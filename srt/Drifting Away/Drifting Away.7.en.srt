[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,729
[Episode 7]

4
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,710
That time, a friend

5
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,039
introduced me to a bar

6
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,590
to be a promoter.

7
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,229
The working hours

8
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:57,979
weren't fixed,

9
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,170
but every trip

10
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,230
makes money.

11
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,790
It was there...

12
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
that I met them.

13
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:25,910
What's up?

14
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,870
What is it?

15
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,680
Why do you think I called you?

16
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,680
To drink?

17
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,840
Of course.

18
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,360
Why else would I call you?

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,800
What do you want?

20
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,240
How much do you have?

21
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,680
Babe, come here!

22
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,120
Is it enough?

23
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,870
Sure.

24
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,840
How should we drink?

25
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,120
It's up to you.

26
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,300
How do you want to drink?

27
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,710
I'll set an example first, okay?

28
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,430
Come on.

29
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,240
Here.

30
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:50,840
Here.

31
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,630
You're a bit slow.

32
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,800
Stop teasing me.

33
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,630
They came again the next day,

34
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,250
and I sold them drinks.

35
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,520
Just like last time,

36
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,480
they spent a lot.

37
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:33,030
I realized that you have a nice job.

38
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,150
Whether you win or lose,

39
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,910
I have to pay for the drinks.

40
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:38,000
Nice?

41
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,280
I've to drink a lot all the time.

42
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,360
How much do you earn in a month?

43
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,070
I can't say. It's a secret.

44
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,190
Every day,

45
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,829
we're here to support you.

46
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,079
We've bought a lot of drinks from you.

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,030
Don't you

48
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,310
have to please me then?

49
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,190
Right?

50
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,000
What do you mean?

51
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,120
Please you?

52
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,120
My job's a decent one.

53
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,520
Go get

54
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,630
your wife to please you.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,710
Huh?

56
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,910
With your looks,

57
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,960
do you think I'd mistake you

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,120
as selling your looks?

59
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,110
You're so mean!

60
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,900
What I mean is

61
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,840
let's have supper later.

62
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,360
Supper?

63
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,910
Let's drink first.

64
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,310
Two more dozen. Come on.

65
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,080
Come on, come on!

66
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:12,870
Bottoms up.

67
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,560
I'll call a cab.

68
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:13,900
Sure!

69
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,390
You're awake?

70
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,630
Listen.

71
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,600
You'd better not scream

72
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,680
after I take this off.

73
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,240
Otherwise,

74
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,560
I won't go easy on you.

75
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,310
You've done what you want.

76
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,940
Let me go.

77
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,310
Done what?

78
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,760
What do you think?

79
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,190
Didn't you both sleep with me?

80
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,870
Not enough?

81
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,190
He didn't.

82
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,240
I slept with you.

83
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,560
Where's the money?

84
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,950
What money?

85
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,240
Money you earned.

86
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,240
I don't have money.

87
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,430
You must have

88
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,000
gotten a fat check

89
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,520
just from the drinks we bought.

90
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,390
Where's all the money

91
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,360
you've earned so far?

92
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,310
I sent everything to my parents.

93
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,070
Ask them for it.

94
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,000
There's no phone there.

95
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,630
It's pointless.

96
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,240
I'm in a lot of debt.

97
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,430
There's where all my money is.

98
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,750
It's always the same.

99
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,510
The typical choice

100
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,070
of money over life.

101
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,720
Listen up.

102
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,320
This is what we do.

103
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,850
If you don't pay us today,

104
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,790
you won't be able to leave.

105
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Then kill me.

106
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,480
You think I'm scared of you?

107
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,630
You think you're big stuff,

108
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,240
huh?

109
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,560
Two grown men

110
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,360
tying me up here.

111
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,160
You've slept with me. What else can you do?

112
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,070
What do you want?

113
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,040
I'll stab you to death!

114
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,560
Try me!

115
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,070
I really don't believe you.

116
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,040
Try me then.

117
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,240
Try me!

118
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,610
Let's have a go then.

119
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,270
Let me tell you.

120
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,920
Drinking with you

121
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,220
wasn't our goal.

122
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,630
Neither is

123
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,300
sleeping with you.

124
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,510
Our real goal

125
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,390
is taking your money.

126
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,560
I want to see

127
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,150
how you can kill me

128
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,320
when you're this weak.

129
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,630
What was that for?

130
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,070
It's just a life.

131
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,770
I don't care about living.

132
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,120
I've had enough of this

133
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
crappy life!

134
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,440
Kill me.

135
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,630
Come on!

136
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,610
Looks like you have hatred in your heart.

137
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,450
Of course I do.

138
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,070
I hate you.

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,630
I hate him.

140
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,510
I hate men.

141
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,600
I hate all....

142
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,840
I hate all of you!

143
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,960
What are you doing?

144
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,440
We...

145
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,450
just want your money.

146
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,750
As for your life...

147
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,150
Let's decide after we get the money.

148
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:08,870
Boss.

149
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,080
This...

150
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,630
This...

151
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,110
Why should we keep her?

152
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,780
If she's so cruel to herself,

153
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,670
she'll have

154
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,750
no problem hurting others.

155
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,050
Let her join us.

156
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,840
I think...

157
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,360
it's much easier for her

158
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,030
to lure people in.

159
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,120
Say no more.

160
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,360
Take her to the hospital.

161
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,120
Since then,

162
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,960
I've been working for them.

163
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,470
I bring the victims in,

164
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,610
and they take care of the rest.

165
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,720
I want to go home.

166
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,120
Sure.

167
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,600
Bring me along.

168
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,630
What for?

169
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,600
Take me back

170
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,440
to see your father

171
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,080
and your younger brother.

172
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,840
I'll bring them gifts.

173
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,630
Then...

174
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,160
I'll kill them.

175
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,530
Just kill me first.

176
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,440
I like you.

177
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,840
You'll kill me if you don't like me?

178
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,000
If I don't like you,

179
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,790
I still won't...

180
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,670
kill you.

181
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,220
But with your dad and brother...

182
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,270
it's hard to say.

183
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,680
So you'd better

184
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,370
stay in my favor forever.

185
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,970
They gave me enough money

186
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,030
to pay off my debts.

187
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,080
Being with them...

188
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,210
I live without morals.

189
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,400
I'm so free.

190
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,450
Do you tell

191
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,080
all your victims

192
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,630
the same story?

193
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,510
For you two.

194
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,870
Before you die,

195
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,200
drink something good.

196
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,200
Let's go.

197
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,630
What are you doing?

198
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:41,810
Don't drink it.

199
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,200
Don't drink it.

200
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,600
Don't drink it.

201
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,810
It must be spiked.

202
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
I'd be dead

203
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,980
either way.

204
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,920
Wait.

205
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,320
Don't drink it.

206
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,700
Cry. Don't stop.

207
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,160
Dashun.

208
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:18,790
Yes.

209
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,200
Come on.

210
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,680
Cheers.

211
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,790
Congrats.

212
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,240
You could even spot cops in plain clothes.

213
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,640
What sharp eyes.

214
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,310
It's learning by doing, isn't it?

215
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,240
Besides,

216
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,400
I have a great name,

217
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,590
Ji Dashun.

218
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,920
Ji means "good luck."

219
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,310
Shun means "smooth."

220
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,920
Combined together,

221
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,570
I'm practically a lucky star.

222
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,480
Goodness.

223
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,770
You know stars explode, right?

224
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,640
What about that time

225
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,830
you threw away a head?

226
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,380
Do you even have a brain?

227
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,550
Here.

228
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,780
Have a drink too.

229
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,510
Are you done eating?

230
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,240
Not yet.

231
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm done.

232
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,510
One bite left.

233
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,480
Done?

234
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,310
If so,

235
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,200
then let's...

236
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,680
get to work.

237
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,750
Anyone in?

238
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,310
Anyone in?

239
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,790
Is anyone home?

240
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,590
If you scream again,

241
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,650
I'll stab you to death!

242
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,680
Don't make a sound. Got it?

243
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,950
Who is it?

244
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,750
What's wrong?

245
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,750
Gosh, I've been knocking for so long.

246
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,440
Why'd you take so long?

247
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,350
I didn't hear you.

248
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,000
My bathroom is leaking.

249
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,880
I came up to take a look.

250
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,960
My wife is showering.

251
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,750
Perfect timing.

252
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,610
Since you're using water,

253
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,680
I'll just take a look, okay?

254
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,780
It can't be a leak from my house.

255
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,720
We shower every day.

256
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,440
It can't be just today.

257
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,830
Come on.

258
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,720
I'll check out your house.

259
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,550
Let's go.

260
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,810
About time you did so.

261
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,610
Look at me.

262
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,590
I'm all drenched.

263
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,110
Yeah, it looks like a bad leak.

264
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,070
It can't be from my house.

265
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,880
Seriously?

266
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,160
Trying to break down

267
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,000
my door?

268
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,310
Unit 3002, right?

269
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,440
The owner downstairs said your unit's leaking.

270
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,880
I'm here to check for leakage points.

271
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,720
You're finally here.

272
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,960
My home's like

273
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,030
a cave under a waterfall.

274
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,270
It must be the upstairs neighbor.

275
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:12,830
Let's go.

276
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,510
Go take a look with me.

277
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,750
Seriously, oh my god.

278
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,270
Let's go then.

279
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,790
Untie me.

280
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,830
Untie me now.

281
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,190
What?

282
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,620
Untie me now.

283
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,070
Hurry up.

284
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:02,750
Hurry up.

285
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,400
We have to block the door.

286
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,270
Get up.

287
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,640
We have to block the door.

288
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,840
It won't budge.

289
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:06,730
Support it.

290
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:07,640
No, no.

291
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:08,880
No.

292
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:12,960
Hold it.

293
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,720
Hold it.

294
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,480
What are you doing?

295
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,960
I'll crawl out.

296
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,270
Even if you make it out,

297
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,000
what can you do?

298
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,230
I'll scream...

299
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,400
I'll scream for help.

300
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,920
Someone will see me.

301
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,160
Even if I fall to my death,

302
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,340
they'll call the police.

303
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,680
Then they'll find us.

304
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,410
What are you doing?

305
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,170
Step on me.

306
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,510
Lift me up.

307
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,200
Help!

308
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,310
Help!

309
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,880
Higher!

310
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,180
Higher!

311
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,470
Help!

312
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,070
Help!

313
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,960
No, I have to go further.

314
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,070
Help!

315
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,790
Help!

316
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,120
Help!

317
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,750
Help!

318
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,470
Open the door!

319
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,270
Go back in!

320
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,880
Go back in! It's dangerous!

321
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,240
Go back in! It's dangerous!

322
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,300
Don't take it too hard!

323
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,160
What's wrong? What's wrong?

324
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:23,950
What's wrong?

325
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,400
Go back in! Go back in!

326
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,640
Someone's trying to jump!

327
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,640
It's dangerous!

328
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,550
Come down!

329
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,530
Don't take things too hard!

330
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,330
Careful! Careful!

331
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:36,990
-Call the police.
-Go back in!

332
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:37,860
Miss!

333
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,270
Call the police!

334
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,550
Don't take it too hard!

335
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,830
Miss!

336
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,590
Don't take things too hard!

337
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,030
Go back in!

338
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,160
Go back in!

339
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,960
It's dangerous!

340
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,620
You must be new here.

341
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,880
The waterproofing upstairs

342
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,720
has always been a problem.

343
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,680
It leaks whenever they take a shower.

344
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,260
How about

345
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,510
we check out your house?

346
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,640
How about this?

347
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,350
Call property management.

348
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,030
Come to my place

349
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,750
with them.

350
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:22,920
Okay?

351
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,430
I'll go up with them then.

352
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,650
Call Dashun.

353
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,590
Hello?

354
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,240
This is the police.

355
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,820
How can I help you?

356
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,480
I've been kidnapped.

357
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,880
I've been kidnapped.

358
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,270
Do you know your exact location?

359
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,480
I don't know where I am.

360
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,430
I don't know.

361
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,640
I just...

362
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,350
I just climbed to the unit next door.

363
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,440
But...

364
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,590
there's still another girl next door.

365
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,030
She is...

366
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,750
l-locked up in the bathroom.

367
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,240
Go and save her.

368
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,030
There's another girl.

369
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,350
Okay, please calm down.

370
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,210
Don't hang up.

371
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,350
We'll locate you right away.

372
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,110
H-Hurry up.

373
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,760
Please hurry up.

374
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,510
Right now, the carplate HAI-A73300

375
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,480
is the most suspicious.

376
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,480
Surveillance footage

377
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,170
shows that

378
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,960
it stopped in front

379
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,640
of several ATMs.

380
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,240
Captain Peng!

381
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,750
The traffic department called.

382
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,400
They found info

383
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,610
about the car that

384
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,640
lingered around the ATMs.

385
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,410
The plate number is HAI-A73300.

386
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,640
It's at Heye Residence.

387
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:55,720
Get to work.

388
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:56,960
Let's go.

389
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,200
Captain Peng.

390
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,160
Luancheng's police informed us

391
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:36,920
of a kidnap

392
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,850
in Heye Residence.

393
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,480
Is it Zhen Zhen?

394
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,720
They're not sure.

395
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,070
The call

396
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,110
was from a young woman.

397
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,880
Miss, don't worry.

398
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:47,960
We've dispatched the police.

399
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,160
Please wait in a safe place

400
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,750
for rescue.

401
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,000
Hello.

402
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,570
Are you the owner of this unit?

403
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:03,670
Yes.

404
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,460
The residents downstairs said

405
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,760
a woman tried to jump from this floor.

406
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,410
Jump?

407
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,280
She didn't jump.

408
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,510
She didn't?

409
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,940
Yes, she didn't.

410
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,400
She crawled back into the window.

411
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,380
So you are...

412
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,210
May we go into your house

413
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:19,680
to have a look?

414
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,670
It can't be our house.

415
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Is it that house?

416
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,070
Isn't this unit vacant?

417
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,000
Can we go into your house

418
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,800
and check this unit

419
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,510
from your balcony?

420
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,710
I didn't bring my keys.

421
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,880
My wife has the keys.

422
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:14,800
She's downstairs.

423
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,150
Please go downstairs to get it.

424
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:16,840
Okay.

425
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,590
Police!

426
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,480
Police.

427
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,440
You're finally here.

428
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,630
Someone was trying to jump.

429
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,440
It's not suicide. It's a kidnap.

430
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,920
Kidnap?

431
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,440
There's another woman next door

432
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,280
locked up in the bathroom.

433
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,880
Let's hurry then!

434
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,420
This way.

435
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,070
-Manager Yang.
-Manager Yang.

436
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,590
What are you two doing?

437
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,120
The homeowner...

438
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,480
Let's go.

439
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:45,960
You're causing trouble.

440
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,440
Hurry.
