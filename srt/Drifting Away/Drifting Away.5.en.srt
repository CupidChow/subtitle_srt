[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,740
[Episode 5]

4
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:02,950
Coming.

5
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,289
Who are you looking for?

6
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,000
Is Qiu Feng in?

7
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:12,970
She...

8
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,190
Hey!

9
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,130
Why are you here?

10
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,200
Come in!

11
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,310
Come.

12
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,000
Come to my room.

13
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:25,870
Here.

14
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,120
Have some water.

15
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,350
You didn't answer my calls,

16
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,290
so I came to you myself.

17
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,079
I'm a light sleeper.

18
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,320
My phone was muted.

19
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,710
What's up?

20
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,980
Kai wants to

21
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,120
treat us to a seafood feast.

22
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,400
He repeatedly

23
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,950
insisted that I invite you.

24
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,380
Why are you all shy?

25
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,800
Who's the girl at the door?

26
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,120
A friend's relative.

27
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,280
She's visiting.

28
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,590
She's staying here for a few days.

29
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,840
Let's get her to join us tonight.

30
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,800
Don't leave her out.

31
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,400
Sure.

32
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,920
Miss.

33
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,079
I'll get going.

34
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,079
What big eyes.

35
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,630
Stop cooking.

36
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,800
Eat out with me later.

37
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,840
Eat out with you?

38
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,310
Why?

39
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,280
Someone's treating.

40
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,280
You can join.

41
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:51,840
It's a free meal.

42
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,190
Don't ask so many questions.

43
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,870
That woman who just came?

44
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,680
No thanks.

45
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,120
What did she do to you?

46
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,480
I got bad vibes from her,

47
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,570
as if she came from hell.

48
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,470
Ominous.

49
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,280
She didn't provoke you.

50
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,260
Why are you so mean?

51
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,560
That's

52
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
my instinct.

53
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,800
You always hang out with

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,350
those people.

55
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,330
You're immune to those vibes.

56
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,600
So vile at a young age.

57
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,720
Watch out for karma.

58
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,829
Just you wait.

59
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,510
Why did

60
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,700
your mom buy you this toy?

61
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,390
Do you know who he is?

62
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:37,920
No.

63
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,390
His name is Sisyphus.

64
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,120
Who is Sisyphus?

65
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,920
A mythical figure

66
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,310
in ancient Greek.

67
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,000
He's unlucky.

68
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,510
He offended Zeus.

69
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,070
Who is Zeus?

70
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,560
Zeus was... his boss.

71
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,430
So, Zeus punished him

72
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,330
to push a boulder

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
to the top of the mountain.

74
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,560
When he got to the peak,

75
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,840
the boulder was too heavy

76
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,950
that it rolled down.

77
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,040
After that,

78
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,360
he went down the mountain

79
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,560
to push it up again.

80
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,190
Again and again,

81
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,160
day after day,

82
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,190
year after year,

83
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,480
forever and ever.

84
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,890
Dad, you're Sisyphus.

85
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,720
What do you mean?

86
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,800
When you have to catch bad guys,

87
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,120
you don't come home, right?

88
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,630
Basically.

89
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,000
In the end,

90
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,270
you can't catch them,

91
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,120
and you've to keep going after them,

92
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,650
again and again,

93
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,120
repeating the same thing.

94
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,750
Aren't you

95
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,070
just like Sisyphus?

96
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,430
Come in.

97
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,040
Director Jiang.

98
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,600
Captain Peng.

99
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,780
Someone's suing you, you know?

100
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:00,920
Who?

101
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,160
Liu Liang, someone related to

102
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,680
the victim of the 11/03 case.

103
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,570
For what?

104
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,760
You promised to solve

105
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:09,950
the case.

106
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,830
The two old folks

107
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,010
are seriously ill

108
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,950
with no tomorrow.

109
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,830
And you still

110
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,000
haven't accounted

111
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,610
for their daughter.

112
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,680
So,

113
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,310
their request is

114
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,040
for you to give them closure

115
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,690
before they pass.

116
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,760
Then...

117
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,600
How can I do that?

118
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,240
Get removed from my post?

119
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,010
You were already transferred away.

120
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,470
Where else can you go?

121
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,680
Guard the gates?

122
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,930
Tell me what you think.

123
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,830
I was in charge of

124
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,630
the 11/03 case.

125
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,390
What

126
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
those criminals think

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,520
and how they operate...

128
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,190
I know it best.

129
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,360
Forget about objective reasons.

130
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,760
I failed to catch them.

131
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,830
I fully accept

132
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,040
being sued

133
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,190
for inaction.

134
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,380
I was kicked out of the Special Task Force.

135
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,510
That's...

136
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,870
my due punishment too.

137
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,240
Don't beat around the bush.

138
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,830
Just say what you think.

139
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,950
Tell me everything you think.

140
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,870
Director Jiang.

141
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,160
I couldn't solve it.

142
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,830
I'm upset too.

143
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,140
What worries me most now

144
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,190
is that those criminals

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,310
are very cruel.

146
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,240
From the info we have on them,

147
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,830
before they're brought to justice,

148
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,300
they'll keep at it.

149
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,680
This...

150
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,190
will put

151
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,420
our society in peril.

152
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,470
The 11/03 case

153
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,080
is really complicated.

154
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,480
I just took office.

155
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,630
So far,

156
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,390
we haven't found a breakthrough.

157
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,510
To be honest,

158
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,870
everyone is

159
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,470
very anxious.

160
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,950
Just say what you want.

161
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,360
Okay.

162
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,950
Transfer me back.

163
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,000
That's all?

164
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,310
No.

165
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Transfer your buddies

166
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,050
back too, right?

167
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,240
They know the details.

168
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,480
Saves time.

169
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,630
Tell me.

170
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,870
How confident are you?

171
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,630
100%.

172
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,070
I've heard that too many times.

173
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,880
I trust you.

174
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,550
Thank you.

175
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,510
You're late!

176
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,750
I'm sorry I'm late.

177
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,400
Forgive me.

178
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,640
Drink as punishment.

179
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,200
Sure.

180
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,430
Sorry, forgive me.

181
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,750
Kai.

182
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,360
Where should I sit?

183
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,940
Sit next to me.

184
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,240
I reserved the spot for you.

185
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,420
Since I was late, I'll drink as punishment.

186
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:08,600
Sure.

187
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,440
Let me drink with you.

188
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:11,870
Here.

189
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,510
I'm really sorry.

190
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,480
I only

191
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,030
have two hours today.

192
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,610
I have to go to work later.

193
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,370
Is that a problem?

194
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,150
You know what,

195
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,550
my buddy will

196
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,770
call your manager

197
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,550
to ask for leave.

198
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,000
It's that Liu, right?

199
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,600
Well...

200
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,840
I really can't.

201
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,240
I...

202
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,440
I have to make money.

203
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,750
How much can you make in a day?

204
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,270
Share it with me.

205
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,910
How rude are you?

206
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,520
That's private.

207
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,480
I'll keep the change.

208
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,060
This is for you, okay?

209
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,690
That's too much.

210
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,580
What's too much? Take it. He's loaded.

211
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,380
Don't go to work tonight.

212
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,670
Just hang out with us.

213
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,270
Okay.

214
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,550
Thank you.

215
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,660
Treat yourself.

216
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,030
Here.

217
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,600
Thank you.

218
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,080
Let me fill your glass.

219
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,810
Where is that girl?

220
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,000
Why isn't she here?

221
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,240
Her?

222
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,760
She... She is immature

223
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,440
and stubborn.

224
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,690
She'll just spoil the mood.

225
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,620
She can't drink too.

226
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,630
I'll drink with you. Come on.

227
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,510
You ordered so many dishes for nothing.

228
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,580
What a waste.

229
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah.

230
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,750
Oh well,

231
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,240
I thought she was coming.

232
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,390
Call her and tell her

233
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,150
to get here.

234
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,030
Yeah? The more, the merrier.

235
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,960
Here.

236
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,510
After the call,

237
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,720
have this.

238
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,130
Here, have this.

239
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,000
Thank you.

240
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,960
No one answered.

241
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,640
It's okay. Ignore her.

242
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,360
Let's enjoy ourselves.

243
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,080
It's not far.

244
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,550
Why don't you go get her?

245
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,080
Okay.

246
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,380
The food won't be good if you take it back.

247
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,480
That's good. Leave some for me.

248
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,080
Okay.

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,840
Come on. Cheers.

250
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,960
You really care a lot

251
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,010
about that girl.

252
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,270
Come, let's drink.

253
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:03,910
Come on.

254
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,870
Sir.

255
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,840
These two bosses are in the electricity business.

256
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,910
What do you do?

257
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,600
I'm in publishing.

258
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,510
Publishing?

259
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,330
Can't you tell?

260
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,320
I specialize in poetry.

261
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,050
Is it profitable?

262
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,630
Extremely.

263
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,290
Really?

264
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,490
Like "Three Hundred Tang Poems."

265
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,120
You're amazing!

266
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,300
I know "Three Hundred Tang Poems."

267
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,780
The beauty rolls up the curtain.

268
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,790
No trace of anyone for thousands of miles.

269
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,510
Right?

270
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,960
The apes on both shores can't stop crying.

271
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,320
Right?

272
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,920
Startling the gulls.

273
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,090
Right?

274
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,870
Cheers!

275
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,870
Coming.

276
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,510
Qiu Feng isn't home.

277
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,480
I'm here to invite you.

278
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,200
What for?

279
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,720
To eat.

280
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,030
I told her I'm not going.

281
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,140
We ordered a full table of seafood.

282
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,630
Come enjoy with us.

283
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,620
I'm allergic to seafood.

284
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,410
Then I'll order

285
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,080
what you like.

286
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,000
No need, really.

287
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,240
We're just strangers.

288
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
Slow down.

289
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,290
Listen to me.

290
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,410
It's just a meal.

291
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,360
Stop following me.

292
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,510
I said I'm not going.

293
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,760
I need to find a job.

294
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,520
Look at you.

295
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,670
What's wrong with a meal?

296
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,910
I told you she wouldn't come.

297
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,420
Come on, let's drink.

298
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,620
Qiu Feng, you're so sensible.

299
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,910
Have one with me too.

300
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,920
You haven't told me

301
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,120
why your wife divorced you.

302
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,550
Do you want to know?

303
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,560
Well,

304
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,080
it's really quite

305
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,030
a long story.

306
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,960
How about this?

307
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,600
After eating,

308
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,200
let's go someplace else.

309
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,550
You don't have work

310
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,720
today anyway,

311
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,470
yeah?

312
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,720
Go to our place.

313
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,150
There's a story and drinks.

314
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
As the poets say,

315
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,200
carpe diem.

316
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,200
Here.

317
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:39,960
It's a deal.

318
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,750
Cheers.

319
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,740
Enjoy.

320
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,480
Excuse me.

321
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Please take my empty plates.

322
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,350
Everything?

323
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,030
Yes.

324
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,630
Enjoy.

325
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,870
Any news from the police?

326
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:50,750
No.

327
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,460
Where are you going?

328
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,510
To look for our kid.

329
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,030
Where would you go?

330
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,090
I don't believe I can't find her.

331
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,410
Enough.

332
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,510
Stop causing trouble, okay?

333
00:15:59,530 --> 00:15:59,960
If not,

334
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,030
I'll just run into traffic.

335
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,790
Stop causing trouble, okay?

336
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,670
Let me find her!

337
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,700
Let me...

338
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,910
Let me... Let me find her!

339
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,630
Can you calm down?

340
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,270
Where are you going to find her?

341
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,240
What if I end up

342
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,500
losing you too?

343
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,320
Let me go look for her!

344
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,410
Hubby.

345
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,510
I lost my precious daughter.

346
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,390
Where can I find her?

347
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,840
What should I do?

348
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,030
Don't just smile.

349
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,790
Press the elevator.

350
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,440
Let's go.

351
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:35,960
Come on.

352
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,440
Sir.

353
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,590
Here.

354
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,850
Let me pour you another glass.

355
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,400
I can't drink anymore.

356
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,510
I'll get drunk.

357
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,920
Then just sleep here.

358
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,640
We have beds here.

359
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,400
I'll drink with you.

360
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,550
Bottoms up.

361
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,070
Bottoms up!

362
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,270
I've emptied mine.

363
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,160
I really can't drink anymore.

364
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,920
Come on.

365
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,510
Come on.

366
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,110
I'll drink

367
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,920
another with you.

368
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:15,920
Okay?

369
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,680
Here.

370
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,750
Are you wearing a wig?

371
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,550
No.

372
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,640
This is my own hair.

373
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,710
Really?

374
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,750
Look.

375
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,850
What do you want?

376
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,070
Let me go.

377
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,550
Let me go.

378
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,030
Help!

379
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,350
No one can hear you

380
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,040
through these walls.

381
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,350
Call that girl.

382
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,200
Get her here.

383
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,790
We're not on good terms.

384
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,850
She wouldn't agree.

385
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:25,960
Not on good terms?

386
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,230
Not on good terms?

387
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,680
I think...

388
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,440
you like me the most.

389
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,350
Because I'm the gentlest one.

390
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,550
Don't provoke him.

391
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,510
If you do...

392
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,400
you'll know what hell is.

393
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,110
Call her.

394
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,720
Press the number.

395
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,380
No one answered.

396
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,000
Shun.

397
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,480
She sure is beautiful.

398
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,270
Did I call you here to admire her?

399
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,660
Since no one answered, let's kill her.

400
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,680
Looks like this rope is quite firm.

401
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,060
That girl saw me.

402
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,270
We can't let her live.

403
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,200
Aren't these her house keys?

404
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,640
I'll just go get her

405
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,270
here now.

406
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,750
It's late at night.

407
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,590
Tomorrow.

408
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,640
Find a time tomorrow.

409
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,450
Qiu Feng got drunk last night

410
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,350
and is sleeping in my house.

411
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,280
I need to go out.

412
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,000
Get her out.

413
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,310
If she's drunk,

414
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,620
just get her out yourself.

415
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,790
She has her keys.

416
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,160
You don't need me.

417
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,720
If I could do it alone,

418
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,750
why'd I ask you?

419
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,370
It's not easy for me to find a job.

420
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,790
If I leave now,

421
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,860
I'll lose my job.

422
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,720
Are you serious?

423
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,310
Why're you so cold-blooded?

424
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,060
I just live with her,

425
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,790
nothing else.

426
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:07,400
Here.

427
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,000
Take this call.

428
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,420
It's Qiu Feng!

429
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,430
What is it?

430
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,750
Zhen Zhen.

431
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,270
Do a friend a favor.

432
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,310
Come and pick me up.

433
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,840
You're my friend now?

434
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,300
We're not friends.

435
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,000
Just get

436
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,090
one of your boyfriends to help you.

437
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:18,880
Tell me.

438
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,910
Why doesn't she care about you?

439
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,510
Let me teach you.

440
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,390
I'll teach you.

441
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,670
Then she'll answer your call.

442
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,760
Do you remember...

443
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,130
what we talked about when we were dancing?

444
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:17,900
I don't remember.

445
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,890
I asked you

446
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,470
if you like your current job.

447
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,170
No, I don't.

448
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,680
Then why

449
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,040
are you in this business?

450
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,790
It's quick.

451
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,450
Clocking in for work is so tough.

452
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,390
Clocking in for work...

453
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,370
is so tough.

454
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:07,490
Where's she?

455
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,750
I told you I'm needed for this job.

456
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,040
Sit down and rest.

457
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,620
It's air-conditioned.

458
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm putting up the recruitment notices.

459
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,470
Really? How many came?

460
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,040
Not many places left then?

461
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
Five left?

462
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,670
Five left!

463
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,870
You're dressed lightly.

464
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,030
Call your dad.

465
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,990
Ask him to transfer some money to your card.

466
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,990
You said

467
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,830
you didn't give much money to your family,

468
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:46,680
right?

469
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,630
How about this?

470
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,510
Ask for 20,000 first.

471
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,550
Come on.

472
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,680
Read it.

473
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,990
My friend...

474
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,190
Do business...

475
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:02,880
Profit...

476
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,030
Read it properly.

477
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,220
Stop crying.

478
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,290
A friend of mine

479
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,880
wants to do business with me.

480
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,550
It yields 30% profit.

481
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,920
Transfer me 20,000 yuan.

482
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:24,890
Memorized it?

483
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,840
Here, call him now.

484
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,050
Hello?

485
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,110
Dad.

486
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,440
Transfer me 20,000 yuan.

487
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,670
A friend of mine wants to do business with me.

488
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,160
It yields 30% profit.

489
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,400
You sent us

490
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,720
13,000 in total.

491
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,810
Your mom had an operation...

492
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,190
Didn't you say

493
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,510
you didn't send much money

494
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,420
to your family?

495
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,470
It's hot!

496
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,880
Hey, do you have anything cold?

497
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,830
There's ice cream.

498
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,590
Ice cream's too sweet.

499
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,100
How about this?

500
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,350
Buy a bottle of water

501
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,310
and I'll get you some ice.

502
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,270
Sure.

503
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,170
Coming right up.

504
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,880
You can keep the water;

505
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,070
I'll just take the ice.

506
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,880
Have you been looking for me?

507
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,200
Peng.

508
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:57,660
Hey.

509
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,040
Give me

510
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,160
three vegetarian, three meat.

511
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:00,720
Takeaway.

512
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,160
Okay.

513
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,040
Careful.

514
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:05,960
Are you busy?

515
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,310
Peng?

516
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,510
How rare.

517
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,480
I came to the morning market for buns.

518
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,270
What's so rare?

519
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,290
Peng, you're here.

520
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,880
How's your mom doing?

521
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,790
Report!

522
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,070
My mom's in good health.

523
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,000
Don't be like this.

524
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:18,880
Why are you

525
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,720
so nervous?

526
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,950
I'm not nervous. I'm not.

527
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,400
Any news of your brother?

528
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,200
-No.
-No.

529
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,750
Have you rehearsed?

530
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:26,720
No, no.

531
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,200
No news, really.

532
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,720
Really.

533
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,180
Nothing.

534
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,410
Let me know if there's news.

535
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,600
As I said,

536
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,910
a cover-up is a crime.

537
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,510
Yes, yes.

538
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:33,920
Go ahead.

539
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,760
Stay for a bit.

540
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,200
No thanks.

541
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,210
Take care!

542
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,550
Okay.

543
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,460
Are you interested?

544
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,280
Here, take one.

545
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,800
Your salary is so high.

546
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,840
Well, we're short-staffed.

547
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,590
No one would come

548
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,590
for a low salary.

549
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,350
W-What if

550
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,060
I don't have an ID card?

551
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,469
No ID card?

552
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:27,920
It's okay.

553
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,429
As long as you pass the interview,

554
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,080
specialized personnel

555
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,000
will take care of that.

556
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,750
It's nothing.

557
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,679
Where is it? There's no address.

558
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,150
We had no space to include it.

559
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,360
Call this number.

560
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,190
The recruiter

561
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,280
will tell you the exact address.

562
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,520
What do you do?

563
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,760
We do gifts.

564
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,440
It's on there.

565
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,110
A gift company.

566
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay.

567
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,420
Got it. Thank you.

568
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,230
Are you interested?

569
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,070
I'll think about it.

570
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,670
Think about what?

571
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,800
There are very few spots.

572
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,190
A rare opportunity.

573
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,360
It's rare to get paid this much now.

574
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,680
What if I don't pass the interview?

575
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,550
Then I'd just be late for

576
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,230
my current job.

577
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,320
I'll be doubly screwed.

578
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,050
What do you do now?

579
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,920
Is the salary better?

580
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,620
How about this?

581
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,440
My company is just ahead.

582
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,960
About ten minutes by car.

583
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,810
I'll send you there now

584
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:16,640
for an interview.

585
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,880
Even if you fail,

586
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,560
I'll drive you back.

587
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,730
Will that do?

588
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,440
Let's go. Don't hesitate.

589
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,440
Okay.

590
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:26,900
Let's go. Come on.

591
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,010
My car's right ahead.

592
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:28,920
Super convenient.

593
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:31,590
Here.

594
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,090
Thank you.

595
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,660
Didn't you say it'd take ten minutes?

596
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,230
Why are we still not there?

597
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:57,930
I ran out of gas.

598
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,000
There's a gas station ahead.

599
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,910
It'll take a second.

600
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,440
Where are you from?

601
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,170
Maizhou.

602
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,810
Judging from your accent,

603
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,440
you must be from around there.

604
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,180
I'm from Longyang.

605
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Look, we're here.

606
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,960
How much do you want?

607
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:28,910
100 yuan.

608
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,960
Where's the restroom?

609
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,670
Over there.

610
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:31,270
Thanks.

611
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:32,940
Restroom break.

612
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,500
Where's she?

613
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,320
That girl?

614
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:11,820
Where's she?

615
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,110
She went there.

616
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,870
Stop adding the gas.

617
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,280
Come on.

618
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,440
Stop. Hurry up.

619
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,620
P-Pull it out. Hurry.

620
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,960
Hurry! Hurry up!

621
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,510
Take the money.

622
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:23,680
75, right? Change.

623
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,030
Hurry up!

624
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,880
Wait, I don't have...

625
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,510
Wait a minute.

626
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,360
I'll get you change.

627
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,550
You owe me 25 yuan.

628
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,420
I-I-I...

629
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:38,880
Hello?

630
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,150
Hello?

631
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,290
Who is it?

632
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,510
They said nothing and hung up.

633
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,600
Was that Zhen Zhen?

634
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,630
They hung up.

635
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,820
It might be a wrong number.

636
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,550
Did something bad happen?

637
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,920
Don't talk nonsense!
