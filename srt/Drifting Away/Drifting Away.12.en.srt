Rolling the dough.

00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,920
you started the work

-It's okay.

You can't use much force.

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:31,840
Do they have

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,550
How does someone as cruel as Song Hongyu,

146
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,940

170
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,240
the Yongshun Billiard Hall

171

172
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,480
It's located here.

173
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,960
This place.

174
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,750
The first floor is a billiard hall,

175
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,490
and the second floor is for massage.

176
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,120
With a high flow of people,

177
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:00,960
this billiard hall

178
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,960
is next to the residential area,

179
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,300
which will make the arrest

180
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,510
much more challenging.

181
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,620

185
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,570
Currently, the two of them are living

189
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,150
Deng Ligang rarely goes home,

190
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,900
preferring to stay in his massage room.

191
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,440
Besides the billiard hall

192
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,630
and his own home,

00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,960
his most-visited place

194
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,790
is the house of his mother,

195
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,860
Zhang Nianci, here in Suilu.

196
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,360
Zhang Nianci now

197
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,230
lives with Deng Ligang's

198
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,430
younger brother, Deng Lide.

199
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,290
Based on our long-term surveillance,

200
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,960
we've found that

201
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,710
Deng Ligang has no contact

202
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,870
with either Shi Bi

203
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,840
or Ji Dashun.

204
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,870
We are guessing that

205
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,360
these people don't usually interact much.

206
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,030
Song Hongyu

207
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,960
is currently unemployed

208
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,330
without any other

209
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,030
source of income.

210
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,700
She and Deng Ligang have a child

211
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,910
who attends Yumeng Kindergarten in Suilu.

212
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,810
From Monday to Friday,

213
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,680
Song Hongyu takes the boy to school in the morning

214
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,510
and picks him up in the afternoon

215
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,510
on time.

216
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,030
When their child

217
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,910
is at kindergarten,

218
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,080
she sometimes

219
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,000
goes to places like shopping malls

220
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,720
and markets,

221
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,870
and sometimes returns home

222
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,510
just like

223
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,300
an ordinary housewife.

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,960
What about her father and brother?

225
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:13,870
We also found them.

226
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,750
The Songs

227
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,650
interact pretty frequently,

228
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,790
but it's all normal contact.

229
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,130
Nothing suspicious.

230
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:22,960
What about Shi Bi?

231
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,810
Shi Bi is the smartest

232
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,510
among the four.

233
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,510
Years ago, to hide his identity,

234
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,600
he married a widowed woman

235
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,700
with a child,

236
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,730
Feng Shuanghuan.

237
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,670
Since their marriage, he's been living

238
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,210
in Feng Shuanghuan's store.

239
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,370
He keeps a low profile in his daily life.

240
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,460
He's basically commuting between school,

241
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,270
the market, and home only

242
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,670
with quite simple social connections.

243
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,340
The store is located

244
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,120
in a densely populated area

245
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,390
with convenient transportation.

246
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,510
The arrest will be challenging too.

247
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,840
Move on to Ji Dashun.

248
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,560
He's been staying at the Jiamu Slaughterhouse

249
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,420
about 100 li away from Suilu City,

250
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,120
never moving away.

251
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,120
This slaughterhouse

252
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,150
is jointly run by him

253
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:00,800
and his partner.

254
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,720
He spends most of his time

255
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,260
in this place

256
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,270
and never socializes with others.

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,480
That's all.

258
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,240
Captain Peng,

259
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,400
let me add some info.

260
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,750
The Jiamu Slaughterhouse is Suilu's

261
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,270
biggest fresh food distribution center.

262
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:13,910
Also,

263
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,360
we have found

264
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,430
Ji Dashun's business partner.

265
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,080
Thank you.

266
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:30,980
Captain Peng.

267
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:38,870
Alright,

268
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,410
I'll make the plan.

269
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,970
Strategically,

270
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,200
it's better to catch the leader first.

271
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,150
But the three of them

272
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,440
live too close to each other

273
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,440
right in the city center

274
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,030
with hustle and bustle.

275
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,630
One slip-up

276
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,420
or leak of information,

277
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,040
and we could suffer a fiasco.

278
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,550
So I think

279
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,360
we should try to arrest all four of them

280
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,120
simultaneously.

281
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,120
-Understood.
-Understood!

282
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:23,880
Dismiss.

283
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,870
He's Wang Jianye,

284
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,550
my business partner.

285
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,640
He's a fugitive suspect we've been after

286
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,360
for ten years.

287
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,920
I didn't know that.

288
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,310
I really had no idea.

289
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,720
It's okay if you didn't know before.

290
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,840
What matters is that you know it now.

291
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,000
We hope

292
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,320
you can cooperate with us.

293
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,510
I will help with the police work for sure.

294
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,270
Mr. Wang,

295
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,280
what'd you like to buy?

296
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,320
Why are you calling me Mr. Wang?

297
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,960
C'mon, take this.

298
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,840
My shop is too small

299
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,870
to sell something worth this price.

300
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,630
Just take it.

301
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,580
Don't lose it.

302
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,630
You didn't come last month,

303
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,440
and the month before that either.

304
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,910
What do you mean?

305
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,360
I've been busy.

306
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,240
Busy with what?

307
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,510
Tell me what you've been busy with!

308
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,290
You had to rely on me with all the work

309
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,480
in the first couple of years, right?

310
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,040
Now that you're better off,

311
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,670
you think I'm useless

312
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,160
and want to get rid of me for good, huh?

313
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,990
Wang Jianye

314
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,830
has been working

315
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,160
in our cold storage for years.

316
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,550
He's fallen ill

317
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,030
and been diagnosed with cancer.

318
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,460
Isn't he your partner?

319
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,329
Why does he work in the cold storage in person?

320
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,400
He's the one with the best skills

321
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,890
among us.

322
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,160
It takes him

323
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,270
just a few minutes,

324
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,440
to perfectly debone a lamb.

325
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,569
C'mon, have some water.

326
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,720
What's wrong

327
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,210
with your body?

328
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,160
Should we go to the hospital

329
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,560
for a check-up?

330
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,320
Take it slow...

331
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,790
Don't delay the treatment if there's

332
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,530
really something wrong.

333
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,240
It's okay. I know the condition

334
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,920
of my body.

335
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,330
I'm hungry. Could you

336
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,510
make me something to eat?

337
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,070
There's only leftover food now.

338
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:45,960
It's my birthday.

339
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,790
Your birthday?

340
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,030
Then let me make you some birthday noodles

341
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,560
that symbolize longevity!

342
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,790
I'll be right back.

343
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,680
Ma'am!

344
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,560
Welcome!

345
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,040
My tea tastes good, right?

346
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,920
Would you like some more?

347
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,510
Nope!

348
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,750
It's all stems in here

349
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,680
with few tea leaves.

350
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,960
No refund or exchange for what you've consumed.

351
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,790
Wait,

352
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,850
you have to offer

353
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,110
after-sales service, right?

354
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,160
Oh, what a man.

355
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,640
So what if I don't offer that?

356
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,030
You can't shut down my store, can you?

357
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,440
This way.

358
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,650
We're from Suilu Supermarket.

359
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,070
We're here for some good meat.

360
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,110
If you've got top-notch meat,

361
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,350
we can build a long-term partnership.

362
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,120
Then you need to talk to Brother Wang.

363
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,270
Who's Brother Wang?

364
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,590
He's the person in charge here.

365
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,400
Brother Wang!

366
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,520
Brother Wang!

367
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,400
Brother Wang!

368
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,200
What's up?

369
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,440
They're from Suilu Supermarket,

370
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,920
a large chain supermarket.

371
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,220
They're here for the meat!

372
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,960
You guys talk then.

373
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,680
Okay, thank you.

374
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,510
Brother Wang.

375
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,570
Who are you?

376
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,070
I'm from Suilu Supermarket.

377
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,680
How did you find us?

378
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,280
There's a problem with a batch of goods

379
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,750
from Suifa Meat Processing Factory.

380
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,110
So I was in a hurry

381
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,480
to ask around.

382
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,720
It's said that your meat is pretty good.

383
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,240
So I came to take a look.

384
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,400
Suifa is a big factory.

385
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,480
Ours is too small

386
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,590
to supply that much.

387
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,800
You're so arrogant!

388
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,790
Yeah, so what?

389
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:57,960
Why are you arguing?

390
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,020
Can I top up my phone here?

391
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,480
Yes, but the machine is not working today.

392
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,140
You can come another day.

393
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,200
You fraud!

394
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,470
Their machine was good yesterday!

395
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,640
She's got no integrity!

396
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,920
She refuses to give me a refund for the tea I bought!

397
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,760
The machine was fine yesterday but is malfunctioning today!

398
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,480
What's wrong with that?

399
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
Like a person can be fine today

400
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,620
and dead tomorrow!

401
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,480
Don't worry.

402
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,440
As long as your meat is good,

403
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,260
we can discuss it.

404
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,110
I can call the police and file a complaint against you!

405
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,650
Just let it go...

406
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,550
Wow, how aggressive you are!

407
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,530
C'mon, chill!

408
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:29,850
Look how rampant you are!

409
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,960
I am, so what?

410
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,780
You can go ask around about me!

411
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,470
Hey! Stop arguing!

412
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:32,920
Stop it.

413
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,550
Harmony comes first.

414
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,350
Let's make peace.

415
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,160
What's the problem?

416
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,500
Judging from your accent,

417
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,240
you don't sound like a Suilu native.

418
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,440
The meat in Xuecheng is also good.

419
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,270
Haven't you taken a look there?

420
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,800
Ji Dashun!

421
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:44,890
Drop the knife!

422
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:56,660
Attention, everybody.

423
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,230
block all entrances and exits.

424
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,720
Proceed as planned.

425
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,930
Copy that.

426
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:44,960
Boss,

427
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,210
what's wrong?

428
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,720
Nothing.

429
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,270
Come on.

430
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
I've been

431
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,310
having a weird feeling today.

432
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,680
It's making me

433
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,640
restless.

434
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,200
Perhaps

435
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,480
it's a good omen

436
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,790
rather than boding ill.

437
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,440
Tonight,

438
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,350
let's go for some lamb spine hotpot.

439
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,400
I'm out.

440
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,200
Lately, I've been feeling

441
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,650
that something's off.

442
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,640
I'd better just

443
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,960
stay in the shop for safety.

444
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,700
Turn off the lights.

445
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,720
Let me catch up on some sleep.

446
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,720
Okay.

447
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,200
How much is this?

448
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,720
That one's ten yuan.

449
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,090
The slightly smaller one is five yuan.

450
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,790
This is six yuan.

451
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,430
This is eight yuan.

452
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,400
Can you

453
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,510
give me a discount?

454
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,070
-Ten yuan, right?
-These are bottom prices.

455
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,240
Here you are.

456
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,750
Stay close

457
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,930
and keep your distance.

458
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,550
How much is this?

459
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,480
25 yuan per set.

460
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,160
Can I get a better price

461
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,790
for this one?

462
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,310
Okay.

463
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Pilot Toys.

464
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,390
It's yours now.

465
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,190
She spotted me

466
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,400
and went in through the west gate

467
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:47,830
of East District 3.

468
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,070
Qiao Han, follow her.

469
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,230
I'll be at the south gate.

470
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,160
Who are you two looking for?

471
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,960
Are you here for massages?

472
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,720
It's mealtime now.

473
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
The massage crew's all gone for lunch.

474
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,160
How about you two go

475
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,380
find a room to rest for a while?

476
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,380
I'll arrange it for you later.

477
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,000
Okay.

478
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,000
Hello?

479
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,310
Hello?

480
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,310
Who is it? Speak.

481
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,750
Don't move!

482
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:48,240
Freeze!

483
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:14,950
Move, move!

484
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,550
Team One in position.

485
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,890
Team Two in position.

486
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,130
Target lost.

487
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,240
She's over here.

488
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,350
She escaped from the hat shop.

489
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,970
Target not found.

490
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,000
Watch out!

491
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:49,580
Watch out!

492
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,590
Where's my black coat?

493
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,070
Who took away my black coat?

494
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:05,810
What coat?

495
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,950
The long and black coat!

496
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,370
Who grabbed my black coat?

497
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,880
The suspect, in a long black coat

498
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,140
and a black hat, left through the South Gate 2.

499
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,590
There's no way out for you.

500
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,550
The Heye Residence

501
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,350
kidnapping case in Luancheng from 2003.

502
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,480
Remember that?

503
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,810
What Luancheng?

504
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,780
I don't know what you're talking about.

505
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,680
Don't you remember me?

506
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,400
No, I don't.

507
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,830
Who are you?

508
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,160
You once told me that

509
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,520
the first time you saw me,

510
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,880
you felt I got a certain vibe

511
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,840
that resembled someone else's.

512
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,030
Then it finally occurred to you that

513
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,480
I reminded you of that girl

514
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,100
called Huang Ying,

515
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,370
who was also so stubborn.

516
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,600
And you said I was a lot like you.

517
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,740
Just kill me.

518
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,160
You're quite like me.

519
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,510
But I'm not you.

520
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,690
I am the victim

521
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,570
of that kidnapping case,

522
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,480
Zhen Zhen.

523
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,030
I'm a cop.

524
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,400
You're under arrest.

525
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:12,630
You can't get away now.

526
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,340
There's no way out for you today.

527
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,050
After all these years,

528
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,030
you've always been after me.

529
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,030
It must have been tough.

530
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,440
I accept the fate of being caught

531
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,020
by you.

532
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,880
No way out, huh?

533
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,440
Let me go.

534
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,960
Don't waste your time.

535
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,400
Just let go.

536
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,550
I will let go,

537
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,630
but not now.
