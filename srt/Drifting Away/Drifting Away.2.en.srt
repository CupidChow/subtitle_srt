[Episode 2]

4
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,230
Boss!

5
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm taking the hair.

6
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,130
Go ahead.

7
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,920
Are you that broke?

8
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,790
Why'd you steal my trash?

9
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,910
How's this hodge-podge stew?

10
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,120
There's seafood!

11
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,280
Boss.

12
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,630
What took you so long?

13
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,800
We were waiting for you to eat.

14
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,730
What are you doing?

15
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,280
Boss!

16
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,800
Boss!

17
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,360
Boss!

18
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,480
Boss!

19
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,300
Boss!

20
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,830
Boss!

21
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,710
Boss! No!

22
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,400
Boss! Hey!

23
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,930
Hey, hey, calm down!

24
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:18,730
Boss!

25
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,390
Let go of me!

26
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:22,579
Boss...

27
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:23,860
Boss!

28
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,630
Boss, I'm sorry!

29
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,310
Boss, enough!

30
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:27,210
Stop hitting him!

31
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,280
I'm sorry!

32
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,910
Hey, enough!

33
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,760
Why are you hitting him?

34
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,570
What do you want to do?

35
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,630
Boss! Hey!

36
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,240
Boss!

37
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:38,800
Enough.

38
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,220
Enough.

39
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,170
What's wrong with you?

40
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,240
Boss!

41
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,280
Hey, don't!

42
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,210
Stop, stop!

43
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,200
Stop, stop!

44
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,380
We're on the same side!

45
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,130
You threw a whole piece in the garbage truck!

46
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,710
If I hadn't found out,

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,350
it'd have been taken away!

48
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,380
His ribs are almost broken.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,690
Dashun!

50
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,310
Say something, Shun!

51
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,240
Boss, I was wrong.

52
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,030
I'm really sorry.

53
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,680
I won't do it again.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,430
Look.

55
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,080
He knows he's wrong.

56
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:05,940
He knows he's wrong.

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,310
Boss.

58
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,430
I'll take care of it.

59
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,270
Cool down, okay?

60
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,910
Cool down.

61
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:09,480
Let him do it!

62
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,470
I'll do it!

63
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,310
I'll do it!

64
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,310
Enough!

65
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,340
Boss, Boss.

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,370
I'll do it. I'll do it.

67
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,019
Alright.

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,040
Cool down.

69
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,810
He knows he's wrong.

70
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,830
The DNA profiling

71
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,870
result is out.

72
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,530
The victim

73
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,050
is your daughter, Liu Xinyuan.

74
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,510
The bureau

75
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,630
is prioritizing this case.

76
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,480
I'll lead the Special Task Force

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,750
to solve the case.

78
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,670
You can go back now.

79
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,500
Are you sure

80
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,000
you want to take the belongings

81
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,710
of the other girl too?

82
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,190
She was

83
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,210
with my daughter.

84
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,880
Poor girl.

85
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,010
The two of them

86
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,640
died together.

87
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,680
They'll be

88
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,040
companions in the afterlife.

89
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,870
I'll bury

90
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,840
their clothes

91
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,170
together at home.

92
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,310
I hope

93
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,270
they'll rest in peace.

94
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,830
Don't worry.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,680
We will

96
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,560
solve this case

97
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,870
and give you closure.

98
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,120
I'll do the dishes tonight.

99
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,190
Don't tell me

100
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,510
you're on duty New Year's Eve.

101
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,750
I asked around.

102
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,790
You're not on duty then.

103
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,680
I am not.

104
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,320
But Zhu is.

105
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,720
I have to accompany him.

106
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,560
That's his job.

107
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,880
Is he a baby?

108
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,750
Everyone in the team

109
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,550
has their own positions.

110
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,010
This kid just

111
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,750
got married.

112
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,310
And...

113
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,510
He's been busy with my cases

114
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,159
for months.

115
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,360
I feel bad for him.

116
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,880
You sure are a softie.

117
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,920
No.

118
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,310
He's not a member of my team.

119
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,460
I can't be hard on him.

120
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:49,950
Are your son and I

121
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,360
members of your team?

122
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,190
Come on.

123
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,000
Do you have to

124
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,200
be like this every time?

125
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,150
Look at you.

126
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,390
You didn't take marriage leave.

127
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,120
You were not by my side when I gave birth.

128
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,270
I manage the house myself

129
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,310
and take care of the child myself.

130
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,360
Aren't I tougher

131
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,070
than your

132
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,080
police buddies?

133
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,160
Go away.

134
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,920
It's my fault for always

135
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,940
giving in to you with this.

136
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,540
I don't expect you to change.

137
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,330
Do whatever you want.

138
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,240
Spend Chinese New Year

139
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,040
with whomever you want.

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,120
I'll take your son...

141
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,680
to my mother's.

142
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,360
Isn't your mother with

143
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,990
your sister?

144
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,720
In Weihai.

145
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,680
Can I go?

146
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,630
W-Where are you going?

147
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,310
To buy tickets!

148
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,150
Captain Peng, why are you here?

149
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,280
Here. Give it to me.

150
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,080
What?

151
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,750
Am I not welcome?

152
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,440
No way!

153
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,000
I can't let you be alone

154
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,720
on New Year's Eve.

155
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,520
I'll wash some plates.

156
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,400
Okay, okay.

157
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,630
The food looks good.

158
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,480
Of course.

159
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,670
Who is it?

160
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,270
Cheng Guo.

161
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,200
Who?

162
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,380
I'm Mrs. Peng.

163
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,030
Open the door.

164
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,040
Get in.

165
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,030
This...

166
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,410
You are...

167
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,670
Dad.

168
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,600
Mrs. Peng, yeah?

169
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,600
Happy New Year.

170
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,180
Didn't you go to Weihai?

171
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,630
Can't I change my mind?

172
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,030
But

173
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,080
why'd you come here?

174
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,390
Do you know what we're doing here?

175
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,280
Yes.

176
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,100
Then why'd you bring the kid here?

177
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,870
It's dangerous.

178
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:50,770
We're in a mission—

179
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,150
I'm talking to you!

180
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Why'd you come here?

181
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,790
You're at a stakeout.

182
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,980
Should you be so loud?

183
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,510
Tell me

184
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,510
why you came here!

185
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,430
It's New Year's Eve.

186
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,360
I brought some food to my hubby.

187
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,680
I was worried he'd die here.

188
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,410
Wish the uncle a happy new year.

189
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,240
Uncle.

190
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,840
May you have a happy

191
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,910
and blessed year.

192
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,270
Okay, thank you.

193
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,160
Dad, may you also have a happy

194
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,160
and blessed year.

195
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,550
Go back.

196
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,600
I know what to do.

197
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,240
Eat it while it's hot.

198
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,080
Take care, Mrs. Peng.

199
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,600
Mom.

200
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,630
Dad's dirty clothes.

201
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,380
It's not your dad's.

202
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:45,750
Zhu, it must be yours.

203
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,600
I'll wash it for you.

204
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,000
It's okay.

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,840
Peng will return it to you.

206
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,910
One, two, three.

207
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,120
Go!

208
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,720
Hurry up.

209
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,150
Well...

210
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,390
Captain Peng, you should go home.

211
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,080
I'm fine alone.

212
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,530
Really.

213
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,560
Let's eat.

214
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,670
No chopsticks.

215
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,840
I'll go get them.

216
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,510
Get some sleep.

217
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,510
I'm here.

218
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,320
It's okay.

219
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,910
Mrs. Peng's great.

220
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,630
My wife is

221
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,850
too accommodating.

222
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,510
Since we were young,

223
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,200
she never acted demure.

224
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,270
We were friends since childhood.

225
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,240
When I got into fights,

226
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,630
she'd pass me bricks.

227
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,310
What's it called?

228
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Childhood sweethearts, right?

229
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,270
You even need time to think of that term?

230
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,270
Do you even get the joke?

231
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,460
Mom.

232
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,480
Dad forgot to give me a red envelope.

233
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,980
Your dad has prepared it long ago.

234
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,390
Where is it?

235
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,480
Look for it.

236
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,100
See if it's under the pillow.

237
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,390
This one.

238
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Put it in your piggy bank.

239
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,290
Go, go, go.

240
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,000
Happy?

241
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,360
I'll peel an apple for you.

242
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,050
Did you get a New Year's gift too?

243
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,670
Yes, I do.

244
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,630
Where is it?

245
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,390
Come here.

246
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,480
You're my New Year's gift.

247
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,830
You're my greatest gift.

248
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,270
It's so hard to tear.

249
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,840
Don't move.

250
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,010
It's here, yeah?

251
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,440
What's this smell?

252
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,600
When did you last shower?

253
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:36,910
Done.

254
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,270
Come on.

255
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,240
Boss.

256
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,510
Here's to you.

257
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,440
Happy New Year.

258
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,440
Here.

259
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:50,910
Let's eat.

260
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,990
B-Boss, let me wish you well too.

261
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,450
H-Happy New Year.

262
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,120
Wish you good health and success.

263
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,590
I'll down one.

264
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm homesick.

265
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,120
I want to make a call.

266
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,870
You want to...

267
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,120
call home?

268
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,480
I'll help you.

269
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,780
Be careful. Don't get hurt.

270
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,750
Something's up.

271
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,240
Who is that?

272
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,670
Huang Qi,

273
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,120
Deng Ligang's cousin.

274
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,880
Auntie.

275
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,670
I brought you dumplings.

276
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,000
You're here, Ligang.

277
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,510
Ligang?

278
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:10,630
Auntie.

279
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,550
Are you confused again?

280
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,560
Look carefully!

281
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,440
I'm not Ligang!

282
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,270
I am

283
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,440
Huang Qi,

284
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,240
your nephew. Gosh.

285
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,550
My nephew?

286
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,670
Hello?

287
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,480
Old man!

288
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,840
Happy New Year.

289
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,200
Guess who I am.

290
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,390
You've got a sharp ear.

291
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,480
Yes, yes.

292
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,550
It's the New Year's.

293
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,630
I'm eating.

294
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,330
You're eating too?

295
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,080
Hold on.

296
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,270
Your daughter wants to talk to you.

297
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,120
Happy New Year!

298
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,160
Dad, Happy New Year.

299
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,390
Where are you celebrating?

300
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,600
Everyone has their own fate.

301
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,240
We can't risk our lives

302
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,440
because of your sentimentality.

303
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,670
Here.

304
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,000
Have a drink.

305
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,600
Here.

306
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,960
Boss.

307
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,240
Upset, huh?

308
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,030
Shi Bi.

309
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,080
Yes.

310
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,550
Tell me.

311
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,440
About her and I...

312
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,160
do you think it's love?

313
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,070
I love you.

314
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,400
Normally,

315
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,880
men at your age are involved

316
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,270
in proper work.

317
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,710
Are you?

318
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,750
Dashun.

319
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,340
I love you.

320
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,710
I love you too.

321
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,070
B-Boss.

322
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,440
We... W-We all love you.

323
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,630
Boss Lady, we love you, too.

324
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,750
I love you too.

325
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,600
Happy New Year.

326
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,550
Captain Peng.

327
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,510
There's no ice here at all.

328
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,250
Make do with the popsicle.

329
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,270
Well,

330
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,440
Captain Peng,

331
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,030
don't get agitated.

332
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,160
After such a long time,

333
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,680
Deng Ligang still hasn't shown up.

334
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,960
Do we keep this up?

335
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,240
Yes,

336
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,830
until he shows up.

337
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,680
I've checked his background.

338
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,160
That fellow

339
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,400
used to be a fitter.

340
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,550
A brute.

341
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,030
He loves fighting

342
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,180
like a gangster.

343
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,720
But he is very filial.

344
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,160
In this area,

345
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,310
he's known for being filial.

346
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,830
Every New Year's Eve,

347
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,940
he kowtows to his mother.

348
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,510
It's not the New Year yet.

349
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,590
I bet he will

350
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,350
come home.

351
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,510
I brought some food.

352
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,680
Where is he?

353
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,150
I don't know.

354
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,550
He said he'll be back

355
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,930
in two or three days.

356
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,840
He told us to stay put.

357
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,550
And stir-fried pork.

358
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,640
What's he busy with?

359
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,790
Would he tell me that?

360
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,550
Or I'd be the Boss Lady.

361
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,720
Boss Lady.

362
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,030
He's been

363
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,400
in a foul mood.

364
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,380
How'd I ask him?

365
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,130
I just took a nap

366
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,200
and you've driven so far,

367
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,720
huh?

368
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,510
Not bad.

369
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,000
Keep sleeping.

370
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,240
Okay.

371
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,030
Hey.

372
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,240
Are you from Xuecheng too?

373
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,240
I missed the train

374
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,390
to get home for the New Year's too.

375
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,990
What a coincidence.

376
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,060
Mom!

377
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:33,830
Mom.

378
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,590
Your son's back.

379
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,550
Mom.

380
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,110
It's me, your son!

381
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,680
Ligang?

382
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,260
Mom...

383
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,010
I'm Lide, Mom.

384
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,510
Lide?

385
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,640
You unfilial brat!

386
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,810
You...

387
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,790
Ligang, my baby.

388
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,330
Where's my baby?

389
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,070
Find Ligang. I want to see my baby!

390
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,430
Captain Peng.

391
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,240
Update.

392
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,200
That was Deng Ligang's younger brother,

393
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,750
Deng Lide.

394
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,480
He was released from prison.

395
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,070
Hey.

396
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,300
How far are we from Xihuang Village?

397
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,550
Almost there. It's right ahead.

398
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,930
Be careful.

399
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,640
Careful, Mom.

400
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,640
Careful, Auntie.

401
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,160
This way.

402
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,240
Slow down.

403
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,930
Captain Peng. Update.

404
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,240
Vroom, vroom,

405
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,590
okay?

406
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,440
Let's go.

407
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,750
Be careful.

408
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,000
Bye.

409
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,070
Bye, Mom.

410
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,720
Okay.

411
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,640
Slowly. Let's go.

412
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,510
Yes, vroom, vroom.

413
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,200
Here.

414
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,790
Careful, Auntie.

415
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,190
Wait a minute.

416
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,030
The van door's wonky.

417
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:00,490
Here.

418
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,480
I'll fix it soon.

419
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,000
Let's go.

420
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,380
Where are we going?

421
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,270
I am

422
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,400
taking you to meet someone.

423
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,360
You'll have fun.

424
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,680
-Vroom, vroom!
-Vroom, vroom!

425
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,920
Captain Peng.

426
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,630
Huang Qi and Zhang Nianci went out.

427
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,440
Roger.

428
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,400
Are you from elsewhere?

429
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:45,980
Who're you visiting?

430
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,160
Sorceress Ma.

431
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,840
Her house?

432
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,270
What's the deal today?

433
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,600
Everyone's looking for her early in the morning.

434
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,680
Let me tell you.

435
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,920
Go up all the way

436
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,110
along this path.

437
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,680
At the end,

438
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,000
turn right.

439
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,350
The one with

440
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,510
two cars at the doorway

441
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,000
is her home.

442
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,400
Go on.

443
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,640
I'm at Xihuang Village.

444
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,440
Something's up. Hurry over.

445
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,960
Roger, Captain Peng.

446
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:19,750
Come.

447
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,110
Are you happy now?

448
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,590
Yes, so happy!

449
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,790
Is it fun?

450
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,480
Yes.

451
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,130
We'll go vroom, vroom again later!

452
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,000
Police.

453
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,270
What are you doing?

454
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,480
Checking her pulse.

455
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,510
Don't move!

456
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,580
I was getting you a stool.

457
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,380
Sit down!

458
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,640
What were those two doing here?

459
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,310
T-To see a doctor.

460
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:07,920
For a doctor.

461
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,270
W-What's wrong?

462
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,790
I...

463
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,830
I just...

464
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,580
My certificate's on the way.

465
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,550
Anyone else in here?

466
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,030
J-Just the three of us.

467
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:15,880
What's wrong?

468
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,170
Who owns the black car?

469
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,000
At the door? That's mine.

470
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,300
Good cigarette.

471
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,580
I've smoked enough.

472
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,310
There are few cars along the way.

473
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,290
You're lucky you met me.

474
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,790
Let me tell you.

475
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,030
Go up all the way

476
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:45,770
along this path.

477
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,090
At the end,

478
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,270
turn right.

479
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,310
The one with

480
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,940
two cars at the doorway

481
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,390
is her home.

482
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:53,790
Go on.

483
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,590
Captain Peng.

484
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,400
What's going on inside?

485
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,170
Huang Qi

486
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,670
went in with Deng Ligang's mom.

487
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,560
Deng Lide never left home.

488
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,110
Peng?

489
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,000
So free today?

490
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,790
I have something to ask you.

491
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,680
Come to the station.

492
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,310
What is it? Why are you being so sneaky?

493
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,950
Must we talk here?

494
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,240
I'm in a rush to get my goods.

495
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,110
Here.

496
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,000
Did you see him?

497
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,830
See...

498
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:16,960
See who?

499
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,270
Who?

500
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,830
You drove around for 40 kilometers

501
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,920
with Deng Ligang's mom.

502
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,920
What do you think?

503
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,790
You mean

504
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,620
my cousin Deng Ligang?

505
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,570
I just...

506
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,590
Wait.

507
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,270
We can't do this.

508
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,720
Helping a criminal

509
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,590
cover up his crimes

510
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,080
is n-not a minor crime.

511
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,590
Peng, t-this is slander.

512
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,200
Y-You can't

513
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,000
pin this on me.

514
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,350
Why'd you go to Xihuang Village?

515
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,310
Xihuang Village?

516
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,720
My aunt doesn't recognize anyone

517
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,920
when she relapses.

518
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,070
I heard that

519
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,170
Sorceress Ma of Xihuang Village

520
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,000
is good at acupuncture.

521
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,790
I thought I'd bring her

522
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,720
for some treatment.

523
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,430
Sorceress Ma's acupuncture...

524
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,790
Back when Deng Ligang

525
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,720
hurt two people,

526
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,160
you took a photo for him

527
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,310
and registered a fake ID.

528
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,880
Then, he fled out of the village.

529
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,240
You even

530
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,310
personally sent

531
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,240
the fake ID to him.

532
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,070
Do you know why

533
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,830
I brought this up?

534
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,400
I'm reminding you that

535
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,640
you, Huang Qi,

536
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
have a criminal record.

537
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,440
What's wrong?

538
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,550
The man in the cargo truck

539
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,440
looked a lot like Deng Ligang.

540
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,110
But

541
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,750
that was so many years ago.

542
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,450
And...

543
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,640
And I confessed

544
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,750
everything to you then.

545
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,800
I did time in prison

546
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,720
and served my sentence.

547
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,310
Why are you bringing up the past again?

548
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:33,750
Right?

549
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:34,920
Besides,

550
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,030
a criminal record

551
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,720
proves a man's toughness.

552
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,590
Hello?

553
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,510
Hello, Captain Peng.

554
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,270
On our way back,

555
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,510
we noticed someone

556
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,400
in a cargo truck

557
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,240
who looked like Deng Ligang.

558
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,790
Wait here.

559
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,030
I need to get my goods.

560
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,640
Where?

561
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,680
On the National Highway.

562
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,790
Which direction?

563
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,480
From east to west.

564
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,440
Don't lose him. I'm coming.

565
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,590
Got it.

566
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,680
Don't lose him.

567
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,200
He can't escape.

568
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,000
Bro,

569
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,270
I need to pee.

570
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,230
I can't hold it in anymore.

571
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,000
That's not him.

572
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,920
Keep an eye on him

573
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,680
in the car.

574
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,880
Leave the engine on.

575
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,960
I'll go take a look.

576
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,510
Be careful.

577
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,110
Stop!

578
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,920
Hurry! Hurry!

579
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,050
Hurry! Hurry up!

580
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,220
Stop! Police!

581
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,360
Watch out!

582
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:21,760
Stop!

583
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,280
Catch up!

584
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,030
Stop the car!

585
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,230
Intercept him!

586
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,070
Sit tight!

587
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,480
Stop the car!

588
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,480
-Captain Peng.
-Captain Peng.

589
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:56,920
How are they?

590
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,840
They're still in rescue.

591
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,400
Thank you.

592
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,920
He's out.

593
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,320
Shoujia.

594
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,280
Okay, I won't talk.

595
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,080
Go to the ward with him.

596
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:22,590
Okay.

597
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,230
Doctor.

598
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,230
How is he?

599
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,150
Left leg fracture,

600
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,360
dislocated cervical spine,

601
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,550
and moderate concussion.

602
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,230
He's out of danger.

603
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,430
Thank you.

604
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,110
Doctor.

605
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,360
What about the other one?

606
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:35,630
Massive hemorrhage

607
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,510
from internal injuries.

608
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,760
We'll do our best.

609
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,070
Captain Peng.

610
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:06,830
How is it?

611
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,480
Shoujia's out of danger.

612
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,740
He's in the ward now.

613
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,480
And...

614
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,680
Yang Bo is still in rescue.

615
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,550
It's okay.

616
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,190
It'll be fine. Don't worry.

617
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:40,760
How is it?

618
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,820
He broke four ribs

619
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:42,880
and ruptured

620
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,980
the blood vessels in his lungs and chest.

621
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,850
Massive hemorrhage

622
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,070
caused various organ failure.

623
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,280
The bleeding has stopped.

624
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,710
But whether he can wake up

625
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,260
will depend on his willpower.

626
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,690
We'll keep observing him.

627
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,000
Doctor!

628
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,230
Please do your best!

629
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,110
Why are you sleeping here?

630
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,230
Answer me! Get up!

631
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,550
Get your director here.

632
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,390
I want to see your director!

633
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,630
Director Xu.

634
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,190
Zhaolin.

635
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,880
Come in.

636
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:37,630
Have a seat.

637
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,710
How are the injured comrades?

638
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,690
Ge Shoujia just got out of danger.

639
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,070
Yang Bo...

640
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,750
is still in a coma.

641
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,040
We must do our best to save

642
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,800
our comrades.

643
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,400
Yes.

644
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,150
Also, what's up

645
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,070
with Huang Qi?

646
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:02,840
I...

647
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,310
I forgot about him.

648
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,800
Alright, sit down.

649
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,030
He's gone.

650
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,070
I sent him off myself.

651
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,210
I even spent

652
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,570
half an hour placating him.

653
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,320
I think

654
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,280
Deng Ligang would've contacted him

655
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,960
in this return.

656
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,230
Do you have evidence?

657
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,070
My two comrades

658
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,440
were almost killed by Deng Ligang.

659
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,670
Isn't that evidence?

660
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,030
Zhaolin.

661
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,630
Right now,

662
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,180
you need to stay calm.

663
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:44,920
Director Xu.

664
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,920
Since I accepted this case,

665
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,150
I've always been very calm.

666
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,360
I demand myself to be so.

667
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,800
But one of my comrades

668
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,920
just got out of danger

669
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,670
and another's life is on the line.

670
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:06,670
We haven't

671
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,820
made any headway with the case.

672
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,250
I don't know

673
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:13,510
how to

674
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,880
answer to their families.

675
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,190
You can't

676
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,550
be emotional with investigations.

677
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:22,590
Let me ask you.

678
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,690
How long have you been

679
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,600
in charge of the 11/03 case?

680
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:25,630
Three months.

681
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,480
In three months,

682
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,480
two of our men got hurt,

683
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,990
but the case is still stagnant.

684
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,320
Also,

685
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,590
on New Year's Eve,

686
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,230
your wife and child

687
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,670
sent you food at your stakeout.

688
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,880
This is prohibited.

689
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,230
The Bureau Committee has decided.

690
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,520
Someone else will

691
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,440
take over the 11/03 case.

692
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,670
You'll be transferred to Outsourcing.

693
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,300
Director Xu.

694
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,480
Okay, enough.

695
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,060
I'll be frank with you.

696
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,320
It's not just you.

697
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,960
I received a formal transfer too.

698
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,140
I'm leaving tomorrow.

699
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,800
Aren't you going to work?

700
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,710
I'll be

701
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,760
quite free now.

702
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,800
What do you mean?

703
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,840
What's wrong?

704
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,070
I was transferred out of Special Task Force.

705
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,920
Why?

706
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,630
I didn't do my job well.

707
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,660
Still not good enough?

708
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,640
What'll be good enough then?

709
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,610
Never going home?

710
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,740
This case's been open for three months.

711
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,070
I made no progress.

712
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,050
Shoujia

713
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,090
and Yang Bo

714
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,400
are also hospitalized.

715
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:15,880
What happened?

716
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,230
Exhaustion.

717
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,400
They're fine.

718
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,440
But I'm responsible for this.

719
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,030
I have to...

720
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,190
be punished.

721
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,960
Why should you be punished?

722
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,080
I'm the captain.

723
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:41,800
Just wait.

724
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
This case

725
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,540
needs you.

726
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,300
I need you too.

727
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,070
Spend some time with me and our kid.

728
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,770
Rest for a few days.

729
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,670
You're a tough man.

730
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:00,920
Don't burn out.

731
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:09,630
Bomb.

732
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:10,800
Huh? What bomb?

733
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,810
There's no bomb with

734
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,280
three cards.

735
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,000
It's not a bomb?

736
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:13,880
It's not.

737
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:14,880
Then what is it?

738
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,300
Oh my.

739
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,380
Playing with Boss Lady...

740
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:19,110
Where have you been?

741
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:37,760
The meat's cooked.

742
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,320
Come on.

743
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,070
What's this for?

744
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,480
Captain Peng.

745
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,070
How'd we have the appetite?

746
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,280
Yang Bo

747
00:44:58,730 --> 00:44:59,250
and Ge Shoujia

748
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,440
are bedridden in the hospital.

749
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,170
The case's been stopped.

750
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,760
You were transferred.

751
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,320
Deng Ligang got away.

752
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,070
Is this a farewell dinner?

753
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,550
One popsicle, please.

754
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,360
Okay.

755
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,550
How much?

756
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:20,740
Fifty cents.

757
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:28,110
Here.

758
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:29,190
Here's your change.

759
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:42,230
Thank you.

760
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,170
At that moment, I didn't know

761
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,630
that in three days,

762
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:50,070
this girl's parents would report her missing

763
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,650
to the police.
