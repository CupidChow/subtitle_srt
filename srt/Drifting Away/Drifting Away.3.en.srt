00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:42,630
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,660
[Episode 3]

4
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,560
My name is Zhen Zhen.

5
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,720
My story starts

6
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,560
from the year when my mom

7
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,680
pulled some strings to get me

8
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,950
into the top high school in Xuecheng.

9
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,590
A new school

10
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,400
and new classmates

11
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,640
made me think

12
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,000
that would be a new beginning.

13
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,040
However,

14
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,800
it was, in fact, the beginning of my nightmare.

15
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,180
When should I go to your home for tutoring?

16
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,310
It's best on Saturday and Sunday.

17
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,910
Okay, I got it.

18
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,840
I'm leaving.

19
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,120
Be careful on your ride back.

20
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,750
Okay.

21
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,240
What's wrong?

22
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,210
you haven't told me

23
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
where you live.

24
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:04,800
Oh, right.

25
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,680
No. 201, Unit 2.

26
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,930
Okay, I got it.

27
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,690
Bye.

28
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,210
Mom.

29
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,079
Why didn't you knock before entering my room?

30
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,190
It's my own home.

31
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,500
Why should I knock?

32
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
How's your schoolwork?

33
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,079
Not bad.

34
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,970
What do you mean by "not bad"?

35
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,970
Not bad means not bad.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,880
I mean it literally.

37
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,079
Don't talk back to me.

38
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,770
Can't you talk to me properly?

39
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,630
People say

40
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,710
there are two types of children.

41
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,370
One type is here to repay the parents' kindness.

42
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,150
The other

43
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,750
is here to collect debts.

44
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,470
You're here to collect debts from us.

45
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,710
When your grandma died,

46
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,440
just because I didn't let you go to her funeral

47
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,280
in the countryside,

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,250
you just put on a long face

49
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,710
and ignored me for half a month.

50
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,530
Your grandma's funeral

51
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,970
and your exam clashed.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,360
-What's more important?
-Mom.

53
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,870
I dreamed of Grandma

54
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,510
last night.

55
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,680
That old lady!

56
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,680
Why couldn't she be quiet?

57
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:29,950
What did she want?

58
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,240
What did she say?

59
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,600
She said she wanted to go home.

60
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,720
I told her it was impossible

61
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,280
because you've removed her from the household registry.

62
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,070
How could she come back?

63
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,120
Then, she cried.

64
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,040
She said she'd come back to you.

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,070
Let me think about it.

66
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,310
Today is...

67
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,040
The day after tomorrow…

68
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,800
The 15th.

69
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,490
The day after tomorrow is the 15th.

70
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,659
Go burn some joss paper for your grandma.

71
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,240
Burn more.

72
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,480
Manager, you...

73
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,480
It's late.

74
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,950
Why are you calling me?

75
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,310
Eat the walnuts.

76
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,950
I wasn't talking to you.

77
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,240
What is it?

78
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,680
Tell me.

79
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,160
Zhen Zhen.

80
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,870
This is for you.

81
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,020
No, it's not appropriate.

82
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,140
It's okay. It's fine.

83
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,750
Take it.

84
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,750
But this is…

85
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,210
It can ward off evil spirits.

86
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,400
Why did Zhou Yue give her

87
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,040
his favorite pendant?

88
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,600
Shameless!

89
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,190
She seduced our campus Beau as soon as she transferred here.

90
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,470
I'll teach her a lesson.

91
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,240
Shameless!

92
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:28,840
What's wrong with you?

93
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,360
What?

94
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,720
What are you doing?

95
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,070
Let go!

96
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:34,870
Let...

97
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,680
Don't move!

98
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,840
Don't move!

99
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,680
Let me go.

100
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,280
Let me go.

101
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:39,920
Let go…

102
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,120
Shout out loud.

103
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,070
You have to shout loudly.

104
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,360
Shout!

105
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,040
Shout!

106
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,630
"Help!" Shout it! Shout it!

107
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,040
She stopped shouting.

108
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,810
What do you want?

109
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,050
Nothing.

110
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,240
You think you're pretty?

111
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,920
You feel so good about yourself.

112
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,330
A country bumpkin like you,

113
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,800
do you really think

114
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,830
you're a match for Zhou Yue?

115
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,160
Do you think Zhou Yue

116
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,270
really likes you?

117
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,550
He doesn't like you anyway.

118
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,480
If I am to

119
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,560
mess up your face,

120
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,790
will Zhou Yue still talk to you?

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,600
You hit me?

122
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,510
Beat her!

123
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,140
Don't come over!

124
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,510
Don't come near me!

125
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,950
You're bleeding.

126
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,800
Really.

127
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:51,630
Let's go.

128
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,600
Let's go to the hospital.

129
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,560
Let's go.

130
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,580
Just you wait!

131
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,390
Let's go.

132
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:27,920
Kneel.

133
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,240
Kneel!

134
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,470
You're really something now, huh?

135
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,480
You can never make

136
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,630
something of yourself.

137
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,670
You've learned to hit a bottle on people's heads now?

138
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,180
Do you know how much

139
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,080
it cost me?

140
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,600
5,800 yuan!

141
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,170
They surrounded me by the wall,

142
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,720
trying to hit me.

143
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,910
Why didn't they hit others?

144
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,170
You are my mother.

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Why are you siding with others?

146
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,240
I'm being reasonable.

147
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,270
You're not being reasonable.

148
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,840
You just care about the money you've spent.

149
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,120
Why am I not being reasonable?

150
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,840
Did you hit someone's head with a bottle

151
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,360
and crack it open or not?

152
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,980
Blood flew on her head.

153
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,320
Is there blood on your head?

154
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,970
They just drew a few lines

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,270
on your face with the lipstick.

156
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,240
Listen.

157
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,720
Kneel here.

158
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,120
Think about

159
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,910
what you did wrong.

160
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,750
Try to learn a lesson.

161
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,840
Our money

162
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,270
is not a windfall.

163
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,390
How much did I spend

164
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,720
to get you into this school?

165
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,670
Hello?

166
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,430
Oh my.

167
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,670
Mr. Li!

168
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,700
Why are you

169
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,980
calling me all of a sudden?

170
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,940
Is the test passed so quickly?

171
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,600
Ma'am, I'm Zhen Zhen's classmate.

172
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,510
I'm here to tutor her.

173
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,240
Come in.

174
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,150
Mr. Li, please continue.

175
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,580
Zhen Zhen.

176
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,030
That's great.

177
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,670
Thank you.

178
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,910
This is a good thing.

179
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,530
I'm happy.

180
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,790
Okay.

181
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:12,630
Okay.

182
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,120
How about I come…

183
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
come back another day?

184
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,240
Okay.

185
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,670
Sure.

186
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,910
Okay.

187
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,200
Goodbye, Mr. Li.

188
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,120
Hello.

189
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,670
He...

190
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,440
Get up.

191
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,240
What?

192
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,900
You're still in the mood?

193
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,840
Get up.

194
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,240
Before I was ten,

195
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,200
I lived with my grandparents.

196
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,620
I only came to live with you

197
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,710
after I turned ten.

198
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,150
It's barely seven years.

199
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
But the seven years

200
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,240
feels longer than a lifetime.

201
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,750
I was beaten up by others today.

202
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,940
You didn't defend me when you came back.

203
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,240
Instead, you punished me.

204
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,000
Every time you get mistreated outside,

205
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,830
you come home and take it out on me.

206
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,790
I'm your daughter,

207
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,840
not your punching bag.

208
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,240
I'm not

209
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,480
the reason why your life failed, either.

210
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,390
What...

211
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,750
My life…

212
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,010
failed?

213
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,200
You kept talking.

214
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,790
Why are you so eloquent?

215
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,470
Use these skills of yours

216
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,860
on your studies.

217
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,970
Make your grades

218
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,520
go up, okay?

219
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,630
Did you do well

220
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,510
in high school?

221
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,870
Did you get 100 on every test?

222
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:51,880
If you can't do it yourself,

223
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,840
why do you require me to?

224
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,270
I'll have a popsicle.

225
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,080
Okay, 50 cents.

226
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,840
Okay, thank you.

227
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,120
Here.

228
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,200
Here's your change.

229
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,400
-Thank you.
-Okay.

230
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,660
Why aren't you at school?

231
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,790
It's none of your business.

232
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,130
You have a bad temper.

233
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,480
What's wrong with you?

234
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,570
Why don't you go to school?

235
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,750
I'm sick.

236
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,120
There's a blood vessel in my brain

237
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,960
that's a bit malformed.

238
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,910
I get spasms when I'm nervous.

239
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,320
By the way,

240
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,710
you haven't told me

241
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,790
why you skipped school.

242
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,760
My mom is sick, too.

243
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,030
I'm doing it to treat her.

244
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,550
What's wrong with your mom?

245
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,030
When I was a top student at school,

246
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,320
she didn't praise me.

247
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,780
Now I'm a bad student,

248
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,650
she scolds me to no end.

249
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,170
It's her who is sick,

250
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,080
but she forced me to take medicine.

251
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,270
Do you think

252
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:49,930
it is fair?

253
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,670
You're right.

254
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,720
Those people

255
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,270
can't climb the mountain themselves,

256
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,680
but they force their children

257
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,960
to reach the peak.

258
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,940
Aren't they just crazy?

259
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,760
That's right.

260
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,910
That's how

261
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,930
she turned me rebellious.

262
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,000
So, the more she wants to

263
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,000
show off to others,

264
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,910
the more I want to ruin it.

265
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,320
You do have a personality.

266
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,120
It's cold,

267
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,980
and you sit here.

268
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
You might get sick.

269
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,270
Go sit in my shop

270
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,000
and warm yourself up.

271
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,870
How about this?

272
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,600
Let me take you to eat something.

273
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,720
These are for you.

274
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,040
What? Walnuts?

275
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,630
Take a look.

276
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,200
Why are you giving me walnuts?

277
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,870
These are the work of my apprentice.

278
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,150
A gift for you.

279
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,120
Well,

280
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,540
you carved really well.

281
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,750
It's nothing.

282
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,480
Are you really giving them to me?

283
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,240
Thank you.

284
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,320
Are you full?

285
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,030
You should go home.

286
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,610
I'm not full yet.

287
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,240
I want to have another burger.

288
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,680
You just don't want to go home.

289
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,390
I'll order one more for you.

290
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,550
You'll have to go back after you eat it.

291
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,200
No wonder she skipped school today.

292
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,360
Turns out she came out

293
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,390
to date another man.

294
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,870
She's so good at flirting.

295
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,510
She really doesn't rest for a single day.

296
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,200
Dad!

297
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,630
You haven't been back for half a month.

298
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,550
I was busy at the construction site.

299
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:01,790
Wait,

300
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,570
why are you home so late?

301
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,349
Do you realize what time it is?

302
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,069
Why are you back so late?

303
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,630
Why are you coming back later and later?

304
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,480
Stop!

305
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,920
I was talking to you. Didn't you hear me?

306
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,750
When do you want me to come back?

307
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,920
It's always wrong in your eyes whether I come back early or late.

308
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,210
Why don't you set a time?

309
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,880
I'll come back at that time.

310
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,240
I can't even criticize you now?

311
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,970
The kid of one of my colleagues

312
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,960
is of the same age as you.

313
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,000
He can even cook for his mother.

314
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,400
Look at you.

315
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,880
You can't help in anything.

316
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,880
I even have to feed you

317
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,030
after I cook.

318
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,720
Wash your hands first.

319
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,440
Hurry up. Time to eat.

320
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,750
Wash your hands and eat.

321
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,550
Did they pay the remaining balance?

322
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,030
Not yet.

323
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,800
The project has been completed for over half a year.

324
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,400
It's just a small amount of money.

325
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,270
If you were capable,

326
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,180
you would have got it long ago.

327
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,160
Zhen Zhen's cram school costs money, right?

328
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,240
We have to pay the mortgage, right?

329
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,330
You also have to support your father, don't you?

330
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,280
Tell me.

331
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,190
Which one is the priority?

332
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:05,920
Which can be put off?

333
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,270
I'm not going to the cram school.

334
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,310
Don't waste your money.

335
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,070
Just eat.

336
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,200
I'm really not going.

337
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,510
I won't go even if you sign up.

338
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,310
What?

339
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,410
I spend money on you,

340
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,510
yet I'm the one who is wrong?

341
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,000
Mom,

342
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,510
I sincerely beg you.

343
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,160
Don't spend that money on me.

344
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,580
If I'm in debt,

345
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,600
I can't even walk tall.

346
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,560
Why are you in debt?

347
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,290
Everything you invest in me—

348
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,880
I have to prove they're worth it

349
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,050
by doing well.

350
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,680
I really can't do it.

351
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,090
Did I give birth to you and raise you

352
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,850
just for you to

353
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,830
go against me?

354
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,120
You...

355
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,130
Do you think I want to

356
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,720
waste money on you like this?

357
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,720
If you don't go to cram school,

358
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,240
can you make it to a good university?

359
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,270
My colleague's kid

360
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,180
only went to

361
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,290
cram school for a semester,

362
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,710
and he went from being 20th in class

363
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,910
to 9th place.

364
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,410
If you like other people's kids,

365
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,270
you can take them home

366
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,190
and raise them.

367
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,480
If I knew

368
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,440
what you would be like today,

369
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
I wouldn't have given birth to you!

370
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,030
Alright, let's eat.

371
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,340
How did I give birth to

372
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,400
such an ungrateful person?

373
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,650
I transferred you

374
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,030
from a school ranked 20th

375
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,560
to one ranked 4th.

376
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,350
Do you know

377
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,170
how much it cost?

378
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,440
I didn't ask you to transfer schools for me.

379
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,750
In my previous school,

380
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,750
I ranked No. 1 in my grade.

381
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,550
I was fine.

382
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,640
It's you who insisted on transferring me

383
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,610
to this school.

384
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,400
So it's not my fault

385
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,000
that I can't keep up

386
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,910
and my grades dropped.

387
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,410
I'm just stupid.

388
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,160
Half of my stupid genes

389
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,220
are from you.

390
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,240
If I'm a fish

391
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,480
and you insist that I walk on land,

392
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,130
whose fault would that be?

393
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,960
You're asking for it!

394
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,110
Do you dare say it again?

395
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,720
You can't defeat others,

396
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,830
so you use other kids as weapons

397
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,770
to go against your own kid.

398
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,820
Come back.

399
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,080
Come back!

400
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,720
Alright, let's eat.

401
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,680
Here, the food is cold.

402
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,000
What sins did I commit

403
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,640
in my previous life?

404
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,270
How unlucky am I to have ended up

405
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,030
marrying you

406
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,970
and giving birth to her?

407
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,880
The one who just ran into her room

408
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,310
isn't just my daughter,

409
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,880
is she?

410
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,760
Didn't you hear how she insulted me?

411
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,380
Was your mouth glued shut?

412
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,550
Why didn't you dare to say anything?

413
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,170
Why are you blaming me now?

414
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,810
Zhen Yuliang.

415
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,320
Everyone in the world

416
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,850
can blame me,

417
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,070
but you can't.

418
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,620
Why?

419
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,880
Because I've worked hard without complaint

420
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,240
and poured my heart and soul

421
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,020
into our relationship.

422
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,720
And that can't even make you

423
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,590
defend me?

424
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,900
Why am I

425
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,170
the bad guy here?

426
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,350
Let's try to make do, yeah?

427
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,920
If not, let's just divorce!

428
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,110
That man is quite tall.

429
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,480
He seemed to have monolids.

430
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,790
I like monolids.

431
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,590
What did you eat for breakfast?

432
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,200
Hamburger?

433
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:51,960
Fries?

434
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,770
Or a family combo?

435
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,630
With chicken wings?

436
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,010
Where are you going?

437
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,930
You guys can talk in front of me.

438
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,960
Don't gossip behind my back.

439
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,930
Don't you know your place?

440
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,920
You were just dumped by Zhou Yue,

441
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,310
and you're already

442
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,930
rushing to jump into a rebound relationship…

443
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,780
What nonsense are you talking about?

444
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,160
You're a good student,

445
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,560
yet you skipped class every day

446
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,240
and sneaked out of school.

447
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,520
It turns out you went to

448
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,510
sponge off a man for food.

449
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,400
How was it?

450
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,350
Was it yummy?

451
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,480
I should've done more than hit you with a bottle that day.

452
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,320
Let go of me.

453
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,270
Let go!

454
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,500
-What are you doing?
-Let go of me!

455
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,260
What are you doing?

456
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
Nothing, Ms. Chang.

457
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,710
We were just playing.

458
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,830
Go back to your seats.

459
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,350
Okay.

460
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,440
Do you know what the self-study class means?

461
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,320
Let me tell you.

462
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,520
Whether I'm here or not,

463
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,350
you should act in the same way.

464
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,280
Zhen Zhen.

465
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,590
Come to my office.

466
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,520
Why did you quarrel with the property owner again?

467
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,480
You don't know how arrogant she was.

468
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,320
She was so annoying.

469
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,200
She deserves it.

470
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,110
What?

471
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,110
She was practically bullying me.

472
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,680
Should I have praised her for it?

473
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,160
Is she God

474
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,590
and us workers her slaves?

475
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,790
You just passed the test.

476
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,520
Are you trying to ruin your future

477
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,440
just to fight with her?

478
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
W-Where are you going?

479
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,250
I haven't finished yet.

480
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,310
I'll go apologize to her.

481
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,070
Okay?

482
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,000
Hello?

483
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,790
Ms. Chang!

484
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,820
It's me.

485
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,080
Well...

486
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,160
What's wrong with Zhen Zhen again?

487
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,230
Ms. Chang.

488
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,020
Mrs. Zhen, you're here.

489
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,670
Have a seat.

490
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,790
Please have a seat.

491
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,510
Please have a seat.

492
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:08,610
You, too.

493
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,480
Okay.

494
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,520
I invited you here today

495
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,510
to tell you

496
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,680
something.

497
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,690
When Zhen Zhen was just transferred here,

498
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,640
she was a good student,

499
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,920
but her grades have recently

500
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,290
plummeted dramatically.

501
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,480
Someone even saw her

502
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,580
dating a boy in Qingtan Street.

503
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,590
The school prohibits

504
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,260
students from having relationships.

505
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,770
It's an absolute no-no.

506
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,160
I admit my grades have dropped.

507
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,110
I also admit that I skipped school.

508
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,790
But I won't admit to having a relationship.

509
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,640
You skipped school the day before yesterday

510
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,010
and went on a date with a boy

511
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,150
at a fast-food restaurant on Qingtan Street.

512
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,910
Is that true?

513
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,350
I didn't go on a date.

514
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:41,930
No?

515
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,790
Other students

516
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,830
have told me!

517
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,450
And you're still denying it?

518
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,640
Who is that guy?

519
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,030
May I ask

520
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,640
what the definition of having a relationship is?

521
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:53,970
I just had a burger in a fast-food restaurant.

522
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,550
Can that be counted as a relationship?

523
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,240
You adults

524
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,640
were all once my age.

525
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,110
Why are you getting more and more narrow-minded?

526
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,360
I'm asking you!

527
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,830
Who is that guy?

528
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,960
I don't know!

529
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:04,930
Who are you talking about?

530
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,880
I have no idea!

531
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,300
Stop!

532
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,110
C-Calm down.

533
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,790
Where are you going?

534
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,510
Zhen Zhen.

535
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,480
Where are you going?

536
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,960
Where...

537
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,030
Ma'am.

538
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,070
It's you, isn't it?

539
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,560
Don't think I don't know

540
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,500
it's you!

541
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,790
How dare you!

542
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:25,970
You even dare

543
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
go to our home to seduce my daughter!

544
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,550
Huh?

545
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,250
What are you doing?

546
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,680
Do you think we, the parents, are blind

547
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,000
and fools?

548
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,030
Stop it.

549
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:33,820
We're at school!

550
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:34,780
Are you a dating tutor?

551
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,350
Mom!

552
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:35,940
Listen.

553
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,200
Stay away from my daughter!

554
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,590
Stay away from my daughter!

555
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:38,890
You...

556
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,480
Otherwise, I won't spare you!

557
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,790
I won't!

558
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,830
I won't spare you!

559
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,200
You loser!

560
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,000
Where are my books?

561
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:57,960
Novels, painting albums…

562
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,770
Why are they all gone?

563
00:26:59,440 --> 00:26:59,920
I sold them.

564
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:00,890
You sold them?

565
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,050
I bought those by saving money

566
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,970
for years.

567
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,580
I paid for them.

568
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,480
I can sell them if I want.

569
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,750
You are so unreasonable.

570
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,000
It's useless to reason with you.

571
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,920
How can you be so self-righteous?

572
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,790
Why didn't they hit others?

573
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,750
They just drew a few lines

574
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,050
on your face with the lipstick.

575
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,380
Kneel.

576
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:55,680
You are my mother.

577
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,480
Why are you siding with others?

578
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,640
I'm being reasonable.

579
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,440
I don't care if you eat.

580
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,550
Open the door!

581
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:17,990
Open the door!

582
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,250
Open the door!

583
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:42,960
Come out!

584
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,510
What are you doing?

585
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,830
What are you doing?

586
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,840
I'll burn down everything that has a word on it

587
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,720
in your house.

588
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,590
Say it again.

589
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:55,880
Do you dare say it again?

590
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,270
I'm too ashamed to go to school.

591
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,400
It's useless to keep those things.

592
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,320
I gave birth to you.

593
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,890
Is this how you repay me?

594
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,510
Huh?

595
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,350
You gave birth to me

596
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,960
not because you like me.

597
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,480
It's just because you got pregnant.

598
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,110
You raised me

599
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,460
because it's convenient

600
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
to vent your anger on me.

601
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,560
A mother beats her child.

602
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,020
As long as she doesn't kill it, the law won't interfere,

603
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
nor will outsiders.

604
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,110
Say it.

605
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:31,790
Say it!

606
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,650
Say it properly!

607
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,080
I'll allow you to let it all out today.

608
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,270
Go ahead. Let it all out!

609
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,680
Every time you compare

610
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,000
my ungratefulness

611
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,070
to your hard work,

612
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,270
it can drive me crazy.

613
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:48,370
I just want to settle the scores

614
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,240
with you.

615
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,400
After we settle it,

616
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,790
I can have some peace of mind.

617
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,270
I gave my life to you!

618
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,680
Ungrateful.

619
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,640
You know?

620
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,830
I gave my life to you!

621
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,440
What else do you want from me?

622
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,790
What else do you want from me?

623
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,700
It's just a C-section.

624
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,440
Your tummy was cut open.

625
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,830
You also said that

626
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,720
you shouldn't have given birth to me

627
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,750
and that it was a mistake to give birth to me.

628
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,550
No matter how hard I try,

629
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,810
I can't meet your requirements.

630
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,350
Every time you beat me and scolded me,

631
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,200
my dad would say

632
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,840
you're just sharp-tongued, but you're tender inside.

633
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,070
But you know what?

634
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,070
your sharp tongue

635
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,110
has hurt the feelings of everyone in the family.

636
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,000
Everyone.

637
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,210
The slap you gave me

638
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,310
at school today

639
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,750
is the turning point in our mother-daughter relationship.

640
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,370
From now on,

641
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,160
just let me be.

642
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,070
Leave me alone!

643
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:51,790
Get lost.

644
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,200
Get out!

645
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,210
Go as far as you can!

646
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,550
I don't want to see you again!

647
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,920
Get lost!

648
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,240
Get lost!

649
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:04,880
Okay.

650
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,790
Is the house ready?

651
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,030
Yes.

652
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,850
What about the car?

653
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:38,630
It's done.

654
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,400
Since everything is ready,

655
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,590
let's…

656
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,880
open again.

657
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:19,430
[Luan Cheng]

658
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,990
Feng.

659
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,210
Where did Feng go?

660
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,240
Don't hide.

661
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,320
Where are you going?

662
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,520
The whole room

663
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,600
waiting for you.

664
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,810
I can't walk anymore.

665
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,230
I'll carry you.

666
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:09,800
Let me carry you.

667
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,550
Let me carry you.

668
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,110
Go away!

669
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,190
I can't drink anymore!

670
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,510
You have to.

671
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,010
You just had a few drinks, right?

672
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:15,670
Morbid.

673
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,000
What? Mortal?

674
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,000
I am a mortal.

675
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,110
Do you want to be an immortal?

676
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,400
Huh?

677
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,200
How is it?

678
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,210
How many orders did you get today?

679
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,960
Business is not good now.

680
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,120
Those male guests

681
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,590
always get drunk.

682
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:35,760
Ignore them.

683
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,450
I'll take a rest.

684
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,000
Bye.

685
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,510
Bye.

686
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,630
Who is it?

687
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,230
Who are you looking for?

688
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,310
I'm looking for Ding Yachun.

689
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,030
She's not here.

690
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,070
Where did she go?

691
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,070
She went to college in Shanghai.

692
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,480
Who are you?

693
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:22,880
I'm a tenant.
