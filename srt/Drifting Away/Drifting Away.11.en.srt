[Episode 11]

4
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,009
Deng?

5
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,350
Yep.

6
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,680
What's wrong?

7
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,280
See if

8
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,400
it's this man.

9
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,710
Yeah, that's him!

10
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,509
Exactly!

11
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,370
His name is Deng... Deng what again?

12
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,039
Deng Lide.

13
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,680
Right, Deng Lide!

14
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,669
Now we have a new lead.

15
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,820
I just have one question.

16
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,800
What do you think?

17
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,280
When I heard about this,

18
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,530
it literally freaked me out.

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,680
We must do it! I mean it!

20
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,310
Yeah! We must get him!

21
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,470
How do you feel?

22
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,800
-Great!
-Great!

23
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,660
Keep it up!

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,750
-Yep!
-Yep!

25
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,030
Alright.

26
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,079
Yesterday,

27
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,350
the two of us went to the hospital

28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,590
to investigate a bit.

29
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,530
There's a person called Sun Qiang.

30
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,670
His illness is real,

31
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,470
but everything else, like his address and identity,

32
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,630
is totally made up.

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,440
If this Deng Lide

34
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,210
has really come back,

35
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,480
he must have left some traces.

36
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,150
Left some traces?

37
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,610
What kind of traces would he have left?

38
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,840
Like what he ate,

39
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:47,790
what he used,

40
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,150
and where he stayed,

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,030
right?

42
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,490
Huang Qi.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,520
Boss Peng?

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,870
Huang.

45
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:18,960
Boss Peng,

46
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,000
I knew you were looking for me everywhere,

47
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,400
so I took the initiative to call you.

48
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,240
How's it?

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,430
I did behave myself,

50
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,870
right?

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,120
What happened to your leg?

52
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,910
I used to fight a lot when I was young.

53
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,560
Now the fallout's started to bite these years.

54
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,520
It was injured before.

55
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,710
Now I've got the femoral head necrosis.

56
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,120
I heard the hospital can replace it

57
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,280
with something called

58
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,400
a titanium steel plate, right?

59
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,240
I've asked around.

60
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,260
It costs over 30,000 yuan.

61
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,660
Even my life...

62
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,070
My life isn't even worth that much.

63
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,470
Don't say that.

64
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,560
Borrow some money from others

65
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,140
to get it treated first.

66
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,630
Otherwise, it will make you suffer every day.

67
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,470
In my condition,

68
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,290
who can I borrow money from? Who would lend me money?

69
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,150
The dishes have been served.

70
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,960
What a hearty meal!

71
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,840
All your favorites.

72
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,190
Nice.

73
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,190
Come on, have a drink.

74
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,110
It's quite cold.

75
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,220
What's up, Boss Peng?

76
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,910
I haven't seen you

77
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,430
drink in a while!

78
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:09,980
Are you gonna drink?

79
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,150
Just for you.

80
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,590
Let's drink to our hearts' content.

81
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,280
C'mon, man...

82
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,750
Cheers, Boss Peng.

83
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,150
Cheers!

84
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,630
Cheers!

85
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,970
I heard you sold

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,600
your shop

87
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,920
and opened a mahjong parlor.

88
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,270
Yep.

89
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,000
How's the turnover?

90
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,530
It's terrible.

91
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,430
Just making ends meet,

92
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,040
barely enough

93
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,680
to feed myself.

94
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,720
Boss Peng, what do you mean?

95
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,000
Having gone through all this trouble to find me,

96
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,600
are you trying to save me?

97
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,850
You're much older than me,

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,770
yet you still call me

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,510
Boss Peng.

100
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,750
It's a bit hard for me to accept that.

101
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,070
In Xinqiao District,

102
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,310
no matter their age,

103
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,530
everyone just calls you Boss Peng, right?

104
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,159
You know what?

105
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,000
We call you

106
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,390
"Boss Peng"

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,480
out of respect for your kind heart.

108
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,190
You know?

109
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,050
Boss Peng,

110
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,480
you're a kind-hearted boss.

111
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,560
Right?

112
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,080
You're a good mate too.

113
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,270
C'mon...

114
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,270
You're a loyal friend,

115
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,010
especially to the Deng brothers.

116
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,330
You're more loyal than anyone.

117
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,750
Wait...

118
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,830
Boss Peng, isn't

119
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,360
our conversation

120
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,390
a bit off-topic?

121
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,190
Is it?

122
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,190
Alright.

123
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,120
If you have any questions, just go ahead.

124
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,480
I'll tell you everything I know.

125
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,560
Cheers.

126
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,320
Well,

127
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,740
Deng Ligang has been committing crimes in other provinces,

128
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,120
killing several more people.

129
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,190
Do you know that?

130
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,750
He killed someone?

131
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:45,720
I, um...

132
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,940
I really didn't know that.

133
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,780
Zhang Nianci and Deng Lide

134
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
have moved.

135
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,360
Any idea

136
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,750
where they moved to?

137
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,680
I don't know that either.

138
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,390
Deng Lide came back to Xuecheng for treatment.

139
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,830
You should know about this, right?

140
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,680
Nope!

141
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,830
Then what on earth do you know?

142
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:23,970
Well, Boss Peng,

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,040
we're just having a drink.

144
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,240
Why are you getting so worked up?

145
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,260
Am I worked up?

146
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,000
Alright, Boss Peng, fine...

147
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,670
Fine...

148
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,720
I can't mess with you.

149
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,250
Sit down.

150
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,010
Don't be so fragile.

151
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,120
Well, you...

152
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,950
I just slammed down the cup

153
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,750
a bit too hard.

154
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,330
What's wrong?

155
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,000
The food's been served;

156
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,830
the wine's been poured.

157
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
We should finish them all,

158
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,270
or it'll be a waste.

159
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,480
Don't you think so?

160
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,040
C'mon.

161
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,880
Just say whatever you want, but don't get worked up.

162
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,360
You...

163
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,040
Not this clatter again!

164
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,870
How can I continue to drink?

165
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,390
Hurry up.

166
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,510
C'mon, hurry.

167
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,480
Huang Qi!

168
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:06,940
Everybody freeze!

169
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,110
Wait...

170
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,750
Behave yourself!

171
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,390
I haven't broken any laws!

172
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,160
Why are you arresting me?

173
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,600
Why were you trying to run away if you haven't?

174
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,120
Couldn't I just stretch my legs?

175
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:13,870
Good,

176
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,270
then you can go somewhere else to stretch.

177
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:15,630
Take him away.

178
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:15,890
Got it!

179
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,430
Go!

180
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,040
Wait!

181
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,190
My hat!

182
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,000
My hat's still over there!

183
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,550
Bring it along!

184
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,430
What's going on?

185
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,070
Boss Peng,

186
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,420
how was my acting?

187
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,430
Come on.

188
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,040
Sign this.

189
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,360
W-What is this?

190
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,800
Wait,

191
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,070
Boss Peng, you can't set me up!

192
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:37,560
Calm down

193
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,460
and take a look at what it is.

194
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,310
Well...

195
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:40,270
Sit down.

196
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,390
No, I...

197
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,760
I really don't know anything about the case.

198
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,400
[Xuecheng People's Hospital]

199
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
I've made an appointment

200
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,470
with the hospital and the doctor for you.

201
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:52,870
Also, I've covered

202
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,590
the surgery fee for you.

203
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,070
You can pay it back to me

204
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,580
after you get enough money.

205
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,310
Boss Peng, you're such a good mate.

206
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,950
Well, this...

207
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,560
This isn't titanium steel?

208
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,870
Titanium steel

209
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,560
is really not what I can afford.

210
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,350
Just use a steel one for now.

211
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
It can last you seven or eight years.

212
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:14,800
Okay...

213
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,960
T-Thank you, Boss Peng.

214
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,000
Everyone's here.

215
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:17,720
Let's go.

216
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,450
Okay, just a second.

217
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,310
L-Let me sign this.

218
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,130
Go ahead...

219
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,870
Thank you, Boss Peng.

220
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,630
Um...

221
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,210
I'll leave this here for now.

222
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,270
It's inconvenient for me to carry it.

223
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,000
Wait...

224
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,030
You...

225
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,240
C-Can anyone give me a hit?

226
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,789
It'll make the act more convincing, just like this.

227
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,789
Is that necessary?

228
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,120
It's against the rules.

229
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,720
Alright,

230
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,720
I got it.

231
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,480
Wait a moment, I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

232
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,550
Let me catch my breath.

233
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,060
Even so,

234
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,670
you still need to pay me back for the medical expenses.

235
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,810
Okay...

236
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,530
Now it looks real.

237
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:17,790
Not bad.

238
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,480
You're suspected of harboring Deng Ligang.

239
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,640
Listen,

240
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,240
this is serious.

241
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll send you to the detention center later.

242
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,390
Whether you can get out is another matter.

243
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,330
Wait, I...

244
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,870
Stand still.

245
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,320
Wait...

246
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,360
What's going on?

247
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,240
Bro,

248
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,030
what happened to you?

249
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,440
Are you alright?

250
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,440
Oh, my God. You know what?

251
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,720
You'd better all come clean

252
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
and lay bare the secrets.

253
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,390
Listen,

254
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,750
just confess right away.

255
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,430
You can't hold on.

256
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,510
You really can't take it.

257
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,580
Besides, what are we holding out for?

258
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,520
Deng Ligang is out there

259
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,360
enjoying his posh life,

260
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,110
while we're back here

261
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,200
suffering for him?

262
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,850
Why should we do that?

263
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,550
It's not worth it!

264
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,000
Right.

265
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,360
Yes.

266
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,690
Are you done yapping?

267
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,480
Come in, we've still got something to ask you.

268
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,090
Let's go.

269
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,660
Bro...

270
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,750
Don't move...

271
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,320
But...

272
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:55,910
C'mon, get inside.

273
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,960
What's going on here?

274
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,240
When did you and Deng Lide,

275
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,620
get divorced?

276
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,270
We divorced the year he was sent to prison.

277
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,190
Have you been in contact since then?

278
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,240
No.

279
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,840
When did he leave?

280
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,600
How would I know that?

281
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,130
I also heard about it from others.

282
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,790
He's

283
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,080
never hit you up again?

284
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,000
Sir,

285
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,200
I think you're asking the wrong person.

286
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,570
When we got divorced,

287
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,550
it was a huge mess.

288
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,690
We've split up completely.

289
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,750
You're Deng Ligang's cousin, right?

290
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,510
Yes, I am.

291
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,360
You collected

292
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,000
Zhang Nianci's pension, right?

293
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,030
Yes.

294
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,140
Did she give you her permission?

295
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,150
Here's the thing.

296
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,600
If you didn't have her personal consent,

297
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,750
it would be a whole different story.

298
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,580
If you collected her pension

299
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,320
without her permission,

300
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,720
that's called theft of someone's property.

301
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,910
We've checked,

302
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,150
and it's 42,000 yuan.

303
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,750
That's a huge amount,

304
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
enough to file a case now.

305
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,380
M-My aunt told me to keep it.

306
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,760
She's not of sound mind.

307
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,630
Did what she said count?

308
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,000
She didn't say that.

309
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,080
I-It was Lide's proposal.

310
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,830
Did he say it before he left Xuecheng

311
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,000
or after?

312
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,370
He...

313
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,390
He...

314
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,870
Why would Deng Lide

315
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,080
leave you so much money?

316
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,320
Let me tell you,

317
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,510
Deng Lide is in trouble right now.

318
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,950
We're looking for him.

319
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,630
You accepted his money.

320
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,270
If you don't cooperate with us,

321
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,920
you'll be suspected of harboring a criminal.

322
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,320
I didn't.

323
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,840
He owed me the money.

324
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,750
How much did he owe you?

325
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,750
How did he come to owe you?

326
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,670
Last time,

327
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,790
Lide came back for heart surgery

328
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,910
and borrowed over 10,000 yuan from me.

329
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,610
Over 10,000? Are you sure?

330
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,840
Y-Yes, it was over 10,000.

331
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,790
Then why did you keep 40,000?

332
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,970
He didn't get the heart surgery done last time.

333
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,730
Later, he went to Jingbei for treatment

334
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,790
and borrowed

335
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,910
over 30,000 yuan from me again.

336
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,030
So he used my aunt's pension

337
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,360
to cover the debt he owed me.

338
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,660
Which hospital in Jingbei?

339
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,550
I really don't know.

340
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,210
Where did you give him the money?

341
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,090
I gave it to him

342
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
at Jingbei Railway Station

343
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,720
last time.

344
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:15,780
When?

345
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,000
On the 20th of last month.

346
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,080
Did you see Deng Ligang?

347
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,550
Nope.

348
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,260
Well,

349
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,720
Deng Lide specifically told me

350
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,270
not to tell anyone about this.

351
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,060
So you two chatted for a while?

352
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,480
We didn't chat much. I just...

353
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,180
I just asked him where he'd been staying

354
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,510
all these years

355
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,240
away from home.

356
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,910
He told me

357
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,600
he'd probably be back home

358
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,000
by the time we got home.

359
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,800
Try harder to recall.

360
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,320
T-That's all.

361
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,240
"They'd be back home

362
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,550
by the time we got home."

363
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,910
Based on this time analysis,

364
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,630
check

365
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,000
the household registrations

366
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,000
of all people with the surname Sun.

367
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:06,440
Also,

368
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,960
check those who had heart surgery

369
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,490
on the 20th

370
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,770
in all the hospitals

371
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,350
across Jingbei.

372
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,920
Expand the age range by five years younger and older.

373
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm afraid he might have lied about his age.

374
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,200
All of them?

375
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,840
All of them.

376
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,990
Among all the males

377
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,070
with matching birthdates

378
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
in the surgeries we've looked into,

379
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,390
we didn't find Deng Lide.

380
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,150
Could it be that his surname isn't Sun?

381
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,870
Is "Sun Qiang"

382
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,960
a fake name he made up?

If we don't know his surname,

384

it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,640
I'm at the shop right now.

572
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,760
You think I don't know

573
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,510
it's running smoothly?

574
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,510
Just cut the crap and go ahead.

575
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,600
Yes!

576
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,790
That's it! You're getting

577
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,620
better and better.

578
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,330
You've improved a lot!

579
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,020
I'm a bit dizzy.

580
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,070
This last part...

581
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,580
For the final pose, I feel...

582
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,790
My weight should be put on this leg, right?

583
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,770
Yes, that's right... C'mon.

584
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,830
Lean on me.

585
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,650
Yes, chin up.

586
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,550
That's right. Lean back more, more.

587
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,310
Yes, perfect. Stretch further.

588
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:15,960
It tickles.

589
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,000
You dance so well!

590
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,000
The car is coming.

591
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,200
Bye-bye.

592
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,350
Give me my bag.

593
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:26,960
Be careful.

594
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,680
See you next week.

595
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,510
Bye-bye.

596
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,400
Sir...

597
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,400
Keep dancing.

598
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,160
How long

599
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,560
does it take you

600
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,640
to make someone

601
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,160
good at dancing?

602
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,480
Well, it

603
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,830
depends on everyone's aptitude.

604
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,440
With good potential,

605
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,400
it would take less time.

606
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,000
If she has good potential...

607
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,240
If you take someone like her

608
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,160
to your home for tutoring,

609
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,000
how much

610
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,700
do you charge per lesson?

611
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,470
Wait, sir...

612
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,000
Keep dancing!

613
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,270
Okay.

614
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,430
Come on, jump into it.

615
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,480
How am I supposed to jump in?

616
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,060
Just like how you usually teach her to dance.

617
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,920
Now jump into it the same way.

618
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,830
Is that enough, sir?

619
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,480
Sir, I'm sorry...

620
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,720
I'll never do it again, sir!

621
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,690
I won't dare to do it again.

622
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Sir!

623
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,150
Please spare me, sir!

624
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,750
Behave yourself from now on.

625
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,550
Sir...

626
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,560
Please let me go, sir.

627
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,920
Don't mess with me

628
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,550
ever again.

629
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,550
Welcome back.

630
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,160
Come on, wash your hands and eat.

631
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,300
You're in a good mood today.

632
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,820
I'm in a good mood every day!

633
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,350
Does it sound good?

634
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,240
What do you mean?

635
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,590
I stuffed

636
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,680
your little swan in the trunk.

637
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,550
You didn't cook him?

638
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,270
I did.

639
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,880
But I'm not sure

640
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:28,940
whether he's well-cooked or not.

641
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,170
Can you take a bite?

642
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,160
Are you

643
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,200
really not afraid of me getting angry?

644
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,030
No.

645
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:49,830
Why?

646
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,400
Because I have a son.

647
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,200
Well said!

648
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,480
Because we're family!

649
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,030
I have a beautiful wife

650
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,680
and also

651
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,710
an adorable son.

652
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,680
Right?

653
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,350
So,

654
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,160
I can't get angry.

655
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,950
I really won't get angry.

656
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,050
Aren't you afraid

657
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,970
I might resort to family violence?

658
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,350
Whatever.

659
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,610
You're not quite the same as before.

660
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,110
Have you ever seen any women

661
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,030
the same both inside and out?

662
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,310
Not the same inside and out, huh?

663
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,900
I'll strangle you to death.

664
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,070
Why aren't you the same inside and out?

665
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:54,760
What are you doing?

666
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,480
Why?

667
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,440
Let go!

668
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,400
What are you doing to my daughter? Let go!

669
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:00,840
Let go!

670
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,070
Let go!

671
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:06,790
What do you want to do?

672
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,640
What do I want to do?

673
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,440
Then what were you doing?

674
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,370
Why did you strangle my daughter?

675
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,640
Ask her what she did!

676
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,440
Ask her!

677
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,080
Let her tell you about it!

678
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,550
I don't care what my daughter did.

679
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,490
You can't fight my daughter!

680
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,850
Don't mess with me.

681
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,710
You're being unreasonable!

682
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,040
Why should I be reasonable

683
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,000
with you, Deng?

684
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,030
Deng,

685
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,110
All these years,

686
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,000
I've been living here

687
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,880
like a ghost.

688
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,100
And you expect me to be reasonable with you?

689
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,800
If you hadn't kept my daughter

690
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,590
imprisoned here,

691
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,510
I-I wouldn't have held it back until now!

692
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,680
Listen, you brat...

693
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:38,400
Come on,

694
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:38,910
daughter.

695
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,960
I'm taking my daughter,

696
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,750
my son,

697
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,820
and my grandson

698
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,480
back to Huayuan!

699
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,240
Whoever dares to take a step out of here,

700
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,940
I'll break their legs.

701
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,720
Believe it or not!

702
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,920
Are you trying to scare me?

703
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,480
I don't need you to beat me.

704
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,760
I can kill myself right now.

705
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,590
Just watch!

706
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,730
Dad!

707
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,640
Don't stop me!

708
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:58,480
Dad!

709
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,390
Let's see how you're gonna die.

710
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,070
I'll jump from here right now!

711
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:01,930
Jump! Go ahead and jump!

712
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,510
You think I don't have the guts?

713
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,730
Dad, come down!

714
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,400
Daughter,

715
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,320
don't stop me!

716
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,030
We won't!

717
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:07,690
Go ahead and jump!

718
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:08,480
Jump!

719
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,190
I'll count to three, and you jump.

720
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:10,800
One.

721
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,400
I'll jump!

722
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:11,880
Two.

723
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,320
I will!

724
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:12,880
Three.

725
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,920
Are you going to jump or not?

726
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,000
Are you going to jump or not?

727
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,070
Are you going to jump or not?

728
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,310
Come down if you're not jumping!

729
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,280
Dad!

730
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,550
Listen!

731
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,000
You talk about going back

732
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,840
to your hometown every month, all year round!

733
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,570
If you mention it ever again,

734
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,080
I'll jump down today!

735
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:26,880
I...

736
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:27,590
You jump!

737
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,400
I'm going back to my hometown!

738
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,710
If you've got the guts, just jump!

739
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,400
Stop provoking him!

740
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,760
Just jump if you've got the nerve!

741
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,070
What are you...

742
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,550
Are your legs okay?

743
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,750
Tell me.

744
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,590
If I had used all my strength

745
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,070
and strangled you to death just now,

746
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,550
what would happen?

747
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,560
Once you strangled me to death,

748
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,670
you'd soon end up in jail.

749
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:31,840
Do you believe it?

750
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,860
What a woman...

751
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,030
Do you have any true feelings?

752
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,450
Tell me

753
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,670
what true feelings are.

754
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,880
Next time,

755
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,730
don't forget to tell me when you go

756
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,590
meet the little swan again.

757
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,740
I'll keep watch for you.

758
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,150
Don't worry.

759
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,800
Next time when I go

760
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,000
meet the little swan,

761
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,590
I will absolutely not let you know.

762
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,150
Director Chen,

763
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,230
this is Captain Peng.

764
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,150
I'm Peng Zhaolin.

765
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:42,710
Hello, Director Chen.

766
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,580
Welcome to Suilu.

767
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,760
Sorry for the trouble.

768
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,160
We're all on the same side.

769
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,830
Just chill.

770
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,260
If you need anything, just say it.

771
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,320
We've been after

772
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,420
this group of culprits for years.

773
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,440
They're felons.

774
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,030
We're very familiar with their habits.

775
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,510
This time,

776
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,110
we need your help

777
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,320
to know their living conditions

778
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,190
and social networks.

779
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,280
Also, we hope you can provide us

780
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,850
with some manpower

781
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,800
to help with the arrest.

782
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,840
No problem.

783
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,510
Well,

784
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:07,560
I'll have Qiao Han

785
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,480
put aside his current work

786
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,480
to specifically assist you.

787
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,190
Feel free to make any requests.

788
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:11,940
We'll do our best to help.

789
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:12,590
Thank you,

790
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,490
thank you, Director Chen.

791
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,970
Son, just tell the teacher,

792
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,590
"Sir,

793
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,160
I like this dish.

794
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,110
Could you give me some more?"

795
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,090
The teacher will surely say yes.

796
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,700
Got it?

797
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,120
If you like that meat,

798
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,800
just tell the teacher.

799
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:39,860
Don't be afraid.

800
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:40,480
Come on.

801
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:52,840
Let's go, sir.

802
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,070
Are you alright?
