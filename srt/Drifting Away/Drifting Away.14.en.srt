[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,700
[Episode 14]

4
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,079
Qiu Feng.

5
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,550
You've changed so much.

6
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,630
So have you.

7
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,520
Let's sit.

8
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,390
Was your journey smooth?

9
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:19,829
Very smooth.

10
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,680
I didn't know what you'd like,

11
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,710
so I ordered this for you.

12
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,800
Thank you.

13
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,680
It's been

14
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,870
nine years since we last met.

15
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,770
How've you been these nine years?

16
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,870
After I was rescued,

17
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,150
I was afraid to stay at home alone,

18
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,670
so I went to Thailand as a migrant worker.

19
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,400
There, I met

20
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,180
an overseas Chinese.

21
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,990
He's very good to me,

22
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,870
so I got married.

23
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,360
I even have two kids.

24
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,120
Recently,

25
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,250
I heard that all the perpetrators were arrested.

26
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,520
The court also

27
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,610
asked me to testify as a witness.

28
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,430
I agreed.

29
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,310
There's actually

30
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,830
another huge reason why I came back.

31
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,159
I wanted to see you.

32
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,270
I wanted to see you too.

33
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,350
This is the complete opposite of what we agreed upon

34
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,460
nine years ago about never seeing each other again.

35
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,360
Yes.

36
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,920
Nine years ago,

37
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,390
we both knew nothing but fear.

38
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,160
Now,

39
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
our perpetrators are arrested.

40
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,390
We need not be scared anymore.

41
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,510
During the trial,

42
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,440
will all four perpetrators appear in court?

43
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,510
One of them

44
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,680
got cancer

45
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,750
and died in the hospital a month ago.

46
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,720
Zhen Zhen.

47
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:40,970
I consider you

48
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,120
my closest kin.

49
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,430
If it weren't for you,

50
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
I wouldn't be alive today.

51
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,920
We saved each other back then.

52
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,800
If you hadn't lifted me up

53
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,720
to that window,

54
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,750
how could I've possibly escaped

55
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,670
from such a high place?

56
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,130
There are two sides

57
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,780
to every coin.

58
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,080
Do you know what I do now?

59
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,160
I'm a cop.

60
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,190
To be honest,

61
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:16,990
if it weren't

62
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,980
for that incident,

63
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,360
I wouldn't have joined the police force

64
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,330
or arrested them

65
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,120
with my own hands.

66
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,750
When we were held captive,

67
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,860
my hands and legs were

68
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,190
tied up.

69
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,870
They didn't let me sleep,

70
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,510
eat,

71
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
or drink water.

72
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,590
They'd punch and kick me

73
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,120
when I showed the slightest disobedience.

74
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,720
Every time the wounds on my body

75
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,120
were about to heal,

76
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,700
they'd break open from another beating.

77
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,070
When they saw me bleeding non-stop,

78
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,900
they'd grab my head

79
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,680
and shove it under a running water pipe.

80
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,360
The moment I complained it was too cold,

81
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,190
they'd come and kick me hard,

82
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,120
saying if I don't shut up,

83
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,680
they'd burn me dead

84
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,120
with boiling water.

85
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,360
In the winter of 2003,

86
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,830
Deng Ligang's gang kidnapped me

87
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,430
in Luancheng.

88
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:54,830
When they

89
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,680
realized my parents

90
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:57,950
had called the cops,

91
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,190
they decided to kill me.

92
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,870
I proved to her with my actions

93
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,630
that a blade

94
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,750
is indeed sharper than words.

95
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,240
She even bragged to me,

96
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,430
saying this bracelet

97
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,820
was her family heirloom,

98
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,610
so I didn't sell it.

99
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,220
I-I didn't kill Huang Ying.

100
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,960
I said those things to the two of them

101
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,880
just to

102
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,080
scare them.

103
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,980
All these years,

104
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,750
I've also been a victim myself.

105
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,360
They...

106
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,030
They held a knife to my throat

107
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,170
and forced me to bring the girls back.

108
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,060
I had no choice.

109
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,080
Then did you know

110
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,750
what'd happen to the people

111
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,120
you brought back?

112
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,600
I really didn't know.

113
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,950
From the first time you assisted Deng Ligang,

114
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,480
Shi Bi,

115
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,080
and Ji Dashun in luring victims to them,

116
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,660
which resulted in their deaths,

117
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,150
your actions

118
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,300
have directly led to the wrongful deaths

119
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,270
of multiple victims

120
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,080
in many places

121
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,820
like Yanhui City, Xuecheng, and Jintai.

122
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,840
I never once laid a hand on them.

123
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,720
They're both still alive.

124
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,840
How does that prove

125
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,880
you didn't kill anyone?

126
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,840
You are a murderer!

127
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,390
You must die.

128
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,140
You must die!

129
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,750
Order.

130
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,000
The prosecution may continue questioning the defendant.

131
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,760
It was precisely because Zhen Zhen

132
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,540
and Qiu Feng managed to escape

133
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,480
that your criminal gang

134
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,550
fled from Luancheng

135
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,960
and stopped committing crimes.

136
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,030
The two of them

137
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,290
are direct witnesses

138
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,120
to your crimes.

139
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,800
Defendant Deng Ligang,

140
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,910
did Song Hongyu

141
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,500
participate in the murders?

142
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,600
No.

143
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,040
Shi Bi and I

144
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,630
forced her to do all those things

145
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,720
at knifepoint.

146
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,230
Defendant Shi Bi,

147
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,180
did Song Hongyu participate

148
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,760
in any of the murder processes?

149
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,550
No.

150
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,910
Order.

151
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,790
Court is adjourned.

152
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,930
When will

153
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,990
the verdict be out?

154
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,270
The trial has been concluded.

155
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,630
The verdict will be out at a later date.

156
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,720
I'll keep you informed.

157
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,590
Will Song Hongyu

158
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,150
be sentenced to death?

159
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,510
Based on the evidence admissable in court,

160
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,750
it's hard to say.

161
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,960
When we were held captive,

162
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,120
she admitted it herself.

163
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,910
But now she insists

164
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,730
that it was all made up

165
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,600
to scare us.

166
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,360
Don't worry, Qiu Feng.

167
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,820
I promise you

168
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,440
she'll get the punishment she deserves.

169
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:42,870
Let's go.

170
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,190
Don't miss your plane.

171
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,320
The defendant Deng Ligang

172
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,720
is found guilty of intentional homicide,

173
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,270
rape,

174
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,310
and kidnap.

175
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,030
He is sentenced to death

176
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,200
and deprivation of political rights for life.

177
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,000
The defendant Shi Bi

178
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,000
is found guilty of intentional homicide

179
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,140
and kidnap.

180
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,670
He is sentenced to death

181
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,820
and deprivation of political rights for life.

182
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,270
The defendant Song Hongyu

183
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,910
is found guilty of kidnap

184
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,550
and intentional injury.

185
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,670
She is sentenced to life imprisonment

186
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,630
and deprivation of political rights for life.

187
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,410
I want to appeal.

188
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
I want to appeal.

189
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,150
Mentor.

190
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,480
Song Hongyu's verdict is out.

191
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,520
It's abominable that

192
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,390
she gets to live.

193
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,960
But

194
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,120
those people testified

195
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,200
that she didn't kill Huang Ying.

196
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,160
She did.

197
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,200
Where's the evidence?

198
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,600
Don't play dumb.

199
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:22,760
They agreed on

200
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,640
a false account

201
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,840
so her son wouldn't lose his mom.

202
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,930
We are law enforcers.

203
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,510
Everything

204
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,160
needs to be backed up by evidence,

205
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:30,920
right?

206
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,030
I'm a law enforcer.

207
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,960
But I was also a victim.

208
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,760
What about the torture and abuse

209
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,550
I suffered,

210
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
my nightmares every night,

211
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,670
and my psychological trauma?

212
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,270
Just a false account

213
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,240
from

214
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:52,910
those bastards

215
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,000
and that's it?

216
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,870
I know.

217
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,050
She killed Huang Ying.

218
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,910
She did!

219
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,090
She told me herself!

220
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,890
Evidence.

221
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,750
Evidence, evidence.

222
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,920
What's wrong?

223
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,720
Our girl hasn't

224
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,290
come out of her room once.

225
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,600
She hasn't eaten.

226
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I made radish and pork rib soup for her.

227
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,420
Why don't you bring it in to her?

228
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,420
It's okay, it's okay.

229
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,550
She has grown up.

230
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,910
She has a mind of her own.

231
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,430
Give her some space.

232
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,030
Eat up.

233
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,230
No thanks.

234
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,880
Then I won't eat either.

235
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,670
Listen.

236
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,110
There's an ironclad rule in my team:

237
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,920
Don't let conflicts fester overnight.

238
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,310
I know

239
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,240
you need closure.

240
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,000
But

241
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,790
that takes time.

242
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,200
When I said Song Hongyu killed Huang Ying,

243
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,270
you asked me for evidence.

244
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,720
Now Deng Ligang's gang said

245
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,440
she didn't kill anyone.

246
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,250
Do they have evidence?

247
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,750
They don't need evidence.

248
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:17,880
You do.

249
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,560
Because you're a cop.

250
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,000
The police solve cases with evidence.

251
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,600
Is this your first day on the job?

252
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,240
You're being unreasonable

253
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,680
because

254
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,060
you haven't come to terms with it.

255
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,070
You haven't walked out of the darkness yet.

256
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,270
Think about Liu Liang

257
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,790
and Qiu Feng.

258
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,610
Their appeals for retrial

259
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,680
were both rejected by the court.

260
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,480
Why did the court reject them?

261
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,640
The court has nothing against them.

262
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,520
It's due to the lack of conclusive evidence

263
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,830
that Song Hongyu committed murder.

264
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,270
The law

265
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,480
operates on evidence.

266
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:56,880
Can you

267
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,510
get over this?

268
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,110
I can't.

269
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
Then take a vacation.

270
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,790
I'm not in the mood for a vacation.

271
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,120
It's not up to you.

272
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,920
I'm telling you to.

273
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,000
This is an order.

274
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,030
What's with that glare?

275
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,530
Something's off with you.

276
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,960
Elaborate on that.

277
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,240
You never let

278
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,480
others take a leave,

279
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,040
but you're ordering me to

280
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,240
when I don't want to?

281
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,960
Why?

282
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,590
Because I can.

283
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,240
I got it.

284
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,720
Do you want me to

285
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,030
use this vacation to find evidence?

286
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,070
No, that's not what I meant.

287
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,030
That's exactly what you meant.

288
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,550
Mentor.

289
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,370
You were relentless with

290
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,000
Deng Ligang's gang

291
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,870
for so many years,

292
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,720
painstakingly

293
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,590
scouring for leads

294
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,610
before finally arresting them.

295
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Song Hongyu's been

296
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,130
sentenced to

297
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,200
life imprisonment.

298
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,600
She can't run anyway.

299
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,400
I want to be as relentless

300
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,790
as you.

301
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,450
I'll find the evidence

302
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,550
to give the victim closure.

303
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,820
Listen to me.

304
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,180
Vacation, it is.

305
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,440
Eat.

306
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,880
I know Song Hongyu killed Huang Ying.

307
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,970
I figured Huang Ying's silver bracelet

308
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,670
will be my impetus

309
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,790
to find evidence.

310
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,200
This bracelet is handcrafted.

311
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,920
Its material and design

312
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,550
are reminiscent of ethnic minority styles.

313
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,830
We found out

314
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,310
that the bracelet was produced in the Decheng area.

315
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,350
Hello.

316
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,550
Do you know any shop

317
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,640
that makes such bracelets?

318
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,240
No, I don't.

319
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,310
Thank you.

320
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,270
Hello.

321
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,350
Have you seen any shop selling such bracelets?

322
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,080
No, no.

323
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:15,920
Thank you.

324
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,640
Hello?

325
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,260
Zhen Zhen.

326
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,720
It's me, Qiao Han.

327
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,540
I heard you went to find evidence.

328
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,160
What's up?

329
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,510
How long will you be there?

330
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,200
I haven't decided.

331
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,920
Alright, then stay safe.

332
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,500
If you hadn't come,

333
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,370
I'd have forgotten

334
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,030
that my name is Shi Bi.

335
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,680
It's only when you came

336
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,110
that I realized I was a demon.

337
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,310
A TV station wants to interview you.

338
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,400
Do you want to be on TV?

339
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,070
Interview me?

340
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,550
What for?

341
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,510
For me to go down in history

342
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,880
as one of

343
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,720
the notorious villains?

344
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,020
I'm not doing the interview.

345
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,630
The lesser the people who know me,

346
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,920
the better.

347
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,790
You've never said

348
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,590
why you killed your wife.

349
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,680
Can you come clean now?

350
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,750
At that time,

351
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,480
we wanted to get married.

352
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,590
So we did.

353
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,970
Stop tinkering with that here.

354
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,790
Hurry up and eat.

355
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,080
A grown man like you

356
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,210
always fixing these crappy things.

357
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,440
How much money can that make you?

358
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,400
I heard

359
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,800
dealing in alcohol is profitable.

360
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,750
Dealing in alcohol? Don't we need a car for that?

361
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,640
We're too broke to buy a car.

362
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,020
We could borrow from relatives and friends.

363
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,070
If that's not enough,

364
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,460
we could get a loan from the bank.

365
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,550
How much could a used car cost?

366
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,030
A loan?

367
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,310
With my mother's health now...

368
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,920
Let me consider it.

369
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,230
What's there to consider?

370
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,440
You're a grown man.

371
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,280
Other people your age

372
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,440
think about making money,

373
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,920
but you're always just considering.

374
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,200
When you're done thinking,

375
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,590
the opportunity will be gone!

376
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,240
I'm so unlucky

377
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,920
to have married a loser like you.

378
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,000
Later,

379
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,880
I got a driver's license

380
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,030
transporting

381
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,350
beer.

382
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,310
Anyway, however much I earned every month,

383
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,830
I gave it all to my wife.

384
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,750
One night,

385
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,240
while I was driving at night,

386
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,160
I received a call from the hospital

387
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,110
saying my mom was dying.

388
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,640
Now that the funeral is over,

389
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,310
let's get a divorce.

390
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:20,950
I made you

391
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,930
your favorite

392
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,170
tomato and egg noodles.

393
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,710
Shi Bi.

394
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,470
Your mother has passed away.

395
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,110
There are no more concerns.

396
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,410
Let's hurry up

397
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,680
and file for divorce.

398
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,550
Let's eat first.

399
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,960
Eating is important.

400
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,440
Didn't you see everything just now?

401
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,610
I'm with another man now.

402
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,000
I can't live with you anymore!

403
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,960
At this point,

404
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,910
you're still acting like a coward.

405
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,120
Later, Deng Ligang

406
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,350
taught me to use her phone

407
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,740
to text all her family,

408
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,920
saying she went south to do business.

409
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,200
All these years,

410
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,680
her family has been asking me

411
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,830
about her.

412
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,850
Now I can finally

413
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,160
give them an answer.

414
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,290
Do you have any wishes

415
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,840
you'd like us to help you fulfill?

416
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,000
Anyone you want to see?

417
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,880
I'm about to see my mom soon.

418
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,480
Isn't that nice?

419
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,160
Wait.

420
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,790
You...

421
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,460
Why are you here?

422
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,510
I came to discuss the case.

423
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,120
You've been searching for a week.

424
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,550
I can't let you bear the burden alone.

425
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,680
What case?

426
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,000
I don't have time to chat with you.

427
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,830
Don't be stubborn.

428
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,160
Two people searching

429
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,350
will be more efficient

430
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,590
than just one.

431
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,420
Maybe you'll find something because I'm here.

432
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,200
Who knows?

433
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,680
Hello, sir.

434
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,280
Do you know anyone

435
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,790
who makes such bracelets nearby?

436
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,350
Ask around in the town down the mountain.

437
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,430
Thank you.

438
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,400
Thanks.

439
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,270
Why did you come alone?

440
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,460
I came...

441
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,680
I didn't dare tell your mom.

442
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,080
With her health,

443
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,790
if she came

444
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,590
and

445
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,350
saw you like this,

446
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,220
I'm worried

447
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,750
she wouldn't make it back alive.

448
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,590
I feel so wronged.

449
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,160
Give me a break.

450
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,400
Wronged?

451
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,010
I watched you grow up as a kid.

452
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,240
I know you very well.

453
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,500
You've never been a good egg.

454
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,680
How could you be so cruel?

455
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,750
You killed so many people.

456
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,610
When you killed them,

457
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,750
w-what were you thinking?

458
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,900
Have you never considered

459
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,310
their fathers and mothers

460
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,360
and the pain you'd cause their families?

461
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,390
How're you wronged?

462
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,550
You don't deserve

463
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,100
to feel that way at all.

464
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,560
Let me tell you,

465
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,570
for the things you've done,

466
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,610
even multiple

467
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,720
executions wouldn't be enough.

468
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,160
Your execution has been approved...

469
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,760
for tomorrow.

470
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,510
Is there anything

471
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,030
you want to tell me

472
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,680
or inform me?

473
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
Just tell me.

474
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
Don't worry

475
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,830
about your mom.

476
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,900
She's my real aunt.

477
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,790
I promise I'll take care of her

478
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,630
like a son for you.

479
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,560
When Lide is released,

480
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,850
we'll take care of her together.

481
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,790
So, don't you wor...

482
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,660
Enough.

483
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,030
Just sit with me for a while.

484
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,240
Okay.

485
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,550
Hello.

486
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,930
Have you

487
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,160
seen this bracelet before?

488
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,960
I made this bracelet.

489
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,110
I made two of them.

490
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,570
Do you remember who you sold them to?

491
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,640
I didn't sell them.

492
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,310
I made them when I was young

493
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,110
for the woman I loved.

494
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,070
I gave them to her personally,

495
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,370
but she married

496
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,750
someone else.

497
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,110
Why?

498
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,960
Isn't this just how love goes?

499
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,290
I like you,

500
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,580
but you like him,

501
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,310
so it never ends well.

502
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,970
May I ask what her name is

503
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,240
and where she is now?

504
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,830
Her name is Yan Xiang.

505
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,030
She died last year.

506
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,270
Did she have children?

507
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,240
Yes.

508
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,110
Hello.

509
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,850
I'd like to ask you about something.

510
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:41,960
What is it?

511
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,120
[Huang Ying] [Liu Xinyuan]

512
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,070
What's wrong?

513
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,690
This bracelet is

514
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,050
the same one as the one in your photo.

515
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,760
When I was 18,

516
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,310
my mom gave my sister and me one each.

517
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,320
How did you get it?

518
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,120
Do you know my sister?

519
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
Is she your sister?

520
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,410
You really know her!

521
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,160
We haven't heard from her in ten years.

522
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,260
We filed a police report,

523
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,030
but we haven't found her all these years.

524
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,030
Her name is Yu Man, and I'm Yu Jiao.

525
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:31,960
We're twins.

526
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,000
Where's my sister now?

527
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,400
Is Deng Ligang

528
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,500
about to be executed?

529
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,640
It's just a matter of time.

530
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Don't hide it from me.

531
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,860
If it's true, just nod your head.

532
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,260
Don't think too much.

533
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,270
Focus on your rehabilitation.

534
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,860
Why do they have to

535
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,460
lock people up within four walls?

536
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,320
What's going on

537
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,650
with Deng Ligang?

538
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,090
His energy is depleted.

539
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,000
He can't stand up.

540
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,800
What?

541
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,780
Afraid you won't see me again,

542
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,480
so you came to visit?

543
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,230
Let's never meet again.

544
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,780
Can't we have a filling

545
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,400
with both meat and vegetables?

546
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,430
Is it that tough to make another one

547
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,110
with chives and eggs?

548
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,480
Gosh, you're such a baby.

549
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,190
I'll fry some chives and eggs later. Happy?

550
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,160
And your favorite stewed green beans,

551
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,070
triple stirfry,

552
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
pork balls with gravy, braised pork belly,

553
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,180
and fried hairtail. Is that enough?

554
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,250
Are we running a restaurant?

555
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,970
The two of us

556
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,710
can't finish all that.

557
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,760
Who said it's just us two?

558
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,590
What do you mean?

559
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,800
They're here.

560
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,760
Coming!

561
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,850
Zhen Zhen, you're here.

562
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,190
Mrs. Peng.

563
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:55,880
Come in!

564
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,010
Here, I'll get that.

565
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,550
Mentor.

566
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,150
Come here!

567
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,320
Know how to make dumplings?

568
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,250
I do.

569
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,840
Qiao Han?

570
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,840
Is he the surprise you wanted to give me?

571
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,560
Of course not.

572
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,150
Go ahead.

573
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,020
Huang Ying is from Decheng.

574
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,670
Her registered name is Yu Man.

575
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,090
She has a twin sister

576
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,800
named Yu Jiao.

577
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,200
In 2002,

578
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,000
Huang Ying left

579
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,270
with a Malaysian man.

580
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,590
Her family always thought

581
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,750
that she got stuck abroad

582
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:31,560
because

583
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,750
she married him and had kids.

584
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,630
Now,

585
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:35,930
Yu Jiao has agreed

586
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,480
to cooperate with our investigation.

587
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,440
I've already settled her in.

588
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:40,800
Mentor.

589
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,800
Maybe her sister

590
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,730
could be the key to determine

591
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,510
that Song Hongyu

592
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,780
killed Huang Ying.

593
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,910
Well, good luck then.

594
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,610
Find it cold here?

595
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,360
No.

596
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,340
Not afraid of the cold?

597
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,280
Of course not.

598
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,560
That's good.

599
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,110
You're suited to be here.

600
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,860
I've already signed the papers.

601
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,630
I thought

602
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,130
you'd report to the station.

603
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,780
I didn't expect someone

604
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,920
to bring you straight to my home.

605
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,670
Huh?

606
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:26,880
What do you mean?

607
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,590
You've been transferred here?

608
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,070
Yes, soon.

609
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
Why didn't anyone tell me?

610
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,100
Should I have

611
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,100
reported it to you first?

612
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,920
You brought someone to my home

613
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,040
without reporting to me either.

614
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,230
Qiao Han.

615
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,760
Are your parents

616
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,060
also in our line of work?

617
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,320
Yes.

618
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:50,880
That's good.

619
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,150
From now on,

620
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,400
be considerate of each other.

621
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,170
Zhen Zhen

622
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,500
is stubborn

623
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,710
and bad-tempered,

624
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:01,880
but after all,

625
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,590
with her small stature,

626
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,710
she can't withstand bullying.

627
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,190
Mentor.

628
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,960
Let's eat.

629
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,360
There's a limit to both happiness and sorrow.

630
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,360
What does that mean?

631
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,920
It's just describing love.

632
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,450
Quit it already.

633
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,520
Day after day,

634
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,290
you just keep

635
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,440
working without saying a word.

636
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,190
What's the point?

637
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,000
Working on my rehabilitation

638
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,100
to reduce my life sentence to a fixed term one.

639
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,180
Reduce it year by year,

640
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,800
so I can see my son sooner.

641
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,320
Song Hongyu.

642
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,400
Someone's here to see you.

643
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,590
Who is it?

644
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,910
My trial's over.

645
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,670
Why are you here?

646
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,750
I came to see you.

647
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:36,920
I don't want to see you.

648
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,360
Take me away now.

649
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,400
You don't want to see me?

650
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,760
Then do you want to see her?

651
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,420
Do you remember me?

652
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,670
That lipstick color really suits your skin tone.

653
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,710
I haven't seen you around.

654
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,850
Are you new here?

655
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,840
I joined two days ago.

656
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,800
I'm Song Ying.

657
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,410
What's your name?

658
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,710
I'm Huang Ying.

659
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,220
Hurry up!

660
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,890
What are you doing?

661
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,360
I have customers waiting for me.

662
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,000
Those broke and stingy losers in your room

663
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,630
who don't even buy beer by the dozen?

664
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,100
Join me for a feast tonight.

665
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,230
A customer's treating.

666
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,700
Who's this generous guy?

667
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,030
The guy from yesterday. You've met him.

668
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,360
That guy with long hair and a goatee.

669
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,610
He's interested in you.

670
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,800
You know what to do tonight.

671
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,080
Sure. I'll get back to work first.

672
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:57,840
I'll be waiting for you.

673
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,550
Hurry up.

674
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,120
I can kill you, you know?

675
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,060
Go ahead.

676
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,150
Kill me.

677
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,650
I'll wait for you in hell.

678
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,510
Go to hell then.

679
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,030
Impossible.

680
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,360
Impossible.

681
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,000
Impossible.

682
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,070
Impossible.

683
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,880
You're already dead.

684
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,910
I'm not dead.

685
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,670
You're dead!

686
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,920
I'm not dead.

687
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,840
You're wrong!

688
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,320
I killed you with my own hands!

689
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,030
The person you killed wasn't me.

690
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,520
You're the one I killed!

691
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,230
The person you killed wasn't me!

692
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,550
It was you!

693
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,150
The person you killed...

694
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,750
wasn't me.

695
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,610
You're the one I killed!

696
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,190
It was you!

697
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,030
Impossible.

698
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,550
You're already dead.

699
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,400
You're already dead!

700
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,360
You finally admitted to your murder.

701
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:04,600
She's not Huang Ying.

702
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,600
She's Huang Ying's twin,

703
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:07,190
Yu Jiao.

704
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:08,680
She couldn't accept

705
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,070
the verdict you received,

706
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:11,560
so she filed for an appeal for retrial

707
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,670
to the People's Procuratorate.

708
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,760
The Procuratorate has already filed

709
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,400
for a retrial to the court.

710
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:18,800
Your case

711
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,070
will be retried.

712
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,280
Song Hongyu.

713
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,030
You will...

714
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,590
pay for everything you did.

715
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:43,710
[Song Hongyu is found guilty of intentional homicide.
She is sentenced to death and deprivation of political rights for life.]

716
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:43,710
[In the end, Song Hongyu confessed to the crime of killing Huang Ying.
After police investigation and supplementary evidence, the court reopened the trial.]

717
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:45,850
Come on.

718
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,360
Pour the drinks.

719
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,320
Cook the meat.

720
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:48,230
Fill up the glasses.

721
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,120
I'll take it.

722
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:51,880
Thank you.

723
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,190
Fellows.

724
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,110
As I always say,

725
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,130
how do you feel?

726
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,110
-I feel awesome!
-I feel awesome!

727
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,710
Maintain that feeling!

728
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,160
Captain Peng,

729
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:03,030
say a few words.

730
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:04,590
Sure.

731
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,000
It's been tough.

732
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,110
Really tough.

733
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,110
We've been working

734
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,240
on this case for a whole nine years,

735
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,960
11 months, and 21 days,

736
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:16,360
just a few days short

737
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,400
of a decade.

738
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,230
It's been so tough.

739
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:20,420
You two

740
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,250
even almost lost your lives.

741
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:25,290
I'd like to

742
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,840
especially thank Zhen Zhen.

743
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,410
She's the best.

744
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:29,960
As a witness,

745
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,670
on her first cross-provincial mission,

746
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:33,400
she reacted quickly.

747
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,140
Bold yet meticulous.

748
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,630
I can't think of any more words.

749
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,000
Let's all raise a toast

750
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:39,810
to Zhen Zhen.

751
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,190
Sure!

752
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,030
-Sure!
-Sure!

753
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,000
Come on!

754
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,290
Let me toast to everyone.

755
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:43,960
Here, here.

756
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:44,550
To Zhen Zhen.

757
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:45,320
Come on, come on!

758
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,080
Bottoms up!

759
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:46,590
Bottoms up!

760
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,030
Hui.

761
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,420
Why aren't you drinking?

762
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:55,590
Well,

763
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:56,810
someone has to stay sober,

764
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,190
right?

765
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,670
What?

766
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,110
I'll drink for him.

767
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:01,620
