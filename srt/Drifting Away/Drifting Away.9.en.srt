[Episode 9]

4
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,430
Captain Peng.

5
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,000
Zhen Zhen and her dad are here.

6
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,410
I'll talk to you later.

7
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:02,920
Okay.

8
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:06,950
Have a seat.

9
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,770
Captain Peng.

10
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,120
How's your recovery?

11
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,850
Not bad.

12
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,300
Come, have a seat.

13
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,250
Zhen Zhen, sit here.

14
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,200
Our family

15
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,680
was already going to

16
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,980
go to the train station.

17
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,920
But she wanted to

18
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:25,770
come and

19
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,790
say goodbye to you.

20
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,520
Are you going somewhere far or on a business trip?

21
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,900
We're leaving Xuecheng.

22
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,300
For a change in environment for her.

23
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,920
What do you want to say to me?

24
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,290
I actually met you before.

25
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,740
I know.

26
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,200
We met in Luancheng.

27
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,530
Not Luancheng.

28
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,370
A the hotpot restaurant on Qingtan Street.

29
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,950
You were eating

30
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,320
with a group of people.

31
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,270
What were you doing?

32
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,510
I was passing by.

33
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,090
Passing by?

34
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,150
Why did you notice us?

35
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,930
My grandpa also likes to wear leather vests.

36
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,720
Yes.

37
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:40,930
Have some water.

38
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,040
He was there too.

39
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,450
He was right beside you.

40
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,940
You have a photographic memory?

41
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,700
Don't police all have that?

42
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,200
You're not a police.

43
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,130
Thank you for coming to say goodbye.

44
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,240
This is good.

45
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,490
Have a change of environment

46
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,140
and be happy every day.

47
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,590
I don't want to leave.

48
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,040
My home is in Xuecheng.

49
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,709
I like it here.

50
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,880
When can you catch them?

51
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,540
Well,

52
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,040
keep this for me.

[Third-class Medal]

54
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,750
I swear with my honor that

55
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,810
I will catch them.

56
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,330
When that day comes,

57
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,060
you can give it back to me.

58
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,290
Everyone.

59
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:53,700
Captain Peng.

60
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,130
You must feel frustrated.

61
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,710
But this is

62
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,960
not the time to be discouraged.

63
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,870
Captain Peng.

64
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:00,800
Director is looking for you.

65
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,080
I'll go look for him.

66
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,530
-We must–
-Peng Zhaolin!

67
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:16,970
Peng Zhaolin.

68
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,670
You didn't answer my calls.

69
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,800
You didn't come looking for me when I asked for you too.

70
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,870
I can come look for you.

71
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,140
Give me some time.

72
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,230
Didn't I give you time?

73
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,890
How much time will

74
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,980
criminals like Deng Ligang give us?

75
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,920
Accept the reality.

76
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,680
The chance is fleeting.

77
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,980
If we've missed it, we've missed it.

78
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,780
Give me some time.

79
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,580
If I can't solve the case,

80
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,070
I'll resign.

81
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,830
What?

82
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,830
Are you going to bet the rest of your life

83
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,290
on whether you can catch him?

84
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,500
What about Wang Ligang and Li Lilang?

85
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,690
Peng Zhaolin.

86
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,980
I know.

87
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,120
You're angry because

88
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,270
you didn't capture the criminal.

89
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,700
We saved the hostage.

90
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,470
We can't waste time

91
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,420
and energy anymore.

92
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,420
You should think for the bureau.

93
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,260
We have so many big cases accumulated

94
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,290
in our backlog over this period of time.

95
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,200
From now on,

96
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,670
solve them one by one.

97
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,520
Don't forget.

98
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,610
You're the chief of Xuecheng's criminal police force.

99
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,920
As all the clues have led to a dead end,

100
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,480
starting tomorrow,

101
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,510
the investigation of the

102
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,450
11/03 case will be suspended.

103
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,950
Peng Zhaolin.

104
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,350
Withdraw all the

105
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,590
investigators.

106
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,540
This is not a discussion.

107
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,170
This is an order.

108
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,820
How angry are you?

109
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,360
Eating ice to cool down?

110
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,280
Excuse me.

111
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,910
Is there someone

112
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,510
called Erbiao?

113
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,310
Who are you?

114
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,740
I have an appointment with him

115
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:25,960
to view the place.

116
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,120
It's me.

117
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,900
This case is good.

118
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,650
How much can you earn a day?

119
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,270
Earn money?

120
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,630
Others use it to pay their debts.

121
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,950
It's in.

122
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,570
It's his.

123
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,420
Aren't you here to see the place?

124
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,530
Come inside.

125
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,900
It's just

126
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,260
in this condition.

127
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,590
Take a look.

128
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,070
It's still pretty spacious.

129
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,900
Originally,

130
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,830
this was my uncle's place.

131
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,480
His business lost money

132
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,950
so he's trying to

133
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,020
sell the place.

134
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,020
What are these things?

135
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,430
They're all around.

136
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,380
Didn't I tell you?

137
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,950
People who couldn't pay the rent

138
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,760
brought these over to pay off their debt.

139
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,270
To pay off their debt.

140
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,870
This condition

141
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:38,970
is not great.

142
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,400
Well, this is it.

143
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,860
It depends on what business you do.

144
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,390
I haven't decided yet.

145
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,330
Why look for a place when you haven't decided?

146
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,510
Well,

147
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,360
I'm just having a look first.

148
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,850
After looking,

149
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,250
I will think about it.

150
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,890
There's more on the second floor.

151
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,140
Do you want to see it?

152
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,630
Yes.

153
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,120
This way.

154
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,630
Erbiao!

155
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,870
What?

156
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,140
The police are looking for you.

157
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,190
What is it?

158
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,800
They're doing an ID check.

159
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,900
Come out.

160
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,190
How annoying.

161
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,660
Officer Zhang.

162
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,250
Officer Dai.

163
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,130
What is it?

164
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,040
That you two have to come here?

165
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,650
There's a roaming gang robbery.

166
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,400
What gang?

167
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,040
A roaming gang.

168
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,650
Didn't you watch the TV?

169
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,780
It's on the news.

170
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,240
No.

171
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,890
Is there anyone else in there?

172
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,030
Yes.

173
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,560
Let's go in and have a look.

174
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,510
Let's go.

175
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,230
This way.

176
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,260
This way.

177
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,300
ID, please.

178
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,500
No one else?

179
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,570
Nope.

180
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:16,800
We're off.

181
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,150
Take care.

182
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,510
Jiang! Jiang!

183
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,520
Where's the person who just came up?

184
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,430
Who?

185
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,070
The person who came to view the place.

186
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,590
Who'd view this

187
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,350
shabby place?

188
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:28,890
Quit dreaming.

189
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,590
Hey.

190
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,110
You're here very often.

191
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,010
Is it not good to take care of your business?

192
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,130
It's good.

193
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,240
Of course it is.

194
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,590
Here.

195
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,490
A pack of cigarettes too.

196
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,140
Wang.

197
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,500
You can't

198
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,750
eat instant noodles every day.

199
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,580
Every day...

200
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,110
What can I do?

201
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,860
I'm dirty poor.

202
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,610
What else can I eat?

203
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,310
You?

204
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,440
What are you cooking?

205
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,030
It smells so good.

206
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,600
Braised pork.

207
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,910
Do you want some?

208
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,200
What if your man sees it?

209
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,140
You're so dumb.

210
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,950
He can't make a sound.

211
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,120
Are you afraid of him?

212
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,140
I'm not the one who sleeps

213
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,710
with him.

214
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,700
What am I afraid of?

215
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,340
Give me a pair of chopsticks and I'll eat it.

216
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,880
Do you dare?

217
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,020
Why not?

218
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,230
Come in.

219
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:54,920
Closing your store?

220
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,890
Don't you want meat?

221
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,150
It looks good.

222
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,580
Eat.

223
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,930
You're good at cooking,

224
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,190
pretty

225
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,020
and capable.

226
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,500
Your husband

227
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,930
is so lucky

228
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,900
to be able to marry you.

229
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,740
Tell me about it.

230
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,200
What's the use?

231
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,780
People in the mountain

232
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,660
don't think so.

233
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,380
If I can't have a son,

234
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,740
no matter how capable I am,

235
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,110
I'm still a loser.

236
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,660
People always tell me

237
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,500
your husband and I look alike.

238
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,040
Is that true?

239
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,110
Well,

240
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,790
you do look quite alike.

241
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,840
Really?

242
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,650
Do you have a photo?

243
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,590
Wait a minute.

244
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,830
[Wang Jiangye]

245
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:01,780
Oh my!

246
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,960
Isn't this me?

247
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,070
I happened to have lost my ID card.

248
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,230
Lend it to me for two days.

249
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,250
What are you doing?

250
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,940
I'll help you find your man.

251
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,220
Not like I will use it to

252
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,090
borrow money.

253
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,160
Don't worry.

254
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:16,950
Just two days.

255
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,120
Why did you divorce?

256
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,470
Our personalities don't match.

257
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,930
No children?

258
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,710
My husband died three years ago.

259
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,740
I have a seven-year-old son.

260
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,580
Do you mind?

261
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,330
Let me ask you something.

262
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,550
Go ahead.

263
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,340
You are so good-looking.

264
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,650
Why did you take a liking to me?

265
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:05,790
You...

266
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,849
are different from others.

267
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,420
If you think I'm not bad,

268
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,060
let's try getting along first.

269
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,859
It's simple food.

270
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,750
You don't mind, do you?

271
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:39,860
Comrade.

272
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,270
Hello.

273
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,380
ID, please.

274
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:51,870
What's wrong?

275
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,790
-Okay, register it.
-What’s up?

276
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,790
Okay, thank you for your cooperation.

277
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,780
Take your ID card.

278
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,390
Let's go.

279
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
That was close.

280
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,660
I saw the police doing ID checks

281
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,590
from afar.

282
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,960
I hid immediately.

283
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,150
Then there were another two.

284
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,460
Fortunately, I was prepared.

285
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,830
I got an ID from Xiao Liying.

286
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,860
This is call experience.

287
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,550
Bro, look.

288
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,310
Do we look alike?

289
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,510
He just has smaller eyes.

290
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,030
It's the same as your brother today.

291
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,310
When he was viewing a place,

292
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,460
he almost ran into the police.

293
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,130
Think about what to do.

294
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:51,900
Yeah.

295
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,750
We need to think of a way.

296
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,140
Gathering together like this

297
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,580
is making us too obvious.

298
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,790
If something happens to someone,

299
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,110
we will all be captured.

300
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,180
Let's topple.

301
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,550
What?

302
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,350
Topple.

303
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,510
It's called hibernation for animals.

304
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,040
For humans,

305
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,470
it's hiding,

306
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,750
disappearing.

307
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,920
You call that topple?

308
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,580
That's called torpor.

309
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,220
Fine.

310
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,740
Think of a way.

311
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,830
Enough.

312
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:41,800
Stop talking nonsense.

313
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,350
Let's

314
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,620
go into torpor.

315
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,410
Let's split up.

316
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,420
Here.

317
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,220
Tiger's mouth.

318
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,940
Let me try.

319
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:34,940
How is it?

320
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,270
Dad.

321
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,830
Next time, cook bacon

322
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,900
instead of sausage next time.

323
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,030
Sure.

324
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,270
Peng Zhaolin.

325
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,510
You woke up at 3 a.m. again?

326
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,750
I had enough sleep.

327
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,350
Listen.

328
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,550
1 a.m. to 3 a.m. is called the ugly hour.

329
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,550
If you don't sleep during this time...

330
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,970
I'll become ugly, right?

331
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,860
Listen to me.

332
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,810
From 1 to 3 a.m.,

333
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,110
your liver is working hard.

334
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,690
If you don't sleep well during this time

335
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,860
or is unable to sleep,

336
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,390
that means you have too much liver heat.

337
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,590
You need to fix that.

338
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,990
It's my mood that needs to be fixed.

339
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,990
It'll be fine

340
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,790
after that's done.

341
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,070
Son.

342
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,310
I made you breakfast

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,180
to make you strong.

345
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,230
You're going to Jingbei for a competition tomorrow.

346
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,180
Are you confident?

348
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,380
I will definitely bring home

349
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,600
a gold medal.

350
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,940
I believe you.

351
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,020
Don't pass your pressure onto your child.

352
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,760
Ranking is not important.

353
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,190
As long as you know

354
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,790
you've done your best.

355
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,530
As for the result you want...

356
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,030
God has eyes.

357
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,810
There will be one.

[Hexi City Experimental High School]

359
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,580
All right.

360
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,070
I'll

361
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,180
see you off here.

362
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,620
Okay.

363
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,280
Go ahead.

364
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,020
Go.

365
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:19,620
Bye.

366
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:43,780
Give it to me.

367
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,460
Get a bowl of porridge.

368
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:47,420
Here.

369
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,460
Eat it while it's hot.

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:48,870
Okay, thank you.

371
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,430
Here, eat it while it's hot.

372
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:50,990
Thank you.

373
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,140
Whose is this?

374

Here.

375

Here.

Dad.

377
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,520
Can you get up there without getting off?

378
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,840
It's not Mount Everest.

379
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,860
Why not?

380
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,510
Dad!

381
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,110
Go! Go!

382
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,620
Go!

383

With all the clues have leading to a dead end,

the 11/03 case

385

has become a fish bone

386
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,900
stuck in my throat–

387
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:19,530
I can't swallow it

388
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,340
nor spit it out.

389
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,320
My life is back to normal.

390
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,900
Stop frowning.

391
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,180
If you keep frowning,

392
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,880
you will get wrinkles.

393
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,790
Have some water.

394
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,380
Your lips are peeling.

395
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,110
You just think about work

396
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,270
all day long.

397
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,090
It's all over your face.

398
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,200
Where did you go last time?

399
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,720
I didn't see you.

400
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,180
Are you going to rent this place or not?

401
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:25,940
Yes.

402
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,440
What kind of business are you going to do?

403
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,100
A billiard place.

404
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,790
There are so many tables.

405
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,590
If I throw them away,

406
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,030
it's a pity.

407
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,760
I'll open a billiard hall on the first floor.

408
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,320
Upstairs,

409
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,830
I'll open a

410
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,340
health massage place.

411
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,790
It'll be relaxing

412
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,990
both up and downstairs.

413
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,620
How long will you rent it for?

414
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,310
I haven't decided yet.

415
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,750
But let's go with

416
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,660
the rent you said last time.

417
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,270
I'll go with that.

418
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,900
I won't bargain.

419
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,700
Tell your uncle later.

420
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:07,750
Look.

421
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,790
You're doing business.

422
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,330
I'll tell my uncle for you.

423
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,510
What's in it for me?

424
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,340
When the business starts,

425
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,180
you can see

426
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,540
what you can do.

427
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,140
Do whatever then.

428
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,180
Take me upstairs.

429
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,630
Let me see how many rooms there are.

430
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,520
Let's go.

431
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,270
This way.

432
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,700
Why did the police come last time?

433
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,540
They said they were investigating

434
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,050
a roaming gang case.

435
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,700
Do they come here often?

436
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,070
Occasionally. It's annoying.

437
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,810
Raise your feet.

438
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,560
Look at how messy

439
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,100
you've made our house.

440
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,220
If don't do this, no one will.

441
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,800
I'm the only one doing things.

442
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,270
So darn lazy.

443
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,070
Turn that off!

444
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,590
Does he expect me to do this too?

445
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,550
I'm in the toilet.

446
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,900
Can't you just press it?

447
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,830
You didn't flush the toilet too?

448
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,660
The toilet is broken.

449
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,310
Don't you know?

450
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,820
Why don't you fix it then?

451
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,180
I have to do everything?

452
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,150
Can I fix the toilet?

453
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:32,940
Seriously.

454
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,460
So darn lazy.

455
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,250
Other men wouldn't let

456
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,510
their wives do anything.

457
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,630
Look at you.

458
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,750
You treat me like a babysitter.

459
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,990
Give me a hand!

460
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:53,750
Shake it.

461
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,160
The oil bottle's about to fall off

462
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,340
and you didn't even bother catching it.

463
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
Are you done talking?

464
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:03,750
No.

465
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,900
You must have nothing better to do.

466
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,420
Sick of your good days?

467
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,830
Nothing better to do?

468
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,030
I do everything

469
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,830
in this house.

470
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,110
Good days?

471
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,590
What good days?

472
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,420
Tell me.

473
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,520
You don't think

474
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,510
you're having good days?

475
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,790
What are good days to you then?

476
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,700
What are good days?

477
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,450
I want to go home!

478
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,920
I want to live a normal life!

479
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,790
I want to see my dad

480
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,570
and my brother!

481
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,070
Did you contact your family?

482
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,900
So what?

483
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,610
Who told you to?

484
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,960
Who told me to?

485
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,860
That's my dad

486
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,480
and my brother.

487
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,700
-Let me ask you one last time.
-I can contact them if I want.

488
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,750
Did you contact your family?

489
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,000
Didn't you contact your mom too?

490
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,420
I...

491
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,150
I!

492
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,070
Just so you wait!

493
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,550
Just wait...

494
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,070
I'll chop you up!

495
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,270
Today,

496
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,180
I...

497
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,250
I'll kill you!

498
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,280
Kill you!

499
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,320
Let me tell you.

500
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,860
Either you die

501
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,810
or I die.

502
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,700
Weren't you going to commit suicide

503
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,480
in the bathtub?

504
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,140
Go ahead!

505
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,000
I do want to die.

506
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,900
I'm pregnant!

507
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,350
Drink.

508
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:58,710
Since

509
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,960
it has come to us,

510
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,760
then give birth to him.

511
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,770
Aren't you homesick?

512
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,000
Bring your dad here.

513
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,990
And I'll bring my mother.

514
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,000
She kept going missing.

515
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,920
My brother

516
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,520
has just been released too.

517
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,630
He can't take care of her alone.

518
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,530
He's a loser.

519
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:49,830
How about this?

520
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,590
Let's give birth to him.

521
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,890
We can live together.

522
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,480
If we die, we all die together.

523
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,750
Lide.

524
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,820
I'm thirsty. I want water.

525
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,880
I want water.

526
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,080
Mom.

527
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:24,870
Mom.

528
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,340
Have some water.

529
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,650
Water.

530
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,340
Here.

531
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,760
Here.

532
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,920
Who are you?

533
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:54,730
Me?

534
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,190
I'm Ligang.

535
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,660
Ligang..

536
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,040
Ligang...

537
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:04,720
Li...

538
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,880
Lide!

539
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,550
Lide!

540
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,610
Come help me up.

541
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,410
What's wrong, Mom?

542
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,070
Go to sleep.

543
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,370
Go to sleep.

544
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,500
Brother?

545
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:21,660
Brother...

546
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,180
You'd dare to come back?

547
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,110
The police

548
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,060
are looking for you every day.

549
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,770
How dare you come back?

550
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,960
Pack your things.

551
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,620
I'll take you away.

552
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:33,560
What?

553
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,480
Brother.

554
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,030
Where are we going?

555
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,230
You'll know when we get there.

556
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,350
We won't be apart anymore.

557
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,040
We'll be together forever.

558
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,550
[Exit]

559
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,740
[Waiting Room]

560
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:19,990
Give it to me!

561
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:21,370
Give it back!

562
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,430
I'm going to kick you!

563
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,220
You keep messing with me.

564
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,470
You keep messing with me!

565
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:26,930
Hey!

566
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,270
How old are you?

567
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:31,920
Do you want this?

568
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:33,990
Hello?

569
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,380
Captain Peng.

570
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,100
After we withdrew the control a while ago,

571
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,950
since Deng Lide was released from prison,

572
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,390
the community center has been taking care of him.

573
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,340
Now they're saying that

574
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,990
Zhang Nianci and him have disappeared.

575
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,660
Song Hongyu's father and brother

576
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,490
are also missing.

577
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,520
Captain Peng.

578
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,700
Captain Peng?

579
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,900
You can't catch me.

580
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,590
What's wrong, Captain Peng?

581
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,220
What happened to your place?

582
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,670
I want to get a renovation.

583
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,800
My wife hasn't been

584
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,320
satisfied with the layout of this place.

585
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,220
But I didn't have the time.

586
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,820
She didn't either.

587
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:39,940
Now,

588
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,820
she's in Jingbei with our child.

589
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,660
I want to give her a surprise.

590
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,540
Please help me.

591
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,390
No problem.

592
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,010
It's nothing.

593
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,620
Just do it.

594
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,230
Bo,

595
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,880
don't get involved.

596
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,050
You just recovered from a serious illness.

597
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,700
I'm almost recovered.

598
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,090
Right?

599
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,910
If we staying around,

600
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,860
I won't be able to even walk.

601
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,550
That's right.

602
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,590
I've been wanting to return to the police force.

603
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,050
I've already recovered.

604
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,470
Thank you.

605
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:03,620
Sit.

606
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,590
Come, have a seat.

607
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,370
Let's do it.

608
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,770
Yes, let's do it.

609
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,260
Let's do it.

610
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,260
Don't worry.

611
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,630
I have one more thing.

612
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,070
Go ahead.

613
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,060
I don't want to

614
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,930
let go of Deng Ligang's case.

615
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,070
I can't let it go.

616
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,390
What did Director Jiang say?

617
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:26,990
We won't investigate it openly.

618
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,890
I will be under table.

619
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:30,930
It'll be here.

620
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,580
We work

621
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,440
while talking about the case.

622
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,110
Sure.

623
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,670
No problem.

624
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,360
Okay.

625
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,000
Tell me about the situation.

626
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,060
We've checked

627
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,240
Zhang Nianci's place

628
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,590
but we didn't find

629
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,610
any valuable clues.

630
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,310
What about over at Huayuan?

631
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,350
Our local colleagues went there too.

632
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,610
Looks like

633
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,530
the two families left in a hurry.

634
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:53,780
But no one knows

635
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,520
where they went.

636
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,680
They left together.

637
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,070
Deng Ligang and Song Hongyu

638
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,500
brought their families away.

639
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,430
They want to

640
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,070
go into hiding.

641
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,590
It's unlikely

642
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,790
that they will go to first and second-tier cities.

643
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,540
It should be in a small city

644
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,470
bad security.

645
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,660
It'd be easier for them to hide/

646
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,700
Captain Peng,

647
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,340
there are so many

648
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,260
small cities like this.

649
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,220
Hundreds of them.

650
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,610
Where should we start?

651
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:31,930
Let's do it one by one.

652
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:33,830
All of them?

653
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,910
I know.

654
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,510
It will be difficult.

655
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,030
But I can't think of any other way.

656
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,510
I understand how you feel.

657
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,110
If you don't want to do it,

658
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:48,880
you can quit.

659
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,590
I didn't say that.

660
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:51,870
I didn't say I wouldn't investigate.

661
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,550
That's not what I meant.

662
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,030
Thank you.

663
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:57,970
Here.

664
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,040
Let's start.

665
00:40:59,280 --> 00:40:59,850
Come on.

666
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,340
Come on.
