(The Last Golden Feather)

3
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,177
At last, I've found you.

4
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:25,937
It's the Silver Fox Clan.

5
00:01:33,617 --> 00:01:34,857
White-clad Immortal...

6
00:01:38,537 --> 00:01:39,577
Who exactly are you?

7
00:01:40,337 --> 00:01:41,377
Who am I?

8
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:45,897
I'm the one
who's going to seize your Xuanzhu Jade.

9
00:01:56,937 --> 00:01:57,777
Mu Lingxue...

10
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:01,857
It turns out

11
00:02:02,257 --> 00:02:03,497
that you're Bai Li.

12
00:02:03,817 --> 00:02:05,417
So what
if you've figured out my identity?

13
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:07,617
You're dying after all.

14
00:02:08,297 --> 00:02:08,977
Speak.

15
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:11,177
Where is the Xuanzhu Jade?

16
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:13,417
I won't hand it over to you
even if it costs my life!

17
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:31,017
The Xuanzhu Jade
is actually in your body.

18
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:37,177
Sneeze.

19
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:38,697
Sneeze.

20
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:44,977
Sneeze!

21
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,350
Bai Li.

22
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:10,125
You're as soft-hearted as ever.

23
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,385
But your kindness

24
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:14,305
seems just like a joke.

25
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,782
Who do you think you can save
with your sympathy?

26
00:03:17,237 --> 00:03:18,397
Yanlie's death

27
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:20,335
and the ice-sealing of our clan

28
00:03:20,537 --> 00:03:22,497
are all your doings.

29
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,825
It tells how incompetent you are.

30
00:03:55,977 --> 00:03:57,817
How come you remain powerful?

31
00:04:24,217 --> 00:04:25,057
Hang in there,

32
00:04:25,737 --> 00:04:27,017
Mu Lingxue.

33
00:04:38,217 --> 00:04:40,017
(I need to get myself another body.)

34
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:10,417
This is such a nice body.

35
00:05:23,897 --> 00:05:24,737
That woman

36
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:26,137
cherished this jade pendant,

37
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:27,110
and she always had it with her.

38
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:30,337
I think you will

39
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:32,925
find it handy eventually.

40
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:36,937
(It's actually come into use.)

41
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:54,720
(This is a strong poison
from the Silver Fox Clan.)

42
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:57,377
(If this goes on,
she will lose her life in no time.)

43
00:05:59,112 --> 00:05:59,792
(No way.)

44
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,360
You cannot die.

45
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,520
(What do I do?)

46
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,415
(What should I do?)

47
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,600
(My golden feather...)

48
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,000

Chi Yu, what are you doing?

75
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,800
Your shoes are wet.

76
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,040
