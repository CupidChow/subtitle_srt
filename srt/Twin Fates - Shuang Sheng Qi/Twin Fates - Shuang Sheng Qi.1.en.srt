No!

3
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,040
Stay back!

4
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,440
What are you doing?

5
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,800
Don't come closer.

6
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,800
Why?

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Why is this happening?

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,000
(No, until I take revenge,)

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,440
(I can't die.)

10
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,240
Blood!

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,120
Kill her.

12
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,800
Drain her blood.

13
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,760
(What's wrong with him?)

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,320
I want you to kill her

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,720
and drain her blood.

16
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,500
(The contract is sealed.
Twin cultivation took place)

17
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,500
(on the full moon night.
Whoever betrays will suffer backlash.)

18
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,380
=Episode 1=
(Please Make a Pact with Me)

19
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,800
(Mu Residence)
Traitor Mu Heng betrayed

20
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,040
Emperor's abundant grace.

21
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,480
After Lord Yi's investigation,

22
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,280
it was found

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,080
that Mu Heng had plotted rebellion.

24
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,360
His ill intent deserves death,

25
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,760
and his behavior is contemptible.

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,360
(Master Mu)
Hence, strip him of his title as Grand Tutor at once,

27
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,640
and execute his entire household

28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,200
without mercy.

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,480
Xue, run!

30
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,440
Go that way.

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,560
Faster.

32
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,400
No one in the Mu Residence
is to be spared.

33
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,240
Go search.

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,040
Hurry up, Xue.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,320
Run.

36
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,200
Mother.

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,480
No matter what happens,

38
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
don't look back.

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,800
(Mu Lingxue)
You must survive.

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,760
Go, Xue.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,800
Over there.

42
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,840
Get her.

43
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,180
(Madam Mu)

44
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,000
Mother.

45
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,200
Stand right there.

46
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,680
Over there.

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,600
Run, Xue!

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,920
Now!

49
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,560
Mother.

50
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,360
Search the room.

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,800
Where is she?
There must be a secret passage here.

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,160
The lord wants her alive.

53
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,790
Search around.

54
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,640
It's her.

55
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,760
The red-haired woman.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Red hair is an ill omen.

57
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,400
Burn her!

58
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,560
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,240
- Burn her!

60
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,880
- Burn her!

61
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,280
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

62
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,280
What are you doing?

63
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,080
Release me.

64
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,840
She broke into the village.

65
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,080
She'll bring disaster on us.

66
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,080
That's right.
She must be a harbinger of doom.

67
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,680
If she stays,

68
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,640
our village will be doomed.

69
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,080
We can't let her stay.

70
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,880
Burn her as tribute to Heaven.

71
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,160
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

72
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,320

- Burn her!
- Burn her!

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,680
No!

76
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,360
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

77
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,000
No!

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,640

Deity! The deity is here.

88
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,480
The deity is here.

89
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,160
- The deity descends!
- The deity descends!

90
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,100
- Greetings, Heavenly Deity!
- Greetings, Heavenly Deity!

91
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,880
(It's the Divine Beast Phoenix.)

92
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,301
(Chi Yu)
(Legend has it that if a human)

93
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:30,400
(Chi Yu)
makes a pact with a divine beast,)

94
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,440
(the beast will grant one wish.)

95
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,600
Help me.

96
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,480
(Xuanzhu Jade?)

97
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
(I'm saved.)

98
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,000
Speak up.

99
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,680
Where is the Xuanzhu Jade?

100
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,080
I don't know any Xuanzhu Jade.

101
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:06,517
I saw the Xuanzhu Jade on you
with my own eyes.

102
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,720
Don't try to trick me.

103
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,600
I have ways to make you suffer.

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,080
If you tell me
where the Xuanzhu Jade is.

105
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,800
I don't know anything about it.

106
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,320
If you don't talk,

107
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,200
you must die.

108
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,320
(Xuanzhu Jade is really inside you.)

109
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,560
You're a Wangshu Vessel.

110
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,880
(I really have the Xuanzhu Jade
inside me?)

111
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,240
(Could this be why)

112
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,920
(I was born with red hair?)

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
(Great.)

114
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,840
What are you trying to do?

115
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,200
I'll use you as a sacrifice.

116
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,720
Let go.

117
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,880
To save my clan.

118
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,640
(What's going on?)

119
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,960
Impossible.

120
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,040
You clearly have
the Xuanzhu Jade on you.

121
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,640
Why won't it return?

122
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,040
(How come?)

123
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,600
(What is this?)

124
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,480
(All things return to their place.)

125
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,600
(To offer me a heart,)

126
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,640
(it must be a willing sacrifice,)

127
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
(so that the jade could return
to its place.)

128
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,480
I can

129
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,800
offer myself willingly.

130
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,120
You want the Xuanzhu Jade
inside my body, don't you?

131
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,920
How about

132
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,840
we make a deal?

133
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,760
Who do you think you are

134
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,280
to bargain with me?

135
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,560
Didn't you just try?

136
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Sacrifice needs my consent.

137
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,520
My entire family was massacred.

138
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,120
I was nearly burnt
in a sacrificial rite.

139
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,200
I will not die in peace

140
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,440
until I avenge them.

141
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,000
If you help me get revenge,

142
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
I'll sacrifice myself willingly

143
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,280
and let the Xuanzhu Jade return.

144
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,240
I don't make deals with lowly humans.

145
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Mu Lingxue.

146
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,800
Even if you have to kneel,

147
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,080
you must survive.

148
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,300
(On the full moon night, human and deity
combine to make a Twin-soul Contract.)

149
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,240
(Please)

150
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,440
