(Birthday Celebrations)

3
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,320
My skills are not yet refined.

4
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,640
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

5
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,280
Iron trees bloom with silver flowers.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,320
A thousand stars light up the sky.

7
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,400
Your craft has won my heart.

8
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,400
Huh? What's the matter, Chi Yu?

9
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:20,960
Chi Yu?

10
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,120
What's gotten into you, Chi Yu?

11
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,720
You really put on a grand show.

12
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,440
Facing your enemy,

13
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,120
you spare their life

14
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,120
and instead put on a show of charm.

15
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,680
Chi Yu, I wish you health and happiness

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,990
on this Lantern Festival
and your birthday.

17
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,460
Congratulations to you,
Scarlet Flame Lord of War,

18
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,860
on a joyous Lantern Festival
and birthday.

19
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,600
I've heard the Scarlet Flame lands

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,800
once bloomed with iron fireworks.

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,920
Though I never saw it myself,

22
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,080
that performance was the closest

23
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,000
I could imagine.

24
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,840
Do you like this birthday gift?

25
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,960
Thank you.

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,680
You're not upset anymore?

27
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,880
I still can't stand to see you

28
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,440
flattering and bending

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,800
to your enemies.

30
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,720
Ji Yuchen can't die yet.

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,480
He sentenced your whole family to death.

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,320
My father
was falsely accused of treason.

33
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Why should I prove his guilt

34
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,080
by killing the emperor?

35
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,760
I want justice and vengeance
for spilled blood,

36
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,680
but more than that,
I want justice to be restored.

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,360
Why do you think
he would clear your name?

38
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,880
I'm powerless

39
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,600
and insignificant.

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,280
Without trust or help,

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,400
how can I clear the Mu Residence's name?

42
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,600
That's why I have
to get close to Ji Yuchen,

43
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,080
use his power

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,560
to uncover the truth

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,280
and expose the real culprit

46
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,600
behind the Mu family's tragedy.

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,280
Do you trust me?

48
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,240
I do.

49
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,480
Peace and reunion to all

50
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,280
on the Lantern Festival.

51
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,880
Peace and reunion to all

52
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,800
on the Lantern Festival.

53
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,400
I haven't had

54
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,560
the wheat cakes this year.

55
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,640
My mother used to make the best.

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
I'll never taste them again.

57
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,560
(Lord Yi's Residence)

58
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,680
Chi Yu.

59
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,640
For you.

60
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,200
What's this?

61
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,520
These are wheat cakes.

62
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,520
Leave the items and go.

63
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,880
Thank you, sir! Thank you!

64
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you, sir! Thank you!

65
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,280
Is this

66
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,440
a phoenix?

67
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,400
Yes.

68
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,200
Wait, Chi Yu!

69
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,480
Chi Yu! Chi Yu.

70
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,440
Chi Yu. Chi Yu!

71
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,080
You can't take back a gift.

72
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
I'll eat it.

73
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,360
Give it to me.

74
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,520
Give it to me!

75
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,360
Chi Yu, I want to eat it.

76
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,800
Chi Yu,

77
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,600
come on. Give it to me.

78
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,320
(Lord Yi's Residence)

79
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,600
Foreign envoys brought a batch

80
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,990
of exquisite thousand-layer silk
as a tribute for the Lantern Festival.

81
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,840
His Majesty specifically ordered us

82
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,960
to tailor garments for Your Highness.

83
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,800
Your Highness is very sensitive.

84
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,840
I believe it's time

85
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,120
to take your waist measurements?

86
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,240
Yes.

87
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,280
Her waist measures
one chi and eight cun.

88
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,480
Her shoulders span two palms.

89
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,520
Feng has a keen eye.

90
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,200
I'm ticklish,
so I don't like being touched.

91
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,320
He's been reporting
my measurements for years for me.

92
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,760
If there is any falseness,

93
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,920
you will be guilty of deceiving me.

94
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,520
Her bust measures two chi and eight cun.

95
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,560
Anything else you need to know?

96
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,080
Brother, I used to roam alone
in dangerous places.

97
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,080
Feng's actions were unintentional.

98
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,400
Please don't mind him.

99
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,440
I need to check the files
in the archives.

100
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,960
Let's call it a day.

101
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,040
Why do you insist
on provoking Ji Yuchen?

102
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,520
I need his help

103
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,560
to reopen the Mu Residence case.

104
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,600
It's just to check a file.

105
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,200
I could help you myself.

106
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Why must you get Ji Yuchen's permission?

107
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,120
Are you jealous?

108
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't have

109
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,360
such silly human emotions.
