=Twin Fates=

2
00:00:35,456 --> 00:00:38,356
=Episode 8=
(Lord Yi and Ji Yuanying's Doomed Day)

3
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,680
His Majesty arrives.

4
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,200
Qingci,

5
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,480
I've come to see you.

6
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,760
I'm coming in.

7
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:52,280
All right, Your Majesty.

8
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,360
Qingci,

9
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,560
I had the imperial physician

10
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,920
prepare this herbal censer.

11
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,000
It helps restore your health.

12
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,440
Qingci,

13
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,640
are you running a fever?

14
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,000
Why are your lips so red?

15
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,120
I'm too worried about you.

16
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,720
Sorry, I'm being too forward.

17
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,120
Thank you for your concern,
Your Majesty.

18
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,200
I'm fine.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,720
"Thank you for your concern,
Your Majesty?"

20
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,360
Go now.

21
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,720
What's wrong?

22
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Is there something

23
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,440
on me?

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,520
No.

25
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,320
What are you doing?

26
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,400
Your Majesty,

27
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,960
it's time to take a medicinal bath.

28
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,120
Your Majesty...

29
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,200
All right.

30
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,560
Take care.

31
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,920
I'll visit another day.

32
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,640
Who cares about this?

33
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,520
You finally came.

34
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,440
Hurry and get me out.

35
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,440
I want to kill that wretch.

36
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,160
It's useless even if I get you out now.

37
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,040
You can't kill her.

38
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,680
What do you mean?

39
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,240
Are you not helping me?

40
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,280
How could I not?

41
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,240
I told you.

42
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,920
Jealousy makes you beautiful.

43
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,480
I brought you something
from the White-Clad Immortal.

44
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,440
It makes people speak the truth.

45
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,600
Her guard isn't ordinary.

46
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,920
I'll deal with him for you.

47
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,240
Our feud

48
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,640
can't be settled easily.

49
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,120
No matter the cost,

50
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,920
I'll drag you into the abyss.

51
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,600
She took it?

52
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,720
Yes, Master.

53
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,640
I believe

54
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,560
that woman has already taken it.

55
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,880
Who would have thought

56
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,000
her jealousy was so strong?

57
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,440
But one person's jealous spirit

58
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,720
won't sustain your body.

59
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,840
Your Silver Fox scent is leaking.

60
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,240
You must find a new host
as quickly as possible.

61
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes, Master.

62
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
(Lord Yi is indeed a corrupt official.)

63
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Miss Qingci, Lord Yi sends for you.

64
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,000
All right.

65
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,440
Father.

66
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,760
You're here too, Yuanying.

67
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,320
You're out now.

68
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,240
After all,

69
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,680
blood is thicker than water.

70
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,800
Save that fake sympathy.

71
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,400
Father,

72
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,000
she came to me and forced me to reveal
the secret account.

73
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,480
I found it strange

74
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,240
and feared she might harm
Lord Yi's Residence,

75
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,920
so I asked this of the White-clad Immortal.

76
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,120
(White-clad Immortal?)

77
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,480
(Is there a hidden hand behind this?)

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,360
What are you talking about?

79
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,360
What White-clad Immortal?

80
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,240
What secret account?

81
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,920
I've never heard of any of this.

82
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,760
I knew you always had a way with words.

83
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,360
Seeing you now,

84
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,120
you're good at distorting the facts.

85
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,840
But

86
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,880
this will make you speak the truth.

87
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,480
It's called Truth Serum.

88
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Whoever drinks it,

89
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,240
no matter how eloquent they can be,

90
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
can only speak the truth.

91
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,440
Father, aren't you afraid
Yuanying might poison me?

92
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,760
I had it tested.

93
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,840
It's safe.

94
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,920
But it makes one

95
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,280
speak without hiding.

96
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,880
Speak without hiding?

97
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,240
Really?

98
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,360
If you won't drink it,

99
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,480
you must be hiding something.

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,240
Even if you refuse to drink it,

101
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,000
I will force it down your throat.

102
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,600
Speak up.

103
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,600
Are you Ji Qingci?

104
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,360
Speak up.

105
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,840
Of course not.

106
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,800
Is all of this your plot against me?

107
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,680
Yes.

108
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,160
Why are you impersonating Ji Qingci?

109
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,240
My only purpose is

110
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,680
to avenge myself

111
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,600
and Qingci.

112
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,920
Father, she admits it.

113
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,960
The Silver Fox's scent may be faint,

114
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,440
but it should be in this room.

115
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,520
It's him.

116
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Very well.

117
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
You came here yourself.

118
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,160
Du Ya from the Silver Fox Clan.

119
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,080
It's you.

120
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,600
So what if you guessed it?

121
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,960
Everyone who knows must die.

122
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,400
You won't leave here alive today.

123
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,280
Qingci?

124
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,800
To avenge Qingci?

125
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,280
Where is

126
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,400
the real Qingci?

127
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,680
I saw with my own eyes

128
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,880
that Ji Qingci

129
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,480
was killed by her own sister.

130
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,400
And you killed your sister.

131
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,200
Father, that's not what she said it was.

132
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,440
Qingci slipped and drowned herself.

133
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,800
You must believe me.

134
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,320
I never said Ji Qingci drowned.

135
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,280
No.

136
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,000
Father.

137
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,440
The Truth Serum really works.

138
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,760
It makes everyone speak the truth.

139
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,720
Good.

140
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,760
I wanted to tell the truth anyway.

141
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,960
If I'd known you had such a good thing,

142
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,280
I wouldn't have wasted all this trouble.

143
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,320
You're still insolent
even at death's door.

144
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,320
You're out of tricks.

145
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,960
You still don't understand.

146
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,800
I was proven

147
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,880
to be the legitimate daughter of Lord Yi

148
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,160
before His Majesty

149
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,000
and everyone else,

150
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,560
while you were deemed a madwoman
who falsely accused her sister

151
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
out of jealousy,

152
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,680
before the Emperor and everyone.

153
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,920
Father.

154
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,760
But Father, I'm your true daughter.

155
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,680
Scoundrel!

156
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
And you too!

157
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,560
All of you have been lying to me!

158
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,720
This is bad.

159
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,120
Guards!

160
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,600
Drag

161
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,560
these two vile women away.

162
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,440
We'll just announce publicly

163
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,440
that Ji Yuanying

164
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,160
was driven mad by jealousy

165
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,480
to kill her sister, and then took her life
in fear of punishment.

166
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,440
Make sure there are no loose ends.

167
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,680
Father.

168
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,160
I knew it.

169
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,160
I knew it.

170
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,800
Nothing matters

171
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,720
but your reputation

172
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,840
and status.

173
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,720
Daughters mean nothing

174
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,680
to you at all.

175
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,720
How dare you!

176
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,760
Guards.

177
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,560
Stand back.

178
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,920
Yuanying,

179
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,960
why must it come to this?

180
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,320
I know I was wrong.

181
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,320
Put the sword down.

182
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,040
We can still be a family.

183
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,280
Father,

184
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,920
do you know you were wrong,

185
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,600
or that you're afraid?

186
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,640
No! Don't!

187
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,040
It's her.

188
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,680
Yes.

189
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,040
It's her.

190
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,560
She did it.

191
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,280
Kill her.

192
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,160
Kill her, and everything will be fine.

193
