00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,760
What did you just say?

4
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,080
I

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,360
will marry you.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,640
Great. I knew

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,120
you've

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,640
adored me.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
After all, we've been
through a lot together.

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,280
And I've always fancied you.

11
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,400
But I have one condition.

12
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,360
As long as you marry me,

13
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,840
I'll say yes

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,160
to any condition you have.

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,960
However,

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,040
I myself have one condition too.

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,960
From now on,

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,360
you cannot meet with Chi Yu again.

19
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,960
I promise you.

20
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,800
Your Majesty!

21
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,840
What are you doing, Your Majesty?

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Am I an easy woman

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,280

Fine.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,720
I'll arrange
