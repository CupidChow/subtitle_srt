(One Different Phrasing,)

3
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:38,200
=Episode 12=
(and an Entire Clan Is Executed)

4
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,480
(Confiscate their property,
search the residence, investigate.)

5
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,440
(The Mu clan must not be spared.)

6
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,200
(Every member of the Mu clan
shall be executed.)

7
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
(His Majesty hereby decrees)

8
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,840
(that every member of the Mu clan
shall be executed.)

9
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,160
Why?

10
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,920
Assets seized and investigated…

11
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,800
The entire clan executed…

12
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,440
A single phrasing change

13
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,320
cost my entire family their lives…

14
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,320
Why?

15
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,080
Heaven's justice fails.

16
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,200
If the wicked dare to wreak havoc,

17
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,000
then let their laughter

18
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,200
turn to wails.

19
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,040
(Li Cang)

20
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,240
Her Highness
destroyed an imperial edict.

21
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,280
This is a grave crime.

22
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,320
Seize her!

23
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:07,920
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

24
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,360
How dare you!

25
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,200
I'm a princess of this nation,

26
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,360
the emperor's
appointed heiress to Lord Yi.

27
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,520
Who dares touch me?

28
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,720
Our dynasty rules by law.

29
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,280
Even the emperor, if he breaks the law,
answers like any commoner.

30
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,760
Your Highness,

31
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,360
do you intend to defy the law?

32
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,240
Seize her at once!

33
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,920
Stop!

34
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,320
If the heiress to Lord Yi's guard
mounts an assassination

35
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,760
inside the palace,

36
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
by law I may have you
executed on the spot.

37
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,200
Surrender at once.

38
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,080
Chi Yu!

39
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,640
Take them both

40
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,080
to the imperial prison.

41
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,640
Yes, sir.

42
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,720
Chi Yu.

43
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Chi Yu!

44
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,600
Where are we?

45
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,520
This is

46
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,200
Li Cang's private prison.

47
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,240
He intends to silence us.

48
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,600
Don't worry.

49
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,280
I'll get you out of here.

50
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,920
Come on.

51
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,920
And where do you think you're going?

52
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,960
Li Cang,

53
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,560
you, the Imperial Preceptor,

54
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,280
are colluding with the Silver Fox Clan!

55
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,960
He is not colluding.

56
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,640
He is a member of the Silver Fox Clan.

57
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,080
If that is so,

58
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,920
I will execute you

59
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,200
here and now

60
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
for destroying the imperial edict.

61
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,160
Are you all right?

62
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,960
Curses!

63
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,400
The power of the pact is too strong.

64
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,920
I must find another host.

65
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,760
You are bestowed imperial favor,

66
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,760
yet you do not repay it.

67
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,720
Instead, you plot rebellion

68
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,480
to overturn the state!

69
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,240
Your heart is vile,

70
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,000
and your deeds are despicable!

71
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,640
"Execute every member of the clan."

72
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,800
A single line
can trample lives so easily.

73
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,800
Today,

74
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,880
I'll make you taste the pain

75
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,680
of every single word!

76
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,720
(Father,)

77
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,360
(the wicked has received his due.)

78
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,680
(Can you see this from above?)

79
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,240
You've done it.

80
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,880
He's dead.

81
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,920
I'll borrow your body for now.

82
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,680
I thought

83
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,680
that once the edict resurfaced,

84
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,760
the Mu Residence's injustice
would be cleared.

85
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,120
I never imagined Li Cang

86
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,680
would dare burn the edict
without reservation.

87
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,280
Now,

88
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,000
the evidence is nothing but ash.

89
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,080
Reopening the Mu Residence case

90
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,000
will be even harder.

91
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,040
What exactly is the Xuanzhu Jade?

92
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,840
Why does everyone want it?

93
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,640
A hundred years ago,

94
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,600
the Scarlet Flame Clan of the north,
descended from the phoenix deities,

95
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,440
held the earth's fiery veins.

96
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,480
I was a general
of the Scarlet Flame Clan,

97
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,720
raised alongside Yanlie,
the king of our clan.

98
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,520
The Scarlet Flame and Silver Fox clans
were long at war.

99
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,280
To end the war,

100
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,080
I urged Yanlie to seal the peace

101
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,600
with a marriage to Princess Bai Li
of the Silver Fox Clan.

102
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,920
We walked right into Bai Li's trap.

103
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,800
Our peaceful life ended

104
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,080
with the arrival of the princess.

105
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,200
I lost my divine power

106
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,160
and could no longer
feel human suffering.

107
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,200
The Xuanzhu Jade is
the Scarlet Flame Clan's sacred relic,

108
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,240
the artifact that seals
the evil spirit An Sha.

109
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,880
Because of that,
it holds the sun deity's power.

110
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,640
Whoever possesses the Xuanzhu Jade

111
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,280
holds the sun deity's might.

112
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,200
All of this happened because of me.

113
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,000
I trusted the enemy, and I was mistaken.

114
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,680
Rest assured.

115
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,000
I will honor our pact,

116
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,760
return the Xuanzhu Jade to its place,

117
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,080
and revive your people.

118
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,920
Do you understand?

119
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,480
Your body will become

120
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,760
the Wangshu Vessel
to hold the Xuanzhu Jade.

121
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,520
Even in death, you'll feel

122
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,400
the jade's burning, suffering

123
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,920
until your spirit is completely gone.

124
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Aren't you afraid?

125
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,440
I'm not.

126
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,400
I'm prepared for it.
