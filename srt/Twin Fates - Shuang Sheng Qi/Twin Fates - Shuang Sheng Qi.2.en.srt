(Do Not Hurt Me, Lord Divine Beast)

3
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,400
Run!

4
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,880
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

5
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,320
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,280
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

7
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,080
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

8
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,820
(On the full moon night, man and deity
combine to make a Twin-soul Contract.)

9
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,200
(On the full moon night,)

10
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,840
(human and deity combine
to make a Twin-soul Contract.)

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,600
(I am as lowly as grass.)

12
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,800
(But no prairie fire
can destroy the grass,)

13
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,520
(it shoots up again
when the spring breeze blows.)

14
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,240
Please make a pact with me.

15
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,240
Make a pact with you?

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,160
You don't deserve it.

17
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,520
I will do anything

18
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,560
you say.

19
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,800
Please.

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,680
Please?

21
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,800
Don't leave this place.

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,680
I'll find a way to remove
the Xuanzhu Jade from your body.

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,160
(Legend has it)

24
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,960
(that the Divine Beast Phoenix)

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,520
(loses his mind
on the night of the full moon.)

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,040
(At that time,
his power is at his weakest.)

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,920
(After tonight,)

28
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,520
(I'll lose my chance.)

29
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
What are you up to?

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,920
(Why is there no reaction?)

31
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,720
(How can we form a pact?)

32
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,920
What are you doing?

33
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,920
Stay back.

34
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,400
(No.)

35
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,560
(He's lost his mind.)

36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,600
(I must control him.)

37
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,680
Make a pact with me.

38
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,520
I'll give you

39
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,320
whatever you want.

40
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,760
(A pact?)

41
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,800
(Make a pact with her,)

42
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,320
(and save the clan.)

43
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,000
Blood?

44
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,600
Kill her.

45
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,640
Drain her blood.

46
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,000
(What's wrong with him?)

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,840
(Kill her.)

48
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,680
(Kill her!)

49
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,000
(No matter what the price is,)

50
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,480
(I must avenge the Mu family.)

51
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,080
(What's going on?)

52
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,920
(How can this woman)

53
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,120
(seal my power?)

54
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,020
(The contract is sealed.
Twin cultivation took place)

55
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,020
(on the full moon night.
Whoever betrays will suffer backlash.)

56
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,080
A union between a human and a deity,

57
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,120
Twin-soul Contract.

58
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,200
You can no longer harm me.

59
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,240
Do you understand,

60
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,240
Lord Divine Beast?

61
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,820
(Ji Yuchen, Ji Xinwu, Ji Yuanying)

62
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,040
(What is this?)

63
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,480
How dare you attack me
while I was meditating?

64
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,920
I'm just a lowly human.

65
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,320
How could I possibly
take advantage of your weakness?

66
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,720
It was just a night
full of uncertainties.

67
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,760
A lonely man and woman

68
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,560
who came together willingly.

69
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,240
Shut it.

70
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,400
You're courting death.

71
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,440
(Ji)

72
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,200
You should carve one for yourself.

73
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,800
Soon.

74
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,520
But they'll have to die one by one
by my hand first.

75
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,600
I decide when that will be.

76
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,080
I won.

77
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,880
From now on, we're bound
by the Twin-soul Contract.

78
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,800
Hurting me is hurting yourself.
We share the pain.

79
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,680
So what?

80
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,920
I can't feel pain like humans do.

81
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,400
How shameless.

82
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,240
Humans will do anything
to get what they want.

83
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,680
We are both bound
by the Twin-soul Contract.

84
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,680
You can't hurt me.

85
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,200
(Kill her.)

86
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,560
(Drain her blood,)

87
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,080
(and the Xuanzhu Jade can be destroyed.)

88
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,560
No.

89
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,760
I need the Xuanzhu Jade
to save the Scarlet Flame Clan.

90
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
(What's wrong with him again?)

91
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,840
(You're the one who caused them
to be frozen in ice.)

92
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,760
(Even if you save them,)

93
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,080
(will they forgive you?)

94
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,560
(If it wasn't for you
to hold my evil soul,)

95
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,240
(you would've frozen to death too.)

96
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,600
(You should destroy the Xuanzhu Jade)

97
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,160
(and ascend with me.)

98
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,800
(Chi Yu,)

99
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,960
(you fool.)

100
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,000
(You actually made a pact
with a mortal.)

101
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,080
I told you.

102
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,680
You can't kill me

103
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,720
because of the Twin-soul Contract.

104
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,920
Lowly human.

105
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,840
Do you have no family left either?

106
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,680
Where are you taking me?

107
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,440
Can my blood melt the ice?

108
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,080
(Why is there no effect?)

109
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,040
It's useless.

110
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,640
Get out.

111
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,160
You shouldn't be here.

112
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,680
Why did they...

113
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,360
Scram.

114
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,160
Don't make me repeat myself.

115
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,480
Let's cooperate.

116
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,040
You help me take revenge,

117
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,640
and I'll sacrifice myself willingly.

118
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,040
Three months from now,

119
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
on the Day of Xihe,

120
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,480
return the Xuanzhu Jade to its place

121
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,760
and save your clan.

122
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,960
If not, the Scarlet Flame Clan
will suffer in the ice forever.

123
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Are you threatening me?

124
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,880
You're the high and mighty
Phoenix Divine Beast.

125
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,880
Don't you even
have the courage for that?

126
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,560
Does repenting in front of your people

127
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,040
solve the problem?

128
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,240
I will not cooperate with anyone again.

129
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,080
I'm warning you, keep your place,

130
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,720
and you may live a little longer.

131
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,840
(Back then, I trusted the Silver Fox
Clan and worked with them,)

132
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,160
(that's why the Xuanzhu Jade
fell out of place.)

133
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,480
(I will never repeat that mistake.)
