(The Death of Chi Yu)

3
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,160
Since you want the Xuanzhu Jade so bad,

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,920
I shall return your favor

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,560
with its flame!

6
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,480
No! Chi Yu, no!

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
Stop it!

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,800
If I die,

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,600
you will perish too!

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,560
If I can

11
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:09,966
save the world

12
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,640
by defeating an evil demon like you,

13
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,120
there's nothing to be afraid of.

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,880
No! No!

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,960
Chi Yu!

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,720
Chi Yu!

17
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,320
Chi Yu!

18
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,600
Chi Yu!

19
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,560
Chi Yu!

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,400
It's alright.

21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,880
You're safe now.

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,200
Everything's fine now.

23
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,360
It's alright.

24
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,480
Why is the Xuanzhu Jade in you?

25
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,400
Have you thought it through?

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,200
There's a twin-soul contract
between us.

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,280
Only by moving the Xuanzhu Jade into me

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,480
can she live.

29
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,040
But you're not the Wangshu Vessel.

30
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,680
According to the secret technique
mentioned in the Scarlet Flame Holy Book,

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,320
a divine beast
must destroy its divine bone

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,320
to obtain the mortal Wangshu Vessel.

33
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,040
(The Xuanzhu Jade is way too powerful.)

34
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,720
(Even though
you have the twin-soul contract,)

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,640
(in the end,)

36
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,600
(you will still perish.)

37
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,560
(This is the only way)

38
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,320
(to disperse the Xuanzhu Jade's energy)

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
(and have
the invincible evil spirit of An Sha)

40
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,680
sealed completely.

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,700
That way, the Scarlet Flame Clan
which has been sealed in ice

42
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,680
will be released too.

43
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,920
That incident
has always been a thorn in my flesh.

44
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,880
(I didn't manage to stop
the Silver Fox Clan's plot.)

45
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,280
(And I've done everyone wronged.)

46
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,320
(This thorn has been tormenting me
all these years.)

47
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,200
(I'm tired.)

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,480
(I want to remove this thorn.)

49
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Please help me.

50
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,480
We're safe now.

51
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,120
Chi Yu, are you alright?

52
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,240
Let's tend to your wound first.

53
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,600
Chi Yu, are you feeling better?

54
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,440
Chi Yu?

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,720
Chi Yu?

56
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,800
Chi Yu!

57
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,800
Chi Yu!

58
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,080

59

60
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,400

Please don't...

63
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,320
Give... Give me the Xuanzhu Jade now.

64
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,480
Hurry.

65
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,360
I... I will fulfill our promise

66
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,200
and unseal your clan members.

67
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,240
