(The Emperor's Nightmare)

3
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,440
Chi Yu.

4
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,520
Take the concoction first.

5
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,100
It's hot. Let me blow on it for you.

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,240
Are you alright?

7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,480
You're even feeding me the concoction.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,600
I'm all fine.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,680
Since the gas

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,840
was removed from my body,

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,320
I've felt much better.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,640
Here, eat the concoction.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,360
Go ahead.

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,760
His Majesty has arrived.

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,000
Qingci.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,160
I've brought you a treasure.

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,960
What's happened to you?

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,640
I've accidentally caught a cold.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,760
Leave it to me.

20
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,320
Just the right temperature.

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
Your Majesty, are you alright?

22
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,360
I'm good.

23
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,040
It was the wind.

24
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,320
Yuchen,

25
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,520
I'm a bit sleepy.

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,120
Fine.

27
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,560
Get some rest now.

28
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,080
Sure.

29
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,120
Let me see you out, Yuchen.

30
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,480
Forget about it.

31
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,400
Take some good rest.

32
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,520
Just the right temperature?

33
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,920
It's gone cold.

34
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,200
Master.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,720
What is it with you?

36
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,280
It's nothing.

37
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,200
I thought of manipulating Chi Yu's body

38
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,800
with the Soul-Pulling Spell.

39
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,440
Unexpectedly, it backfired.

40
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,720
But it's alright.

41
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,640
I've found myself

42
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,280
a more suitable subject.

43
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,000
Yuchen.

44
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,520
You like Ji Qingci, right?

45
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,480
That's right.

46
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,760
However,

47
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,840
she's your sister.

48
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,040
So you will never be together.

49
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,760
No...

50
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,120
No...

51
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,040
No...

52
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,640
No...

53
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,120
What if

54
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,840
she weren't your sister?

55
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,400
Indeed.

56
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,160
You're my sister.

57
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,680
She belongs to me.

58
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,600
My beloved consort.

59
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,760
Greetings, Your Majesty.

60
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:04,062
(Ji Qingci)

61
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,320
Greetings, Yuchen.

62
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,120
I wonder what you're here for.

63
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,280
Let me ask you a question.

64
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,280
Who exactly are you?

65
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,520
Naturally, I am Ji Qingci.

66
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,600
Then who is she?

67
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,160
She is my sister

68
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,040
and Lord Yi's legitimate daughter,

69
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,120
Ji Qingci.

70
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,640
I'm not.

71
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,640
I'm not.

72
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,960
Pardon me.

73
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,880
This girl

74
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,360
is an orphan

75
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,800
whom I saved days ago.

76
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,400
Is that so?

77
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,680
But I heard

78
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
that she had
Lord Yi's jade pendant with her

79
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,920
when you were saving her.

80
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,600
This jade pendant

81
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,720
is a gift from Qingci.

82
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,000
Yet I remember

83
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,880
you only had half of the jade pendant

84
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,200
upon your return.

85
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,520
After what I've been through,

86
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,520
the other half of it was lost.

87
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,120
Now she has it with her.

88
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,240
That means it's all fated.

89
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,680
No...

90
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,200
No!

91
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,600
Qingci.

92
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,120
This is too much of a coincidence.

93
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,880
The other half of the jade pendant

94
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,680
and the same scar

95
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,240
have been found

96
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,320
on this orphan of unknown origin.

97
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,600
Who among you

98
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,880
is lying to me?

99
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,480
All I need is your answer.

100
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,880
Tell me.

101
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,440
Are you truly Ji Qingci?

102
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,760
Say yes

103
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,640
and I shall get rid of her for you.

104
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,480
That will put your mind at ease.

105
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,920
I'm not Ji Qingci.
