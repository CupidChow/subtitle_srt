=Episode 20=
(The Return of Consciousness)

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,760
Who is this?

4
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,240
I never I'd find a body

5
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,960
in this secret chamber.

6
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,920
Your Majesty.

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,280
He's Lord Scarlet Flame, Yanlie.

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,760
After his death, Bai Li removed
his primordial soul

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,880
before putting it into your body.

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,600
My body?

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:02,680
Mm.

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,840
How could that be?

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,320
I'll tell you everything

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,160
in detail after this.

15
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,080
Please keep your words

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,990
and remove the golden phoenix feather
out of this body.

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,800
Golden phoenix...

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,560
Golden feather...

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,280
There's a divine beast's primordial soul
in your body.

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,080
And this golden feather
only resonates with you.

21
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,440
You're still alive?

22
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,560
Li Cang, you're outrageous!

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,680
(No way,)

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,120
(this black miasma is just like
what Chi Yu had then.)

25
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,200
(Could it be...)

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,280
He's not Li Cang.

27
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,360
I thought of making you
the ruler of Hong.

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,160
To my surprise, you've been useless.

29
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,520
Since that's the case,

30
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,520
someone else should take the throne.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,120
You're here for me, aren't you?

32
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,690
Surrender the golden phoenix feather

33
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,960
and I'll go with you.

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,760
Hmph.

35
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,160
I will take

36
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,640
both of your lives!

37
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,400
Chi Yu, now!

38
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,920
The Silver Fox Clan has tried
to sow discord between Chi Yu and Ji Yuchen

39
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,120
in order to take advantage of it
and seize the golden feather,

40
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,490
giving birth to a disaster
in the mortal realm.

41
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
I must stop them.

42
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,760
Please come up with a reading
when it is time.

43
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,600
And pass this token to Chi Yu.

44
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,800
He remembers what my blood smells like.

45
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,360
Chi Yu, quick!

46
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,480
Get the golden phoenix feather!

47
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,320
Chi Yu, you've regained
your consciousness.

48
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Don't you marry him.

49
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,080
You're mine.

50
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,160
Well,

51
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,200
I was rude to you then.

52
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,040
I really had no idea what I was doing.

53
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,160
I understand.

54
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,320
You weren't yourself,

55
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,840
and you didn't mean to hurt me.

56
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,920
There are two souls in you.

57
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,320
We finally know the truth.

58
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,040
As for

59
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
the wedding...

60
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Of course it's not valid.

61
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,920
What will you do

62
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
after this?

63
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,640
Now that I've regained my consciousness

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,210
and the contract has come into effect,

65
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,040
it's time to settle
both old and new scores

66
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,040
with the Silver Fox Clan.

67
00:06:31,537 --> 00:06:32,537
I'll wait for your return.

68
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,720
Where is Yanlie's
golden phoenix feather?

69
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,480
The contract
between Mu Lingxue and Chi Yu

70
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,240
is way too powerful.

71
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,800
I couldn't withstand it,

72
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,080
and they managed to seize
Yanlie's golden phoenix feather.

73
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,640
Now Chi Yu's consciousness and powers
have been restored.

74
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,080
The Soul-Pulling Spell on Yanlie

75
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,000
is gone too.

76
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,320
You good-for-nothing!

77
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,560
My carefully crafted plan
has gone down the drain because of you!

78
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,280
Have you lost your mind?

79
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,080
How dare you betray me!

80
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,040
You think a mere tiny dagger

81
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,440
can kill me?

82
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,160
I'll give you an ugly death.

83
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,040
Ah!

84
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,120
Go to hell

85
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,480
and be a ruler as you please.

86
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,200
How can this...

87
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,200
Master.

88
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,760
Take a good look at it.

89
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,400
This is Windcutter,
the dagger you gave me.

90
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,800
It's used to slay
divine and demonic beasts.

91
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,680
(Well done.)

92
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,480
Master.

93
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
I'll get you the Xuanzhu Jade
as soon as possible.

94
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
For the sake of power and glory,

95
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,400
I'll make it happen at all costs.

96
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,360
Bai Li, show yourself!

97
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,200
Bai Li's primordial spirit
has escaped again, hasn't it?

98
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,840
No. Her consciousness and spirit
are both destroyed.

99
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,680
An Sha killed her.

100
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,920
(It's all over now.)

101
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,840
Let's go home.

102
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,960
(Grand Tutor Mu Heng)

103
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,480
(had always been a diligent
and dedicated subject.)

104
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,040
(Unfortunately,)

105
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,000
(he was framed by traitor Li Cang.)

106
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,520
(My negligence)

107
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,440
(has wronged such a loyal subject,)

108
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,240
(leading to this tragedy.)

109
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,960
(I)

110
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,520
(Memorial Tablet of Late Father, Mu Heng)
(feel deeply regret.)

111
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,440
(With this edict of self-blame,)

112
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,240
(I'd like)

113
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,280
(to clear Grand Tutor's family's name
and restore their innocence.)

114
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,680
(Grand Tutor Mu Heng)

115
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,480
(deserves to be part
of the ancestral temple,)

116
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,400
(and he shall be conferred
the title of Duke Mu)

117
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,880
(to display my repentance)

118
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,160
(and my utmost respect
for his achievements.)

119
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,000
(Father.)

120
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,080
(Mother.)

121
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,880
(At last, I've cleared your name.)

122
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:17,937
(Memorial Tablet of Late Father, Mu Heng)

123
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,720
(Once I've completed the sacrifice)

124
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,200
(for you on the Day of Xihe,)

125
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,160
(you shall always
be under this sunlight)

126
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,280
(and live as freely as you do now.)
