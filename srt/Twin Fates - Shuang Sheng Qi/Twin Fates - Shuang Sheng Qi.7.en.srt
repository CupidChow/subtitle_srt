=Episode 7=
(Twin Cultivation on Full Moon Night)

3
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,360
(Why is my face so red?)

4
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,120
(What am I even thinking?)

5
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,400
(Calm down.)

6
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,680
(Calm down.)

7
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,960
(It's the Silver Fox Clan scent.)

8
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,720
(I knew there was a hidden chamber.)

9
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,200
(The account might be hidden here.)

10
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:44,640
(Oh no.)

11
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,360
Why are you here?

12
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,920
I didn't summon you.

13
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,320
I'll be careful.

14
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,040
You...

15
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,720
What are you doing in the study?

16
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,960
It was Lord Yi who framed my father

17
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,800
and got my whole family executed.

18
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,560
I came to Lord Yi's Residence

19
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,040
for one reason only.

20
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,640
I want to avenge the Mu family.

21
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,040
If that's so,

22
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,040
I'll help you kill him.

23
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,920
I want blood for blood,

24
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,640
but more than that,
I want to clear our name.

25
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,840
I must find the evidence

26
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,160
that he framed my father

27
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,640
and prove the Mu family's innocence.

28
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,360
I just tested Ji Yuanying

29
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,200
and found out there maybe
a secret account hidden here,

30
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,760
but I didn't find it yet.

31
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,080
I suspect

32
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,920
there's a hidden space here.

33
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,720
I'll keep looking.

34
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,080
I knew there was a secret chamber.

35
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,080
Come on.

36
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,480
Help me look for it.

37
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,600
Lord Yi took so many bribes.

38
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,240
Once we find the secret account,

39
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,160
he can never deny it before His Majesty.

40
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,920
It's here.

41
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,280
Indeed.

42
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,600
Quick. Get out of here first.

43
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,600
(No way, the lock.)

44
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,720
(What to do? He's going to see us.)

45
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
What's wrong?

46
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,160
Nothing.

47
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,840
Let's get out of here.

48
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,600
He almost found us.

49
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,280
Thank you.

50
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,200
That day

51
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,840
when you pulled out a golden feather,
I was conscious.

52
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,520
The golden feather must be important

53
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,960
to Phoenix Divine Beasts, right?

54
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,480
If he ever takes over your body again,

55
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,960
I can help you.

56
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,160
You know?

57
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,800
I know there are two souls in your body,

58
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
and my kiss

59
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,080
can keep it at bay.

60
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,040
There won't be another time like this.

61
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,280
I help you

62
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,080
only for the Xuanzhu Jade.

63
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,240
What's wrong with me?

64
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,450
(After the twin cultivation
on the full moon night,)

65
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,960
(she will be sacrificed
once the pact is complete.)

66
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,800
(For the sake of the clan,
I mustn't have feelings for her.)

67
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,240
Ah, I've lost my mind.

68
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Could it be...

69
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,480
"Twin cultivation
on the full moon night.

70
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,600
Whoever betrays

71
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,200
will suffer backlashes."

72
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,840
Does that mean

73
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,240
he and I...

74
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,720
You...

75
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,720
- I...
- I...

76
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,120
You...

77
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,200
It's late. Why are you in my room?

78
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,320
I couldn't sleep,

79
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,080
so I passed by.

80
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,200
You...

81
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,600
You're dressed so boldly,

82
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,480
wandering around at midnight.

83
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,800
The Scarlet Flame Clan

84
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,280
has warm bodies.

85
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,840
I should get going.

86
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,200
Wait. Don't go.

87
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,360
No. Just go.

88
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,880
Do you want me to come in

89
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,120
or to go out?

90
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,080
Backlash is nothing.

91
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,200
I won't believe I can't get through it.

92
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,720
Sleep.

93
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,240
Just sleep and it'll be fine.

94
00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:39,440
(Calm down.)

95
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,440
(Calm down.)

96
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,240
(Calm down.)

97
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,720
(Calm down.)

98
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:21,880
I...

99
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,000
I didn't

100
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
mean it.

101
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,360
I didn't mean to summon you.

102
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't care.

103
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,280
You started it.
