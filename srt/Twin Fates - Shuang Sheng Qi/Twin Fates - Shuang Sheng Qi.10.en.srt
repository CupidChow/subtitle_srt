Edict of Emperor of Hong.

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,960
First year of Qianyuan,

5
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,720
in the cyclical year of Yimou,

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,440
third month, day of Gengyin.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,560
Princess Yuanxi, Ji Qingci,

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,520
daughter of Lord Yi.

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,480
Gentle in nature, sincere in virtue,

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,840
gifted with wisdom,

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,280
fit to bear great responsibility.

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,000
Hereby established
as heiress to Lord Yi.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,480
So decreed.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
Long live

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,880
His Majesty.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,760
Qingci, don't be too depressed.

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
No one could have imagined

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,160
Ji Yuanying would kill her own father
and then take her own life.

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,510
You've lost
your closest kin so suddenly.

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,600
You must take care of yourself.

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,120
Thank you for your concern.

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,960
Brother, this is my father's written confession.

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,560
(Out of greed and envy,
I plotted against the Mu Residence,)

24
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:48,400
(whose loyalty spanned generations,
and sought to destroy them.)

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,040
(Complainant: Yi Mei)
(Recorded by: Zhang)

26
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,360
I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,720
My father may have sinned,
but he is gone now.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
May your anger be appeased.

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,720
His mistakes

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
are not yours to bear.

31
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,520
Rise.

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,920
I, too,

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,760
struggle to believe
my father would do such a thing.

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,240
But since he wrote this
with his own hand,

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,720
guilt must have weighed on him.

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,840
It was with fear and shame

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,400
that I presented this to Your Majesty.

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,840
Be at ease.

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,080
Lord Yi has passed away.

40
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,680
Even if he erred,

41
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,280
I will not punish you.

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,320
And as for the Mu Residence…

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,880
The deceased are no longer with us.

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,400
There's no need
to pursue this matter further.

45
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,600
I don't believe that's right.

46
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,680
I beg Your Majesty to let me

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,960
uncover the truth
behind the Mu Residence case.

48
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,040
The case of Grand Tutor Mu Heng?

49
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,760
I am humbled

50
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,080
by your grace.

51
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,600
But my father's confession

52
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,080
unsettles me.

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,400
I fear his name left stained,

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,880
or that he truly

55
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,960
wronged the innocent.

56
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,440
I only wish

57
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,400
to set his soul at peace.

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,100
You have my permission
to investigate the Mu Residence case.

59
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,400
You have always been
pure-hearted and kind.

60
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,960
Brother, this is my guard.

61
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,080
He's saved me many times.

62
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,040
We're as close as siblings.

63
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,560
As close as siblings?

64
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,920
Brother,

65
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,600
I made these pastries myself.

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,320
Please try them.

67
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,280
Please pardon him.

68
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,760
He only did that
out of concern for my safety.

69
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,440
Let me make you some tea.

70
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:52,960
Brother.

71
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
He's from the martial world.

72
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
He can be a bit eccentric,

73
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,720
but he is skilled.

74
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,520
What skill could

75
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,200
the uncultured have?

76
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,440
Qingci,

77
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,960
my guards are masters at moving unseen.

78
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,520
They protect you from the shadows.

79
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,640
You'd never notice,

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,960
let alone feel

81
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,160
they're in the way.

82
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,640
Tomorrow, I'll choose a few of the best

83
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,280
and send them to you.

84
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,480
Forgive me, Your Highness, for the disruption.

85
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,400
But Qingci,

86
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,760
even a guard should have some manners.

87
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,040
Why not let me

88
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,960
find you a few eunuchs who can fight?

89
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,040
What do you think?

90
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,440
I trust him.

91
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,680
Since you insist,

92
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,800
I'll say no more.

93
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,440
Oh, right.

94
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,640
The Lantern Festival is coming soon.
The palace will host a grand banquet.

95
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,560
You must attend.

96
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,440
It'll be your first festival
since returning.

97
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,080
Of course. I'll be there

98
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,000
to wish Your Majesty joy and peace.

99
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,960
It's sweet.

100
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,160
Those are sour date pastries.

101
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,480
Blessings to Your Majesty for joy
and longevity on the Lantern Festival.

102
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,360
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

103
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,520
All rise.

104
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,960
Today is the Lantern Festival.

105
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,840
Drink and feast to your heart's content.

106
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,320
No one shall until they're satisfied.

107
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,600
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

108
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,400
Why hasn't the heiress of Lord Yi

109
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,320
arrived yet?

110
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,360
The invitation said
she's already in the palace.

111
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
The heiress of Lord Yi has arrived.

112
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,840
I, Ji Qingci,

113
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,280
wish Your Majesty peace and joy
on the Lantern Festival.

114
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,160
Long live Your Majesty.

115
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,360
Rise.

116
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

117
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,760
I've prepared a performance

118
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,960
I wish to present to Your Majesty.

119
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,480
All right.

120
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,000
By all means.
