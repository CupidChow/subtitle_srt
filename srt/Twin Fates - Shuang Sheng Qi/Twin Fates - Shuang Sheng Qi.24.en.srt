If so,

00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,360
After all,

105
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,000

107
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,320
It's got too many lines?

108
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,320
To be honest, that's not the case.

109
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,200
I have to give a poker face throughout.

110
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,720
However, I need to make sure
my eyes and facial expression are on point.

111
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,000
It's all about being emotional.

112
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,960
It's okay.

113
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,210

My favorite character? I...

115
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,320
In fact, I wonder what it'd feel like
to act as An Sha.

116
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
I'd love to give that a try.

117

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,520
Hold her hand. There's no space here.

137
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Each of them has a face.

138
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,320
You see the bathtub.

139
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,080
- Okay. Let's give it a try.
- Alright.

140
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,000
Well, normally,

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,100
you'll walk by and take a glimpse.

142
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,400
Yeah, that's it.

143
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,320

That's right.

149
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,520

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,320
- Use some oil, then.
- Hahaha! Let's just use some oil.

156
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,040
Yeah, you could turn around. That's it.

157
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,520
Do I do it myself?

158
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,120
Who did this?

159
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,320
They stepped on the dress. And she fell.

160
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,440
Just once. Yeah.

161
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,840
Face him this way.

162
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,560
He will take two steps back.

163
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,560
Use this gesture. And push it!

164
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,640
