(Kiss Me. There's No Time)

3
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,160
This is bad.

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,200
There's no time.

5
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,280
(Twin-soul Contract.)

6
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,480
(Saving her is saving myself.)

7
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,320
(Chi Yu,)

8
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,920
(the phoenix's three golden feathers)

9
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,600
(are a divine gift.)

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,120
(Pulling out the golden feather
can kill you.)

11
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
(The harm is irreversible.)

12
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,080
(How many more times)

13
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,440
(can you save this weak human?)

14
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,480
(Once all the golden feathers
are used up,)

15
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,680
(we'll both lose our divine body.)

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
(If you don't cherish this body,)

17
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,240
(I'll do it.)

18
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,840
Get out!

19
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,840
(An Sha!)

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,520
(If you hurt her,)

21
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,280
(I'll destroy this body.)

22
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,480
She's awake?

23
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,880
How could she still be alive after being struck
by the poisoned needle?

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,840
I believe

25
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,440
she was saved by the guard by her side.

26
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,440
This man is indeed no ordinary person.

27
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,200
We must find a way
to get rid of him first.

28
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,160
By the way,

29
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,880
His Majesty and Lord Yi

30
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,720
heard Princess Qingci had fallen sick

31
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,320
and had already rushed back.

32
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,920
They truly care about her.

33
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,680
(Where is Chi Yu?)

34
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,000
(Did something happen?)

35
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,520
(Let me try a sneeze.)

36
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
Are you all right, Chi Yu?

37
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,440
What's wrong, Chi Yu?

38
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,080
What are you doing?

39
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,560
What's wrong with you?

40
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,240
Kiss me.

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,800
Are you insane?

42
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,600
I can't control him.

43
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,920
Kiss me.

44
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,320
(Could it be that his body)

45
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,680
(have two souls?)

46
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,520
His Majesty, Lord Yi,

47
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,920
and Lord Yi's heiress have arrived.

48
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,640
That guard is in her room.

49
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,200
Ci,

50
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,760
His Majesty heard you fell ill,

51
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,920
so he has come to see you.

52
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,160
Qingci,

53
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
I'm here to see you.

54
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,120
(Now.)

55
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,760
There's an assassin in her room.

56
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,240
Quick. Protect His Majesty.

57
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,600
Go.

58
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,960
Don't be afraid, Qingci.

59
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,960
Someone saw an assassin in your room.

60
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,480
For the sake of His Majesty

61
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,800
and your safety.

62
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,080
We must search immediately.

63
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,800
What assassin?

64
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Are you trying to embarrass me
without proof?

65
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,440
My servant saw it.

66
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,440
Are you being coerced?

67
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,800
Or is the assassin

68
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,240
actually your servant?

69
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,720
Since I returned,

70
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't know how I offended you.

71
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,520
You keep humiliating
and making things hard for me.

72
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,640
First you questioned my identity

73
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,160
and forced me to undress
before everyone.

74
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,480
Now you barged in with a group of people

75
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,040
while I was taking a medicinal bath.

76
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,200
You're trying to ruin my reputation.

77
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,640
(Playing the victim)

78
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,080
(won't work on me.)

79
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,040
What has happened, Qingci?

80
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,600
Isn't making me look bad enough for you?

81
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,000
That's enough!

82
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,480
Father,

83
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,640
an assassination attempt
in a lord's residence is a grave crime.

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,480
The assassin may be hiding in this tub.

85
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,800
If you want to check,

86
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,120
I'll let you.

87
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,520
Everyone leave.

88
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,040
I came here

89
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,120
to visit Qingci.

90
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,840
I didn't expect the heiress

91
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,080
to stage such an act.

92
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,560
How very thoughtful.

93
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,320
Your Majesty, please believe me.

94
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,120
Shut up.

95
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,040
Isn't this causing enough of a scene?

96
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,640
Father.

97
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,320
(He must be here.)

98
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,520
(If I can find him,)

99
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,480
(I can prove I'm right.)

100
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,320
Your Majesty.

101
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,160
Guards.

102
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Lock her up

103
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,520
to reflect on her actions.

104
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,720
Father!

105
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,640
Father, believe me.

106
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,040
Your Majesty, believe me.

107
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Father!

108
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,280
Chi Yu.

109
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,520
Wake up, Chi Yu.

110
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,120
Wake up.

111
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm losing control of him.

112
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,080
Kiss me.

113
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,200
Could it be

114
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,560
that

115
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,360
the kiss time isn't long enough?

you fainted just now,

Father...

135
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,400
Did Father send you?

136
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,640
Try this.

Are you proud of that?

141

You'll meet a grimmer end than I did.

142
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,440
You're not Ji Qingci at all!

143
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,760
It's no different
from a street stall.

144
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,800
Looks like you still don't understand.

145

Whether I'm Ji Qingci or not

146
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,240
is not the point.

147
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,840
Because no matter what you do,

148
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,560
you can never change the fact

149
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,840
that you'll always

150
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,320
be only an illegitimate daughter.

151
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,320
Just why?

152
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
We're both Father's daughters.

153
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,480
But why does Father only see Ji Qingci?

154
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,440
Why can Ji Qingci

155
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,760
easily take everything
that belongs to me?

156
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,720
Why didn't she just die?

157
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,800
I'll give you a choice.

158
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,120
Tell me
where Lord Yi's secret account is,

159
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,920
and I'll get you out of here.

160
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,840
How did you know
about the secret account?

161
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,880
Who are you, really?

162
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,040
(I knew something was wrong
with Lord Yi.)

163
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,880
You tricked me.

164
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,120
You!

165
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,440
No matter who I really am,

166
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,040
right now I am Ji Qingci.

167
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,120
It's thanks to your schemes

168
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,640
and the way you kept
giving yourself away

169
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,080
that my identity as the legitimate
daughter was finally confirmed.

170
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,680
You can never get the secret account.

171
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,680
Even if you don't tell me where it is,

172
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,720
it's fine.

173
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,120
With my current position,

174
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,800

You, on the other hand,

176
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,880
have already lost.
