00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,842
- [Kitty sighs]
- [Min Ho scoffs]

175
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,471
And you can thank me
by talking to Dae for me.

176
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,849
Why would Dae want
to talk to <i>me</i> about this?

177
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,227
He's not mad at you.
You're the perfect person to tell him

178
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,689
whatever happened on the plane
was a moment of temporary insanity.

179
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,273
I was disoriented.

180
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,108
It was my first time in coach,
for God's sake.

181
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,027
[Kitty] Okay.

182
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,111
I'll see what I can do.

183
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,030
Thank you.

184
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,088
- Hi, how've you been?
- Kitty, let's not.

185
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,218
Hi.

186
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,011
- How are you two?
- Hi.

187
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,679
Hey.

188
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,015
Isn't this great?
We're all here in one room.

189
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,394
I mean, nothing brings people together
more than artistic collaboration.

190
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,022
I know. Me and my Dae-bae have
really been working on our chemistry.

191
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,943
Both on <i>and</i> off the stage,
if you catch my drift.

192
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,445
[Kitty chuckles]

193
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,030
[softly] Hey.

194
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:37,534
Look, I know that
you're still really upset with Min Ho,

195
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,912
but he would never do something
to intentionally hurt you.

196
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,331
And me and you are
in such a good place right now.

197
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,417
- You seem so happy with Eunice--
- Kitty.

198
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,294
[somber music playing]

199
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,089
Min Ho confessed his love to you
five minutes after we broke up,

200
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,843
and now he's making you
do his dirty work for him.

201
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,638
He has always been selfish and entitled.

202
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,976
This is just another example of that.

203
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,276
[music fades]

204
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,405
[whimsical music playing]

205
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,159
Hi.

206
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,328
- Hey.
- I heard about your road trip with Min Ho.

207
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,664
Oh, it's so, so important
to connect to your extended family.

208
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,375
You don't mind if I steal him away
for a whole Saturday?

209
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,293
[Stella] Kitty.

210
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:32,047
I'm not one of those girls that needs
to spend every minute with her boyfriend.

211
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,424
Cool.

212
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,426
Oh, you're here.

213
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,011
Why wouldn't I be? I live here.

214
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:38,970
Right, but wait.

215
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,973
What you saw earlier today,
I promise, it's not what it looked like.

216
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,767
I really can't take one more lie.

217
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,019
No, I... I know, it's...

218
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,103
[sighs] I'm really sorry.

219
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,190
You know what? I'm not gonna help you
feel better about what you did.

220
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,567
If I have to live with it, so do you.

221
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,277
Can we please just talk?

222
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,404
- [door locks]
- [sighs]

223
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,491
[somber music playing]

224
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,548
[music fades]

225
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,550
Like some tea?

226
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,220
I'm good. I just brushed my teeth.

227
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,389
[quietly] And I can't be sure
you're not poisoning it.

228
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,184
[Stella humming "Amazing Grace"]

229
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,523
[sighs]

230
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,784
[exhales]

231
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,039
[chuckles softly]

232
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,625
[indistinct chatter]

233
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,293
Thank you again for doing this.

234
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,463
Especially because I did not fulfill
my side of the bargain with Dae.

235
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,549
I actually might have made it worse.

236
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,592
It's fine. Honestly,

237
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:03,054
I wouldn't mind putting some distance
between myself and Dae's death glare.

238
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:03,973
[Kitty sighs]

239
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,810
And look at that.
Stella gave me sandwiches to bring.

240
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,688
Huh. That's really thoughtful of her.

241
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,190
- She really is the best.
- Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

242
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,151
Yeah.

243
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,070
Thanks.

244
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,489
Damn. [sighs]

245
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,243
So when we went to Iceland,
Juliana loved this certain yogurt.

246
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,037
And I found a place
that will overnight them.

247
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,957
So what I'm thinking is
I need a big gesture like that.

248
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,500
Look. [sighs]

249
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,836
I know how badly
you want to fix things with Juliana,

250
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,423
but I just think
a gesture like that isn't gonna do it.

251
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,426
Okay, then what will?
I've apologized a million times.

252
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,886
Breakups suck.

253
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,387
When I first moved to Korea,

254
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,557
I was coming off the back
of a really bad breakup.

255
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,058
Oh. I didn't know that.

256
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,978
I've definitely told you a few times.

257
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:56,609
Is it possible that
you can be a little self-involved?

258
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,528
That is a distinct possibility.

259
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,863
[sighs]

260
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:06,034
What if I <i>am</i> just
a selfish, terrible person?

261
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,869
- No, don't say that.
- Like with Kitty.

262
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,873
I completely shut her out
after kissing her on a whim.

263
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,627
Yesterday she came to me as a friend,
and I didn't want anything to do with her.

264
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,504
I might have ruined that friendship.

265
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,630
Ugh. God.

266
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,842
All I want is to get Juliana back.
That's all I can think about.

267
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:28,474
That may be what <i>you</i> want,
but what if that's not what Juliana needs?

268
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,103
[energetic music playing]

269
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:48,284
[Min Ho] Okay, we're here.
What's the plan? You do have one, right?

270
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,869
Well, of course I have a plan.

271
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,915
We are waiting for my great-aunt to leave
so I can talk to my cousin, Jiwon.

272
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,627
And I'm not gonna do the grand "you have
a long-lost relative" reveal just yet.

273
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,796
Today, we are simply gathering intel.

274
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,423
We're gonna act like students
who are interviewing locals

275
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,719
who have lived here for generations
for an oral history project.

276
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,888
That's actually not a bad plan.

277
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,182
- [chuckles]
- Thank you.

278
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,351
I'm sorry again that
I couldn't help with the whole--

279
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,520
What? Dae hating me thing?

280
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,147
- [sighs]
- It's all right.

281
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,567
I just don't know what to do.

282
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,068
Dae's like a brother to me.

283
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,573
We had our fights,
sure, but never like this.

284
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,284
Never over a girl.

285
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,788
Well, when I talked to Dae,

286
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:38,127
I kinda got the feeling
that this wasn't really about me.

287
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,671
What do you mean?

288
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,965
I remember Dae telling me
about some fight that you guys had

289
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,758
in, like, the 7th grade.

290
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,135
You wanted to go to a concert

291
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,345
and made fun of him
for wanting to stay in and study.

292
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,556
- [gentle music playing]
- I don't even remember that.

293
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,183
'Cause it probably seemed
like no big deal to you.

294
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:58,062
But for Dae, getting caught for something
like that can mean losing his scholarship.

295
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:02,568
He has to think about
a lot of things that you... don't.

296
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:08,281
And sometimes, that can lead you
to making impulsive decisions.

297
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,827
Like telling my best friend's ex
that I'm in love with her.

298
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,789
[inhales sharply] Right.

299
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,958
So maybe for Dae's sake,

300
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,881
you should think twice
before doing things like... that.

301
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,595
[gentle music fades]

302
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,016
[yawns] I'm sorry.
I didn't know stakeouts were this boring.

303
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,645
- Want the last walnut cake?
- [gasps] Wait. I think that's her!

304
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,731
[bright music playing]

305
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,652
That's my great-aunt! It has to be.

306
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,361
Ooh.

307
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,530
She looks just like my <i>halmoni.</i>

308
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,033
She's leaving. She's leaving.

309
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,452
And she's left. She's left! [gasps]

310
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,996
Oh, we're going up. Okay.

311
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,176
[gentle music playing]

312
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,095
Covey?

313
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,263
Hello?

314
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,141
You all right? [chuckles]

315
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,563
I didn't expect
to feel this... much. [sighs]

316
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,569
Is it weird to have a close connection
to a place I've never even been before?

317
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,825
No, I think it's pretty special.

318
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,455
[Kitty] I just can't get over...
My ancestors lived here.

319
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,000
[in Korean] Oh my God!

320
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,962
Why are you just standing there?

321
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,213
You're too late.

322
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,924
She thought you weren't coming,
so my grandma stepped out for a bit.

323
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,009
[Min Ho] Oh.

324
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,427
We're very sorry.

325
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,639
Which one of you is here to be matched?

326
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,352
[in English] She's asking which of us
is here to be matched.

327
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,813
[whispers] New plan. Go with it.

328
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:04,982
Tourists?

329
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,983
[chuckles]

330
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,028
I guess <i>Halmoni</i>
really is expanding her customer base.

331
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,030
[Kitty chuckles]

332
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,491
- Follow me.
- [energetic music playing]

333
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,578
Are you telling me
that they are matchmakers?!

334
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,123
- [gasps]
- Covey, be cool.

335
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,417
- Be cool.
- [exhales]

336
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,753
[chuckles softly]

337
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,348
[clears throat] So, which one of you
is the client?

338
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:45,521
Oh. So, my American friend here,
she's so pathetic and perpetually single.

339
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,565
- She really needs professional help.
- Mm.

340
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,777
And Min Ho here
also desperately needs your services.

341
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,906
He's run off every girl in town
by being so annoying and rude.

342
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,909
[Min Ho chuckles]

343
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:02,288
Okay, my <i>halmoni</i> doesn't like
to get involved in anything complicated.

344
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,791
So, you two aren't a couple?

345
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,709
- Oh my God. That's disgusting.
- Oh God, no.

346
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,796
- I'm gonna throw up and die.
- What's wrong with you?

347
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,963
We are just friends.

348
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:14,008
Single and ready-to-mingle friends.

349
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,343
[Min Ho chuckles]

350
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,886
[whimsical music playing]

351
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,056
Okay, so two questionnaires, then?

352
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,391
Sounds great.

353
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,977
- [Q] Thank you.
- [Juliana] Thanks. [sighs]

354
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:29,273
So, did Kitty put you up to this
to make herself not the bad guy?

355
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,900
- Well, yes.
- [chuckles]

356
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,529
And I also thought the squish of the boba
might actually make you feel better.

357
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,446
Is it working?

358
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,365
[sighs] That worked
for like half a second,

359
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,867
and then my bloodlust returned anew.

360
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:45,541
[chuckles] Okay, I totally understand
your... bloodlust. But, um...

361
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,837
Okay. I'm gonna tell you something
I haven't told anyone. Not even Kitty.

362
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,214
You have my attention.

363
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,384
Remember our old roommate, Marius?

364
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,053
He was "straight."

365
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,098
He had a girlfriend back home.

366
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,349
Well, he and I used to secretly hook up.

367
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,601
To be honest,
you're not coming off great in this story.

368
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,770
I know. I know. But...

369
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,858
I never met the girlfriend.
I could pretend she didn't exist.

370
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,152
But then she visited us,

371
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,156
and I realized
a real person was getting hurt.

372
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,825
I know it's not an excuse.
I'm still garbage.

373
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,493
You're not garbage.

374
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,873
You're just a person that made a mistake.

375
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,920
[Q] Look, Kitty first started
having feelings for Yuri last semester.

376
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,631
- When she was still figuring out she's bi.
- Yeah.

377
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:36,967
She didn't know you.

378
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,138
She helped you come back to KISS,
despite her feelings, and...

379
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,516
[sighs] I know she feels like garbage too.

380
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,018
Yeah.

381
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:51,190
I've been focusing my rage on Kitty
because if I face who I'm really mad at,

382
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,774
I may never stop crying.

383
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,359
[door opens]

384
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,945
[Juliana] Stella, what are you doing
at an internet café?

385
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,530
[gasps] Juliana! Q!

386
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,575
Hi. Um, so... it was a funny story.

387
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,827
I actually use
the gaming computers in there

388
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:09,081
to play this immersive role-playing game

389
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,250
where you get to be
a famous Bible character.

390
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,627
[chuckles softly]

391
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,422
Okay, fine. I was playing
<i>Call of Duty: Warzone,</i> all right? Um...

392
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,676
I... I should go. Uh, have a... a blessed day.

393
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,928
[chuckles softly]

394
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,014
[intriguing music playing]

395
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,350
Okay. Why was she acting like
we just busted her making a drug deal?

396
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,436
- That was sus, right? Okay.
- Yeah, that was sus.

397
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,647
- Okay. All right.
- [Q] Absolutely. But I don't know.

398
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,318
I'm still not buying Kitty's theory
that she's some letter-stealing wackadoo.

399
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:37,903
Why not?

400
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,696
I kind of agree with Kitty on that one.

401
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,697
No way.

402
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:45,034
Look, Stella was conspicuously missing
when that letter was circulating.

403
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:48,955
And as her roommate,
I gotta say, the girl just... is off.

404
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,999
Too smiley. Too wide-eyed.
It all adds up to sus.

405
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,211
Well, now I feel bad for telling Kitty
<i>she's</i> the one who lost it.

406
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,629
[sighs]

407
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,634
You know, if the two of you ever squashed
your beef, you could actually be friends.

408
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,761
Maybe even start
a detective agency together? Huh?

409
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,638
- Don't know about that one.
- [Q] Baby steps.

410
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,931
[Juliana] Yeah.

411
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,974
[thunder rumbles]

412
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,643
So, how long
has this business been around?

413
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,603
Is the whole family involved?

414
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,773
It goes back many generations.

415
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,568
<i>Halmoni</i> would love
for me to take over one day, but

416
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,239
I'm actually studying to teach English.

417
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,201
Probably at the village school so that
I can stay here and take care of Halmoni.

418
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,579
She needs me. I'm her only family.

419
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,457
Well, don't freak out,
but speaking of family--

420
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,584
Kitty, that's not the plan.

421
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:39,005
[in Korean] It's really starting
to pour out there!

422
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:39,922
Jiwon.

423
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,175
- Yes.
- [grandmother] Come here and help me.

424
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,094
[Jiwon] Grandma! Over here.

425
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,348
Who are these people?

426
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,641
Huh?

427
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,353
Aren't these your new clients?

428
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,605
What are you talking about?

429
00:21:56,106 --> 00:22:00,109
No, why would a radish farmer
have such a fair skin complexion?

430
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,110
[chuckles]

431
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,196
Plus, his younger sister...

432
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,866
[Kitty chuckles]

433
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,952
...has a famous hairy mole, look.

434
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,746
It's not there.

435
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,082
Who are you both?

436
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,626
[in English] Uh, maybe I can help explain.

437
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,669
Uh, Kitty?

438
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,421
[in Korean] I am Kitty Song.

439
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,797
My mom's Eve Song.

440
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:24,008
She's your sister's daughter.

441
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,761
- [in English] Your mom is Eve Song?
- [grandmother gasps]

442
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,262
You've heard about my mom?

443
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,430
Her and Simon were--

444
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,556
That's my dad.

445
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,515
[Kitty] Yeah.

446
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,351
[in Korean] Grandma,
what's she talking about?

447
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,020
That's enough!
Stop and just leave! Get out!

448
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,563
[in English] I... I don't understand.

449
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,023
She says, "Get out."

450
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,358
[in Korean] Leave right now!

451
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,985
I said get out!
Why are you just standing there? Get out!

452
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,320
- Halmoni!
- Yeah, yeah.

453
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,155
Get out! Get out now!

454
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,657
[Kitty crying softly]

455
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,284
[in English] Great tea. Thanks for the--

456
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,410
[in Korean] I told you to get out!

457
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,536
[Min Ho in English] Right.

458
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,373
- [in Korean] Oh, what's wrong with you?
- What?

459
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,625
How upsetting.

460
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,418
[exhales]

461
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,045
Oh, my temperature is rising.

462
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,380
[sighs deeply]

463
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,799
[Min Ho] Kitty!

464
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,508
Kitty!

465
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,843
[somber music playing]

466
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,677
Kitty!

467
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,764
[thunder continues rumbling]

468
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,060
Kitty, you all right?

469
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,436
I should have seen this coming.

470
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,397
[music fades slowly]

471
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,900
I just kept thinking that they're family,

472
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,570
so they would have to feel a connection.

473
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,535
I mean, my great-aunt is a matchmaker.

474
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,831
[voice breaking] But my family...

475
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,333
doesn't want me?

476
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,548
I have made such a mess
of things at school,

477
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,802
and now I've made a bigger mess.

478
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,888
And apparently,
that's what my mom did too.

479
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:00,897
I always thought that maybe
I was like her in the best ways.

480
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,195
What if I'm like her in the worst ways?

481
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,781
[sobbing]

482
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,701
[tender music playing]

483
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,915
Come on now. That's not true.

484
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:24,295
Oh, I know quite a bit
about Kitty Song Covey.

485
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,132
She's relentless and determined.

486
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,217
She helped her sister find love

487
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,970
in her own chaotic way,

488
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,974
then traveled around the world
so she could find it for herself.

489
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,935
["This Is What It Feels Like"
by Armin van Buuren playing]

490
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,146
That's how I know she...

491
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,523
Well...

492
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,952
Well, that's how I know
you won't give up on your family.

493
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,747
Whether they want you to or not.

494
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,790
[chuckles sadly]

495
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,668
[clears throat]

496
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,378
Right. Shall we get out of here?

497
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,673
It's getting quite muddy, and frankly,

498
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,051
your living ancestors scare me.

499
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,762
I don't want to meet the dead ones.

500
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,182
Yeah? Come on.

501
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,227
[gentle music fades]

502
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,522
Runners always get the runs.
It's like an actual thing.

503
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,857
They were so surprised by that.
Tell me you've heard that.

504
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,275
You should keep that to yourself.

505
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,401
- Okay.
- Right.

506
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,611
[Q] I'm workin' on that.

00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,697
- Uh...
- Hi. Don't worry. I'll be quick.

I just want to say I'm gonna stop
chasing you around campus

510

and give you space.

511
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,959
I'm gonna really try
to figure out why I made the mistakes...

512
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,797
[crying] ...that made me lose the most
important person in the world to me.
