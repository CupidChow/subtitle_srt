[Kitty] <i>When I first came to KISS,
I'd never felt more like an outsider.</i>

5
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:23,398
<i>I almost left the first night.</i>

6
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:28,444
<i>But soon, this place
started to feel like home.</i>

7
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,654
<i>My friends became family,</i>

8
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,992
<i>and then amazingly,
I found my</i> actual <i>family.</i>

9
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:38,579
<i>Now that my scholarship is almost over
and I'm about to head home,</i>

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,040
<i>I have one last thing I have to do.</i>

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,709
This is for you.

12
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,918
One hazelnut latte.

13
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,378
- Thank you.
- [phone ringing]

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,048
[Kitty] I think this is her.

[gasps]

16
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,010
Please tell me you have good news.

17
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,470
Halmoni <i>said she'd do it!</i>

18
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,263
[both squeal]

19
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,891
- [gasps] Is that Jiwon?
- [Kitty] <i>Oh, yes. Sorry.</i>

20
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,560
- This is our cousin Jiwon!
- Hi, Margot.

21
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,562
<i>Does this mean we get to meet in person?</i>

22
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,230
Yes. I can't wait.

23
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,108
This is crazy. How did you convince
<i>Halmoni</i> to say yes?

24
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,486
<i>Actually,</i> Halaboji <i>did that.</i>

25
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,612
<i>He told her to imagine</i>

26
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,698
<i>if her granddaughters had
a falling out that lasted this long.</i>

27
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,659
And he reminded her that
this is what her daughter wanted too.

28
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,663
<i>She gave me the go-ahead. I've only got
a couple weeks before my new job starts,</i>

29
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,582
so I'm gonna go so I can look for flights.

30
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,210
<i>- Okay, thank you! I love you!
- Bye.</i>

your KISS happy ending.

[somber music playing]

35
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,769
I always thought
there was a vibe between you two.

36
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,439
Oh no, he's super happy with Stella.

37
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,359
Kitty, we're family.

38
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,777
You can tell me the truth.

39
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,987
[sighs]

40
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,449
Fine. Recently, I have had...

41
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,036
feelings, but it doesn't matter.

42
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,371
It's too late.

43
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,497
You sure about that?

44
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:07,752
'Cause I would have said the same thing
about our grandmas' reunion.

45
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,379
I can't believe
this is actually happening.

46

[Q] <i>Seriously?</i>

49
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,055
Jin wants me to do
another <i>Gilded Age</i> rewatch.

50
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,099
What's the problem?
I thought you loved that show.

51
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,183
I do.

52
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,435
It's like <i>Downton Abbey</i>,
but with crazier hats.

53
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:29,148
I just worry that Jin's falling into
this depression since he can't run,

54
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,233
hence the constant binge-watching.

55
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,820
To top it off, I keep getting these emails
from recruiters at D1 schools.

56
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,906
Like, I just got invited
to USC's track program for the summer.

57
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:38,991
- [Dae] What?
- What?

58
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,161
- That's amazing. Congrats.
- [chuckles] Thank you.

59
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,203
That's incredible, Q.

60
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,538
I know.

61
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,749
I just worry
it'll make Jin feel even worse.

62
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,419
No, he's gonna be happy for you.
He adores you.

63
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,130
- True.
- I mean, I am adorable.

64
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,382
[chuckles]

65
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,762
Okay, just tell us
what you're dying to say right now.

66
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:01,889
Oh, is it that obvious?

67
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,056
- Yeah.
- Okay, well--

68
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,474
[door unlocks]

69
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,809
[tense music playing]

70
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,020
- Hey, guys. Good timing.
- Hey.

71
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,439
Uh, so, the news is,

72
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,649
<i>Halmoni</i> said yes to the sister reunion.

73
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,152
Margot is literally
booking flights as we speak.

74
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,238
- [Q] Oh my--
- Covey, that's great news.

75
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,036
What a blessing. You must be thrilled.

76
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,538
[Kitty] Yeah, thanks, Stella.

77
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:30,793
Min Ho, you better put on a fresh shirt.
We're having dinner with his dad.

78
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,836
Yeah. [clears throat]

79
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,005
Big show tomorrow.

80
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,382
See you guys later?

81
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,218
Yeah.

82
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,804
[door opens]

83
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,640
She didn't even take off her shoes.

84
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,100
And Min Ho passed over
his usual collagen water

85
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,019
for one of your synthetic energy drinks.

86
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,687
Not to kick a man while he's down,

87
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:54,691
but his skin is giving major
Edward Cullen vibes, and not in a hot way.

88
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:55,817
Something's off.

89
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,152
Do you think Stella--

90
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,614
No. I was wrong, remember?

91
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,408
[sighs]

00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,453
[energetic pop music playing]

93
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,334
[Yuri] Okay, what do we think?

94
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:16,588
Is this giving "I am totally worthy of you
forgiving me and loving me forever"?

95
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,424
[cell phone vibrates]

96
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,510
- It's Mom.
- Shouldn't you answer it?

97
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,389
Nope. She's gonna want
to talk about Dario again.

98
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,058
This massage therapist she's dating.

99
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,643
- Oh.
- Uh...

100
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,144
- [in Korean] Excuse me?
- [clerk] Yes?

101
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,689
I'll take everything from here to here.

102
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,526
And I'll take what I'm wearing right now.

103
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,319
[cell phone chimes]

104
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,364
[in English] Ugh. It's my dad.

105
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,825
He's been extra crabby
in the lead-up to tonight's concert.

106
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,326
He's probably butt-hurt.

107
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,745
Seeing these kids
living out their pop star dreams

108
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,748
just reminds him he never made it
as a rock star, you know?

109
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,377
So that's why he's been playing
a bunch of sad songs on his guitar.

110
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,379
Oh my God.

111
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,216
Juliana just hearted my Insta story.

112
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,429
I think she might be ready
to get back together.

113
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,930
[Alex] Hmm. I...

114
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,559
What? We had this moment
at the dance last week. Okay?

115
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,271
[clerk in Korean] Miss?
This card has been declined.

116
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,859
Ah, my mom pauses my cards
to get my attention.

117
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,403
Then, please hold these for later.

118
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:21,988
Yes.

119
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,032
[in English] Okay, I'll go change.
The concert's starting soon.

120

[upbeat pop music playing]

121
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,162
[excited chatter]

122
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,718
Hey. I got your text. What's going on?

123
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,680
Hey, it's Stella. She's competing tonight,
and Min Ho's helping her.

124
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,349
What? That's impossible.

125
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,726
Well, she was last up
during the tech rehearsal,

126
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,354
and Moon introduced her
as his big underdog story.

127
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,231
This explains his weird behavior
and the synthetic energy drinks,

128
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,816
and the less-than-glowing skin.

129
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,401
This is not Min Ho's fault.

130
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,528
What do you mean? Min Ho knew all along.

131
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,155
How could he do this to us?

132
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:09,242
Stella's been fake-dating him this entire
time as part of a plan to take down Moon.

133
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,079
- [tense music playing]
- What? What are you talking about?

134
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,289
It's like she has him trapped somehow.

135
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,583
Well, if Min Ho's trapped,
we have to help him.

136
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:20,630
You have to get ready for the show.
Watch out for Stella. I'll handle this.

137
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,883
[sighs]

138
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,305
Whoa. Kitty, what are you doing here?

139
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,391
What is going on with you?

140
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,103
Stella has you trapped somehow,
doesn't she?

141
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,565
Okay, you were right.
Stella's a complete psycho.

142
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,193
She found out that
Joon Ho got his backup dancer pregnant

143
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:47,906
and threatened to release the story
to the press unless she wins this contest.

144
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,326
Damn, ten points for Slytherin.

145
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,495
What does your dad think?

146
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,540
You haven't told him. Min Ho!

147
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,875
Well, how do you expect
this conversation will go?

148
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,753
"Hi, Dad. It's a good thing
that I finally earned your respect,

149
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,048
because remember that girlfriend
I convinced you to let in the contest?"

150
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,427
"She's blackmailing us
and planning to ruin your entire empire."

151
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,179
"Cheers, thank you, bye!"

152
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,723
I know I have to, okay? It's just...

153
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,267
I feel pathetic.

154
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,895
None of this is your fault,
but you cannot let her win this thing.

155
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:22,483
I mean, imagine what she'll do to you
and your family if she gets famous.

156
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,234
I feel like a proper idiot.

157
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,112
Hey, look at me.

158
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,198
I am not afraid of some freak
dressed in sheep's clothing.

159
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,992
If she wants to mess with my friends,

160
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:36,413
I will drop-kick that bitch faster than
she can say, "Have a blessed day."

161
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,665
All right, Covey. Calm down.

162
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,625
Let's go.

163
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,503
[energetic music playing]

164
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,505
[in Korean] Enjoy the show.

165
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,133
Thank you for coming.

166
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,011
It's an honor
to have the school board here.

167
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,262
[Stella sobs]

168
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:56,350
[in English] <i>But beauty is supposed
to come from within.</i>

169
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,520
[Moon] So, Stella was behind MoonLeaks?

170
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,355
Why are you just telling me this now?

171
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,983
Stella bugged your office.

172
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,945
She found out Joon Ho knocked up
that gold-digging backup dancer

173
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,740
and threatened to release the story
unless she wins.

174
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,118
For the last time,
Eunji's not a gold digger.

175
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,786
[Moon] Joon Ho, don't start this again.

176
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,623
I told you, I love her.

177
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,582
I want to marry her.

178
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,001
- No, hold on.
- Wait, you <i>love</i> this girl?

179
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,211

What about your career? Your fans?

185
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,013
You're just gonna walk away from
everything that we have worked for?

186
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:39,142
Not being with Eunji?
Not being in my kid's life?

187
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,062
That would be the real mistake.

188
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,483
And I think out of everyone,
you would understand.

189
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,318
Right, Dad?

190
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,027

[in Korean] Granddad?

192

193

And of course,
I'll support you if that's what you want.

197
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,300
And this might also be
the best way to get out of this mess.

198
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,054

That had to be Stella.

235
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,674
This is sabotage.

236
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,634

He's on in 15 minutes.

are sick to their stomachs.

Okay, don't panic. We've got this.

[continues singing in Korean]

243
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,714
Here's the plan. Dae's music
and visuals have been sabotaged.

244
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,717
Min Ho you're gonna access
the sound system and fix that.

245
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,511
The rest of us
are gonna be Dae's dance crew.

246
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,054
We've all seen him rehearse--

247
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,014
I'm down.

248
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,516
- We can't leave Dae hanging.
- Yeah, I'm down.

249

Me too.

- Okay, what is happening right now?

- Miss Covey.

Not appropriate.

257
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:32,959
Sorry, but Dae's music track is missing,
and we need your, uh, sick guitar skills.

258
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,085
That's preposterous.

Please? Dae's doing this for his family.

Dad, music has always been your dream.

262

Okay, team, let's do this thing.

- Okay.

So you're healed.

268
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,070
You've just been faking.

00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,868
After I got over being jealous of you,
I've been feeling kind of liberated.

for good.

276
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,966
But I didn't wanna tell you because--

277
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:26,263
Because our entire relationship
is based on competition and sport.

278
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,684
Look, while we're being honest,
I have something to tell you too.

279
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,979
I got accepted into
USC's summer training program.

the most important thing is my family.

345
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,733
And I hope you have people
who care about you like that back home.

346
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,444
You're gonna need them.

347
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,699
I'm sorry I lied to you.

348
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,576
[Min Ho] Was any of it real?

349
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,662
[somber music playing]

350
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,874
No.

351
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,335
Not at first.

352
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:10,589
But then, you were different
than I thought you were going to be.

353
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,341
I liked you.

354
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,259
For real.

355
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,887
Only...

356
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,642
I could tell your heart
was never fully in it anyways.

357
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,735
[chimes jingle]

358
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,195
Congratulations, brother.

359
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,238
[Joon Ho] Thank you.

360
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:39,368
I know I haven't been the best brother,
but I want that to change.

361
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,622
Yeah, I'd like that.

362
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,669
[Moon] My two favorite sons.

363
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,379
Oh, favorite <i>sons.</i> Oh, finally.

364
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,507
[Joon Ho] Congratulations.

[crowd cheering]

366
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,349
[Moon] From five outstanding contestants,

367
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:08,313
all but Dae and Eunice
have been eliminated.

368
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:14,027
It was a tough call for the judges,
but a decision has been made.

369
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,447
The winner is...

370
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,534
[suspenseful music playing]

371
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:24,829
...Eunice Kang!

372
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,414
[gasps]

373
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,332
Oh my God!

374
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,667
Thank you!

375
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,961
[Moon] This summer,
Eunice will open for Joon Ho

376
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,589
on his worldwide "Sugar Daddy" tour.

377
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,633
[Dae] Congratulations. You deserve it.

378
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,263
Thank you so much!

379
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,349
[gasps] Thank you!

380
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,771
Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you!

381
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,942
We tried.

382
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,238
Thanks for being such a great friend.

383
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,283
- We're all here for you, you know.
- Yeah.

384
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,784
[Praveena] Jules.

385
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,869
Hey.

386
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,788
Oh, I'm sorry Dae didn't win,
but you were brilliant out there.

387
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,998
You think so?

388
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,209
- Yeah.
- You want me to teach you?

389
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,212
[Praveena] Yeah, how about tonight?

390
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,297
Yuri! Hey, Yuri, wait.

391
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,466
[gloomy music playing]

392
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,302
[Juliana] Uh, I'm sorry.

393
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,806
Praveena and I, we got to talking
at the dance, and it was...

394
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,561
I should have told you.

395
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,314
You still mean a lot to me.

396
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,942
I hope that we could be friends.

397
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,281
I would love that.

398
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,245
[Kim gasps]

399
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,497
[in Korean] Dae!

400
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,083
- [chuckles]
- [Min Ho] Ah.

401
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,210
I'm so proud of you.

402
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,628
[sighs]

403
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,965
I wanted to win. We need the money.

404
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,841
Truthfully,

405
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,346
I didn't know how things would turn out,
so I didn't tell you.

406
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,389
A lawyer called.

407
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,141
There will be a class action lawsuit
against the Han Group.

408
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,353
From now on, we're going to be fine.

409
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:12,854
Don't worry.

410
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,568
[Alex sighs]

411
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,114
[in English] Yuri, I'm sorry.

412
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,575
[tearfully] She was supposed
to want me back.

413
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,119
- And now she's dating--
- Wait.

414
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,997
I thought Jina finally got a hold of you.

415
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,791
[sniffles] Wait, what happened?

416
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,420
It wasn't a mistake that
your credit cards were getting declined.

417
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:42,259
Your father's assets were frozen after
a development in a class action lawsuit.

418
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,179
[scoffs]

419
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,932
[Yuri] So, I'm broke.

[somber music playing]

421
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,940
[Min ho] Anyone else would have given up
on me. You really came through today.

422
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,276
[cell phone vibrates]

423
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,320
[phone unlocks]

424
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,280
Oh no.

425
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,239
What's wrong?

426
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,616
Margot and <i>Halmoni</i> were headed here
to reunite with Soon Ja,

427
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,410
but the flight got canceled.

428
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,413
Margot has a small window
before she goes Scotland for her job--

429
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,457
Covey! Calm down.

430
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,374
Why should I?

431
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,961
Because you know someone
whose dad owns a private jet.

432
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,546
[Kitty] Seriously?

433
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,631

So, um, let me see what I can do about it.

437
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,692
Cool.

00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,230
For 50 years,

447
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,527
I've thought about what I'd say
if I saw you again.

448
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,695
However,

449
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,573
seeing you now,

450
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,911
my heart is overwhelmed.

451
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,248
I'm deeply sorry.

456
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,553
Sister.

457
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,390
Come with me. Come.

[great-aunt] We want
to perform a <i>jesa</i> ritual for Eve.

I regret I didn't do it when she died...

465
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:30,510
Sister, I wanted to give this to you.

466
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,762
Thank you.

467
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,697
[in English] You did this.

468
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,034
I know how important sisters are.

469
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,830
People always say I'm the most like Mom,
but really, you are.

470
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,082
You bring people together.

471
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,627
She'd be so proud of you.

472
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:09,215
When I first came to Korea, I just wanted
to learn more about who Mom was.

473
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,219
But I have learned so much about myself.

474
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:19,017
I mean, this place, it's become just as
much a part of me as it was a part of her.

475
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:23,980
Now that I have all of this,
the last thing I want to do is leave.

476
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,191
Maybe you don't have to.

477
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,693
Hi, it's so nice to meet you!

478
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,405

[Kitty in English] <i>Staying at KISS</i>

00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,954

Well, I have good news.

we've granted your request
to renew your heritage scholarship.

Can I give you a hug?

[tense music playing]

491
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,648
No, not a hugger. Right.

492

A high five?

493
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,612
I'll take it.

[Q] So?

495
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,075
Have you told Min Ho
the news about you staying?

496
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,243
Not yet.

00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,787
Oh, come on. Don't play blasé.

You basically saved his family.

You two clearly have
some epic thing going on here.

501
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,673
I don't know if I would say "epic."

[pensive music playing]

503
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,054
I am just...

504
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,182
terrified. [sighs]

505
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,893
What if he doesn't feel
the same way anymore?

506
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,688
Plus, Stella really screwed him up.

507

[sighs]

508
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,776
Isn't it just

509
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,237
too complicated?

510
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,950
I think that's a question
only you can answer.

511
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,622
But if there is something
you want to tell him,

512
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,541
I happen to know he takes long walks
in the sculpture garden

513
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,502
<i>around this time every day.</i>

514
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,299
So, it's true.

515
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,176
Covey, what are you doing here?

516
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,554
Q told me you've been walking out here.

518
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,353
Go? Go where?

519
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:32,567
I'm leaving tonight, with Joon Ho
and my dad, on their big summer tour.

520
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,403
Oh, wow. Q did not tell me that.

521
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,114
Well, it was really
