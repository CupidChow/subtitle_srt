00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,509
so we have to be extra careful.

169
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,553
Well, my lips are sealed. [giggles]

170
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,722
Oh, and I'm Kitty. You can bunk with me.

171
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,557
[Stella] Oh cool. Um...

172
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,685
Can one of you show me
how to get to the administration office?

173
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,104
- I still have to register--
- Yes, I can show you. Right now.

174
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,441
If you don't sign up ASAP, you'll end up
with the worst professors, so let's go.

175
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,151
Uh, wait, wait. Before you go,

176
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:10,447
we are planning a fun
group barbecue dinner tonight, on me.

177
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,698
Are you guys in? 7:00 p.m.?

178
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,159
Are you kidding?
I would love that. [laughs]

179
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,286
Uh... [sighs]

180
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:20,332
Dang. I wish I could, but I promised
my sisters that I would FaceTime them

181
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,460
and tell them about
the first day back. So...

182
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,962
Won't it be like 2:00 a.m. in Portland?

183
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,341
Indeed, it will be. Yes.

184
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,342
Good point.

185
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,678
Well, I'm... I'm in.

186
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,137
Let's leave right now.

187
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,973
- [Stella] Thank you for showing me around.
- They're in.

188
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,725
- [door opens]
- [Kitty and Stella chatting]

189
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,894
[door closes]

190
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,396
Min Ho, package for you.

191
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,483
[whimsical music playing]

192
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,655
Oh. Probably from my mom.
She's so thoughtful.

193
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,451
Never mind. This is from my dad.

194
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,955
[sighs] My mom would never forget
my skin is chemically sensitive.

195
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,625
These moisturizers are full of parabens.

196
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,293
Right. Um, looks
like your dad wrote you a note.

197
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,420
[Min Ho] Mm-hmm.

198
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,881
He only reaches out
when he needs something.

199
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,550
Probably pissed off his latest wife,

200
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,054
and he needs me to do
some fake PR story about our happy family.

201
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,306
Have at it.

202
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,647
Kitty left her comfort socks here.

203
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,108
Please tell me you're not
about to sniff those socks.

204
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,111
Shut up. It's just...

205
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,155
I'm glad she's here,
and I want to be friends, but...

206
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,365
I'm not over Kitty yet.

207
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,451
[somber music playing]

208
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,086
Did you just see that?

209
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,714
When I mentioned Kitty,
he disappeared into his room.

210
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,842
And since we saw her this morning,
he's acting weird.

211
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,054
Well, I guess it's all my fault.

212
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,474
Remember before break, I, like,

213
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,934
threatened to kill him

214
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,061
because I thought
he was in love with Kitty?

215
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,523
Right, yeah. You... you did do that.

216
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,567
But you didn't mean it.

217
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,444
Of course I didn't, obviously.

218
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,778
And I told him I'm sorry,

219
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,783
and he keeps saying it's okay,
but... clearly... [sighs]

220
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,705
He's feeling awkward,
and I feel like such an idiot.

221
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,998
[gentle music playing]

222
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,208
[indistinct chatter]

223
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,587
[Stella] Oh my goodness.
This place is so daunting.

224
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,048
Seoul is nothing like Pepper Pike, Ohio,
let me tell you.

225
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,301
But Yuri and Juliana seem super sweet.
Are you three super close?

226
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,094
Uh, I wouldn't say super close.

227
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,805
More like... Actually,
don't know what I'd say.

228
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,099
But enough about me.
How did you end up at KISS?

229
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,268
Oh, an exchange program through my church.

230
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,355
Oh, it's so nice to be rooming
with another Korean-American.

231
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,940
- Thanks for showing me the ropes.
- Yeah. Uh, here we are.

232
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,233
I'll meet you at the same spot.

233
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,404
I just have a little errand
to run myself, so... [chuckles awkwardly]

234
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,073
[Kitty] <i>There's been a mistake.</i>

235
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,784
I signed up for a single.

236
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,785
There's no mistake.

237
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:06,499
Our room and board fees have gone up
due to unforeseen tuition deficiencies.

238
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,002
A cheating scandal has led many parents
to withdraw their children from KISS.

239
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,047
The new rate for a single
isn't covered by your scholarship.

240
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:18,260
Well, is there any way I can be in
another suite? With different roommates?

241
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,515
[keyboard clacking]

242
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,393
Yuri Han. Isn't she a friend of yours?

243
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,938
Yes. Yes, indeed. That is the problem.

244
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,856
If I'm gonna focus on my academics,

245
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,484
rooming with a friend
would be a major distraction.

246
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,570
Well, when you put it that way,
I'll see what I can do.

247
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,572
Oh my God, thank you!
Can I give you a hug?

248
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,615
Absolutely not.

249
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,284
Right, of course.

250
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,288
While I have you,
can I ask you one more thing?

251
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,708
If it really is only one. [sighs]

252
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,752
My mom, Eve,

253
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:57,466
apparently had a boyfriend
named Simon while she was here.

254
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,136
Do you... remember him at all?

255
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,096
[gentle music playing]

256
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,807
[Lee takes a deep breath]

257
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,395
Your mom and I weren't particularly close.

258
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,938
And, um...

259
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,066
I don't recall a Simon.

260
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,738
Perhaps he was the young man
she followed to Seoul.

261
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,239
The one her parents didn't approve of.

262
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,157
Wait, what?

263
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,536
Yes, I recall her parents
didn't support her coming to Korea.

264
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,663
Particularly her mother.

265
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,624
No, my mom was always very close
to her parents.

266
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,127
That doesn't sound right.

267
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,004
Maybe I should call my grandma.

268
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,255
[whimsical music playing]

269
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,050
Dad! Ten-minute warning for the assembly.

270
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,680
Fifteen. I asked for a 15-minute warning.

271
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,560
Oh. You said ten. I thought it was...

272
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,354
- [Lee] No, I said 15.
- [Alex splutters]

273
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,567
[overlapping chatter]

274
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,908
This is our auditorium.

275
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,451
Oh look!

276
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,745
I think Yuri and Juliana saved us seats.

277
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:13,500
Or... we could sit here,
next to my other good friend.

278
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,377
This is my friend...

279
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,796
[chuckles]

280
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,215
- Praveena. Nice to meet you.
- [Kitty chuckles]

281
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,801
Praveena! That's so funny.
We know each other.

282
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,844
It's like, uh... "I'm Kitty."

283
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,638
[chuckles] You know. This is Stella.

284
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,140
- Hi. I'm new.
- Hi.

285
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,227
[gentle music playing]

286
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,190
So clearly, you're avoiding
those two girls.

287
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,400
Okay, what happened? Big fight?

288
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,277
- Whose fault was it?
- Um...

289
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,403
[sighs]

290
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,491
If I'm going to be part of your scheme,
I should know what I'm in for.

291
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,243
Plus, I'm nosy.

292
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,663
- [Q] I <i>was</i> saying it right, then.
- Not the whole time. I'm not sure.

293
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,456
But I'd say you were getting--

294
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,999
So it <i>is</i> "<i>joah</i>."

295
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,251
What on earth?

296
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,044
[intense rock music playing]

297
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,128
Isn't that your...

298
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,297
My dad?

299
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,091
Yeah.

300
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:03,758
[sighs]

301
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,177
I'll see you in there?

302
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,555
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.

303
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,308
Dad?

304
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,727
Oh. My Min Ho. [chuckles]

305
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,438
It's been too long.
Come give your daddy a big hug.

306
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,690
Ah!

307
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:22,068
Okay, what are you doing here?
Aren't you meant to be on your tour?

308
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,863
We had to end our tour early.
Your half-sisters Su-Jin and Bianca

309
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,699
realized they were both dating
Dark Star, my new opening act.

310
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,867
Oh.

311
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,996
So I decided to find myself
a new business venture.

312
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,125
Perhaps you heard of the new arts program
I'm funding to save your school.

313
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,751
They are going to put
my name on a building.

314
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,212
Whoa, hey.

315
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,673
<i>You</i> are the new donor?

316
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,424
That's right.

317
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,719
And lucky me, it's a chance
to reconnect with my favorite son.

318
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,721
Your favorite son is Joon Ho.

319
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,724
You wrote a song about him
called "Favorite Son."

320
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,393
Artistic license.

321
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,730
All right. Get back inside.
The show's about to start. Okay?

322
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,611
Students, please take your seats
so we can begin!

323
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,779
[chatter dies down]

324
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,197
[Lee] Thank you.

325
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,910
Students, faculty,
and distinguished board of directors,

326
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,623
welcome to spring semester
at the Korean Independent School of Seoul.

327
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,958
- It's no secret...
- [quietly] Hi.

328
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,335
- Hi.
- FYI, Dae's in a tizzy.

329
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,337
He thinks Min Ho's acting weird
around you,

330
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,840
and he blames himself for accusing Min Ho
of having a crush on you before break.

331
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,468
There's nothing going on
between me and Min Ho. Dae knows that.

332
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,347
I know, but it's complicated.
Dae still has feelings for you.

333
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,474
You just broke up with him. Okay?

334
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,435
He's not gonna get over you that fast.

335
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,895
I'm sorry.

336
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,397
I didn't mean to derail
your drama-free semester.

337
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,024
