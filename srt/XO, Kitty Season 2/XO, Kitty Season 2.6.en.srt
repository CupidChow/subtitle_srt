00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,162
<i>"Happy Lunar New Year 1994."</i>

171
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,997
<i>"Sorry your mom's still mad at you."</i>

172
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,543
<i>"I feel somewhat responsible
for dragging you into this family feud."</i>

173
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,046
Jeez, Grandma, way to hold a grudge.

174
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,342
<i>"Dear Eve,
Dan sounds cool for a white guy,</i>

175
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,052
<i>and you seem head over heels."</i>

176
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,431
<i>"Did you hear your old friend Gina
has a new boyfriend too?"</i>

177
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,391
<i>"Sun-jin Han, total player,</i>

178
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,144
<i>and I'm pretty sure
she's not his only girlfriend."</i>

179
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,272
<i>"I can't believe you convinced
your mother to go back to Korea."</i>

180
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,857
<i>"Remember back in the '90s</i>

181
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,735
<i>when she didn't speak to you
for six months because of this?"</i>

182
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,778
<i>"Now I just have to get my mom on board."</i>

183
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,905
Wait, what?

184
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,365
<i>"And I'm so happy
you're bringing your youngest."</i>

185
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,869
<i>"How cool that Kitty will have her first
passport stamp at three years old."</i>

186
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,871
<i>"Jiwon can't wait
to play with her cousin."</i>

187
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,290
Oh my God.

188
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,168
[cell phone vibrating]

189
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,295
Kitty?

190
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,173
[Kitty] <i>I'm still feeling weird about us,
but I just had to tell you.</i>

191
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,426
My sister's boyfriend gave me a bunch
of letters from Simon to my mom.

192
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,137
<i>It turns out they were
writing each other for years.</i>

193
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,139
And I found out my mom
convinced my grandma

194
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,225
to reunite with her sister
when I was little.

195
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,978
She was gonna bring me
to Korea too, but she...

196
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,816
But she died before...

197
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,361
Before we could go.

198
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,905
<i>I was meant to be part of their reunion.</i>

199
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,698
<i>Oh, Kitty.</i>

200
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,410
Only no, because I'm stuck.

201
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,412
My great-aunt won't let me in the house,

202
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,708
and my cousin Jiwon
has ghosted me on Instagram, so...

203
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,960
<i>Well, what can I do to help?</i>

204
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,586
[somber music playing]

205
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,880
I don't...

206
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,840
I don't really know how you can.

207
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,342
<i>But thanks for listening.</i>

208
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,095
[call disconnects]

209
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,931
[sighs deeply]

210
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:24,437
Luckily for you, this non-pop quiz
is worth only 5% of your final grade.

211
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,275
The earlier you start reviewing
for the final, the better.

212
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,987
That bloke bought you a pen?

213
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,030
What's his name? Pete?

214
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,284
Peter. And... yeah.

215
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,703
I'm sure Stella also loved her pen.

216
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,498
<i>And is using it to write up
her next diabolical plan.</i>

217
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,333
Did you guys go on
some hot date last night?

218
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,336
She barely made it home for curfew check.

219
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,214
None of your business, Covey. [scoffs]

220
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,801
[school bell rings]

221
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,386
[indistinct chatter]

222
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,723
Um, Professor Lee, are there
any TA positions available?

223
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,266
I could really use the money.

224
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,977
Unfortunately, in light of
the MoonLeaks scandal,

225
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,772
the school's been under a lot of heat.
We're bracing for potential budget cuts.

226
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,859
I... I understand. Thank you.

227
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,945
[sighs]

228
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,406
Speaking of MoonLeaks, Min Ho!

229
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,825
Can you please let your father know
that a PR crisis

230
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,370
is not a reason to call off
weeks of classes?

231
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,748
Will do.

232
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,083
[under breath] I don't believe you.

233
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,127
[Min Ho] Dae.

234
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,254
I heard you ask Lee for a job.

235
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,341
I promised your dad
I wouldn't let you do that.

236
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,635
- If you need money, I can always--
- [Moon] Dae!

237
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,552
Yes, sir.

238
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,512
[chuckles] "Sir"?
Can you believe this kid?

239
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,473
Could you excuse us for a minute?

240
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,016
[tense music playing]

241
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,268
[Min Ho] Dae, seriously!

242
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:45,977
Where have you been?

243
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,145
Handling MoonLeaks.

244
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:51,107
I fired several executives, and I had
everyone else sign an iron-clad NDA.

245
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,192
It's behind us.

246
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,569
I hope it didn't have
any negative effect on you.

247
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,945
Oh, not at all.

248
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,783
I've only been pestered by hundreds
of people on every social media platform,

249
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,826
dying to know if you're a sociopath.

250
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,787
- [scoffs]
- Or if you have hair plugs.

251
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,081
Well, I'm about to change
the conversation.

252
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,000
Tonight, I am gathering my best students

253
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,169
to discuss the future
of the Moon Arts Program.

254
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,131
Dad, it's Friday, <i>Bulgeum</i>.
I obviously have plans with my girlfriend.

255
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,969
Oh. She's invited, of course.
I promise, it will be worth it.

256
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,847
Fine. I'll be there.

257
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,523
Thanks for doing this. I...

258
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,359
I know this has been hard for you.

259
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,819
It could have been you running tomorrow.

260
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,737
If I had only known then

261
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,281
how I was gonna feel
about you now, I wouldn't have--

262
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,242
It's okay.

263
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:42,827
Really.

264
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,413
Something I've been meaning to ask you...

265
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,833
Since my dad is going to be at regionals,
would you want to meet him?

266
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,919
<i>The</i> Mr. Olympics?

267
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,837
I would love that.

268
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,755
[tender music playing]

269
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,259
Okay, I should probably
do a couple more sprints.

270
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,761
Or... want to race?

271
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,638
Oh, it's so on.

272
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,808
- The loser has to do 100 burpees.
- [both laugh]

273
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,853
What's the matter? Can't keep up?

274
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,312
[laughs]

275
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,732
[groans]

276
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,108
Shit, shit, shit. Are you okay?

277
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,651
Just rolled my ankle. I'm fine.

278
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,864
- That did not sound fine. You need--
- I said I'm fine!

279
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,492
See? Just need to sleep it off.

280
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,335
[jazz music playing]

281
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,429
Whoa! Such a vibe!

282
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:45,848
What?

283
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,686
Do you think he's gonna have to sell
all that crap when his empire tanks?

284
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,146
- Dude!
- [Madison] What?

285
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,900
Welcome, welcome. My best students
in Entertainment Management.

286
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,486
And the star of
my Acting for K Drama class.

287
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,613
- What?
- Come on in. Come on in, please.

288
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,115
- Thank you.
- Come on in.

289
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,074
For the host.

290
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,453
Oh. Oh, a gift.

291
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,246
[softly] Yeah.

292
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,374
Oh.

293
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,877
Thank you, son.

294
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,756
I know the perfect place for it.

295
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,632
You're welcome, Dad.

296
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,592
[sighs] I'm very touched.

297
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,761
Excuse me.

298
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,263
That's... odd.

299
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:31,559
Is it me, or did he just exhibit
a genuine human emotion?

300
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,896
You should probably go check on him.

301
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,072
[Min Ho] Dad?

302
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,075
Is everything all right?

303
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,577
[sighs]

304
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,581
What have I done with my life, Min Ho?

305
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,250
I barely know my own kids
except as commodities.

306
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,545
And you. I want to be in your life.

307
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,214
Then you might've shown up at <i>Seollal</i>.

308
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,841
Your brother's in trouble. He needs me.

309
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,342
[somber music playing]

310
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,094
Joon Ho got a girl pregnant.

311
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,179
Some backup dancer.

312
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,600
- That's why you missed the ski cabin.
- [sighs] Yeah. Stress is getting to him.

313
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,896
He's having panic attacks,
and he's even talking about quitting.

314
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,815
You can't tell anyone.

315
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,440
[sighs] I won't.

316
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,318
I know it's terrible timing
with the MoonLeaks scandal.

317
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:26,657
If I lose my biggest star,
it's over, and I'll have nothing.

318
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,079
That's not true, Dad.

319
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:38,627
I made mistakes, and it means a lot
that you showed up for me tonight.

320
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,680
Kitty? You're kind of staring.

321
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,892
Oh no. I was just admiring your makeup.
I've never been good at contour.

322
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,185
[Stella] Hmm.

323
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,270
Where did you get your nose done?

324
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,563
Excuse me?

325
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,941
Oh no, don't misunderstand.
It's really nice.

326
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,692
Uh... [chuckles]

327
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,236
God gave me this nose.

328
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,614
Sorry!

329
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,949
- My bad. [chuckles]
- [door opens, closes]

330
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,787
She's totally lying.
I know a rhinoplasty when I see one.

331
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,582
- Interesting.
- Wanna know who else at school has one?

332
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,377
I'm... I'm good, for now.

333
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,004
Okay.

334
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,886
Pretty nice place, huh?

335
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,220
[Stella] Seriously.

336
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,139
There are no skyscrapers in Pepper Pike.

337
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,391
[Kitty sighs]

338
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,144
- Hello, darling.
- Hi.

339
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,897
You were right, as usual.

340
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,941
I'm glad I went over to talk to him.

341
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,568

513
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,049
She even got me a gift for him.
You have no idea how happy that made him

514
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,303
or what it means to me
to have a better relationship with him.

515
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,806
And second of all,
not everyone is in a fake relationship.

516
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,142
- No, not everyone. Stella.
- Enough!

517
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:42,105
It was bad enough you broke my heart.
You trying to break up my relationship?

518
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,357
I... broke your heart?

519
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:52,198
Why do you think I jumped into
a rebound relationship with Stella?

520
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,576
And now that I'm past all that
and actually really care about her,

521
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,411
you try to tear us apart because what?

522
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,787
Are you jealous or something?

523
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,789
You're my friend.
I wanna look out for you.

524
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,042
Well, don't!

525
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,381
[Peter] Maybe Min Ho just needs
time to process.

526
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,759
It's a lot to handle.

527
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,511
[Kitty] I've never seen him
so angry before.

528
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,138
When am I gonna learn
to just mind my own business?

529
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,807
All I do is ruin things
for myself and for other people.

530
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,894
Hey, that is not true.

531
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,021
Remember when you mailed out
Lara Jean's love letters?

532
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:27,358
You not minding your business
landed me the love of my life.

533
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,653
Kitty, you have this killer instinct.

534
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,073
It is literally your superpower.

535
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,283
So stop second-guessing yourself.

536
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,954
Who cares if Min Ho wasn't ready
to hear what you had to say?

537
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,581
It doesn't mean you're wrong.

538
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,209
Thank you, Peter.

539
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,507
- You are Kitty Song Fricking Covey.
- [chuckles]

540
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,093
Don't you forget it.

541
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,054
- You're the best.
- Mm.

542
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,639
[Kitty] I'm so glad you came.

543
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,724
Me too.

544
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,979
[sighs] Do you like your latte?

545
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,896
I do.

546
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,982
