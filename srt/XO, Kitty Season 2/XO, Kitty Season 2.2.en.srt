because of you and because of Simon."

[sighs] Jina has to know
something about Simon.

3
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,768
Why else would my mom
mention him in her letter?

4
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,062
I mean,
Yuri emailed her mom to ask, right?

5
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:25,524
Yeah, but Jina's at some wellness retreat
and doesn't have any service.

6
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,860
[sighs] It is killing me to be this close

7
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,862
to finding the guy
that my mom was so in love with

8
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,197
that she moved here
against her parents' wishes.

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,533
I always thought
my mom was this perfect daughter.

10
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,660
Those are the only stories
that I ever heard.

11
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:41,040
[sighs] I guess when someone passes,
you kind of forget their flaws.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,626
Well, this is the first time that
my mom actually feels like a real person.

[Q chuckles]

14
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,463
I have to find Simon.

15

He can tell me things about her
that nobody else can.

are still in their honeymoon phase, huh?

They're always tickle-fighting.

19
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,894
I tear them apart for curfew so the RA
doesn't figure out they're a couple.

Doesn't that bother you?

Oh, not at all!

22
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,690
Their squeals of joy
act as a helpful reminder

23
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,484
for me to stay focused on my goals.

24

You're always hiding out in your room.
Come hang out with us.

39
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,565
Yeah, come distract us.

40
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,235
Otherwise, an RA
might walk in and catch us making out.

- [Yuri] Oh!
- [chuckles] Uh, sure.

42

no making out unless we're
in the bedroom with the doors closed.

44
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:03,038
Suddenly, I'm just feeling so, so sleepy.

- [Yuri] Oh, okay.

46
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:09,003
- [whispers] Sorry.
- Uh, actually, Yuri, quick question.

47
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,421
Yeah? What's up?

48
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,508

from Jina about my mom's letter?

Oh, sorry. Nothing yet.

51

I mean, the wellness retreat
is supposed to be off the grid.

52
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:24,393
Right. Well, maybe if you give me the name
of the retreat, I could try and call them?

Dude, seriously?

195
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:48,736
I agree. In fact, Min Ho and I had
identical feedback for each singer.

Stella, you were
the only student who voted for Mihee.

00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,784
- Why?
- I didn't want to hurt her feelings.

198
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,579
It's hurtful to let someone with no talent

the same way that she stonewalled me.

to my mom right now

I was cool with it.

she would add another person

She's been looking forward to tonight,
but ever since she ran into you,

she's just been... upset about something.

451

I found out that
Yuri's been lying to me about her mom,

452

and I confronted her about it today.

453
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:18,068
Right. So Yuri's pissed at you
for not minding your business.

Uh, maybe, but she's also clearly hurting,

is making her feel worse.

00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,245
Yuri was so happy when she came out
and had her mom's support.

457

Support that her mom
pretty much snatched away.

458
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,458
Yes, but I'm sure
Jina doesn't see it that way.

I bet she thinks she's protecting Yuri,
which I know is wrong and messed up,

but I don't know.

461
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,676
I feel like if Yuri talked to her,
Jina would step up and do better.

462

So Jina deserves a free pass?

463

No, absolutely not,

It is.

she did not want to talk to Jina.

And I'm following her lead,

and tell her your feelings, she'd step up.
