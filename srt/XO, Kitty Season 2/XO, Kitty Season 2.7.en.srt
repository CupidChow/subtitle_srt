she'd be okay with it.

But when I heard about the tour
with Joon Ho, I had an epiphany.

00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,878
You know what they say.

519
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,089
If you can't beat them, join them, right?

520
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,967
- Your dad's gonna make me a star.

And you're gonna help.

522
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,346
Now, why would I do that?

523
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,683
'Cause if you don't,
I'll make sure the world finds out

524
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,852

on Kitty's laptop

00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,703
Hopefully, I won't have to.
