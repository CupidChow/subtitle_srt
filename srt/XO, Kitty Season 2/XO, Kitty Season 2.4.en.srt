[chimes jingling]

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,023
Covey! Cars are here. Let's go.

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,441
[music fades]

5
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,110
[tense music playing]

6
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,779
[sighs]

7
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,324
- I'll... I'll see you down there.
- [gasps]

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,661
- Hi.
- Uh, hi.

9
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,873
- [door closes]
- Covey, what on earth was that?

10
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,750
Oh, so you saw that?

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,502
[splutters] Since when
do you even like Yuri?

12
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,171
Yesterday you were all about Praveena.

13
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:51,926
[sighs] Okay, the truth is, I started
having feelings for her last semester.

14
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,137
It's... it's part of
why I broke up with Dae.

15
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,182
So, when Dae almost punched me
in the face...?

16
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,559
He knew that I had feelings
for somebody else,

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,853
and he thought that it was you.

18
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,813
What am I gonna do now?

19
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,315
I need to talk to Yuri.

20
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,484
What you do now is get to the cars.

21
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,862
And try not to ruin my ski weekend.

22
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,032
Right. Okay.

23
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,950
[quietly] Okay.

24
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,409
[sighs deeply]

25
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,496
[bright music plays]

26
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,831
[music fades]

27
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,584
[indistinct chatter]

28
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,044
I didn't think you'd come.

29
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,838
Yeah, I know.

30
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,048
We have a lot to talk about.

31
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,384
- [girls cheering]
- Seollal ski weekend, baby! [laughs]

32
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,137
I don't think I can do this.

33
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,431
- [sighs]
- Guess who!

34
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,016
- Hey.
- Hi.

35
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,978
Oh, I think Yuri and Juliana made up.
Should we ride with them?

36
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,274
That one seems full.
Why don't you take this one?

37
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,943
This weekend's gonna be so fun.

38
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,153
[Kitty giggles, inhales sharply]

39
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,198
- [Praveena] Thank you.
- Yep. It's gonna be one for the books.

00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,033
["Nun Nu Nan Na" by Cignature playing]

41
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,285

00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,788
[energetic K-pop continues]

43
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,095
- [pop music fades]
- Wow.

44
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,681
- [excited chatter]
- [gasps] It's beautiful up here.

45
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,976
Got to admit, I've missed this place.

46
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,478
Hey, can we talk? I'm freaking out.

47
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,480
Not right now. It's too risky.

48
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,649
[Kitty sighs]

49
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,568
[exhales deeply]

50
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,444
[Dae] Eunice.

51
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,738
[in Korean] Let me get that for you.

52
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,370
What did you pack?
We're only here two days.

53
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,915
I like to be prepared.

54
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,585
[in English] For the apocalypse?

55
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,257
Sorry.

56
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,885
[in Korean] I'll clean it.
I'm sure it's expensive--

57
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,512
Don't worry, it's a fake.

58
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,889
But I thought you were rich.

59
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,224
No, I'm not.

60
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:08,896
- I live in the same neighborhood as you.
- Really?

61
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,274
[in English] You really don't know me
at all.

62
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,986
All right. Dad will be here
in a few hours.

63
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,364
Tomorrow, we ski Alpensia
and have dinner by Baek Jong Won.

64
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,991
- [Q] All right.
- [Praveena] Wow.

65
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,952
All right, settle down. Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.

66
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,078
Let's go!

67
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,999
- Korean Kris Jenner.
- [Praveena laughs]

68
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,711
- There's, like, no photos of you.
- Thanks for noticing, Madison.

69
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,880
Wait, is this your brother?

70
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,714
[Min Ho] Half-brother.

71
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,344
Joon Ho is Dad's firstborn,
and best-selling artist.

72
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,638
Moving on.

73
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,264
- [gasps]
- [laughs] Oh my God.

74
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,683
- Jump scare.
- [Q] Yeah.

75
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,518
- Talk about a full moon.
- [phone alert chimes]

76
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,772
- [Kitty laughs]
- Oh, speaking of...

77
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,153
[flatly] He's not coming.

78
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,155
[gently] Min Ho. Uh...

79
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,950
Since my dad decided to bail,

80
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,327
some of the girls
can use the primary suite.

81
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,914
The boys can take the back bedroom.
There's also a pullout in my dad's office.

82
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,125
- He has an office here?
- Dibs.

83
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,170
I... I need the single.
I'm a night screamer.

84
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,588
- No, you're not.
- Fine.

85
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,840
- It's bubble guts.
- [Madison groans] Okay.

86
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,342
Okay, none of you'd know this,

87
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,637
but intense running
actually causes intense... runs.

88
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,640
- Okay, spare us the deets. Room's yours.
- Okay.

89
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,268
We should get to bed
if we're gonna hit the slopes early.

90
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,353
[softly] Good night.

91
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,274
[somber music playing]

92
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,526
[gently] Hey.

93
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,614
You know, coming here was all his idea.

94
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,994
But the second
precious Joon Ho is available,

95
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,663
he drops me.

96
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,456
He's never put me first.

97
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,834
This... This must be really hard.

98
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,169
I wish I didn't care.

99
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,754
I get it.

100
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,592
I mean, there have been plenty of times
when I felt like I'm not enough either.

101
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,932
Doesn't church help with things like that?

102
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,895
God can't fix everything, Min Ho.

103
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,772
Really?

104
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,983
I thought that was his whole deal.

105
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,484
[Stella chuckles]

106
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,402
No?

107
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,488
- [wind whistling]
- [gentle music playing]

108
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,700
[Kitty] <i>Only a few hours ago,
Yuri and I were kissing.</i>

109
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,036
<i>Is she thinking about it as much as I am?</i>

110
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,413
Cool if I sleep here?

111
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,167
Yeah, of course.
The more the merrier. [chuckles]

112
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,377
[squeals] This is giving
slumber party vibes.

113
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,504
[gasps] Who's gonna start the girl talk?

114
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,590
We could play Never Have I Ever.

115
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,050
Get to the real dirt.

116
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,636
[yawns loudly] I'm really beat.

117
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,016
I forgot to brush my teeth,
so I'm gonna go do that.

118
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,893
Right now. [chuckles]

119
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,895
Kitty, don't you need this?

120
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,688
[chuckles awkwardly]

121
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,607
Thank you.

122
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,528
- Hi. Thank God you got the single.
- Hey.

123
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,156
I really need to tell you something.

124
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,074
Yuri and I kissed.

125
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,284
Huh? When?

126
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,871
A few hours ago,
right after Juliana and her had a fight.

127
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,291
I don't even know what to think.
The kiss was amazing, but--

128
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,877
What about Juliana? And Praveena?

129
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,003
Exactly.

130
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:25,425
I feel horrible about Juliana,
and I like Praveena. I really do. But--

131
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,553
That is why you wrote that letter.
So you wouldn't get into a mess like this.

132
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,139
But this changes everything.

133
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,766
- Oh my God! Who--
- It's okay.

134
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,059
He's... he's with me.

135
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,144
It's okay. We're good.
Yeah. [inhales sharply]

136
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,188
You brought Jin?

137
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,399
You know that
Dae and Min Ho hate him, right?

138
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,943
Okay, let's not throw stones, chaos queen.

139
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,279
Jin's family has a place nearby,
and he'll be gone by the morning,

140
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,324
- Min Ho and Dae, none the wiser.
- Hey, Kitty.

141
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,909
Hi.

142
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,746
Okay, I will give you guys some space.

143
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,041
- Hey, just... be careful.
- [sighs]

144
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,295
The way things are going, someone's
getting their heart broken this weekend.

145
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,631
[sighs]

146
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,760
[Kitty] <i>Q is totally right.</i>

147
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,431
<i>And that person could very well be me.</i>

148
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,978
- [wind gusting]
- [energetic music playing]

149
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,896
Wow, I'm so excited!

150
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,566
I haven't been snowboarding
once yet this winter.

151
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,942
I barely even slept.

152
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,069
Mm, me either.

153
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,906
I'm staying here. I'd much rather
read a book than risk breaking my neck.

154
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,616
Is the Wi-Fi down?

155
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,368
I have no bars.

156
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,911
[Min Ho] I've got bad news.

157
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,872
I just popped my head outside.

158
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,623
There was a blizzard last night.

159
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,792
Must've knocked down the service
and the Wi-Fi.

160
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,587
Bummer. But that means
great skiing, right?

161
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,673
Unfortunately, no.
We're not going anywhere.

162
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,717
It takes a day to clear the roads.

163
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,553
So there's no way out?

164
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,972
We're trapped?

165
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,848
[wind whistling]

166
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,934
[tense music playing]

167
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:05,568
[shivers] Min Ho, can't you make it
any warmer in here?

168
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,988
Next Seollal, book a flight to Cebu.

169
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,204
How do I turn on this fireplace?

170
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,043
It's decorative, Dae.
All we can do is bundle up.

171
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,838
This house is old, so the wood is warped
around those single-pane windows.

172
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,509
Basically, it acts like a sieve
for the cold air outside.

173
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,385
[laughs]

174
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,847
[in Korean] You thought
I was rich and dumb?

175
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,892
I'll give you a pass 'cause you're cute.

176
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,897
- [in English] I should wake up Q.
- No.

177
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,775
[hesitates] He went to bed very late.

178
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,320
I heard the toilet flush,
like, 1,000 times.

179
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,367
Guys, what are we supposed to do
stuck here all day with no Wi-Fi?

180
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,370
I have no idea, but I cannot feel my toes.

181
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,165
Min Ho, are you sure there's not one part
of this house that is not freezing?

182
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,252
Oh my gosh, how did I forget? The hot tub!

183
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,671
- You have a hot tub?
- Yes!

184
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,382
I have to go to the bathroom.

185
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,758
Just one minute.

186
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,511
Have you heard of knocking?

187
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,055
Have you looked outside?

188
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,224
We're trapped.

189
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,561
It snowed? But Jin has to go
back to his parents' place.

190
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,396
Clearly, that's no longer an option.

191
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,480
I don't know what to do.

192
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,482
How do I act normal
when I'm surrounded by--

193
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,650
Both of your girlfriends?

194
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,735
In a hot tub.
And they're not my girlfriends.

195
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:35,740
What if we distract Juliana and Praveena
so you could get a chance to talk to Yuri?

196
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,118
Or be there to have your back
when things get awkward.

197
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,953
Yes, that's perfect. Thank you.

198
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,414
Uh, no. [scoffs]

199
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,832
I... I mean...

200
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,793
Obviously, I will help you, Kitty,
but you're not supposed to be here.

201
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,420
So, can we have a minute?

202
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,256
Yes, of course. Sorry.

203
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,678
You don't seriously expect me
to just stay hidden in here.

204
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,887
Uh, yeah.

205
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,890
Min Ho and Dae hate you,
and rightfully so. You bullied them.

206
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,893
And if they find out we still hook up
after your track meet sabotage,

207
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,312
they'll never let me live it down.

208
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,315
So, you are gonna stay here,
and I'll be right back.

209
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,484
[Kitty] Q, hurry up. We need help
shoveling out the hot tub.

210
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,529
- [door closes]
- [Jin sighs]

211
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,908
- [indistinct chatter]
- [mellow pop music playing]

212
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,370
[Praveena] Everything okay?

213
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,831
Couldn't be better.

214
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,876
Where's Stella?

215
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,128
She's inside with a book.

216
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,718
Uh, it's just, my shoulder hurts
from clearing all that snow.

217
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,428
Oh, let me help.

218
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,012
Trust me.

219
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,181
Ah?

220
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,351
[grunting]

221
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,189
- Okay.
- It hurts worse if you fight it.

222
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,691
- [Dae groaning]
- [giggles]

223
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,027
Hey, I meant to ask.

224
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,863
Did you ever find a VCR to watch
the video from the time capsule?

225
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,741
Um, yeah. I... I watched it
with Yuri before we left.

226
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,161
And? Was it everything you hoped for?
Did your mom say anything about Simon?

227
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,330
Well, he was actually the one filming it.

228
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,289
Oh wow.

229
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,459
Yeah, I mean, I found his real name
and the town that he lived in.

230
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,920
- So, after this trip, I'm gonna--
- You can track him down.

231
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,048
I'll come, if you want.
I am great at stalking, along with heists.

232
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,841
Oh, Yuri actually said that...

233
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,927
- Ah.
- Never mind.

234
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,347
Um, where are Yuri
and Juliana, by the way?

235
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,016
So everything is Moon branded?

236
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,103
What are the chances Min Ho lured us here
to join his dad's cult?

237
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,231
- We should take these outside.
- Uh...

238
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,942
I was thinking that we could talk first,
since we're finally alone.

239
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,821
Look, I was really pissed that you missed
my art show 'cause you were with Kitty.

240
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,117
- Babe, I already told you--
- Just let me finish, okay?

241
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:48,748
I felt... so alone when I was sent
to Oakham last semester.

242
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,627
It was like my world had just stopped.

243
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,965
And there you were,
making all these new friends.

244
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,216
And you and Kitty got so close.

245
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,969
When I came back, it just felt like
you had already replaced me.

246
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,680
- Babe...
- I know it was not rational.

247
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,642
And I realized that
after storming off last night.

248
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,811
I've been letting
my insecurities get the best of me,

249
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,940
when I could just be honest
about what's going on.

250
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,860
It got to the point where I thought
that you'd cheat on me with Kitty,

251
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:22,198
and I know that is not fair,
and I am so, so sorry.

252
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,577
You don't owe me an apology.

253
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,412
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

254
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,498
[gentle music playing]

255
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:35,713
Kitty is my friend,
but no one can ever, ever replace you.

256
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,176
You have my whole heart.

257
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,387
And I ruined everything.

258
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,724
[softly] No. Look at me.

259
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:51,562
Look, we're not gonna let a dumb fight
get in the way of what we have, okay?

260
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,898
I love you.

261
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,525
I love you too.

262
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,861
[gently] Come here.

263
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,701
[Madison] So, the thing about
the markets in Marrakesh

264
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,037
is there's always
plainclothes officers around.

265
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,664
- So, I ended up--
- You could legit be a spy.

266
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,167
Like, the CIA should recruit you, stat.

267
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,627
[squeals] Thank you.

268
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,129
That's so sweet of you to say.

269
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,632
- I wonder if I could kill someone.
- All right, okay.

270
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,175
[group laughs]

271
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,092
Hey, guys.

272
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,803
- [Q] Oh, hey.
- Hi.

273
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,180
- [Min Ho] Hello.
- Hey.

274
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:30,934
[distant scream]

275
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,269
- [Eunice] What is happening?
- [Q] Is that Stella?

276
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,313
Stella! You all right?

277
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,524
I was looking for blankets.
I found him in the armoire.

278
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,151
What are you doing here?

279
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,736
[tense music playing]

280
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,238
[scoffs]

281
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,282
Would you believe that he's stalking me?

282
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,367
[sighs]

283
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,702
- [indistinct chatter]
- Hey, can we talk?

284
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,912
Are you two...

285
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,747
- [sighs]
- [giggles]

286
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,082
Okay, so look.

287
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,377
We both know it was a mistake, right?

288
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:02,048
Juliana and I had a fight, I was confused,
and we just got caught up in the moment,

289
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,467
watching that video.

290
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,885
Thank you for telling me how I feel.

291
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,681
Come on. You're into Praveena, right?

292
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,349
[somber music playing]

293
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,186
And I'm in love with Juliana.

294
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,109
Right.

295
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,531
So, can we agree that
we keep this between us? Because...

296
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,993
otherwise, it's going to ruin everything.

297
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,915
Can't you just
go over there and apologize?

298
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,918
No, they should be over it by now.

299
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,678
[exhales] Lucky for you,
I was prepared for the apocalypse.

300
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,096
[Dae] Thanks.

301
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,856
Oh my God. Guess what I found in our room.
I think it's a love letter.

302
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,775
Oh, let me see.

303
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,153
"When we first met, I thought
we were opposites. But then I thought,

304
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,616
"What if the universe made us
partners in crime for a reason?"

305
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,784
Oh my God, wait.

306
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,703
Partners? Opposites?

307
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,621
[gasps]

308
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,915
I think Dae wrote this for me! [exclaims]

309
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,834
I didn't know that he felt this way.

310
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,627
- [Praveena] Hey.
- Hey.

311
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,629
I'm getting kind of worried about Kitty.

312
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,299
I haven't seen her in a while,
and she keeps running off to the bathroom.

313
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,843
Maybe she has your... stomach thing.

314
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,845
Right. Yeah. [inhales sharply]

315
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,723
- I'll go check on her.
- Thanks.

316
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,726
Hey, Kitty.

317
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,520
- Hi.
- [Q] Oh.

318
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,648
- Hey.
- I should have known better.

319
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,276
- [tearfully] Yuri said that--
- Hey, forget about Yuri.

320
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,863
Praveena's out there,
and she really likes you.

321
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,408
So what? I'm supposed to act like
this kiss didn't happen?

322
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,077
Doesn't that make me a liar?

323
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,914
I mean, it's not like
you guys were exclusive, right?

324
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,085
[sighs]

325
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,006
Eunice, are you okay?

326
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,466
[in Korean] I found the letter!

327
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,551
What letter?

328
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,386
It's okay.

329
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,513
I feel the same way.

330
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,974
- [in English] What are you talking about?
- [scoffs]

331
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,602
Dae, you can be honest with me!
Like what's written in the letter...

332
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,229
[in English] "You always play it cool,

333
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,231
but I wonder
if you feel what I'm feeling."

334
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,317
"Even when we argue,
I feel like we're connected."

335
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,360
[gasps]

336
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,237
[in Korean] Oh, Dae!

337
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,116
Can... I see that letter?

338
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,659
Uh-huh.

339
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,868
It doesn't have a name on it.

340
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,414
Dae, I know it's for me. Look.

341
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,708
[in English]
"You're so hardheaded sometimes,

342
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,334
it drives me crazy."

343
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,336
You're telling me
this is not how you feel?

344
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:49,799
Eunice, I am not a writer.
I'm more of a... math person.

345
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,010
Oh.

346
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,303
Oh my God.

347
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,306
You... didn't write it.

348
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,560
Eunice, I didn't write the letter, but...

349
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,561
[Eunice] Hmm?

350
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,188
I did underestimate you.

351
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,275
You're not a spoiled rich girl.
You're smart.

352
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,901
And that massage
you gave me in the hot tub,

353
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:12,531
that was the most agonizing pain
I've ever experienced.

354
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,451
But I feel so much better now.

355
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,911
You're more than just a very,

356
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,581
very pretty face.

357
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,081
[in Korean] So...

358
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,334
Of course,
it's a little soon for love letters.

359
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:29,256
When we get back to Seoul,
would you like to get dinner with me?

360
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,550
[in English] It's a date.

361
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:32,967
Yeah.

362
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,638
[in Korean] Wait a minute,
if you didn't write this, whose is this?

363
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,059
What are you guys talking about?

364
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,602
- [in English] What is this?
- Some love letter.

365
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,561
[Madison] Ooh.

366
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,480
Hey, do you mind if I join you?

367
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,901
Not at all. I could use some help
with Moon's left cheek. [chuckles]

368
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,195
Have you been to Lotte World?

369
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,531
It's an amusement park.
I was thinking that we could go together.

370
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,658
I'd love that.

371
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,660
[Kitty exhales]

372
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,455
Hello.

373
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,833
I'm sorry, Min Ho,
but I do not feel comfortable with this.

374
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:10,088
We broke up ages ago,
and... Stella's a nice girl.

375
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,590
You can't go around writing love letters
to old flames.

376
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,175
What on earth are you on about?

377
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,178
- I didn't write you a letter.
- [sighs] Okay.

378
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,598
[clears throat] It says right here,

379
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,726
"You are way more than the spoiled
rich girl everybody else sees."

380
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,105
Okay, duh. That is so me-coded.

381
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:30,775
I'm very invested in my girlfriend,
thank you very much.

382
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,861
Have you seen her around, by the way?

383
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,953
- [Madison] Do you know who wrote this?
- [Jin] Wrote what?

384
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,870
What?

385
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,455
[gasps]

386
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,166
Maybe Yuri wrote it to me.

387
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,211
Guys, I can't keep up,
but that does make a lot of sense.

388
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,546
[Praveena] Hey, what is that?

389
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,381
Kitty, did you write a letter about me?

390
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,342
I had no idea you felt so strongly,
but someone found a letter,

391
00:18:56,343 --> 00:19:00,596
and I read some of it, and it sounded like
you were saying you were in love with me.

392
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,057
Oh my God!

393
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,812
"You helped me discover
a whole new side of myself."

394
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,439
"I thought I knew everything about love."

395
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,399
"After all--"

396
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,567
- Give me that.
- Whoa!

397
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,153
No, you wait your turn
like everybody else.

398
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:20,033
"I thought I knew everything about love.
After all, I am a matchmaker."

399
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,705
Oh my God.

400
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,000
This is about Yuri.

401
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,835
Why did you bring this here?

402
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,628
I didn't. I swear.

403
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,798
You both were acting
really weird last night.

404
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,010
Something happened?

405
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,638
Yuri...

406
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,058
Tell me I'm wrong.

407
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,025
[Yuri] Wait. Hey!

408
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,278
[Yuri] I am so sorry.
That really didn't mean anything.

409
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,031
[Juliana] Please, just leave me alone.

410
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,828
So, what did happen anyway?

411
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,331
We kissed.

412
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,708
Right before the trip.

413
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,087
You knew I was worried about this.

414
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,467
You swore to me that you were over Yuri.

415
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:23,846
I don't appreciate being brought up here
as what?

416
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,598
Like... like, a backup?

417
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,100
No, God, no. I like you.

418
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:32,564
You are amazing and interesting
and probably way too cool for me.

419
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:39,154
What happened with Yuri
was obviously a massive mistake.

420
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,116
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

421
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,117
But it did.

422
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,036
[gentle music playing]

423
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,705
I'm gonna leave
just as soon as the roads are cleared.

424
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,875
But for now, I'm gonna hang in here.

425
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,419
Can you go?

426
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,593
[wind whistling]

427
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,890
[Yuri] What do you mean? I'm not lying.

428
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:16,108
[sighs] Min Ho, Dae,
let's finish this once and for all.

429
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,693
Are you gonna fight them?

430
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,736
- Dude...
- No.

431
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,197
I'm gonna apologize.

432
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,825
- I'm sorry I bullied you two, okay?
- [both] No.

433
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,744
A begrudging apology is not enough.

434
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,497
[sighs] Fine.

435
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,915
You know what? Bully me.

436
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,208
Then we'll be even.

437
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,545
- Jin, come on.
- It just got interesting again.

438
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,631
I'm serious, okay?
Bully me. I can take it. Come on.

439
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,883
You have very large pores.

440
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,593
You're just a B-grade student.

441
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:48,055
Also, you picked your nose
all through fourth grade.

442
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,099
And once in the library,
I saw you eat a booger.

443
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,183
[both] Ew.

444
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,727
This isn't helping.

445
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,062
And we all know that you are the one

446
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,648
who farted on the class field trip
to the Songam Space Center.

447
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,860
You... You smelled up the entire bus.

448
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,279
- Jin.
- Okay, now you're just making shit up.

449
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,407
Oh, admit it! And we might have a truce.

450
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,783
- No, I--
- [Dae] No.

451
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,952
You heard the man.

452
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,329
Admit it!

453
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,336
Okay, fine. I admit it.

454
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,048
I'm a large-pored,
booger-eating, bus-farting loser.

455
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,258
That's how much I like you.

[group] Aww.

457
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,056
- It's okay.
- I don't pick my boogers anymore.

458
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,099
- Okay.
- Promise.

No, thank you.

but she was definitely opening up
his desk drawers before she found me.

518
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,154
Oh, that's...

519
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,030
weird.

520
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,116
[unsettling music playing]

521
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,329
[Kitty] <i>What would Stella be looking for
in Moon's office?</i>

522
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,333
<i>And whatever she was looking for,
did she find it?</i>

523
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,838
<i>If Stella can snoop, so can I.</i>

524
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,262
<i>Forget Moon's office.</i>

525
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,015
<i>Why the hell did Stella take my letter?</i>

526
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,061
[tense music subsides]

527
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,104
Stella?

528
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,858
Before you say anything,
there's something you need to see.

529
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,614
All right.

530
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,534
These are...

531
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:22,664
Report cards, birthday cards
you wrote your dad, drawings.

532
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,043
I found them in his office
when I ran into Jin.

533
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,461
My dad kept all of these?

534
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,591
He loves you,
even if he's bad at showing it.

535
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,510
And you deserve to know that.

536
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,431
It's time to explain you and Kitty.

537
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,606
I did have feelings for Kitty.

538
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,524
And I told her,

539
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:53,236
on the plane to LA last semester.

540
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,322
She turned me down.

541
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,906
It's all over now.

542
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:58,825
I'm with you.

543
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,163
Thank you for telling me the truth.

544
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,291
[Dae] Why didn't you tell <i>me</i> the truth?

545
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,838
Dae, I can explain.

546
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,340
What's going on?

547
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,760
You made a move on Kitty on the plane?

548
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,096
And you're supposed to be my best friend.

549
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:24,516
I <i>am</i> your best friend, Dae. Listen to me.

550
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,602
Shut up.

551
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,603
[somber music playing]

552
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,649
I don't want to talk to you, ever again.

553
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:32,942
We're done.

554
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:37,989
[Kitty] Dae, wait!

555
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,241
[door slams]

00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:41,992
