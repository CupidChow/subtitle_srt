1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,345
[energetic music playing]

2
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,432
[indistinct chatter]

3
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,606
Oh, sorry.

4
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,358
Yeah. You've been saying that a lot.

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,361
[Kitty] <i>Things have been pretty tense
since I let it slip to Professor Lee</i>

6
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,071
<i>that Yuri and Juliana are dating.</i>

7
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,824
Like I said, I swear
I didn't know Lee was standing there.

8
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,200
It was a total accident.

9
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,412
So you're ruining lives without trying?

10
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,331
- I really am sorry.
- [message alert chimes]

11
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,293
[clicks tongue] I've never seen
such deep regret.

12
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,669
Oh. No, this is Praveena.

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,756
[sighs] I was so worried that
I messed things up the night at the club.

14
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,216
You were ignoring her
'cause you were obsessing over Yuri?

15
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,677
That was because she was upset,
to be fair.

16
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,179
And something you totally solved.

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,264
Yeah, with your advice.

18
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,975
Who even remembers the details?

19
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,144
I think Praveena
could still be my first kiss.

20
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,812
First girl kiss. Right?

21
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:06,398
I have some work
that I gotta get done before class.

22
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,234
No, I can shut up. Don't leave.
You can finish your cereal.

23
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,070
[Juliana] Kitty, I have to go.

24
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,654
[whimsical music playing]

25
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,948
[under breath] Cool.

26
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,200
- [door closes]
- [sighs]

27
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,286
[bright music plays]

28
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,790
[music fades]

29
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,167
[in Korean] I can't believe
you have to work this weekend.

30
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,211
It's Seollal.

31
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:31,298
Our ancestors won't mind
that we had <i>tteokguk</i> a day early.

32
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,175
- [sighs]
- [Mr. Kim chuckles]

33
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,053
- [yawns]
- I'm just worried about you.

34
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,388
- You just work all the time.
- [sighs]

35
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,891
I'm the dad and you're worrying about me?

36
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,020
When did you get so grown up?
You're all grown up!

37
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,397
- ["Camellia Lady" playing]
- Ahh, this song is so good!

38
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,776
This is a bit of an old song,
but it's one of your mother's favorites.

39
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,778
You're right. Her favorite song.

40
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,863
[bittersweet ballad continues]

41
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,575
[singing along in Korean]

42
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,915
You're really good at singing, huh?

43
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,959
It's such a relief
you take after your mom.

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,044
[Dae chuckles]

45
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,005
- I'm taking off.
- Okay. Go ahead.

46
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,300
- Okay. I'll be home later.
- Okay.

47
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,805
[Dae sighs]

48
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,598
Hey, Dae Kim!

49
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,725
Hey.

50
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,727
How is it living back home?

51
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,980
Oh, well. My room's
a bit smaller, but it's fine.

52
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,107
Your dad didn't say anything
about living with your mom?

53
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,527
Oh, he was furious and said
I was taking my mom's side.

54
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,279
[in English] I do miss living
in the dorms, though.

55
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,199
I miss Juliana, and I miss... Kitty!

56
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,951
Hey!

57
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,369
[Dae] Hey.

58
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,871
[Juliana] Yuri!

59
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,289
Uh, we can talk later.

60
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,999
- [Dae] Bye!
- [Yuri] 'Kay. Bye, Kitty.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,544
- Baby, I missed you so much.
- [Juliana] Mm.

62
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,672
At least we don't have to hide
that we're dating anymore.

63
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,590
[Yuri] Mm.

64
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,092
One silver lining
of us not living together.

65
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,802
- [sighs] Thank God.
- [chuckles]

66
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,305
[energetic music playing]

67
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,101
So, how's my favorite student doing?

68
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,021
A bit early for blatant nepotism, Dad.

69
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,940
I was talking
to your girlfriend, the shark.

70
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,651
[sighs] Sorry about that. Again.

71
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,487
It's okay. I loved it.

72
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,825
So, have you decided
about the ski cabin for the long weekend?

73
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,953
Just you and me, one-on-one on the slopes?

74
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,080
You used to love
when I took you skiing as a kid.

75
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,499
That was Joon Ho, not me.

76
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,920
Anyways, Stella and I have plans
this weekend.

77
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:37,508
Well, it would be a shame
to let this house go to waste. Again.

78
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,012
Your dad's not doing
a Seollal get-together with the family?

79
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,556
All my siblings are spending
the holidays with their moms.

80
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,517
Joon Ho is on tour,
meaning I'm his last resort.

81
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,770
It sounds like he's putting in the effort.

82
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,772
You never know.
This could be a chance to--

83
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,691
Torture myself? Forget it.

84
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,778
All right. Come on.
Let's get this assembly over with.

85
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,739
[energetic music playing]

86
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,658
As part of our Lunar New Year celebration,

87
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,244
you'll see traditional decorations
around our school,

88
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,037
including <i>bokjori.</i>

89
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,580
Now, we have Ms. Miller,

90
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,333
one of the students
on the Festival Planning Committee,

91
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,752
to tell you all about it.

92
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,341
A <i>bokjori</i> is a tool
to sift dirt from rice,

93
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,177
and for Seollal, it represents
good fortune in the new year.

94
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,929
Thank you, Ms. Miller.

95
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,433
As always, your knowledge
of Korean culture is very admirable.

96
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,352
[in Korean] It's my honor.

97
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,437
- [students murmur]
- [in English] Exactly.

98
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,355
[girls laugh]

99
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,024
We'll also have our yearly opening

100
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,237
of the time capsule
of the graduating class 40 years prior.

101
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,156
These time capsules are a pillar
of KISS's ongoing commitment

102
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,159
to preserving our school's history.

103
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,663
Or KISS-tory, if you will.

104
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,333
- [student coughs]
- Um... [clears throat]

105
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:57,337
And documenting the experiences
of our heritage scholarship students.

106
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,839
Oh, that's my mom's scholarship.

107
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,674
Unfortunately, we will not be doing

108
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:05,012
our own capsule this year,
as that time and budget has been allocated

109
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,141
to less academic pursuits.

110
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,978
Which is where I come in,
just in time, before you all fall asleep.

111
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,022
[students laugh]

112
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,899
In the spirit of Seollal,
I have a gift for you.

113
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,735
To celebrate the new arts center,

114
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,739
I am hosting a student talent showcase
at the end of the semester.

115
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,490
- [exclaims]
- [students murmur]

116
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,243
And the winner... will receive a cash prize!

117
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,536
[students gasp]

118
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,622
[triumphant music plays]

119
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,835
Dae, you have to enter the contest.
You have the voice of an angel.

120
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,713
My family could use the money.

121
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,883
But singing is just, like, my hobby.

122
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,760
I got you, bro. I'll coach you.

123
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,095
Manager-performer dream team, baby.

124
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,307
- And I won't even take commission.
- [chuckles]

125
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,726
But do you think I could actually win?

126
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,811
Yeah.

127
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,814
Okay, then. Let's do it.

128
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,858
Alex!

129
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,443
Kitty!

130
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,196
My mom must've put something
in that time capsule for the scholarship.

131
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,114
It might tell me more
about my Korean family.

132
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,618
Right, but they're not gonna open
your mom's time capsule

133
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,827
for several more years.

134
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,457
Okay, well, maybe you can make
an exception for me?

135
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,959
I wish, but Dad's in charge
of the time capsules.

136
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,378
[Kitty] So that's a no-go.

137
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,506
Yeah. I've gotta go prep class.
I'll see you soon, okay?

138
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,591
Okay.

139
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,842
[exhales]

140
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,386
How's living with Kitty?

141
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,346
[clicks tongue] Chill, I guess.

142
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,348
She's all googly-eyed for Praveena,

143
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:35,560
which would be kinda cute if I wasn't
so annoyed that she blew our cover,

144
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,731
which I know
wasn't on purpose, but... [sighs]

145
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,276
For what it's worth,
I actually like living with my mom again.

146
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,238
We've had a lot of good talks.

147
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,574
You were so right
that I needed to reach out to her.

148
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,827
Uh...

149
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,745
What?

150
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,456
I need to tell you something.

151
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:01,045
It was actually Kitty's idea for you
to reach out to your mom, not mine.

152
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,838
Wait, what?

153
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,966
She just knew exactly what you needed.

154
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:10,095
And I guess that made me insecure,
so I recycled her idea as my own,

155
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,681
and I'm... really sorry.

156
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,434
[gentle music playing]

157
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,103
I don't care whose idea it was.

158
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,271
You're not mad?

159
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,774
No, of course not. [chuckles softly]

160
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,860
Okay.

161
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,823
So you're just gonna march in there
and ask for the time capsule?

162
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,908
Yeah.

163
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,285
You must get your cockiness
from your white side.

164
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,786
[both chuckle]

165
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,912
Oh look, there's your girl.

166
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,247
- Hey, Kitty. Q.
- [Kitty] Hey.

167
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,959
What's up, Prav? Might I say,
your bangs are banging today.

168
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,545
[sighs] Thank you literally so much.

169
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,630
Are you guys heading to the gym?

170
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,549
No, the archives building.

171
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,343
I'm hoping they let me open the capsule
from when my mom was here.

172
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,096
Unlikely. I was an aide
in the archives last semester.

173
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,724
You need clearance
for access to the time capsules,

174
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,977
so if you want it,
you're gonna have to steal it.

175
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:03,148
Uh, Kitty, friendly reminder
that you have priors.

176
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,193
I got you. I know the old lady
that guards the archives building.

177
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,153
It'll be a breeze to get past her.

178
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,072
How's tomorrow night at nine?

179
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,949
It's a date.

180
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,700
Cool.

181
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,661
- See you guys later.
- [Q] Bye.

182
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,248
Q! Did you mess with my lucky sneakers?

183
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,626
They're filled with glue.

184
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,543
- [tense music playing]
- Oh.

185
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,670
Jin, I think you're projecting.

186
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,299
See, I would never do anything
to jeopardize a teammate like that.

187
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,221
Careful. You have
no idea how low I can go.

188
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,973
Actually, I do.

189
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,810
And, uh... it's a lot lower than that.

190
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,395
[Jin sighs]

191
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,981
[tense music fades out]

192
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,027
[gentle music playing]

193
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,077
Hey. What are you still doing here?

194
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,455
- Hanging out with Juliana?
- I'm headed home.

195
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:05,502
What's up with you?
You look freakishly perky.

196
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,797
Well, I may or may not
be planning a small heist

197
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,091
to steal the time capsule
from our moms' class.

198
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,469
What? Like, how do you come up with
these ideas?

199
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,555
This one was Praveena's, actually.

200
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,099
We're kinda doing it together.

201
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,518
I'm jealous.

202
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:22,687
What?

203
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,315
I just mean, that's how we bonded
last year, you know?

204
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,735
Do you want to come? I mean,
I could always use another set of eyes.

205
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,281
And crash your date? No, thanks.

206
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,409
But I will catch the next one.

207
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,832
[upbeat music playing]

208
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,751
Hey, you all right?

209
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,961
What is Eunice doing here?

210
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:52,882
I think your best shot to win the contest
is performing a pop duet.

211
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,803
To win with this crowd,
you need the three S's.

212
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,307
Sex appeal, spandex, smoke machine,

213
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,309
and... choreo.

214
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,311
That's actually three S's and a C.

215
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,313
Plus, I don't want to dance.

216
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,065
It's okay. Choreo's simple, see?

217
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,735
One, two, and three, four.

218
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:15,071
- And five, six, seven, eight, and one.
- Whoa. Whoa. [sighs]

219
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,198
[Eunice] Right?

220
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,825
Simple.

221
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,369
[sighs]

222
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,456
- ["Colors" by Aimers playing]
- Three, four, and five.

223
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,166
- Six... No. No.
- [Dae] No.

224
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,543
- It's like this.
- [Dae] Okay.

225
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,087
- One, two, three, four.
- [Eunice] One, two, three...

226
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,923
No! Not that much.

227
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,050
[panting]

228
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,219
- And one--
- One, two...

229
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,430
- Okay.
- [Dae] What?

230
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,349
No.

231
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,059
One, two, and three.

232
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,519
- [Dae sighs]
- No. It's giving flamingo!

233
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,979
- [song ends]
- This isn't gonna work.

234
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,608
It is not my fault that you can't handle
a little constructive criticism.

235
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,859
[Stella] Okay.

236
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,904
Why don't you tell them
your brilliant idea?

237
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:59,825
Well, I thought of the cherry on top
for your performance.

238
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:05,956
When the song ends, you spin around,
bend her back, and lay one on her.

239
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,249
What do you mean, "lay one on her"?

240
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,919
What I mean is...

241
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,797
- [Stella sighs]
- [Eunice gasps]

242
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,341
Oh.

243
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,009
Perfect!

244
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,428
Absolutely not.

245
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,221
My boy's right.

246
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,807
Your instinct is so spot on, son.

247
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,767
[cheeky music playing]

248
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,562
All right, I won't distract you.
I just wanted to say Baek Jong Won said

249
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,148
he'll be happy to cook a dinner
at the cabin this weekend.

250
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,608
I know you love his ramyun.

251
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,068
The famous chef?

252
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,987
[Moon] Yeah. He's just a family friend.

253
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,240
Think about it. [clicks tongue]

254
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,867
[music fades]

255
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,035
[sighs] Your dad's really trying.

256
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,078
Where were we?

257
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,455
I... was just about to leave.

258
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,415
Hm.

259
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,751
Sorry. I can't do this. [sighs]

260
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,545
Dae.

261
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,462
[Eunice] Yo.

262
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,715
[Min Ho] Dae!

263
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,428
[Q grunts]

264
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,930
[groans] What?

265
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:04,932
[sighs]

266
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,270
You. How did you even manage
to shrink polyester?

267
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,647
- Turnabout's fair play, Quincy.
- Fair play?

268
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,983
- [Jin] Mm.
- [Q] You took my spot at regionals.

269
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,111
I don't know what you think this is,
but I don't want to do it anymore.

270
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,779
I thought this was flirting.

271
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,574
Well, I'm not interested. [sighs]

272
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,660
[gloomy music playing]

273
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,666
Oh, mate.

274
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,959
You're gonna have to change.

275
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,628
[suspenseful music playing]

276
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,132
Oh great. You brought the muscle.

277
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,425
<i>I'm</i> the muscle?

278
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,801
Don't get too excited.

279
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,304
We just need someone
tall enough to reach the high shelf.

280
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,056
And Dae and Q were busy, so...

281
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,226
Okay. Huddle up. Here's the plan.

282
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,603
I'll distract the old lady.

283
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,562
[gasps]

284
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,564
[in Korean] It's been a long time!

285
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,358
Mrs. Park! Are your grandkids doing well?

286
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:02,490
They're doing well.
I got the girls matching hanboks.

287
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,784
- Yes! Let's see!
- Hmm. Where did I put it?

288
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,535
Let's see here.

289
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,037
[inhales sharply] Oh.

290
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,122
[in English] Why are we going
through all this?

291
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,249
Because I have
a whole other side of my family

292
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,084
that my mom came here to find.

293
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,629
So if this time capsule has
a clue on how I can track them down,

294
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,922
I have to have it.

295
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,173
[whispers] How touching.

296
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,593
Personally, I'd love to erase
the existence of half my family.

297
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,886
Correct me if I'm wrong,

298
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,640
but did your dad not fund an entire
arts program to spend time with you?

299
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,186
That's his move. Big, shallow gesture
to make up for not being there.

300
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,272
Like inviting me
to a ski cabin for Seollal.

301
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,691
Well, do you want to fix things with him?

302
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,278
I guess so, but, uh...

303
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,614
One-on-one time
with him is always stressful.

304
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,408
It'd be different if there were
a bunch of family members around,

305
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,994
like there's supposed to be on Seollal.

306
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:54,333
Or even just very loud
and chatty people like yourself.

307
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,293
- [Kitty] Mm.
- As a buffer.

308
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,338
[takes a deep breath]

309
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,047
What if we did that?

310
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,632
Use me as your buffer?

311
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,092
Well, you and the guys.

312
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,178
I mean, it'd be more fun
than hanging out here for the holiday.

313
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,472
And we'll have your back
if your dad's being difficult.

314
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,723
["Keeping the Fire" playing]

315
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:15,186
[Praveena, shouting] Professor Lee,
I can assure you I know aisle 12!

316
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,647
- This is aisle 12! Move!
- [Praveena] Like the back of my hand!

317
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,608
[Lee] Why are you shouting?

318
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,694
I am perfectly capable
of hearing you as well.

319
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,611
[Praveena] Okay.

320
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,282
- I'm not as old as you think.
- I don't think you're old!

321
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,616
- [Lee] My goodness.
- [Praveena] Uh...

322
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,702
- Here it is.
- Ah.

324
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,373
Great job finding that!

325
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,166
[loudly] Uh, I guess we'll go now!

326
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,294
[Lee] You should try out
for the musical next year.

327
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,546
- [Praveena] You think?
- [Lee] That projection.

328
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,131
[intense pop song ends]

329
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,465

00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,222
Praveena just saved our asses.
I mean, it's only our second date.

whilst you're in close quarters
with the hottest guy in school.

336
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,358
[softly] Okay.

337
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,027
I'm just saying. It's not much of a date.

338
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,529
[inhales sharply]
Why don't you bring her skiing?

339
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,532
- That's kind of a big step.
- [Min Ho sighs]

340
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,451
Oh my God, I think that's it.

[energetic music playing]

342
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,495
[Min Ho] I think you might be right.

343
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,789
Well, don't just stand there.
Go get it down.

344
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,250
Put those tiny gloves to use.

345
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,586
That's why you're here, dude.

346
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,965
[exclaims] I cannot believe
that actually worked.

347
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,842
Oh, I wish I had a way to thank you.

348
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,261
Oh, please.

349
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,055
Praveena, do you ski?

350
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,139
No, but I snowboard.

351
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,517
Any chance you want to come with us
this weekend to Min Ho's dad's ski cabin?

352
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:40,730
You're inviting me to
the Kris Jenner of Korea's vacation home?

353
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,940
Hell yeah, I wanna come.

354
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,608
[giggles] Cool.

355
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,235
- I can't wait.
- Nice.

356
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,738
[energetic music fades]

357
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,657
- [cell phone chimes]
- [Yuri] Wow.

358
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,159
[chuckles] What are you doing?

359
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,036
[Yuri] I want to document your work

360
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,915
before the unveiling of your masterpiece
at the Seoul Art Festival.

361
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,626
It is going to kill.

362
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,462
[Juliana] I'm actually really excited
for you to see it finished.

363
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,589
[exhales]

364
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,174
[sighs deeply]

365
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,470
Remember last spring
when I told you I liked you?

366
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,721
We were in here.

367
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,933
I couldn't forget that if I tried.

368
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,520
- [Yuri] Mm.
- Although I did already know.

369
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,815
Why else would Yuri Han be spending
so much time around art supplies?

370
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:28,528
I got paint on my brand-new Loewe bag
because of you.

371
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,821
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

372
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,323
- [chuckles]
- [cell phone chimes]

373
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,037
- What do you think?
- [Yuri sighs]

374
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,373
Ski weekend? Could be fun.

375
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:44,335
[sighs] I'm supposed to go to Daegu
to see my <i>keun imo</i> with my mom.

376
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,505
Right. Okay.

377
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,300
[groans]

378
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,594
Screw it. Let's go.

379
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,805
[Praveena sighs]

380
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:56,932
What?

381
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,395
Come on. I'm not saying yes
because Kitty's going.

382
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,230
It just seems like I can't go a minute

383
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,442
without Kitty just busting in
and Kitty-ing all over everything.

384
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,529
Well, Kitty can bust in
wherever she wants,

385
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,950
but she is not busting
into this relationship.

386
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,871
You're cute.

387
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,626
[serene music playing]

388
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,755
[birds singing]

389
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,924
- [music fades]
- Yuri! Wait up.

390
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,845
You will not believe
what I found in the time capsule.

391
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,306
[Yuri] "Eve Song's Heritage Project,
Directed by Jina Lim." Oh my God.

392
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,348
I know.

393
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,184
- I've been waiting to watch it with you.
- Aw.

394
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,644
I also cannot find
any VHS players anywhere.

395
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,438
I know a place that rents them,

396
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,690
but I do have to be back
for Juliana's art opening.

397
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,358
Oh. I can go alone.

398
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,028
[chuckles] No, are you kidding?
We're in this together.

399
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,363
Just like them.

400
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,947
- Let's go.
- [giggles]

401
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,825
[indistinct chatter]

402
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,952
[cell phone vibrates]

403
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,125
- [Yuri] Here it is.
- [Kitty] Oh.

404
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,920
Wait, it's closed.

405
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,506
- Oh no, it's permanently closed.
- [sighs]

406
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,968
Wait. Their new location is at...

407
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,262
Is it far?
Your face is telling me it's far.

408
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,264
Oh no, it's not. [inhales sharply]

409
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,892
But it <i>is</i> rush hour,
so we should get going.

410
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,977
We are not going
back to school empty-handed.

411
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,730
- We can watch it after the festival.
- What would I do without you?

412
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,775
- [chimes jingle]
- [light, romantic music plays]

413
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,945
[chimes jingle]

414
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,655
[music fades out slowly]

415
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,366
Uh, I'm gonna go get us a cab.

416
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,243
[softly] Okay.

417
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,498
- [excited chatter]
- [energetic dance music playing]

418
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,976
Juliana? Your painting is wonderful.

419
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,770
[sighs] Thanks.

420
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,063
Oh, that's you and Yuri.

421
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:09,981
Yeah.

422
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,983
She was supposed to be here to see it.

423
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,526
You're really talented, Juliana.

424
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,528
Thanks.

425
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,869
[sighs deeply]

426
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,835
[tense music playing]

427
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,004
[Praveena] Kitty cat.

428
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,338
- [Kitty] Hey.
- There you are.

429
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,133
- Come on. Let's go grab some tteokguk.
- [quietly] Okay.

430
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,344
[somber music playing]

431
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,267
Wait, babe, babe, babe.

432
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,186
I'm so sorry. My phone died.

433
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,480
I needed you here. And obviously,
whatever you were doing with Kitty

434
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,816
was more important to you
than being here for me.

435
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,528
- No, you don't understand. That's--
- I think I do.

436
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,158
Wait, Juliana.

437
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,034
[in Korean] Thank you.

438
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,203
- [in English] Thank you.
- Oh my goodness.

439
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,622
- I get the first bite?
- Here you go. Yes, you do.

440
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,165
[bright music playing]

441
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,249
It's so good.

442
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,375
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

443
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,212
- What did I tell you?
- [Yuri] Wait, Juliana!

444
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,757
[sighs] Kitty.

445
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,551
This weekend isn't gonna be
like our first date, right? Because that--

446
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,678
Was not cool.

447
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,055
No, and I promise that it won't be.

448
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,640
And I was thinking that this weekend

449
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,684
could maybe be our chance
to find out what could be.

450
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,896
And my hopes, they're up here.

451
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,898
Because I like you. A lot.

452
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,525
All right. Fine.

453
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,446
[peppy pop music playing]

454
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,086
[in Korean] Bora, that's your last sweet.

455
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,841
Here to give me feedback?

456
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,677
[in English] Constructive criticism?

457
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:07,766
[in Korean] No. I know I'm a little
intense when it comes to practice.

458
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,351
But don't quit the contest because of me.

459
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,561
I promise I'll take it easy
from now on. Cool?

460
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:17,233
Honestly? I just don't know
if I'm good enough.

461
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,361
Honestly, you need to practice.

462
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,990
It's about muscle memory. You need
to practice until your body memorizes it.

463
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,868
If you practice, there's nothing...

464
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:29,913
[chuckles]

465
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,291
But you've got an amazing voice.

466
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,251
I wouldn't sing a duet
with you if you didn't.

467
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,337
[dreamy music playing]

468
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,674
Is that your sister?

469
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,551
[Dae] Mm-hmm.

470
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,969
She's the cute one in the family.

471
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,055
I think there might be more than one.

472
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,685
[chuckles lightly]

473
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,812
[music fades]

474
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,522
- [Q] Okay.
- [group laughs]

475
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,400
Oh, man, that's pretty good.
That's really good. Right?

476
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,360
[group chattering]

477
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,320
Oh, come on.

478
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,696
Wait. Wait, look.

479
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,533
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry for all of it.

480
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,828
I was desperate to win,
which is not an excuse,

481
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,123
but it's harder getting scouted
when you go to an international school.

482
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,584
Yeah, no shit.

483
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,504
My dad ran the 400 hurdles
for South Korea in the 1988 Olympics,

484
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:24,760
so if I don't get scouted to a D1 school
on scholarship at the very least,

485
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,261
I'm a failure.

486
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,223
Look, I don't have Olympians in my family.

487
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,769
- Lucky.
- But I have doctors.

488
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,730
And they're literally in the Philippines,
saving lives and being geniuses.

489
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:41,943
Meanwhile, I'm still hung up
on the C I got in bio last semester, so

490
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,320
I get it.

491
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,781
[gentle music playing]

492
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,784
The... failure thing.

493
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,537
But what you did...

494
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,582
it really hurt me.

495
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,796
Not just taking the spot
at regionals, but...

496
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,424
playing with my emotions to sabotage me.

497
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,343
I know.

498
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,053
If you want me
to talk to Coach Alex, I will.

499
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,181
It's probably too late for that now.

500
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,227
You'd actually do that for me, though?

501
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:16,936
[Kitty] Q!

502
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,104
- Hey!
- Um...

503
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,438
I'll catch you later?

504
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,564
I'm counting on it.

505
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,608
[chuckles]

506
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,363
Are you guys fighting or another F-word?

507
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,531
Katherine Song Covey!

508
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,199
Flirting!

509
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,326
My matchmaker spidey senses are tingling.

510
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,121
[scoffs] Yeah, well, don't go telling
Dae and Min Ho about it.

511
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,581
They're... not the biggest Jin fans.

512
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,125
Oh, no, I'm aware.

513
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,210
Did he actually used to steal
Min Ho's hair products?

514
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,129
- He did.
- [laughs] What? Why?

515
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,256
Can you blame him?
They're probably expensive.

516
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,967
[Kitty] We should go pack for the trip.

517
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,554
[knocking on door]

518
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,268
Oh. Hey. Juliana's not here. It's just me.

519
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,397
I know. She's hiding
in her art studio to avoid me. And you.

520
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,608
Well, I'm really glad you're here.
I am dying to watch this tape.

521
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,152
You didn't watch it without me?

522
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,988
No, like you said,
we're in this together. Come on.

<i>And I'm your host, Jina Lim!</i>

527
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,341
Good to know my mom's always had
main character syndrome.

528
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,969
<i>Here, Seojoon. Take the camera.</i>

529
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,431
[Seojoon] <i>Isn't this project supposed
to be about me?</i> I <i>should be in it.</i>

530
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:40,019
<i>Hey, it's about your role
in my life, Seojoon.</i>

531
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,730
[Seojoon] <i>So am I your cousin
or your cameraman?</i>

532
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,647
[laughs]

533
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,860
Wait, I bet "Seojoon"
is Simon's Korean name.

534
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,155
- That's Simon talking.
- And they sound like such good friends.

535
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,449
- [Jina] <i>Bicker on your own time.</i>
- [Eve laughs]

536
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,413
[Jina] <i>So, where will Eve Hyejin Song be
in 40 years?</i>

537
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:03,417
<i>Oh... well, hopefully you and I
will still be friends.</i>

538
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,919
[Jina] <i>Aww.</i>

539
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,296
<i>Maybe we've settled down
in neighboring houses.</i>

540
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,882
[Seojoon scoffs] <i>Eve spends
all her money on magazines.</i>

541
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,552
<i>She'll never save up enough
for her own place.</i>

542
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:17,348
<i>I can move in with you and Hana
if you take my advice and ask her out.</i>

543
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,560
<i>You two would make
such a great couple.</i> [scoffs]

544
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,773
<i>Anyway, by the time
this time capsule is opened,</i>

545
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,067
<i>I'll be in my fifties.</i>

546
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,611
<i>Wow.</i> [sighs]

547
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:36,492
<i>I'll be an award-winning journalist,
married to someone smart and kind.</i>

548
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,954
<i>And we'll have kids. At least one.</i>

549
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,915
<i>A girl, I hope.</i>

550
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,712
<i>And I hope I'll visit Korea with my mom.</i>

551
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,756
<i>I want her to show me around Bukjeon.</i>

552
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,299
<i>That's her hometown.</i>

00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,301
[Kitty crying softly]

554
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,720
[Eve] <i>Maybe by then,</i>

555
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,808
<i>she'll be on speaking terms
with her sister again.</i>

556
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,437
<i>What do you think, Seojoon?</i>

557
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,480
[Seojoon] <i>I don't know.</i>

558
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,566
<i>We've been trying
to get them to talk for months.</i>

559
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,319
- [Eve] <i>And we're not giving up yet.</i>
- [sniffles]

560

- Oh, Kitty.
- [sighs]

565
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:31,880
[gently] Are you okay?

566
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:35,343
I've never seen a video
of my mom at this age before.

At <i>my</i> age.

569
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:42,475
I mean, she sounds just like Margot.

570
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,854
She looks exactly like Lara Jean.

571
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,647
She...

572
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,066
She was a meddler like you. [chuckles]

When I come back from skiing,

575
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,201
I am going to Bukjeon,
and I am finding my family.

00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,583
[softly] Yuri.

577
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,753
Will you come with me?

578
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,255
Of course.

579
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,091
I'll always be there for you.

580
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:20,847
What?
