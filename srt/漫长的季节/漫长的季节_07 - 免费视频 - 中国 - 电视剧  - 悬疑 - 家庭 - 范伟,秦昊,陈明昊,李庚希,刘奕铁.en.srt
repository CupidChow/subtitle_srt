2
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,550
Get past him!

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,270
Come on!

4
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,720
I'd do better than that.

5
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,590
How many chicken ribs have you had?

6
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,630
Stop watching. We're on a stakeout.

7
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,870
I won't ask you to pay.

8
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,000
We've been watching it all morning.

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,240
I'm almost blind!

10
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,080
You two are too gullible.

11
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,960
You can't trust Xing Jianchun.

12
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,600
Excuse me.

13
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Get me a plate of chicken hearts.

14
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,910
Coming right up!

15
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,470
You should cut back on them.

16
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,470
They're high in cholesterol.

17
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,160
They're for you because you need them.

18
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,360
Save them for yourself and Xiang.

19
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,550
You two can have them at night.

20
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,360
Where are you going?

21
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,360
Take the sketch.

22
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,270
I gotta go.

23
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,830
Seriously?

24
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,830
You need that many for number two?

25
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,190
There's still enough for your mouth.

26
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,270
You said no bathroom breaks.

27
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,520
Clearly, you have a double standard.

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,550
We can't go, but you can!

29
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,190
I'm old, but you're not!

30
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,600
Show some respect!

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
I'm insulin-dependent
and still sticking around.

32
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,190
Is there a toilet?

33
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,520
No.

34
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,160
- Go ahead.
- There's one over there.

35
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
Don't poop your pants.

36
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,320
Eyes on the target! Watch closely!

37
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,270
He's a burden.

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,600
Pass! Come on!

39
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,800
Don't touch anything here.

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,600
I'll be right back.

41
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,240
OK, sure.

42
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,100
(China Sports Lottery)

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,910
Whatever.

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,520
Here are my numbers.

45
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,750
Do you need anything else?

46
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,160
Maybe a few scratch-off lottery tickets?

47
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,720
They're boring, not challenging at all.

48
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,830
But it's a quick game.

49
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,320
You'll know the result right away.

50
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,240
Fine, I'll take one.

51
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,800
Here you are. And your change.

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,630
Do it for fun.

53
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,750
Has anyone got lucky today?

54
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,360
Yeah.

55
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,080
How many?

56
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,160
Two.

57
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,880
Why didn't you tell me?

58
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,270
The third is doomed to fail.

59
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,520
I won't win anything.

60
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,440
Maybe you'll get lucky, too.

61
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,190
Now, I regret it.

62
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,030
Hello.

63
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,320
A ticket of ten yuan.

64
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,080
Got it.

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,270
All quick picks.

66
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,080
No problem.

67
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,480
Quick picks are lame.

68
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,760
You're wasting your money.

69
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,720
You don't own the generator.

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,760
Would the owner let you win?

71
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,920
You picked the numbers yourself,
but have you ever won?

72
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,510
And have you?

73
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,720
Me?

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,640
Listen,

75
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,000
I got my car and apartment because of
those quick picks, you know?

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Come off it!

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,110
Who knows if that's true?

78
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,070
Dude, here's a piece of advice.

79
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,880
Keep calm and sincere
before getting the tickets.

80
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,110
Loser.

81
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,200
He wouldn't listen.

82
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,350
How stubborn!

83
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,760
A ticket of quick picks, too.

84
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,860
(For Hire)

85
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,000
Traffic Police Station.

86
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,440
Sorry, try another one.

87
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,480
I'm unavailable.

88
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,790
I insist.

89
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,670
Come on.

90
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,480
What do you want?

91
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,270
You tell me.

92
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,350
I gotta go.

93
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,510
Would you rather abandon your car?

94
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,350
Where are you going?

95
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,390
Wait, sir...

96
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,350
Are you so rich?

97
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,640
Easy, man, easy...

98
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,390
Those quick picks
got you a car and an apartment, huh?

99
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,160
Please...

100
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,320
Don't try to fight me.

101
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,070
I'm a fighter.

102
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,270
Are you still mad about the quick picks?

103
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,480
This is uncalled for.

104
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,270
Shut up!

105
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,640
I'm telling you,

106
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,950
I broke my arm in a brawl. Go easy!

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,600
Hey, don't...

108
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Don't do this.

109
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,880
No need to call your gang.

110
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,720
I'm not.

111
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,040
I can handle you alone.

112
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,480
You know MMA?

113
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,950
You're nowhere near my level.

114
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,110
I can flatten you no problem.

115
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,320
Are you done?

116
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,720
I found him. Come over now!

117
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,920
Stop it, man.

118
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,270
I got nothing in my pockets.

119
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,830
I haven't had any clients.

120
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,950
What? We aren't robbers!

121
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,760
So you aren't here for money?

122
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,440
Here's my piece of advice.

123
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,390
Answer our questions honestly, got it?

124
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,000
You said and I quote,

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,200
"Keep calm and sincere".

126
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,720
Gentlemen, is there a mistake?

127
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,600
I don't think we have a history.

128
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,550
What is this?

129
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,880
Not at all.

130
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,550
You're the one.

131
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,790
Do I know you?

132
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,760
Cornfield, remember?

133
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,000
You were running fast.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,200
Were you afraid after the hit-and-run?

135
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,230
What are you talking about?

136
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,720
When did I hit others?

137
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,110
Let me remind you.

138
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,390
That morning on October 20th,
you were driving this car

139
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,550
with a fake plate of HUAAW357F.

140
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,510
Does that ring a bell?

141
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,640
Look, sir, yes, I don't have
a taxi license, but I'm not a mob.

142
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,350
I wouldn't dare hit anyone.

143
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,350
Look, none of us here is a cop.

144
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,790
Well, even if you said you were,

145
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,790
I wouldn't buy it.

146
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,830
Shut it!

147
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,230
Hey!

148
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,040
Calm down. Ask him nicely.

149
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,070
Just answer the question.

150
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,070
What happened?

151
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,670
It's simple.

152
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,000
You aren't our target,
but the one you hit.

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
I'll say it again.

154
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,510
I didn't hit anyone.

155
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,760
Come on!

156
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,390
Stop denying!

157
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,390
We wouldn't be here without evidence.

158
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,160
Your hit-and-run is undeniable.

159
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,640
Tell us who the victim is
and we'll let you go.

160
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,000
Still feigning calm?

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,510
Stop hitting me!

162
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,070
Go ahead, Biao.

163
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,880
OK.

164
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,200
No, put your knife back!

165
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,000
No more blood!

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,550
I'll kill him!

167
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,440
Sir, come on,

168
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,200
I respect seniors like you.

169
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,670
Please be nice.

170
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,270
You still won't talk?

171
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,920
What to do?

172
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,440
Report him to the police.

173
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,920
You're done. You're over for good.

174
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,300
(Pause)

175
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,390
OK.

176
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,760
(Traffic Police)
Thanks for your help.

177
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,350
Officer...

178
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,390
No need to thank us.

179
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,230
We're on the same side,
so I'll be straight with you.

180
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,790
When can I get my cab back?

181
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,230
Alright.

182
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,350
Go to the Accident Section
for the paperwork.

183
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,040
Thank you!

184
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,670
Sir, other than using a fake plate,
he must've done something else.

185
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,070
Can you ask him who he hit?

186
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,270
Don't worry.

187
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,110
A hit-and-run is a serious crime.

188
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,920
We'll get to the bottom of it.

189
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,790
I'll let you know when we find out.

190
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,070
Thanks.

191
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,720
Go home.

192
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,270
OK.

193
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,350
Please keep me updated.

194
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:28,760
Sure.

195
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,040
I'm Wang Xiang,

196
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,790
"Xiang" as "loud".

197
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,390
Yeah, yeah, got it.

198
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,350
Wang Xiang, what are you up to?

199
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,400
One plate of mutton.

200
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,280
Is there any seafood?

201
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
There's calamari.

202
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,910
OK, that, too.

203
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,760
There's too much for us.

204
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Not at all.

205
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,710
And spicy bellflower root, too.

206
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,790
That's all. We might add more later.

207
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,550
OK.

208
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,230
If you two don't propose a toast,

209
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,550
I will.

210
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,910
There's no booze.

211
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,200
Here it is.

212
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,840
Your cup, Xiang.

213
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,880
This is a treat mostly
to thank Captain Ma.

214
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,320
Yes.

215
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,520
Without you,

216
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,550
I wouldn't have got
my cab back so quickly.

217
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,550
No need to thank me.

218
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,080
They found out you're innocent
and gave your car back, of course.

219
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,320
No, you should take the credit.

220
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,660
Without your help, it wouldn't
have wrapped up so soon, right?

221
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:28,970
Yep.

222
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,150
Let's drink.

223
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,590
Cheers.

224
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,470
Dig in.

225
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,960
What about you?

226
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,840
Aren't you gonna say something?

227
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,880
Come on.

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,910
Thank you, Captain Ma.

229
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,880
Not that.

230
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,150
Say something else.

231
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,670
Like what?

232
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,400
The truth, of course.

233
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,760
Xiang, Captain Ma is a friend.

234
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,030
Just say it.

235
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,080
I'm not sure about anything,
so let it go.

236
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,590
Let's eat if you're done drinking.

237
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,590
I'll say it.

238
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,110
Who was the guy
that got hit by that fake-licensed car?

239
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,200
Why did you go to such great lengths
to find him?

240
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,000
Be honest with me if we're friends.

241
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,440
You've put it like that,

242
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,320
OK, you might not believe this,
but the victim of that hit-and-run

243
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,760
killed my son, Yang.

244
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,670
Unbelievable, right?

245
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,590
Yes.

246
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,790
Go on.

247
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,400
I got him on tape.

248
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,230
I don't see his face.

249
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,550
How could you be sure it's him?

250
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,710
See?

251
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,280
You didn't believe me then,
and you don't believe me now.

252
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,760
So what's the point?

253
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,470
I wish I could believe you.

254
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,000
Wang Xiang,
your son's death has driven you nuts.

255
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,320
Are you nuts, too?

256
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,280
No, Captain Ma.

257
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,670
It's him that...

258
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,440
Look, the truth is still unknown.

259
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,150
How could I let it go?

260
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,590
Wang Yang killed himself
just like I told you 18 years ago.

261
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,760
That's not true.

262
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,550
I know my boy.

263
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,960
He was killed by Fu Weijun.

264
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,000
Not again!

265
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,080
Don't you remember when you were
at the railway, we had caught

266
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,470
Fu Weijun.

267
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,790
But how could he get there?

268
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,200
That's why he didn't do it!

269
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:21,280
You could doubt me, but when he got
caught, everyone saw it right there!

270
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,320
They can't all be wrong!

271
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,640
You are wrong!

272
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,200
As you were

273
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,110
18 years ago!

274
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:26,840
Calm down, both of you.

275
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,910
Shut up!

276
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,880
Tell me,

277
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,320
Fu Weijun is still in prison.

278
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,840
How could he get hit by a car?

279
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,150
You tell me how my son died!

280
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,670
Don't raise your voice at us!

281
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,470
Do you think the police would tell lies?

282
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,400
Our work is based on evidence,
not imagination!

283
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,470
Is that also my imagination?

284
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,880
Isn't that evidence, hard evidence?

285
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,760
I don't see it!

286
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,640
Not his face, not anything!

287
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,550
It's your pure imagination!

288
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,590
It's all in your head,

289
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,350
I'm telling you!

290
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,470
It's OK, guys.

291
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,520
Don't be scared. Sorry.

292
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,590
Don't mind them.

293
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,150
Sorry about it.

294
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,150
They're drunk.

295
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,280
Come on, guys.

296
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,280
You're too old to make a scene.

297
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Act your age.

298
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,670
We can talk at home.

299
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,520
Wang Xiang, think about what I said.

300
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,080
If you're still so obsessed and won't let go,
your life will be ruined.

301
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,000
We've all lost our loved ones.

302
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,200
My wife died of cancer last year.

303
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,670
Then what? I should die, too?

304
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,230
It's not the same, OK?

305
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,790
Your wife died of disease.

306
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,960
She died on her bed in the hospital
and she could rest in peace.

307
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,710
But my son was not even 20
and he was found in the water!

308
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,760
How could I let it go?

309
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,840
It's OK...

310
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,230
Do you still want these?

311
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,640
What do you think?

312
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,790
Can I return them?

313
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,000
No, sorry, sir.

314
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,350
Pack them up.

315
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:43,900
(Hualin Taxi Pause)

316
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,400
What's that attitude?

317
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm here for a solution,

318
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,320
OK?

319
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,230
I've been nothing but nice.

320
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,110
What do you want?

321
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,470
We want money, compensation!

322
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,400
Hey, guys...

323
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,910
Hey,

324
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,150
Ms. Xu, right?

325
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,550
What's wrong? You got a sty?

326
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,910
No! Shut up!

327
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,110
My eyes got double eyelids,
but look what your wife did!

328
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,440
A single and a double.

329
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,470
I can fix the single one.

330
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,350
No problem.

331
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:36,670
Yeah.

332
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,030
Just fix that eye for free as a gift.

333
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,640
That's not gonna happen.

334
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,030
What if you blind her?

335
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,440
It's cold. We can talk inside.

336
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,030
Why?

337
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,520
Are you afraid 'cause you're unlicensed?

338
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,280
Of course not.

339
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
Our business is legit.

340
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,110
Is that so?

341
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,030
Is there a license?

342
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,000
It's being processed.

343
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,200
So no!

344
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,230
We'll get it soon.

345
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,790
Very soon.

346
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,790
You're breaking the law, you know?

347
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,000
Ms. Xu, think about it.

348
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,840
If you go to any big hospital to do your eyes,
it'll cost six grand, right?

349
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,400
But here

350
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,960
I asked for two grand
plus ten percent off.

351
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,520
You got what you paid for,

352
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,790
OK?

353
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,110
You mean I had it coming?

354
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,910
I deserve it?

355
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,640
I didn't say that.

356
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,150
Listen...

357
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:13,640
Enough.

358
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,470
Are you picking a fight?

359
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,440
Say no more.

360
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,350
Call the cops.

361
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:16,790
Please don't!

362
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,640
Don't trouble the police.

363
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,320
Come on!

364
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,550
We can talk it out ourselves.

365
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,910
Pay for her damage.

366
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,640
It's not about the money.

367
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,760
But if you insist,

368
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,590
I'd say 150k.

369
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,230
Come again?

370
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,280
150k.

371
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,350
That's extortion!

372
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,670
What did you say?

373
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,000
You're extorting me!

374
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,150
150k is the least.

375
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,910
If I'm blind, you'll go to jail!

376
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,440
Calm down.

377
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,230
Look, we all worked in the same factory.

378
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,000
Don't be too harsh.

379
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,790
Maybe a discount for old times' sake?

380
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,030
How about 10k?

381
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,000
Give me the phone.

382
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,640
Call it in.

383
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,080
Who are you to think you're worth 140k?

384
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,320
Fine. Make the call!

385
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,670
Let the cops grab her
and give her ten years.

386
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,320
Go ahead.

387
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,590
Let's see if you'll get
any money from us.

388
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,520
Think about it.

389
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,920
We can talk it over.

390
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,280
She charged 1.8k,
and now, you're asking for 150k?

391
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Why not make it a billion?

392
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,230
Like I had it.

393
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,640
So be practical.

394
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,800
How about this?

395
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,640
She paid you 1.8k, right?

396
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,470
So give that back plus 30k damages.

397
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,560
Am I that cheap?

398
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,830
Do I look like a beggar?

399
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,110
Give me the phone. I'm calling it!

400
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,560
Name your price.

401
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,800
100k.

402
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,710
I don't have it...

403
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,710
No bargaining, or we're done here!

404
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,680
Okay, 100k with a signed note.

405
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,430
Then there's no coming back!

406
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,350
Be careful.

407
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,520
Good day.

408
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,880
Sorry, ma'am.

409
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,920
See you, ma'am.

410
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,920
Stop calling me ma'am!

411
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,230
You look much older than me!

412
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,430
Pay up this week,
or I'll see you at the police station.

413
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,470
Yes, ma'am.

414
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,880
Eyes on the road. Hold her.

415
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,070
Hey, dude,

416
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,520
I'd like to sell my license.

417
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,590
Ask around for me.

418
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,000
What's it worth?

419
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,190
It's getting lower?

420
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,110
100k is fine.

421
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,110
I need cash.

422
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,430
Call me if there's a buyer.

423
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,310
Had too much corn.

424
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,710
Come on.

425
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,070
There, there.

426
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,950
I'm not blaming you.

427
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,070
And we've had it solved.

428
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,040
It's OK.

429
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,560
Where could I get 100k?

430
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,470
No worries. I'll handle it.

431
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,070
Easy-peasy.

432
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,070
It's all your fault!

433
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,430
You bought that license behind my back.

434
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,560
Hadn't it been for you,

435
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,590
I would've rented a shop
and none of this would've happened!

436
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,560
It's OK. Everything will be fine.

437
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Don't touch me!

438
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,590
Money goes and comes.

439
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,000
Once my pigeons for racing are hatched,

440
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,160
I'll gain
tens of thousands by selling them.

441
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,920
It's no big deal if money can fix it.

442
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,880
Am I right?

443
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,040
How did we mess up so bad?

444
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,950
Don't be upset.

445
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,470
Once my pigeons lay eggs,
things will pick up.

446
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,590
We're going from primitive accumulation
to crossing class lines

447
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,350
toward financial freedom.

448
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,640
You know what that means?

449
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,520
Money is working for you,
not the other way around.

450
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,110
Make money with money, got it?

451
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,920
I wish I could be like you
always living in your dreams.

452
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,920
Is that bad?

453
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,800
Dreams are a reflection of reality.

454
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,880
Freud said that.

455
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,830
Biao, we should separate.

456
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,760
Bei's not at home. I'll take his room.

457
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,400
I'm not sure if he'll agree.

458
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,760
It's comfy. Try it.

459
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,310
I can't stretch my legs.

460
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,230
It's two-meter-long.

461
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,230
What about your room?

462
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,110
We can share a bed.

463
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,710
No way. I wake up easily.

464
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,830
Your teeth grinding, farts,
and smacks are nonstop.

465
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,590
I can't take that!

466
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,950
But I'm a guest,
not to mention we're related.

467
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,880
I'm heartbreaking because of Liru.

468
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,280
Can't you be nice to me?

469
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:48,350
If you two divorce,
we'll be mere coworkers.

470
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,040
What are you doing?

471
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,470
Smoke in the kitchen.

472
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,040
I'll go to the bathroom.

473
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,880
Even better.

474
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,350
Grab a pillow, will you?

475
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,110
Wash your feet before bed.

476
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,070
You stink.

477
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,310
What brings you here?

478
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,160
Am I unwelcome?

479
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,280
I'll get you a towel.

480
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,590
Biao?

481
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,070
What? I'm pooping!

482
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,920
No need.

483
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,400
I got news about Fu Weijun.

484
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,230
Last month, he died in prison.

485
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,160
He's dead.

486
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,350
Yep.

487
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:55,100
(Phone Booth)

488
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,430
Page 9532657.

489
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,350
Leave a message.

490
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,640
Weijun and I are now in Songhe.

491
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,430
Sir?

492
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,880
Hey!

493
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,280
Two coins on credit.

494
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,470
No credit.

495
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,520
Pay me or go home.

496
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,880
I'll pay you back
when my parents come back.

497
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,800
Just this once, please.

498
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,640
No can do.

499
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,920
Go away.

500
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,190
50 yuan's worth.

501
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,430
What's wrong?

502
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,760
No more coins?

503
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,710
Take these.

504
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,710
Thank you.

505
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,560
What... what were you playing?

506
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,350
KOF.

507
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Are you good?

508
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,280
I'm OK.

509
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,560
I don't like playing with the machine.

510
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,400
Would you like to join me?

511
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,190
Oh, I...

512
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,430
I'll pay for it.

513
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,350
We'll use my coins.

514
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,160
OK.

515
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
I'll insert the coin.

516
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,800
What's... what's your name?

517
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,640
Shen Hui.

518
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,350
Hi.

519
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,680
There you are.

520
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,430
Let's go play games.

521
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,190
I can't.

522
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,470
My mom's waiting for me at home.

523
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,590
You're lying.

524
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,680
Aren't you staying at your grandma's?

525
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:36,110
Your... your parents
are out of town, aren't they?

526
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,560
They've come back?

527
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,590
That fast?

528
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,110
I... I really can't go.

529
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,950
My grandma will get worried
if she doesn't see me.

530
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,950
Are you turning your back on me?

531
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:20,590
You don't see me as...
as a friend, do you?

532
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,070
Fine.

533
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,230
I want my money back for the coins.

534
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,190
I... I don't have any.

535
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,920
I...

536
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,430
I swear.

537
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,880
Now what?

538
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,000
You... you won't find it in my bag.

539
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,680
I've got no money.

540
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,160
Then I'll report you to your teacher!

541
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,430
Hi.

542
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,350
He's asking you what you have

543
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,880
if you've got no money.

544
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,280
What do I have?

545
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,350
So what do you want?

546
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,110
So what do you want?

547
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:57,400
Your arm, or your leg.

548
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,350
Let me go!

549
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,920
Please, let me go!

550
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,830
I'm begging you!

551
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,680
Don't do this!

552
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,800
Please! Don't...!

553
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,590
Please!

554
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,760
Please don't hurt me!

555
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,470
Don't hurt me!

556
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,350
Let me go! I'm begging you!

557
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,430
Please...!

558
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:19,160
Normally, the two sides are attached
to two or more bones.

559
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,950
First, study the anatomical structure
and the organization of skeletal muscles

560
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,160
and the auxiliary apparatus.

561
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,830
Second, study the position and function
of the trapezius and latissimus dorsi.

562
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,160
Third, study the position and function

563
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,110
of the pectoralis major
and serratus anterior muscle

564
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,160
and the position, form, and function
of the diaphragm,

565
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,280
and the names
of its three major apertures.

566
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,560
Is everything OK, Aunt?

567
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,350
What's wrong?

568
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,430
It's all my fault.

569
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,950
I shouldn't have come here
to see the doctor.

570
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,190
Or Hui wouldn't have gotten hurt.

571
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,160
Quit it!

572
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,590
I'll check out the room.

573
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,230
Don't be too worried.

574
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,560
A broken arm isn't too bad.

575
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,280
It'll heal.

576
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:48,950
Excuse me?

577
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,160
But next time,
he might not be this lucky.

578
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,880
Go home and take care of my aunt.

579
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,950
Don't ever come back.

580
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,520
I will... kill you!

581
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,760
Mark my words!

582
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,310
I will kill you!

583
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,800
Yang, dinner is ready.

584
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,920
Eat without me, Mom.

585
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Are you OK, Mom?

586
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,190
What's wrong?

587
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,520
I don't feel well.

588
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,310
What is it?

589
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,310
It'll pass.

590
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,430
I just need to eat something.

591
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,310
I can't breathe because of the smoke.

592
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,680
I'll be fine after dinner.

593
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,560
Come on.

594
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,280
Sit and eat with me.

595
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:14,760
Sit.

596
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,640
They're all your favorites.

597
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,760
Are you still mad at your dad?

598
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,590
He was trying to protect you.

599
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:44,110
If Xing Jianchun refused to let it go,
you wouldn't get into the factory.

600
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,040
Hurting you is the
last thing he wanna do.

601
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,760
He regretted it so much
that he couldn't sleep last night

602
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,640
and woke up with blisters on his mouth.

603
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,110
How could I not be mad?

604
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,640
He slapped me in front of everyone.

605
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,920
Besides, do I have to work
at the factory?

606
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,640
I know.

607
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,110
So that's decent,
and what I'm doing is not?

608
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,000
All work has equal value.

609
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,110
I can't believe he's so snobbish.

610
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,000
About that, you can't blame your dad

611
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,070
because our generation
is used to following orders.

612
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,310
We grew up in a big family.

613
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,040
We'd do whatever our parents said.

614
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,560
And when we started working,
we'd do whatever our bosses said.

615
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,710
People like us all seem

616
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,800
to live in a circle drawn by others.

617
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,640
And there we are following the direction
and living our life as it is.

618
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,950
Nobody has ever asked why
or tried to step out of it.

619
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,310
We'd be scared even on the edge.

620
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,350
The world is changing rapidly.

621
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,350
Every generation is different.

622
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:56,880
When you become a father,
you'll have problems, too.

623
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:00,640
But even so, you'll always be a family.

624
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,710
Don't hate your dad, OK?

625
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,000
I won't.

626
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,870
I'm not that petty.

627
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,600
That's my boy.

628
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,040
Come on. Let's eat.

629
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,840
Dig in.

630
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,320
Eat.

631
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:18,760
Mom,

632
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,630
I need to go out.

633
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,600
Eat something first.

634
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,120
I'm good.

635
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,280
Alright.

636
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,710
Don't be back too late.

637
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,360
I'm off, Mom.

638
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,670
See you later.

639
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,870
Hey, stop.

640
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,840
No late-night screenings today.

641
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,470
I'm here for Shen Mo.

642
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,080
She said she'd come.

643
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,230
You're here early.

644
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,470
Titanic?

645
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,360
We didn't get to watch it together.

646
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,910
Let's do it now.

647
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,190
Wang Yang.

648
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
Fu Weijun.

649
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,000
Let me see if it works.

650
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,120
Hey, did you and Shen Mo just meet?

651
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,280
She's never told me about you.

652
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,470
I'm talking to you.

653
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,470
He can't hear you.

654
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,760
Oh, I see.

655
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,080
Or there'd be a fight.

656
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,560
What did he say?

657
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,910
My brother said you're a little simple.

658
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,000
(Rose, you're no picnic, alright?)

659
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,120
(You're a spoiled little brat, even.)

660
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,930
(But under that,)

661
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:49,500
(You're the most amazingly
astounding, wonderful girl,)

662
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,230
(woman that I've ever known.)

663
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,720
(And...)

664
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,550
(Jack, I...)

665
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,660
(No, let me try to get this out.)

666
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,390
(I'm not an idiot.)

667
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,500
(I know how the world works.)

668
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,110
(I've got ten bucks in my pocket.)

669
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,790
(I have nothing to offer you
and I know that.)

670
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,450
(I understand.)

671
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,860
(But I'm too involved now.)

672
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,530
(You jump, I jump, remember?)

673
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,360
You're a Shen.

674
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,950
How come your brother is a Fu?

675
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,560
He's one year younger than me.

676
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,760
When our parents passed away,
we first went to my uncle's place.

677
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,560
My aunt didn't want him
because he was deaf

678
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,320
and gave him to a family in Hualin.

679
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,630
They named him Fu Weijun
and he's used to that name.

680
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,910
Then when they had their own kid,
he went to the orphanage.

681
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,390
I wanted to go to college in Hualin
so that I could see him.

682
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,130
(And you're gonna die
if you don't break free.)

683
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,000
He's the only family member I've left.

684
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,840
Now, you've got one more.

685
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,730
(Only you can do that.)

686
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,960
(I'm going back. Leave me alone.)

687
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,430
Cui Guodong!

688
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,320
Down here!

689
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,080
Who found it?

690
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,120
Joint Defense.

691
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,910
It's in the trench.

692
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,320
Let me see.

693
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,390
Careful.

694
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,430
Let me see it!

695
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,040
Make a hole.

696
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,760
Didn't you circle a few drain outlets?

697
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,630
Joint Defense was checking them
and found something here.

698
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,950
Wang Xiang is good.

699
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,320
Are you OK?

700
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,120
Whoever did that is a monster!

701
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,000
There's a bag in the trench, too.

702
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,430
They found a meal card
of Hualin Health Vocational College.

703
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,560
Put yourself together. Go back to work.

704
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,470
Get out of here!

705
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,080
Leave no stone unturned.

706
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,140
(Daxiang Film)

707
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,800
Such content is poison.

708
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,950
No wonder he couldn't get into college.

709
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,180
(Alu's Death)

710
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,630
"At this moment,

711
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:46,280
I'd rather die before my father
and have my mother's elegy

712
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,230
guard me and the four seasons."

713
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,560
What kind of poetry is that?

714
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,000
Nothing rhymes.

715
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,430
Where is it?

716
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,150
Did someone break in?

717
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,280
Dad.

718
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,360
Why do you have a protective suit?

719
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,470
I haven't used it for years.

720
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,910
I wore it when going climbing
with Qu Bo earlier.

721
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,520
It could keep me warm.

722
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,150
Where did you go? A snow mountain?

723
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,520
Where's our old map?

724
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,040
I think

725
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,470
I put it in a cookbook.

726
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,470
It's up there.

727
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,710
Why did you put it that high?

728
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,670
Hey, what do you need the map for?

729
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,870
It's for the dismemberment case.

730
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,760
I'm helping the police
watch over the factory.

731
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,000
I need to have a meeting
with Xing Jianchun.

732
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,910
What about lunch?

733
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,040
Justice prevails over food.

734
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,520
What a busybody!

735
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,390
Mr. Wang.

736
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,520
The train will gather rust
if it continues sitting there.

737
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,520
Relax.

738
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,280
There won't be
a single rusty screw cap under my watch.

739
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,190
The train will outlive you.

740
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,840
Isn't that Security's thermos?

741
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,910
Did they transfer you there?

742
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,230
I'm working on something else
and teaching the staff of Security.

743
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,710
You're teaching them?

744
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,390
I should find time
to teach you guys, too.

745
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,910
My lecture will be:

746
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,560
Keep Guard Up and Eyes Open.

747
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,040
Where are their manners?

748
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,800
Mr. Wang.

749
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,150
(Meeting at 1 p.m.!)

750
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,390
You're leaving? What about the meeting?

751
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,710
Where is everyone?

752
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,470
We're supposed to begin at 1 p.m.

753
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:25,430
Where are your people?

754
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,390
Look,

755
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,630
I just got a call from Mr. Ma.

756
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:33,430
He asked me to work with you
on the internal investigation.

757
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:36,430
Now, I know what to do.

758
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,390
Save it...

759
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:41,040
Speaking of this matter,
here's what I think.

760
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,360
Well, actually,

761
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,630
I think we're zeroing in on him.

762
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,040
Who is that?

763
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,150
Not sure yet, but I think
the killer did show up here.

764
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,710
You know why nobody came?

765
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:15,230
They're all on stakeouts.

766
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,040
Stakeouts?

767
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,760
That's right.

768
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:24,760
So?

769
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,670
Found anything?

770
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:26,870
Nothing yet.

771
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:31,760
Dazhi, tell Mr. Wang
what you saw that night.

772
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,430
So the other night,

773
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:40,150
I finished my shift and
brought my stuff to shower.

774
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:45,190
Then I passed the furnaces
and kept going and going.

775
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,280
Suddenly,

776
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:48,950
I heard something.

777
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,150
Like what?

778
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,280
I stopped, he stopped.

779
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,520
I walked, he walked.

780
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,120
Then I looked over toward the furnaces.

781
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:03,470
What did you see?

782
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,760
I saw a guy in full protective clothing
standing above the furnace.

783
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,800
Then he turned around, faceless.

784
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,360
Faceless?

785
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,710
I don't buy it.

786
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,950
If I lied,

787
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:18,870
I'd be a pig.

788
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,910
If you couldn't see his face, how
could you be sure that he's the killer?

789
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:24,800
I...

790
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,520
About that, think about it.

791
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,040
That guy cut a human in pieces.

792
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,230
He's more than ruthless.

793
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,360
You can pick up his murderous vibes!

794
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,150
Dazhi saw it.

795
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:35,280
You saw it, didn't you?

796
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:35,950
See?

797
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:42,000
So you didn't see anything
but his murderous vibes.

798
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:43,840
I'm serious.

799
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,560
You two may leave.

800
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,150
Wang Xiang,

801
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:52,430
I'm telling you, he's come once, and
it's possible that he'll come again.

802
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,360
I've mobilized everyone in my section.

803
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,320
Every entrance of every factory
and the main roads is now under watch.

804
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,950
We're looking for a male under 1.8 meters
with murderous vibes.

805
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,950
A male under 1.8 meters
with murderous vibes.

806
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:11,760
We've got hundreds of them
if not a thousand as poverty can bring out

807
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,670
the worst in people.

808
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,760
Wang Xiang, you're a senior worker.

809
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,840
You should set an example.

810
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,600
Steel-making Shop is
where the suspect was first spotted.

811
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,560
I want you to watch it.

812
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:27,910
Why?

813
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,230
Why not report it to Captain Ma?

814
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,840
We don't have proof yet.

815
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,560
Are you doing it or not?

816
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,800
If not, I'll assign someone else.

817
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,190
Wait! I will do it!

818
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,470
Why would I say no?

819
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,630
But my question is: why would he choose
this shop in particular?

820
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,710
When you catch him, ask him yourself.

821
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:48,520
What is it?

822
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,120
A whistle.

823
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:50,910
For what?

824
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:51,560
For you to blow.

825
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,390
If you see anything suspicious,
call for backup.

826
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,870
Take it.

827
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,080
Your shift is two hours.

828
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:57,950
Then we'll switch.

829
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:39,630
You?

830
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:43,520
And you?

831
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,280
A straight and a pair of sevens!

832
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,040
Show me your cards.

833
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,560
You need a pair of twos!

834
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,360
You stink!

835
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,150
Come on. Another round.

836
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,000
Here you go, Chief.

837
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,630
Wang Xiang is still on a stakeout.

838
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,120
And? You wanna take his spot?

839
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:04,870
No way.

840
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,670
He's craving credit even in his dreams.

841
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:08,630
I should wake him up.

842
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,870
How dare a humble driver
stick his nose into my section!

843
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:16,430
So what if you're from the bureau
or a captain in the police force?

844
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:17,840
I'll tell you this.

845
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,230
That won't work in Hualin Steel!

846
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,150
You rock!

847
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,120
Indeed!

848
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:22,710
That's right.

849
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:29,150
But, sir, what if
Dazhi did see the killer?

850
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,870
Wang Xiang would never catch him.

851
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,910
He meant to do that to save his job.

852
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,390
Nice try.

853
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,430
Liru!

854
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:41,360
Liru!

855
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:48,040
What took you so long?

856
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,280
I rushed over
from your hospital.

857
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,190
Why did you go there?

858
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:52,520
We agreed to meet here.

859
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,430
Something happened at work.

860
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,000
My boss, Director Zhao, got cornered
by two workers in the canteen.

861
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,630
They beat him up.

862
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,360
He was bleeding all over.

863
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,320
I had left,
but they called me back.

864
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,910
Those guys in my office
couldn't do anything.

865
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:06,120
I had to go back
and take care of the mess.

866
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,560
I'm off duty.

867
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,950
No more work-related topics.

868
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:11,910
Sorry.

869
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,080
You must be hungry.

870
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:15,280
Did you just get one for yourself?

871
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,320
Are we going to watch the movie or not?

872
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:19,710
We are! I picked that one in particular.

873
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,320
It's about a couple. Quite romantic.

874
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:22,600
Give me a sec.

875
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,390
I'm putting my bike here.

876
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,560
Where did you
get that baked sweet potato?

877
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,670
I'd like one, too.

878
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,150
I picked the wrong one.

879
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:53,710
I didn't know
they'd hook up like this.

880
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:54,360
When I saw the name,

881
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,710
I thought it'd be about Yu Dafu

882
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:57,000
or Lin Huiyin.
[*Both are famous Chinese writers.]

883
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:03,320
It is kinda sweet,
but the jumpy scenes make me dizzy.

884
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,600
That actor looks a bit like you.

885
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,280
Really?

886
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,710
They always said

887
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:17,950
I could be an actor,
but I chose academia.

888
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,230
Did Xiang tell you about me?

889
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,470
Who?

890
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:31,080
Mr. Wang.

891
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,910
Uh, not much, actually.

892
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,670
Here's the thing.

893
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:48,870
They say career before marriage.

894
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:54,600
Right now, my career is rising.

895
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,120
In Factory Affairs Office,

896
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,000
I'm only under Director Zhao.

897
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,600
Just say it. I can hear you.

898
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,950
Freud once said
a psychologically healthy person

899
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:17,360
should be able to do two things:

900
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:20,800
"lieben und arbeiten",
to love and to work.

901
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,280
In terms of work,

902
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,470
I'm practically way ahead of others.

903
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,910
So what I need is someone to love.

904
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,040
Who's Freud?

905
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,840
A scholar studying dreams.

906
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,600
Did he get an apartment?

907
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,760
No, he didn't work at our factory.

908
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,800
Do you have one?

909
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,230
Almost.

910
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:48,630
I've had a serious discussion
about it with Zhao.

911
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,360
You see,

912
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,840
Mr. Song values talents.

913
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,600
Based on my performance,

914
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,320
I'll be in the next batch
of housing allocation.

915
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,150
Liru, if you're dating someone,
what's your type?

916
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,560
I prefer the mature ones.

917
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,230
I excel at it.

918
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,120
Why is that?

919
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,320
They all say

920
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,600
I look older than my age.

921
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,800
Watch the movie. Don't move.

922
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,630
It's your hair.

923
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:42,470
What's there to watch anyway?

924
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:44,520
I'm not interested in those guys.

925
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,140
(Hualin Cinema)

926
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,000
Liru, wait.

927
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,800
I'll give you a ride.

928
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:00,800
Hop on.

929
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,040
You're going back to the dorm, right?

930
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,000
I'm going the other way.

931
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,280
The earth is round.

932
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,080
Whichever way we take,
we'll get there eventually.

933
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:10,600
Thanks, but no.

934
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,520
How about we watch another movie later?

935
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,150
We'll see. Bye.

936
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,840
Who unplugged my valve core?

937
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,670
Did you see it, sweet potato guy?

938
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,120
Mr. Wang!

939
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,430
Mr. Wang, are you hungry?

940
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,430
How about we go and grab a bite?

941
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,320
Stand up.

942
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:40,080
Why?

943
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:45,840
Now, turn.

944
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:51,950
What's this about?

945
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,150
How tall are you?

946
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:53,840
1.8 meters.

947
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,280
Really?

948
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:58,910
1.785 without my shoes
and 1.8 with them.

949
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,670
I mean,
you work in Factory Affairs Office.

950
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,870
Why put on such a suit?

951
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:07,710
What are you up to?

952
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,120
Safety first, right?

953
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:11,630
Suit up
before entering the Steel-making Shop.

954
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:13,840
Aren't you cautious?

955
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,280
Sit.

956
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:26,470
How did you know where to find me?

957
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,320
I went to Locomotives first.

958
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,190
They said you had a meeting
with Security.

959
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:33,760
When I got there,
they said to try my luck at the crane.

960
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,910
And here you are,
waiting to be hooked.

961
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,520
Say what?

962
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,760
Hooked?

963
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,670
I didn't mean that.

964
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,870
This is a hook.

965
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:46,360
Yeah.

966
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,560
Also, I chose to expose myself.

967
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,080
Otherwise, you wouldn't have found me.

968
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,120
Yes, of course.

969
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,560
You were so good at hiding.

970
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,320
I... I put it the wrong way.

971
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,080
Forget about that potato.

972
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:06,230
Let's go out and talk over proper food.

973
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:06,910
My treat.

974
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:09,800
There's no such thing as a free meal.

975
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:12,560
What's this about?

976
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,800
It's about Liru and me.

977
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:20,470
We need a push.

978
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:21,630
I don't think so.

979
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:23,320
Didn't you go to the cinema?

980
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,190
Don't get me started.

981
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,080
That movie was a bad choice.

982
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,390
It's not about that.

983
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:36,600
Mr. Wang, your help will be appreciated.

984
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:43,430
Where did you get that booze?

985
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:44,910
Mr. Song gave it to me.

986
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:53,800
Song Yukun gave you this?

987
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,150
A friend of mine taught
his son English for free.

988
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:59,360
So he gave me that in return.

989
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,800
He said it's quite aged.

990
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,520
It's old enough to be your uncle.

991
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:09,190
As long as Liru and I can get together,
it can be my grandpa. I mean it.

992
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,520
Is your office busy lately?

993
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,280
Why?

994
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:14,560
If you're free,

995
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,150
I could use your help with the
ongoing internal investigation.

996
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:20,870
Sure. No problem.

997
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,950
Your wish is my command.

998
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:25,800
So Liru and I...?

999
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:27,910
Wait for the good news.

1000
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,120
Is it cooked?

1001
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,120
Can I have a bite?

1002
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:40,190
It tastes good!

1003
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:25,840
Captain Ma,
this is Shen Mo's guidance counselor.

1004
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:27,560
Ma Desheng, Criminal Police Unit.

1005
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,230
Hello.

1006
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:30,470
So, is that Shen Mo's stuff?

1007
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,800
Hey, let's sit.

1008
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,430
Shen Mo was from Songhe.

1009
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:41,870
She seemed to be shy and quiet.

1010
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,150
Academically, she was above average.

1011
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:49,040
She didn't cause us too much trouble
except for

1012
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,390
that incident earlier.

1013
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,320
What happened?

1014
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,120
Is it sensitive?

1015
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,080
Where did you get these?

1016
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:34,910
Those photos and that letter
were found on the bulletin board

1017
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:39,120
outside the school canteen
in the morning on the 20th.

1018
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,520
The letter also said

1019
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:47,230
Shen Mo was an escort in a brothel,

1020
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,000
drinking and sleeping with her clients.

1021
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,150
Why didn't you call the police?

1022
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,080
Our school was concerned
about our reputation.

1023
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:06,710
I had heard such rumors
from other students.

1024
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,950
Her life outside campus
seemed to be complicated.

1025
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:11,760
And there was this boy
who came all the time.

1026
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:12,760
Yes. That's right.

1027
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,950
He even wrote a letter of apology
in the Dean's Office.

1028
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,430
How about we call it a day, Mr. Wang?

1029
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:50,430
I need to go back to my office
in case they need me.

1030
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,630
What's this mess?

1031
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:01,280
Go easy.

1032
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,630
Don't ruin my pants.

1033
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,870
Shed a light.

1034
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:09,760
Over there.

1035
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,190
Keep going!

1036
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:12,080
This is the farthest I can go.

1037
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:14,190
That's it. Yeah.

1038
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:15,190
Don't move. That's the one.

1039
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,600
Mr. Wang!

1040
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:55,670
Mr. Wang!

1041
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,560
Right here.

1042
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:58,520
Bad news, Mr. Wang!

1043
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,390
What's wrong?

1044
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:02,710
Your wife said on the phone
that the police took your son away!

1045
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,180
(Hualin Public Security Bureau)

1046
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,940
(The police should serve the people.)

1047
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:34,190
What's wrong?

1048
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,600
Answer my question!

1049
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,600
Mr. Wang, calm down.

1050
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,190
We brought him in
for asking him something about a case.

1051
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,910
Now, we're done. He can go home.

1052
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,120
What case?

1053
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,280
What is it?

1054
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,320
Say it!

1055
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:54,670
Stop!

1056
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:57,150
Did I say you can leave?

1057
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:00,600
Hey, is Captain Ma in his office?

1058
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:03,760
Keep an eye on him, will you?

1059
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:07,320
Captain Ma,

1060
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,190
I thought you went out.

1061
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:10,800
I'm glad you're here.

1062
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:15,600
What happened to my son, Yang,

1063
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,120
Captain Ma?

1064
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:27,320
Is Wang Yang your son?

1065
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:28,710
Yeah.

1066
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,280
He was dating this girl, Shen Mo.

1067
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,230
You know that?

1068
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:35,430
Shen Mo?

1069
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:38,390
I don't know
they were seeing each other.

1070
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,230
You can ask him when you get back.

1071
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:41,040
I'm done here.

1072
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:44,630
Tell your son
he can't get out of town these days.

1073
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,710
We might bring him in
for questioning again.

1074
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,040
I see.

1075
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:55,520
Sir,

1076
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,870
I found something in the factory...

1077
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:03,000
Mr. Wang,
you shouldn't come here again.

1078
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,600
And stay away from this case.

1079
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:08,800
Your job is to drive trains.

1080
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,560
But I'm your Watson, right?

1081
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,190
Stories aren't reality.

1082
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:20,910
I prefer Raymond Chandler.
[*A renowned American crime writer.]

1083
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,600
Guodong, show Mr. Wang out.

1084
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,390
Chan... Chandler who?

1085
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:27,320
Mr. Wang.

1086
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:28,870
Let's go.

1087
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:30,000
Sure.

1088
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,360
Sir, I...

1089
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,080
Coming.

1090
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,360
Look what you've done!

1091
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,800
You even had a girlfriend?

1092
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:06,950
What happened to her?

1093
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,560
I have said everything to the police.

1094
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:13,670
She died, you know that?

1095
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:19,630
I told you not to work at the
wrong place, but you didn't listen.

1096
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:24,800
When we get home, you're grounded

1097
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,390
until this case is solved.

1098
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,000
You can't go out before that.

1099
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,230
Stop!

1100
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,520
You can't run away from the problem!

1101
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,470
You can tell me whatever happened.

1102
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:03,800
Where's Yang?

1103
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,630
Why didn't he come back with you?

1104
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:08,120
He'll be back in no time.

1105
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,950
What did the police say?

1106
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:11,120
Nothing really. It's fine.

1107
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:13,840
Really? But why did the police need him?

1108
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,320
Hey, wait!

1109
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,870
I'm... I'm talking to you!

1110
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:24,320
I called you to pick up my son.

1111
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,800
Where is he now?

1112
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:27,910
My heart is racing!

1113
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:29,560
Are you sure he's OK?

1114
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,600
Don't fool me.

1115
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,600
He's my son, too.

1116
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,040
I won't let anything happen to him.

1117
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,520
When will he get back?

1118
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,630
Stop following me around.

1119
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:37,560
You're giving me a headache!

1120
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,230
I need to lie down.

1121
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,150
I'm having one, too!

1122
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:15,360
Quit it.

1123
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:19,020
(ME's Office)

1124
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,840
Captain, they're Shen Mo's next of kin.

1125
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,760
They came from Songhe
for the identification.

1126
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,150
Head of the Criminal Police Unit,

1127
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:26,150
Ma Desheng.

1128
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:26,630
Hello.

1129
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,230
Captain Ma,

1130
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:33,870
I was born here, too,
and worked in the city

1131
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:35,910
a few years back.

1132
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:38,870
I've got connections in your bureau.

1133
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:40,910
Are you done?

1134
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,120
Li Qun, bring him to the office.

1135
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:44,390
This way, please.

1136
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:46,600
Is there anything else?

1137
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,000
The investigation is still ongoing.

1138
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,190
I need to ask you
about Shen Mo's recent life.

1139
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,760
Well, we've booked return tickets.

1140
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,950
The train waits for no men.

1141
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:59,120
I'm quite busy.

1142
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,520
I need to go back to Songhe.

1143
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,280
It's not like we can do it
on the train, right?

1144
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,190
We're all busy.

1145
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,390
OK.

1146
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:10,280
We'll comply.

1147
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Stop crying.

1148
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:16,720
Let's go.

1149
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:33,000
Captain, that guy strikes me as odd.

1150
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:33,910
How so?

1151
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,390
He reminds me of you.

1152
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,310
No way!

1153
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,560
I mean he doesn't look like her father.

1154
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,910
That's because he isn't.

1155
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:43,600
He's her uncle.

1156
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,950
He adopted Shen Mo.

1157
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,740
(The police should serve the people.)

1158
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,240
Come here.

1159
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:56,870
Take a look.

1160
01:08:57,790 --> 01:08:58,830
You've got sharp eyes.

1161
01:08:58,830 --> 01:08:59,430
Look at this.

1162
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:02,200
There are two characters on the
thermos next to the nightstand.

1163
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,160
What's the last one?

1164
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,520
The paint's scraped off.

1165
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,600
I know. That's why I need your help.

1166
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:14,680
"Hui". It's "Hui".

1167
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:16,040
Am I right?

1168
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:20,680
Captain Ma,
Director Zhu is calling for a meeting.

1169
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:24,470
This late?

1170
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:27,830
Here you go.

1171
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,120
Eat it after the meeting.

1172
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,350
I need water. I'm thirsty.

1173
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:32,720
It's empty.

1174
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,680
Come on!

1175
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,040
Director.

1176
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:02,560
Take a seat.

1177
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:08,790
Sir...

1178
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:13,910
That so-called Hong Kong businessman is
actually from Zhanjiang, Guangdong.

1179
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,240
His company is registered
in Hong Kong, China.

1180
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:19,000
He contacted his driver on the fifth,
then he's gone radio silent since.

1181
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,910
Before he disappeared,
he received a bank draft

1182
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:22,160
worth 800 grand from Hualin Steel.

1183
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:24,470
The bank said
the money had been withdrawn,

1184
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,470
Now, we believe this case might
be more than a simple fraud.

1185
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,390
Do you know any of that,

1186
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:31,040
Ma Desheng?

1187
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,720
Aren't you their captain?

1188
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,080
I'm working around the clock.

1189
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,910
I need results!

1190
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,000
The dismemberment case
is no longer your concern.

1191
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,120
Police Corps will take over.

1192
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,750
Your priority now is
to follow the money.

1193
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:48,720
Find out who withdrew it.

1194
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,200
Sure, sure.

1195
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,240
Of course.

1196
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,520
I'll do it, but not now.

1197
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,040
Wait until I get back from Songhe.

1198
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,080
Why are you going there?

1199
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,600
The one who took nude photos of Shen Mo
and wrote the anonymous letter

1200
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,430
must be someone she knew.

1201
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,270
I have to go there.

1202
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:03,120
Alone.

1203
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,270
I need to check with her family again.

1204
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:07,560
Ma Desheng,
did you not hear what I just said?

1205
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,750
I can't do anything else.

1206
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,310
Her remains are right there!

1207
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,270
But we're so close to solving that case.

1208
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:14,830
What if the suspect got away?

1209
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:19,720
Ma Desheng, as a police officer, you
have to do your best in every single case!

1210
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,240
Yes, I am!

1211
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,430
So I have to catch that murderer!

1212
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,750
Sir, regarding that missing businessman,

1213
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,790
I've got a theory.

1214
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:33,160
I can fill in for Captain
Ma to trace the money.

1215
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,160
Enough.

1216
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,200
This has nothing to do with you.

1217
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,390
Why?

1218
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:37,680
He's one of us, too.

1219
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:52,460
(The police should serve the people.)

1220
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,120
Your wallet!

1221
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:06,240
It's late.

1222
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,310
Are you driving there alone?

1223
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:07,680
Why?

1224
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,200
Are you coming with me?

1225
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,310
Get in. I'll be your driver.

1226
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,830
You stay and help Li Qun
trace the money.

1227
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:13,750
I'm fine.

1228
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,000
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

1229
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,910
Don't bring that guy up.

1230
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:19,750
You saw what he was like just now.

1231
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:21,790
He meant to step in.

1232
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:23,000
Who does he think he is?

1233
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,270
That rat!

1234
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:25,830
He took the bullet for me.

1235
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:27,080
Alright. Gotta go.

1236
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:30,910
Got a cigarette?

1237
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:32,560
Why? Are you done quitting it?

1238
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:36,430
Never mind.
