00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,900
=The Long Season 12=

2
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,470
Ms. Luo.

3
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,670
I got the portrait back.

4
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,670
Take... Take a seat.

5
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,130
Meisu.

6
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,160
Where shall I put this portrait?

7
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,750
Put it here.

8
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,270
Here?

9
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,760
It's inappropriate.

10
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,030
It's where they pass every day.

11
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,750
How about we put it in his bedroom?

12
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,110
It's vacant, anyway.

13
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,190
It should be put somewhere lively.

14
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,800
Mr. Wang.

15
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,000
Are you OK?

16
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,320
Yes.

17
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,080
Mr. Wang, our team members
have all come.

18
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
If you need any help, let us know.

19
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,000
OK.

20
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,320
My son loves the pork knuckle

21
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,750
I make, you know?

22
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,270
He used to think
we had too many vegetables.

23
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,360
Every time I made it, he ate a lot.

24
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,270
Where shall I put the portrait?

25
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,550
Here.

26
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,520
Somewhere warm.

27
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,080
Facing the sun.

28
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:57,620
(Song Yukun, the factory manager, paid
a caring visit to vigilante Wang Xiang.)

29
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,880
Look.

30
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,480
How about I put the portrait here?

31
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,950
Is it straightened?

32
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,160
We don't hang a portrait of him.

33
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,640
And don't hang that of me after I die.

34
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,880
Meisu, I...

35
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,320
Meisu.

36
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,830
Meisu, are there more chairs?

37
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,790
We still need one.

38
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,950
I don't want to see you.

39
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,390
What are you waiting for?

40
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,440
Enjoy the meal. Hurry.

41
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:36,760
Come on.

42
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,600
Take up your chopsticks.

43
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,230
Quanli.

44
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,600
Qiaoyun.

45
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:40,950
Here.

46
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,950
Eat. Eat.

47
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,230
Come on.

48
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,040
Enjoy the food.

49
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,040
You don't like the food?

50
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,480
I do, I do.

51
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,760
I do.

52
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,510
Oh, my silly head.

53
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,480
When I was talking to you,

54
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,230
I put some salt in twice.

55
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,270
Oh, what the heck!

56
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,880
When someone gets old, she just...

57
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,040
Have some fish.

58
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,000
I tasted it. It's OK.

59
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,350
Come on.

60
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:29,790
Taste some.

61
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,480
I'll get it myself.

62
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,950
Eat.

63
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:35,880
Eat.

64
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,390
Eat. Not too many fishbones.

65
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,510
Mr. Wang and Ms. Luo,

66
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,670
I came to check up on you.

67
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,350
Come and sit, Captain Ma.

68
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,000
He won't come in. You enjoy the food.

69
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,230
Come out with me.

70
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,600
What have you got about Yang's case?

71
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,070
Suicide.

72
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,270
He jumped off the
Xiaoliang River Bridge.

73
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,230
His body, had no other wounds, but
the bruises of knocking onto the water.

74
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,920
I knew this.

75
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,390
Other police officers told me about it.

76
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,070
But that is wrong.

77
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,880
I want to know your deduction.

78
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,070
When I see you like this,

79
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,440
I feel really bad.

80
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,070
But think about it.

81
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Does Wang Yang want
to see you like this?

82
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,000
If you want me to get better,
find out the truth.

83
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,320
I want to know who killed my son.

84
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,760
Fine, fine.

85
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll investigate it.

86
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,080
You're fencing with me.

87
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,520
But now, this is the truth.

88
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,710
You should believe the evidence
and the police.

89
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,110
You're a policeman.

90
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,640
I trusted you.

91
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,080
And then?

92
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,640
What happened to my son?

93
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,960
If you had told me what you had known...

94
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,440
I called you.

95
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,000
Did you reply?

96
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,110
This isn't what I want.

97
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,640
I want my son back.

98
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,030
He didn't kill anyone.

99
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,000
He couldn't have killed himself, either.

100
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,320
Leave.

101
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:41,910
Well done,

102
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,400
Qun.

103
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,710
You've solved such a big case.

104
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,640
Stop calling him Qun.

105
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,350
Call him Captain Li.

106
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,520
Don't wait.

107
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,000
Call me Captain Li now.

108
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,470
Captain Li is getting excited.

109
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,760
Come on. Get Captain Li some water.

110
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Fine, fine.

111
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,590
I just helped our colleagues.

112
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,790
Give me some help, too.

113
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,520
OK.

114
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,230
No more water, don't you know?

115
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,030
What are you thinking all day long?

116
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,640
Darn it!

117
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,670
Didn't you quit smoking?

118
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,440
Get me the file.

119
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,910
But Captain Ma,

120
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,590
Director Zhu said

121
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,400
I would do the follow-up on this case.

122
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,110
And you'll have a couple of days off.

123
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,640
What do you mean?

124
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,760
Get over me with him?

125
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,910
No. I don't mean that.

126
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,670
Even if you do, hold it back.

127
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,440
Want a revolt, Captain Li?

128
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,000
I can't order you about, huh?

129
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,880
Didn't you hear me?

130
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,400
What did I say?

131
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,790
Get me the file!

132
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,200
What about your self-criticism?

133
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,670
No time for that.

134
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,710
What you did in Songhe got messier.

135
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,520
Illegal interrogation and fight.

136
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,200
You'll certainly be disciplined.

137
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,470
Go write a self-criticism
and stop working.

138
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,880
When you can be reinstated
will be decided later.

139
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Then how could I investigate the case?

140
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't bother!

141
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,710
It's no longer your concern!

142
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,150
Someone else will investigate it.

143
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,110
Li Qun?

144
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,320
I disapprove!

145
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,080
You have no right to disapprove!

146
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,400
Go work on your self-criticism.

147
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,030
I'll investigate Weijun!

148
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,150
Immediately!

149
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,550
Ma Desheng, are you out of your mind?

150
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,110
Do you know how Lu Wenzhong was killed?

151
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,150
Song Yukun embezzled his workers'
resettlement money and has been arrested!

152
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,550
Have you ever asked about these cases?

153
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,000
Go look in the mirror.

154
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,670
Do you still look like a policeman?

155
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,030
And can you still recognize yourself?

156
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,150
What are you doing, Ma Desheng?

157
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,880
Are you insane?

158
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,110
I don't deserve this uniform.

159
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,400
I'll quit.

160
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,350
Come back!

161
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,200
Thank you for coming.

162
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,350
Thank you.

163
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,520
We should go, Mr. Wang.

164
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,000
OK.

165
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,320
You go first.

166
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,670
I'll have a word with Mr. Wang.

167
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,840
Mr. Wang.

168
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,840
I... I just...

169
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,550
I...

170
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,110
We can't really help much.

171
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,520
This is all we can give.

172
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,350
Please take it.

173
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,110
My problem has been solved.

174
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,790
When my leg recovers,
I'll be back for work.

175
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,280
Not too much money. Just take it.

176
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,400
Mr. Wang, what are you doing?

177
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,230
You need more money than me.

178
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,150
You have a son to raise.

179
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,400
But in my family,
only my wife and I live.

180
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,350
We don't need a lot of money.

181
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,440
Quanli.

182
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,080
Whatever happens, bring your son up.

183
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,150
It's what a man should do.

184
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,550
This is where we part.

185
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,520
Meisu?

186
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,350
Meisu?

187
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,320
Meisu?

188
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,520
Meisu!

189
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,550
Meisu!

190
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,200
Meisu!

191
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,150
Meisu!

192
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,880
Meisu!

193
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,710
Meisu!

194
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,000
Meisu!

195
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,030
Meisu!

196
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:04,830
Meisu!

197
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,920
Meisu!

198
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,040
Meisu!

199
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,230
Help!

200
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,760
Somebody help!

201
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,280
Meisu.

202
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,230
Meisu, please don't.

203
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,350
Meisu.

204
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,520
Meisu, I'm sorry.

205
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,800
Help!

206
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:34,640
Meisu.

207
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,640
ID cards.

208
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,340
(File Envelop)

209
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,470
Luo Meisu. Relationship.

210
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,310
Husband and wife.

211
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,230
Wang Yang. Relationship.

212
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,470
Father and son.

213
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,820
(Luo Meisu, Wang Yang)

214
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Gong Biao's family.

215
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,110
She's arriving soon, I guess.

216
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,950
I... I'll rush her.

217
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,000
Hurry up.

218
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,760
Wang.

219
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,350
I got to the wrong place.

220
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,520
I went back there.

221
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,280
Where's Biao?

222
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,110
In there.

223
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,000
He's dressed.

224
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,040
How about you take a look at him?

225
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,920
I brought some cosmetics
to give him some makeup.

226
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,400
I'd be worried if someone else did.

227
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,280
I'll tell them about it.

228
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,160
Excuse me, sir.

229
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,710
Gong Biao's wife has come.

230
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,950
She wants to check on him
and give him some makeup.

231
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,430
Come in, then.

232
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,400
But don't stay there too long.

233
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,880
OK, OK.

234
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
OK. Thank you.

235
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,680
How about I get in, too?

236
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,560
Don't bother, Wang.

237
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,310
I...

238
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,560
I want some time with him alone.

239
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:39,660
(Let the dead rest in peace.
Please be quiet.)

240
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,000
Biao,

241
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,880
I'm not gonna cry today.

242
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,230
Or you would feel sorry.

243
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,830
You love the smiling me, right?

244
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,070
I'll smile, then.

245
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,430
These days, I was thinking.

246
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,430
You and I didn't have a very happy life.

247
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,760
Why?

248
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,590
I can't figure it out.

249
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,640
I want to ask you.

250
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,560
How about
we have another try in the next life?

251
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,310
What do you say?

252
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,160
What about this?

253
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,190
Red sandalwood made in China.

254
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,640
The price is good. 2,500 yuan.

255
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,350
A little bit old-fashioned.

256
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,310
How much is this one?

257
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,520
A bit more expensive. 4,000 yuan.

258
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,800
Made of Indian red sandalwood.

259
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,520
I'll take this one.

260
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,560
The wood is very good.

261
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,640
It would never be broken.

262
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,520
Look.

263
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,560
You can even put a photo here.

264
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,760
Have you brought his photo?

265
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,880
I can put it in for you.

266
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,070
I have to search his flat for a photo.

267
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,920
How about this?

268
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,590
I'll pay for it first.

269
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,560
And then, you keep this for me.

270
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,000
Sure. Turn left and pay in the lobby.

271
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,520
OK.

272
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,190
Excuse me, do you have scissors?

273
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,560
Yes.

274
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,060
(Certificate of Hualin Taxi Driver
Name: Gong Biao)

275
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,880
Biao, you made sense.

276
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,280
Every one of us should be happy, right?

277
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,680
You're awake?

278
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,710
Where are the words?

279
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,520
What words?

280
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,280
Words.

281
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,400
The words.

282
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,350
What words?

283
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,040
Gong Hui
[*Labor Union].

284
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,190
What labor union?

285
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,830
Whose is this?

286
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,160
The hospital's.

287
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Hands off me!

288
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,640
Whose is this?

289
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,040
The hospital's.

290
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,640
Hands off me!

291
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,590
What do you want?

292
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,230
Who are you?

293
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:17,760
None of your business!

294
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,400
Let go of me!

295
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,830
Who are you?

296
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,760
Tell me who you are.

297
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,590
It belongs to the hospital.

298
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,070
Doctor!

299
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,520
Whose is this?

300
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,710
Doctor!

301
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,800
Where are the words on it?

302
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,070
What are you doing?

303
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,230
It doesn't belong to the hospital!

304
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,520
And who are you?

305
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,230
What's wrong with him?

306
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,160
He had a suffusion of blood on the brain
and he's a little bit muddle-headed.

307
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,230
This is horrible.

308
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,000
Sorry, sorry.

309
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
Feeling any better?

310
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,160
Wang Xiang.

311
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,280
What are you doing here?

312
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,710
Why do you look so old?

313
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,950
What's going on here?

314
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,520
This...

315
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:15,920
What...

316
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,520
What is this place?

317
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,800
What's going on here?

318
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,280
Where am I?

319
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
It's the hospital.

320
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,470
Stop shouting.

321
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,470
Don't disturb anyone else.

322
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,000
- What's going on?
- (Get a doctor.)

323
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,040
(Get a doctor.)

324
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,520
What happened to me?

325
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,160
Well, return this to him.

326
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,520
In life, does he have any bad habits?

327
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,680
Something like smoking or drinking.

328
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,800
He gave up smoking a long time ago.

329
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,430
He drinks a little bit.

330
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,640
But he loves coffee
and drinks quite a lot.

331
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,560
That's not the problem.

332
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,110
He should drink no more alcohol.

333
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,040
The suffusion of blood isn't serious.

334
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,640
But next time, it would be.

335
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,520
All right. Go take care of him.

336
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,400
Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

337
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,710
You're welcome.

338
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,400
OK.

339
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,880
Don't be anxious.

340
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,470
According to the doctor,
you can easily recover

341
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,110
without bad effects.

342
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,430
Like Biao said,

343
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,000
for a real man,
tomorrow is always another day.

344
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,920
Even I can understand this,
why can't you?

345
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,880
Would you get up?

346
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,430
Let me wash your face and cut your hair.

347
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,110
Make you spirited, OK?

348
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,470
I just didn't like your long hair.

349
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,070
You look good now.

350
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,040
Very tidy.

351
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,590
Look.

352
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,560
This is you, Captain Ma.

353
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,880
Look.

354
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,680
Practice using your hand.

355
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,110
Here. Hold it.

356
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Have a nap in the afternoon.

357
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,400
Wang Bei will be back this afternoon.

358
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,560
I have to pick him up at the station.

359
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,640
I'll come tonight.

360
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,350
Tidy, huh?

361
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,000
I got it.

362
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,590
That'd be great.

363
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,590
I'll ask the nurse
to give you less enema.

364
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,760
Hold it.

365
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,230
Here. Don't do it in your pants.

366
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,680
I'm going to the Bureau.

367
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,230
What?

368
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,640
Give me my coat.
I'm going to the Bureau!

369
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,110
This is the report on the tissue
from Shen Dongliang's nails.

370
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,680
The test result shows
this DNA belongs to someone

371
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,190
collateral relative by blood
with Shen Dongliang.

372
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,310
We compared it with two samples
kept in the body bag of 1998.

373
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,350
One of the samples matches it.

374
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,590
And Hu Xuelu,
who was hit on Shunxing Street, woke up.

375
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,520
She confirmed that a woman hit her.

376
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,000
It testified to our thought

377
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,350
that Yin Hong we were looking for
is actually Shen Mo.

378
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,470
Did you visit Yin Hong's hometown?

379
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,160
Yes.

380
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,640
Yin Hong has a single-parent family.

381
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,160
After her mother died, she ran away
from home and never went back again.

382
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,880
Contact her immediate family
for a DNA test.

383
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,520
And send some men
to check the cemeteries near Hualian.

384
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:07,950
See if you can find

385
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,230
Fu Weijun's registration record.

386
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,830
A probe at the coach station photographed
the driver of the clone car.

387
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,470
It wasn't Shen Hui, but Shen Dongliang.

388
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:19,470
In the early morning of the 20th, he drove
this clone car to the coach station.

389
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,000
After Shen Mo got off the coach,
he stalked her to the 6th Road.

390
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,190
Then he hit her and escaped.

391
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,400
How's Zhao Jing now?

392
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,880
Not conscious enough for the inquiry.

393
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,040
According to your deduction,

394
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,430
Shen Dongliang followed
the address on Fu Weijun's letters

395
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,760
to have contacted Shen Mo.

396
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,230
Then, he got a fake license plate

397
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,350
and planned to hit her
after she returned to Hualin.

398
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,880
After Shen Mo got away, she sneaked back
and killed Shen Dongliang

399
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,950
just to get Fu Weijun's ashes.

400
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,760
This is exactly
what we've analyzed so far.

401
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:57,880
The relationship between Shen Dongliang
and Shen Mo is very doubtful.

402
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,950
When Shen Mo was little,

403
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,470
Shen Dongliang adopted her.

404
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:05,110
He was taking all the trouble
to kill his adopted daughter?

405
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,280
What was the motivation?

406
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,230
Sir, you can't get in.

407
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:09,710
Why do you stop me?

408
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,680
Report a case down there.

409
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,920
Re... Report a case?

410
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,040
I solve cases.

411
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,590
Who are you?

412
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,280
You don't even know me?

413
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,920
He's Captain Ma.

414
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,190
Captain who?

415
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,040
Cui Guodong!

416
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,920
Stop yelling. Stop.

417
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,800
Li Qun!

418
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,160
Desheng!

419
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,070
What are you doing here?

420
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,430
I've been looking for you.

421
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,000
So, you're here.

422
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,160
Go get our men for a meeting.

423
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:35,710
Take my...

424
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,000
OK, I'll take your arm.

425
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,760
He insisted. I failed to stop him.

426
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,800
Is everyone here?

427
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,110
Yes.

428
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,950
Li.

429
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,470
Li?

430
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,230
Li...

431
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,070
Here I am.

432
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,590
Li.

433
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,560
I don't mean you.

434
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,880
Li!

435
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,110
Li!

436
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,760
Captain Ma.

437
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,680
Captain Ma.

438
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,920
Someone's taking care of it.

439
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,110
Why are you here?

440
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,350
It's our meeting.

441
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,920
Stay out.

442
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,880
Where's the tea?

443
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,800
The best tea.

444
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,680
Why don't you make some for me?

445
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,310
Go make some tea.

446
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,590
Let me tell you a story.

447
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,560
Once upon a time, there was a constable.

448
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,710
What's a constable?

449
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,520
Policeman in ancient times.

450
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,710
The constable caught a monk
who did a crime.

451
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,110
He would take the monk to the governor.

452
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,830
At night, the monk

453
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,520
saw the constable sleeping
and he ran away.

454
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:20,350
Before that, he shaved
the constable's hair.

455
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,470
When the constable woke up,

456
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,680
"Why do I feel something missing?"

457
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,400
"My luggage is here."

458
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,040
"And my pass..."

459
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,350
"It's not lost."

460
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,000
"Still here."

461
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,190
Something's wrong.

462
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,280
He stroked his head.

463
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,070
"Oh, the monk is also here."

464
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,830
"Then what's missing?"

465
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,000
"What about me?"

466
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,310
"Where have I gone?"

467
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,560
Understand?

468
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,830
Yes.

469
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,110
No, you don't.

470
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,640
It's about the dismemberment case
of Hualin Steel.

471
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,870
The constable refers to us.

472
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,950
And the monk is Shen Mo.

473
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,890
What if Shen Mo wasn't dead?

474
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,080
It's Shen Mo
who was hit by the clone car.

475
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,520
It is also Shen Mo
who killed Shen Dongliang.

476
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,560
Does it make sense?

477
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,230
Then why did Shen Dongliang
want to kill Shen Mo?

478
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,760
And why did Shen Mo kill Shen Dongliang?

479
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,840
Shen Mo has been
Shen Dongliang's toy since little.

480
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,670
She was raped and manipulated.

481
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:48,230
Zhao Jing pretended to be ignorant.

482
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,320
To get rid of Shen Dongliang,

483
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,870
Shen Mo asked Fu Weijun to break

484
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,520
Shen Hui's arm.

485
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,390
Why did Shen Dongliang
take away Fu Weijun's ashes?

486
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,840
When he identified the corpse,
he knew it wasn't Shen Mo!

487
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,910
Over all these years,
he found Shen Mo at last.

488
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,150
Then think about it.

489
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:21,950
After killing Shen Dongliang,
this guy still tried to kill Zhao Jing.

490
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:27,040
(Hualin People's Hospital)
Who could hate them that much?

491
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,190
Can't you understand?

492
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,390
Take some men to the People's Hospital.

493
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:35,910
Aye.

494
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,390
Where's my thermos bottle?

495
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,190
Where is it?

496
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:43,910
Is it still here?

497
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,230
Desheng, Desheng, it's here.

498
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,390
Cui Guodong!

499
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,000
Desheng, Desheng, it's still here.

500
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,670
Show it to me.

501
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,040
It's still here.

502
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,600
Where is it?

503
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,000
It's...

504
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,520
It's right here.

505
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:02,080
Captain Ma, you're the cleverest.

506
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,080
Director Zhu,

507
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,040
is this case solved?

508
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,320
Yes.

509
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,080
Yes, it is.

510
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,060
(Inpatient)

511
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,320
Aunt,

512
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,230
I'm here to see you.

513
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,320
It's me,

514
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,520
Shen Mo.

515
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,390
The doctor said,

516
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,120
I should turn you over.

517
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,800
You even have bedsores.

518
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,190
Last time in your home,

519
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,950
I left so hastily
that I didn't talk to you.

520
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,190
Let me cut your nails.

521
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,040
I've settled

522
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,080
Weijun's ashes.

523
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,870
In Songhe,

524
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:11,080
I bought him a tomb,
right beside my parents.

525
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,120
If your husband hadn't asked me
to come back in his letter,

526
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,910
I might not have this chance.

527
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,840
You don't even remember Weijun, huh?

528
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,430
Wanna say something?

529
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,120
But you never said anything, did you?

530
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,280
When Weijun begged you to keep him,
you didn't say anything.

531
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:14,040
When your husband put his hands into
my clothes, you didn't say anything.

532
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,360
When he took dirty photos of me,
you didn't say anything, either.

533
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:30,080
You thought
when you didn't say anything,

534
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,670
you would be nice, right?

535
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,360
Scared?

536
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,120
Back then, we were scared, too.

537
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,470
Just like you now,
we couldn't do anything.

538
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,600
How I wish you said something.

539
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,430
Later,

540
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,040
I was "dead".

541
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:48,910
You remember, huh?

542
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,230
It's actually good to be "dead".

543
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,000
Then I wouldn't be scared of anything.

544
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,700
(Nurse Station)

545
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,360
Doctor!

546
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:18,950
Somebody!

547
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:19,760
Nurse, hurry!

548
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,560
Somebody!

549
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,870
Director Li, after the suspect

550
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:59,560
walked out of the ward, in front of
the building, she got a taxi.

551
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,840
It's from Hualin No. 2 Taxi Company.

552
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,840
The driver is Wang Xiang.

553
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,760
He can't be reached now.

554
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,910
His phone is off.

555
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,390
See if you can contact
his family member.

556
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:14,980
(Exit Platform No. 2, No. 3, No. 4)

557
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,630
Are you Wang Bei?

558
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,120
Yes.

559
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,190
We're policemen.

560
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,390
Who is Wang Xiang to you?

561
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,600
Sir, you're going the wrong way.

562
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,950
You should have turned right
for the station.

563
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:37,760
No.

564
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,150
This is the right way.

565
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,150
It's been newly built.

566
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,120
Beside it were train tracks.

567
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,360
On those tracks,

568
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,800
I drove the train for 30 years.

569
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,150
Are you familiar with this place?

570
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,120
We're destined to meet.

571
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,670
For the first time,
we met on this Hualin Line.

572
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,600
After all these years,
here we met again.

573
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,520
You get the wrong person.

574
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,470
I wouldn't.

575
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,360
Since the first time I met you,

576
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,670
I've never dared to forget you.

577
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:39,150
Your appearance has been stuck in my brain.

578
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,840
I can never get rid of it.

579
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:49,320
Over my life, I can let go of everything
except for my son's death.

580
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,600
I still want to know what happened.

581
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,670
Surprisingly,

582
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:56,520
I'm given the chance now.

583
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,910
Something surprised me, too.

584
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:02,600
I didn't expect you to be Shen Mo.

585
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,800
Do you remember this place?

586
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,560
It used to be the Xiaoliang River.

587
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,080
Over the whole night,

588
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,800
Wang Yang was in the water.

589
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,600
It was nearly winter.

590
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:52,560
The water could be so cold.

591
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,360
I'm sorry.

592
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,950
Leave the apology to Wang Yang.

593
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,630
Now, I have only two questions.

594
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,910
Did Wang Yang kill anyone?

595
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:22,280
Wang Yang killed no one.

596
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:26,950
I killed Lu Wenzhong.

597
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,840
I killed Yin Hong, too.

598
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,040
Then why did you kill Wang Yang?

599
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,230
Wang Yang, you're everything I have now.

600
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:54,120
Didn't we agree to find a new place

601
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,470
for a new life?

602
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,470
Wang Yang, you're everything I have now.

603
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:04,320
Leave with me.

604
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,760
I get it.

605
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,040
Fine.

606
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,320
It's OK that you don't answer.

607
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,080
Do you see the bridge pier ahead of us?

608
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,710
I'm hitting it right away.

609
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,910
I've cut the safety belts back there.

610
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,800
You will be catapulted through the
windshield like a shell and into the river!

611
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:09,670
Wang Yang,

612
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,280
Dad is avenging you!

613
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,600
You're different from me.

614
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,150
You have your family.

615
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:31,800
Your parents.

616
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,630
But I have nothing.

617
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,430
This is just my fate.

618
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,230
I resign myself.

619
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:00,430
Go back home.

620
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:04,150
Go back home.

621
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,910
Your father is still on the tracks.

622
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,670
My father?

623
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:17,710
What's happening to my father?

624
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,950
Leave.

625
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,230
Don't leave.

626
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,150
I should have been dead that night.

627
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,950
He pushed me to the bank.

628
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,190
But I failed to catch him.

629
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:03,000
What do you mean?

630
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,910
He saved my life.

631
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,710
Time to pay him back.

632
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,710
What on earth do you mean?

633
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,800
He died, to save my life!

634
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:29,670
Shen Mo!

635
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,710
Shen Mo!

636
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:58,150
Get off the car.

637
00:50:59,150 --> 00:50:59,870
Get off.

638
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:01,230
Hurry.

639
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,080
Get off!

640
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,840
Get off!

641
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,670
Come out!

642
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,080
Come out!

643
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,190
It's on fire!

644
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,670
Come...

645
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,190
Come out!

646
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:07,390
Hurry!

647
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,800
Come...

648
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:39,870
Come out!

649
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,980
(The suspect Shen Mo confessed
her criminal facts to the police.)

650
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,020
(The serial murder cases were solved.)

651
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:58,320
(Dad!)

652
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:11,560
Dad.

653
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:22,120
Bei, you're back?

654
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:26,470
Dad, hang in there.

655
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:27,600
The ambulance is coming.

656
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:28,800
Don't be scared.

657
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,320
Don't be.

658
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,870
I wouldn't die.

659
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,840
I have you, my dear son.

660
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:51,280
Why is this autumn so long?

661
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,910
As if a lifetime had gone.

662
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,040
Dad, look.

663
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,000
It's snowing.

664
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,870
I saw the snow before.

665
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,150
It's from...

666
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,230
From the past.

667
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:37,420
(Workers' Congress
of Hualin No. 1 General Steel Works)

668
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:26,700
=Chapter 4=
=Don't look back in anger=

669
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:32,500
(2017)

670
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,430
Bei.

671
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,320
Bei.

672
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,870
Where's the down jacket
Mr. Ma bought you

673
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:39,670
during his competition
in the provincial capital?

674
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,760
In winter, it's also cold in Beijing.

675
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:46,360
I'm done packing.

676
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,320
It's in my suitcase.

677
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:49,080
Dad, come down.

678
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,230
What if your stent is out of service?

679
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,390
It's OK.

680
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I didn't know that.

681
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:54,670
But now, I understand.

682
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:57,470
The stent isn't that fragile.

683
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:03,000
Back then, your mother had four stents
and they were never broken.

684
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,520
Dad, don't have four.

685
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,910
One would be quite enough.

686
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:12,000
He's going to school,
but looks like he's moving out.

687
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,630
Such old clothes.

688
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:15,120
How did you get them out?

689
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:17,840
You can buy
whatever he needs there in Beijing.

690
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,670
You don't understand.

691
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:22,760
New clothes can't be a perfect fit.

692
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:24,520
Old clothes feel better.

693
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:28,040
It's Yang's book, huh?

694
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:29,630
Oh, yes.

695
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,000
What's it, Dad?

696
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:32,520
A collection of poems.

697
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,040
Your brother wrote the poems.

698
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:37,840
And I instructed him.

699
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,360
In this case, why don't you read some?

700
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,040
Interested?

701
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:44,360
OK.

702
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,390
Let me read.

703
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,670
The title of this poem is...

704
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:56,000
The Long.

705
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,910
The Long.

706
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,360
"Snap your fingers.

707
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:11,430
He said, let 'em ring together.

708
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,230
Those far away will be shattered.

709
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,670
These close to home still know nothing."

710
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,190
Jiang, Jiang.

711
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:37,390
Over there, pull up.

712
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:38,320
Why, Xiang?

713
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,390
I had too much water.

714
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,150
But we're arriving at the station.

715
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,870
I'm urgent.

716
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:44,710
Occupational problem.

717
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:45,670
OK.

718
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,190
No problem.

719
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:32,160
Speed up!

720
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,600
Mr. Wang, let it roar!

721
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,310
Here it goes!

722
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:22,080
Look ahead!

723
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:25,080
Don't look back!
