00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,680
Come on, drink.

6
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,760
Drink.

7
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,360
Come on. Cheers.

8
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,270
What are you doing, Mr. Lu?

9
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,360
You drank too little.

10
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,030
Show some mercy, OK?

11
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,720
Or I would really be drunk to death.

12
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,240
You spend money here
just to get hammered.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't waste money.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,360
Come on.

15
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,630
I'll drink for Mr. Lu.

16
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,440
Mr. Lu, your sweetheart
really cares about you.

17
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,390
Sweetheart?

18
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,600
A minute, please.

19
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,960
Just a minute, Miss Shen.

20
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,440
Come on, Miss Sweetheart.

21
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,320
Let's drink.

22
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,190
Now?

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,880
Yeah, I'm available.

24
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,880
OK.

25
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,270
OK.

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,880
I'll come alone.

27
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,830
OK.

28
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,320
Sure.

29
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,910
Wait for me.

30
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,470
Who called, Mr. Lu?

31
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,910
Do I have to tell you about this?

32
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,720
No.

33
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,910
Just asking.

34
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,880
What does this mean?

35
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,600
A little gift.

36
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,080
Miss Shen, get in the car.

37
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,110
I didn't expect you to call me.

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,070
I think I got it.

39
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,110
Yin Hong gave me a good chance.

40
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,270
You no longer need to live in the dorm.

41
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,600
I have a suite in Jinhao Hotel.

42
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,830
Live there anytime you want.

43
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,040
So, go there with me tonight,

44
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,440
OK?

45
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,160
Could you first drive me to my
friend's place to fetch some books?

46
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,790
I need them for tomorrow's classes.

47
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,000
OK.

48
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,060
(Cinema)

49
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,000
Your friend isn't home?

50
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,070
She's gone back home.

51
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,480
Sit for a while.

52
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,790
OK.

53
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,440
I'm familiar with this star.

54
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,720
We often have afternoon tea together.

55
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,350
You do?

56
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,670
If you have time, I can take you
to Hong Kong and introduce him to you.

57
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,830
Aren't you supposed to find your books?

58
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:39,920
Right.

59
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,550
I'll come down soon.

60
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,790
You take a seat.

61
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,950
OK.

62
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,230
May I use this toilet?

63
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,720
No.

64
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,270
It's out of service.

65
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,670
Use the one on the second floor.

66
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,070
OK.

67
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,780
Come this way.

68
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:08,300
(Toilet)

69
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,720
Have you found the books?

70
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,390
I don't remember where I put them.

71
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,600
I have to keep looking.

72
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,550
It's OK.

73
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,720
I can do it here, too.

74
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,920
What?

75
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,270
Getting shy?

76
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,510
We had this before, anyway.

77
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,440
Relax.

78
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,510
Miss Shen,

79
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,070
do you know the difference
between humans and animals?

80
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,350
There is no difference.

81
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,040
When someone takes off his clothes,
he becomes an animal, right?

82
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,910
I'm not an animal.

83
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm a human.

84
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,960
Not an animal.

85
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,030
Badger Game?

86
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,080
Fool me?

87
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,910
How dare you!

88
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,320
How dare you trick me!

89
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:17,910
Shen Mo!

90
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,760
Are you OK?

91
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,960
The anesthetic...

92
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,150
We can't let him leave.

93
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,440
Pick it up. Pick it up.

94
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,200
Come on, pick it up.

95
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,860
(Cinema)

96
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,960
Sorry.

97
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm really sorry.

98
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,000
If I have offended you,

99
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,960
I'll make an apology.

100
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,350
Do you think an apology
can make up for what you did?

101
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,150
This is totally a misunderstanding.

102
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,550
I have been respecting Miss Shen.

103
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,670
It's Yin Hong.

104
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,960
She's been lying to me.

105
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,590
She said you accepted this.

106
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,000
How about this?

107
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,590
You let me go.

108
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,840
In my car, there is
a bank draft of 800,000 yuan.

109
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,640
Take it as compensation.

110
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,520
Let's pretend nothing happened.

111
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,840
You have my word.

112
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:01,280
Today, right here, you write down
what you did when you stayed in Hualin.

113
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,440
What do you expect me to write about?

114
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,400
Stop pretending!

115
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,080
You must have done this before!

116
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,280
Every day in Hualin,

117
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,550
I meet a lot of people.

118
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:23,840
If I'm gone, a lot of them
will come for me.

119
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,520
Also, when I was answering your phone,
my driver was also there.

120
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,880
Let's do this.

121
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,880
You let me go.

122
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,520
I'll pretend this didn't happen.

123
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,320
Make a call.

124
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,030
Call your driver
and tell him you're fine.

125
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,440
Have you watched so many movies
that you've lost your mind?

126
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,590
Kidnapping will put you in prison,
you know?

127
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,910
Somebody! Help!

128
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,670
Call him!

129
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,840
I will. I will.

130
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,000
I will.

131
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,400
I will call him.

132
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,000
I will call him.

133
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,760
I will.

134
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,320
I just will.

135
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,440
I'll call him.

136
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
Hello, Luo.

137
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,030
I'm... I'm fine.

138
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,910
I'm just...

139
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,150
I'm in the toilet.

140
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,150
I'm fine. I'm OK.

141
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,400
Well, if I need anything,

142
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,960
I'll call you.

143
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,710
OK. Bye-bye.

144
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,200
What if he insists
that we kidnapped him?

145
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,710
Let's withdraw the money.

146
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,640
Then we leave this city.

147
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,200
I want to withdraw the money.

148
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,150
All of it.

149
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,460
(Bank Draft)

150
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,790
Sorry, but you can't get any money.

151
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,320
Why not?

152
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,230
Because it's a payment at a fixed date.

153
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,550
It says the 17th, doesn't it?

154
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,760
You can only get the money on this day.

155
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,640
Wait a moment, please.

156
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,350
That man wants to withdraw some money.

157
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,710
Do you know the difference
between humans and animals?

158
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:06,470
A human has to pay

159
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,560
for what he did.

160
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,260
(Toilet)

161
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,040
He lied to us.

162
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,950
I was nearly detained in the bank.

163
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,303
Darn it!

164
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,310
Get up!

165
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,710
Get up!

166
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,430
He's dead.

167
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,040
I killed him.

168
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,800
You two are not involved.

169
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,280
Why?

170
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,040
We could just withdraw the money
and then leave Hualin together.

171
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,430
Now, will you still leave with me?

172
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,880
Where can we go?

173
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:59,800
To a place where no one knows us
and we can start a new life.

174
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,830
Who's that?

175
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,470
What are you doing?

176
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,560
Wang Yang.

177
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,520
You have a fever.

178
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,310
I'll go get you some medicine.

179
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,710
We need to find a new place.

180
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
We can't live here anymore.

181
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,710
We'll hide for some days.

182
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,680
After we get the money,
we'll go see you.

183
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,470
You go back home and have a good sleep.

184
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,710
Pretend you just had a dream.

185
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,800
If only it was a real dream!

186
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,190
When I woke up, nothing
would have changed.

187
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,350
It wouldn't change.

188
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,830
Nothing would change.

189
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,380
(Cinema)

190
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,400
What are you doing here?

191
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,920
Still angry?

192
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,070
Seriously?

193
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,560
Your handkerchief and your
brother's shirt have been washed.

194
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,760
Put them there.

195
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,680
Where are you going?

196
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,590
Not anywhere.

197
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,350
You may leave. I've got some business.

198
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,040
What is it?

199
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,310
Going to Hong Kong with Mr. Lu?

200
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,830
Don't play dumb.

201
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,400
When you called and invited Mr. Lu,

202
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,470
I heard that.

203
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,190
What?

204
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,000
Changed your mind?

205
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,520
How much did he give you?

206
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,190
800,000 yuan.

207
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,430
Haven't seen so much money before, huh?

208
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,470
A college student is really impressive.

209
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,640
Lu Wenzhong gave you so much money.

210
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,680
Your boyfriend doesn't know it, does he?

211
00:27:59,230 --> 00:27:59,950
No.

212
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,640
It's indeed clever of you.

213
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,190
You take advantage of everything.

214
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,110
Now, he doesn't know this.

215
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,560
But who knows if he will never know?

216
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,110
Don't get me wrong.

217
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,880
I'm not threatening you.

218
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,040
You had this big fortune
and shouldn't you be grateful to me?

219
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,640
Take this.

220
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,110
You want to be me, don't you?

221
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,710
Take this and you'll be me.

222
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,520
I should be glad to have this.

223
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,470
Thanks.

224
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:36,127
How dare you...

225
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,400
(Yin Hong came?)

226
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
(Why did you kill her?)

227
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,710
Yin Hong is dead.

228
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,230
Now, she's me.

229
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,230
When "I" am dead,
I don't need to believe in fate.

230
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,920
Don't send for Wang Yang anymore.

231
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,070
He deserves a good life.

232
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,420
(International Entertainment Center)

233
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,360
Some wonton, please.

234
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,520
No more.

235
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,120
He has bought all the last wonton.

236
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,390
Thank you.
