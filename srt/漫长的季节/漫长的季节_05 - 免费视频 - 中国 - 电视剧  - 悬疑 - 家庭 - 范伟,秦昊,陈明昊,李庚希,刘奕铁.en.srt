(Hualin No. 1 General Steel Works)

3
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,590
Mr. Wang, day shift?

4
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,360
Nope. Extra shift.

5
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,440
Freight in or out?

6
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,510
Not sure.

7
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,910
I'm only a driver.

8
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,160
That's the boss's call.

9
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,000
What are you looking at?

10
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,470
Quanli knows.

11
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,960
Hey, watch it!

12
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,360
Can you drive or not?

13
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,390
I'll teach you!

14
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,110
Driving so fast in the factory.

Qiaoyun.

17
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,160
Mr. Wang.

18
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,750
Is there a problem?

19
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,360
No.

20
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,190
Are you working overtime?

21
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,080
Do you know
what's in that speeding truck?

22
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,520
Nothing. It's empty.

23
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,600
Got unloaded just now.

24
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,750
Are you sure?

25
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,910
Absolutely.

26
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,240
See you.

27
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,270
Nice meal.

28
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,480
My wife made it.

29
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,230
I don't feel well,
so she made something extra.

30
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,270
Look at that.

31
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,670
You got yourself a good wife.

32
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,670
It's OK to like others' food,
but not their wives.

33
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,110
Of course not.

34
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,510
Mr. Wang, should we go now?

35
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,880
No rush.

36
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,760
When did they load Quanli's truck?

37
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,920
Midnight as always.

38
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,830
It's documented.

39
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,670
And joined the fleet?

40
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,640
Yeah.

41
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,110
Wasn't the sheet signed?

42
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,550
Was there anything else in the truck?

43
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,390
No.

44
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,230
Whatever goes in our trucks
needs to be approved.

45
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,720
That's the rule, right?

46
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,270
Let me go check.

47
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,760
Mr. Wang, this is unnecessary.

48
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,200
Quanli already checked.

49
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,040
Mr. Wang, let's go. We're running late!

50
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,720
We've never missed the deadline!

51
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,790
Mr. Wang.

52
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,270
What's this?

53
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,320
Call Security.

54
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,070
Please, let it go.

55
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,000
Liu Quanli, you get a cut, too, right?

56
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:34,110
You aren't alone
by making your wife an accomplice, too.

57
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,320
Things are tough at home.

58
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,070
We all have a family to support,
but that doesn't mean you should steal.

59
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,390
Did your folks raise you to do so?

60
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,070
Bringing shame on our crew is one thing.

61
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,760
You're breaking the law, you know?

62
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,040
Mr. Wang, let it go.

63
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,760
We're all struggling.

64
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,200
So you're in this, too, aren't you?

65
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,600
Mr. Wang,
you should talk to Section Chief Xing.

66
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
That's all mine.

67
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,950
Section Chief Xing,

68
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,320
Jianchun, buddy, stealing is a crime.

69
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,510
Look at you lecturing me on the law.

70
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
It's not like that.

71
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,110
Those are old and crappy machines.

72
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,270
Nobody needs them anymore.

73
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,790
They were sitting there gathering dust
and taking up so much space.

74
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,270
Am I right?

75
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,600
Our factory is making less money.

76
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,110
Back in the day,

77
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,720
We'd need 40 wagons for one train,
but now, it's down to five or six.

78
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,440
So many of them are left there.

79
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,270
They're perfectly good,
but I can't take them, can I?

80
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,510
You're a model worker.

81
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,270
You've got a good name,
but will that put food on the table?

82
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,600
Still, you can't be a thief.

83
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:12,510
Wang Xiang, who are you calling a thief?

84
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,200
That's harsh.

85
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,720
Then what should I call you?

86
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,160
Let me put it this way.

87
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,880
I'm not doing this alone.

88
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,720
We've got people loading,
unloading, and covering it up.

89
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,640
Many people depend on this.

90
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,350
If you stop them,
you know what people can do for money.

91
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,710
They'll hate your guts
if you get in the way.

92
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,590
Besides, you are the only engine driver
we have, right?

93
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,350
I've prepared something for you.

94
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,960
Your work will be rewarded.

95
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,520
What's this?

96
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,520
A bribe?

97
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,520
Whatever you call it.

98
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,840
You can keep it or sell it if you want.

99
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,760
Don't get in the way of others
as well as your own.

100
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,670
Am I right?

101
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,670
Yeah?

102
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,110
We need to speed up, Mr. Wang.

103
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,110
Why is it slowing down?

104
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,840
Zhang, add some decent coal.

105
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,520
There's no slag, but big lumps.

106
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,880
The steam's not coming up.

107
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,960
Is the train breaking down?

108
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,670
What's wrong?

109
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,880
It's the throttle valve.

110
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,760
It needs more steam.

111
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,670
The commutator isn't working, either.

112
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,840
Can we keep going?

113
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,230
Of course not.

114
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,880
Call for help.

115
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,440
It needs a complete overhaul.

116
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,960
You can get changed.

117
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,320
I'm done.

118
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,840
What's going on?

119
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,790
You're getting in others' way.

120
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,880
Oh, that.

121
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,520
So you're moving

122
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,790
Xing Jianchun's staff, right?

123
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,960
This isn't my fault.

124
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,110
I won't talk to you.

125
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,350
I'll talk to Xing Jianchun.

126
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,400
What now?

127
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,230
Are you picking a fight?

128
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,590
Don't break the law.

129
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,760
Money is the law.

130
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,670
You don't work here, do you?

131
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:03,000
Believe it or not, if I call for help,
a dozen people will charge in.

132
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,150
If you lay a finger on me,

133
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,790
I'll break all ten of yours!

134
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,590
Let's do it!

135
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,470
Cheng,

136
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,200
Lei,

137
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Shunzi!

138
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,110
Yes, Mr. Wang?

139
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,910
What's up?

140
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,590
Piss off!

141
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,110
I need some shampoo.

142
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,880
Section Chief Xing.

143
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Are you watching them play?

144
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,910
Do you wanna play?

145
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,590
I can't.

146
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,150
Section Chief Xing, wait, hold on!

147
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,760
What's up?

148
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,320
I need to tell you something.

149
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,640
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

150
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,880
I had told them more than once

151
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,350
that the train needed an overhaul,
but management refused to pay for it.

152
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,000
And you see, it broke down today.

153
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,790
Someone on the Maintenance Team
reported it and they found your stuff.

154
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,400
I apologize for your loss.

155
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,640
What do you mean my loss?

156
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,880
That stuff isn't mine.

157
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,640
Yes, of course.

158
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,320
It... it slipped out.

159
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,880
What's this?

160
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,080
I'm a decent man.

161
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,550
I don't deserve that.

162
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,150
Thanks.

163
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,150
Decent, huh?

164
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,000
Besides, Jianchun,
here's something else.

165
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,550
Recently, some street punks keep
coming here and making trouble.

166
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,790
Actually, I'm worried about them.

167
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,470
You know why?

168
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,520
Because if they run into those kids
in Locomotive,

169
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,520
who are operating machines
and weighing dozens of tons

170
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,760
all day, and get beaten up,
things will become ugly.

171
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,000
And if someone gets hurt,
that will be terrible.

172
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,590
Noted.

173
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll see you around.

174
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,440
Sure.

175
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,760
Thanks.

176
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,710
Take care!

177
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,350
What a punk!

178
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:43,110
You know how
you can tell a person's value?

179
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,200
By the bribe others offered him.

180
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,110
I got two cartons of cigarettes,
the hard pack ones.

181
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,150
One carton is worth at least 50 yuan,
but I didn't even glance at them.

182
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,320
"Take them back", I said.

183
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,470
So you returned them?

184
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,550
That's the simplest way.

185
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,400
You gotta be nice, protect the briber's
feelings, and he can't blame you.

186
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,280
You know what that is?

187
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,150
As the poem goes,

188
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,670
"Silence is safer than sounds."

189
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,550
But by doing so,
you've made Xing Jianchun an enemy.

190
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,400
That guy, he's petty and vindictive.

191
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,670
I'm not afraid of him.

192
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,150
I was lenient enough
by not reporting him to Song Yukun.

193
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,790
In terms of background,
he's not my match.

194
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,000
He was recruited,
while I inherited my old man's post.

195
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,640
And speaking of my dad,
he dug the first shovel of dirt

196
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,000
when the factory was founded.

197
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,400
I grew up with it.

198
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,910
Think of me as old money.

199
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,440
I'm prominent.

200
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,960
He's nowhere near my level.

201
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,080
Hey, you...

202
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,790
Turn around

203
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,150
Your toenails got on my sweater.

204
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,880
Really?

205
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,000
No, they didn't.

206
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,790
They did!

207
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,080
- They went that far?
- Turn around.

208
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,110
Who are you knitting it for?

209
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,710
I don't wear yellow ones.

210
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,670
And I've got enough in the closet.

211
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,280
It's not for you.

212
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,080
Guiying from my team
now owns a tailor shop.

213
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
It's getting cold.

214
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,760
I offered to knit sweaters.

215
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,960
How much does she pay you for that one?

216
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,960
40 yuan?

217
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,840
30 yuan?

218
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,230
That's better than nothing.

219
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,960
And I don't have anything else to do.

220
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,200
What if you develop
an eye or wrist problem?

221
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,590
Your pay won't cover medical bills.

222
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,230
Hey, can I run something by you?

223
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,670
What is it?

224
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,880
Can you pull some strings
and get Yang a job in our factory?

225
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,150
No way.

226
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,230
He needs to study and go to college.

227
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,960
But look at him.

228
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,760
Is he interested in that at all?

229
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,670
He's out every day.

230
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,590
What if he picks up bad habits?

231
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,310
Maybe you should talk to him
and see what's on his mind.

232
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,190
What he thinks doesn't matter.

233
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,190
If he wants things to fall in his lap,
will that work?

234
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:15,880
I know.

235
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
That's why

236
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,760
I want you, you know, to talk to him,

237
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,310
OK?

238
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,680
Wang Yang, come here.

239
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,000
Wang Yang!

240
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,110
Hey, what's he doing
in his room all day?

241
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,760
I don't know.

242
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,590
He didn't even touch
the Crispy Sweet and Sour Pork I made.

243
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,230
Talk to him nicely. Don't be mad.

244
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,520
What are you writing?

245
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,880
Nothing.

246
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,640
There's something.

247
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,160
Let me see.

248
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,110
Come on.

249
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,350
Is that an essay?

250
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,040
No.

251
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
I'm writing a poem.

252
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,680
A poem?

253
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,070
"Snap your fingers.

254
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,230
He said, let 'em ring together..."

255
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,920
Listen, son, poetry
should be written in rhyme.

256
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,680
Your first line is

257
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,430
"Snap your fingers."

258
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,310
So the second line should be

259
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,430
"Let the sound linger.

260
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,430
Linger, linger, linger."

261
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,830
Sit down.

262
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,920
I said sit down!

263
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,800
What do you want?

264
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,590
Just say it.

265
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,590
Watch your attitude.

266
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,950
I'm trying to be nice.

267
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:51,560
I didn't say anything when you had exams
earlier, but you didn't do anything.

268
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,110
So starting tomorrow, you'll join
an extra class or a regular class at school

269
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,950
and resume your study.

270
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,350
Let me save you some time, Dad.

271
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,920
I'm not going back to school.

272
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,400
Why?

273
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,800
So that you can be a street punk?

274
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,160
Studying isn't my thing.

275
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
What is your thing?

276
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,190
Tell me.

277
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,280
Don't push me.

278
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,400
I'm not going.

279
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,470
I thought you'd be nice.

280
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,880
Why are you arguing again?

281
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,590
I'm teaching my son.

282
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,710
Get out.

283
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,070
Hey, this can wait.

284
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,520
Go to the kitchen.

285
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,350
I smelled something when the fan was on.

286
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,830
Don't get anyone electrocuted.

287
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,920
You're spoiling him, you know that?

288
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,640
Son, be honest with me.

289
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,920
Are you sure about quitting school?

290
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,680
100 percent sure, Mom!

291
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,760
I wouldn't get into college anyway.

292
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,160
Well, that's fine.

293
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,470
Here's what I think.

294
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,880
You can work at your dad's factory.

295
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:22,000
So, go to work, or go back to school.

296
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,160
Pick one.

297
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,560
Fix it tomorrow.

298
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,070
I can handle a train,
not to mention a small fan.

299
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,430
What did he say?

300
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,560
He'd rather work.

301
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,590
Good-for-nothing!

302
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,880
Who did he take that from?

303
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,920
So what if he could get into college?

304
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,230
After graduation,
he'd still come back and work here.

305
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,430
He'd be working
in Factory Affairs Office.

306
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,350
That's different.

307
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,920
I'm going out, Mom.

308
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,430
It's late. Where's he going?

309
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,070
He's giving up.

310
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,430
Just be glad that he's agreed to work.

311
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,280
It's better than hanging out all day.

312
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,400
What if he gets into trouble?

313
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,640
That's all your fault.

314
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,430
Get out.

315
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,430
You're distracting me.

316
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,760
Hey, get him in fast.

317
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,160
Got it.

318
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,470
Stop nagging me.

319
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,160
Go back.

320
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,710
Here's something to eat.

321
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,110
I'm going upstairs.

322
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,110
See you after your shift.

323
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,640
What are you doing?

324
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,160
Nothing.

325
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,590
My mom made Crispy Sweet and Sour Pork.

326
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,640
Really?

327
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,920
You know, traditional Crispy Sweet
and Sour Pork is sophisticated.

328
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,400
The temperature of the oil
must be perfect.

329
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,000
And it must be tenderloin.

330
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,950
Mix the slices with water starch
and massage them

331
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,310
to remove the water inside
for a tender texture.

332
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,310
Did you give your meat a massage?

333
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,000
Would you like to taste it?

334
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,590
Let me see if you got the right flavor.

335
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,190
Looking good.

336
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,710
Did you use white vinegar?

337
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
It should be synthetic vinegar,
you know.

338
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,950
Is it a bit salty?

339
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,400
Let me get you some water.

340
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,950
Wait.

341
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,160
Something is missing.

342
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,110
You left something out
when marinating the meat.

343
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,920
I don't think so.

344
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,070
I like it.

345
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,880
I'm going to work.

346
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:51,680
Go ahead.

347
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,680
Sugar, ginger...

348
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,190
Something is missing.

349
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,950
Thank you, sir.

350
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,870
Get out.

351
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,400
Have a good one!

352
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,470
Wang Yang.

353
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,350
It looked better
before Mr. Ge grabbed two pieces.

354
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,160
He ruined it.

355
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,590
It's fine.

356
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,880
I'm hungry.

357
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,350
Is it too cold?

358
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,430
What do you think?

359
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,590
Not at all. It tastes good.

360
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,110
OK.

361
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,950
Bring back the rest.

362
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,110
It's late.

363
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,160
The school canteen must've closed.

364
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,640
You've played the piano all night.

365
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,560
You could use some snacks.

366
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,110
It'll be too cold to eat then.

367
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,110
Let's finish it now.

368
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,190
There's too much.

369
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,710
Sure.

370
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,430
Thanks.

371
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,680
No need.

372
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,040
I can bring you more tomorrow.

373
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,040
Other than the food,

374
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,560
I'd like to thank you
for holding the umbrella that day.

375
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,190
Don't mention it.

376
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,830
You did 30 more minutes of parade step
because of me.

377
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
Time for the firework show.

378
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,590
Are there fireworks?

379
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,950
Yes, come here.

380
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,470
Every day at 9:45 p.m.,
more punctual than CCTV News.

381
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,710
Not a minute of delay.

382
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,560
Just wait.

383
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,520
Squint and look.

384
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,310
Just like fireworks, yeah?

385
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,000
Why is that flame so colorful?

386
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,190
That's a ground flare
to process waste gas.

387
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,280
If there's carbon monoxide,
it'll turn blue.

388
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,760
If it's the cupric ion, it'll be green.

389
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,680
You know a lot more than I thought.

390
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,230
Of course.

391
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,590
I grew up in a steel factory.

392
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,680
Hey, I can take you
to see locomotives someday.

393
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,880
My dad drives them.

394
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,800
That place is off-limits.

395
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,430
Sure.

396
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,680
Will do someday.

397
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,000
I have to get back
before my dorm is locked.

398
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,710
Someday can be any day.

399
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,590
Are you free tomorrow?

400
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
It's the weekend, so yes.

401
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
Then how about tomorrow?

402
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,950
Bring back the pork.

403
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,800
I've got more at home.

404
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,760
Thanks.

405
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,520
See you tomorrow!

406
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,640
I'm going out, Mom.

407
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,040
Already?

408
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,590
You're leaving earlier and earlier.

409
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,280
I'm bored at home.

410
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,950
Drop that and get some rest.

411
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,710
Will that pay for my pills?

412
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,190
Let me help you.

413
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,350
What's that smell?

414
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,110
Is the stove on?

415
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,880
Impossible.

416
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,680
I don't smell it.

417
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,710
Did you use my mousse?

418
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,400
Yes, a little bit.

419
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,470
Don't fool around all day.

420
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,400
Listen to your dad.

421
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,040
Stay at home and wait
for your job offer.

422
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,470
Don't ruin it.

423
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,880
I'm not fooling around.

424
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,520
My friend hooked me up with a gig.

425
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,430
It's legit.

426
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,680
How legit that you have to go there
after midnight every day?

427
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,590
I don't believe it.

428
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,400
Don't worry.

429
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,710
Once I get my pay,
your medical bills won't be a problem.

430
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,830
Just relax.

431
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,160
You'll be fine.

432
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,950
I'm glad to hear that.

433
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,590
Alright, just go.

434
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,640
I'll do it myself.

435
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,430
I'm off, Mom

436
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,880
Be careful.

437
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,070
Lie down and rest.

438
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,070
I'll finish it when I get back.

439
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,040
OK. Fine.

440
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,560
Go ahead.

441
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,070
See you.

442
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,830
See you later.

443
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,640
Does your dad drive a train alone?

444
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,350
There's a team.

445
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,590
My dad is the chief driver.

446
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,000
How nice that he can travel around!

447
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,310
It's not even close to what you think.

448
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,560
What do you want to be?

449
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,590
A doctor, I guess.

450
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,470
Didn't you learn the piano
to be a musician?

451
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:15,280
Liking something doesn't mean
you can own it.

452
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,350
I don't get it.

453
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,000
Aren't we supposed to do what we like?

454
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,430
In that case, do you like to be a waiter?

455
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,520
I won't be that forever.

456
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,470
It's temporary.

457
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,920
Besides, I chose that job
mostly because of you.

458
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,470
Come on.

459
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,070
Can you be serious for once?

460
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,430
I am now.

461
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,280
My dad wants me to work in his factory,
but I don't want to go.

462
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,710
Isn't that good?

463
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:58,400
This railway you're seeing is
the Hualin Line.

464
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,680
It crosses the Xiaoliang River Bridge

465
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,190
and extends 30 km further
to the farthest station here.

466
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,710
You can get off and transfer there
to Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.

467
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,680
But my dad has never got off his train.

468
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,950
That's the end of his world,
but I don't want to live like him

469
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,680
for the rest of my life.

470
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,470
Then what do you want to do?

471
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,350
Promise me that you won't laugh.

472
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,590
Sure, I won't.

473
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
I want to be a poet.

474
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,070
See?

475
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,190
You don't believe me when I mean it.

476
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,350
Do you mind telling me about your poem?

477
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,070
Are you interested?

478
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,160
I've never read it to anyone.

479
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,230
No peeking.

480
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,040
I'll read it.

481
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,040
"Snap your fingers.

482
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,040
He said, let 'em ring together.

483
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Those far away will be shattered.

484
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,520
These close to home still know nothing.

485
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,190
Give a loud whistle.

486
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:57,560
I said, whistle like a bird,
a piece of iron, and a sharp needle.

487
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,000
The magnetic arc
caresses the green glass.

488
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,310
Have a glass of water.

489
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,830
Take a look at the river.

490
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,080
Calm at the calmest.

491
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,560
Otherwise, we'll skip a step.

492
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:22,840
A tiny drop of tear falls on a rock,
lingering before it dries..."

493
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,430
I'm working on the last four lines.

494
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,230
Come on. Let it out.

495
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,390
Laugh all you want.

496
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,760
I don't mean to.

497
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,910
Actually, that's quite good.

498
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
Is there a name?

499
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,760
Still working on that, too.

500
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,080
Now, I'm convinced that you're a poet.

501
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,560
Alright, let's go.

502
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,870
Or it'll be too dark to see the train.

503
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,670
Hey, Mo!

504
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,760
Are you settling in OK?

505
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,560
Yeah, it's fine.

506
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,230
My rheumatism is acting up again.

507
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,280
I can't even sleep.

508
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,360
The local hospitals aren't
as good as those in Hualin.

509
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,080
Hualin College No. 2 Hospital
and Hualin College Hospital

510
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,520
are famous for treating rheumatism.

511
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,600
Doctors back home
can't do much about it.

512
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,870
Your aunt is in great pain.

513
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,910
Yeah, you can see the doctors here.

514
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,150
It's cold.

515
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,040
Your uncle and I have talked about it.

516
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,080
We can rent an apartment
near the hospital

517
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:57,150
and stay for a while
and we can keep you company.

518
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,150
How convenient!

519
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,190
Eat up.

520
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:37,280
Mo, this room costs
at least 30 yuan per day, yeah?

521
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,000
Don't worry.

522
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,840
I get paid by working at night.

523
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,560
She wants us to be comfortable.

524
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,320
I see.

525
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,760
Thanks.

526
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,080
Your parents left when you were little.

527
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,280
Without your uncle...

528
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,560
Without my uncle,

529
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,150
I would've ended up in an orphanage.

530
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,470
I know that.

531
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,360
Why did you bring that up?

532
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,150
Just making small talk.

533
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,710
Your uncle loves you a lot.

534
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,230
Few kids are able
to learn the piano, right?

535
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,190
That's enough.

536
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,630
Go to the front desk and get some tea.

537
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,950
I'll go.

538
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,430
Your aunt will do it.

539
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,320
I'll go.

540
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,670
Stay and talk with your uncle.

541
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,190
Are you unhappy about us coming?

542
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:40,950
No.

543
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,430
Sit.

544
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,670
Kiddo, we're a family.

545
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,120
You know what that means?

546
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,390
A family stays together
forever and ever.

547
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,120
When did you cut your finger?

548
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:24,950
You're careless.

549
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,840
Look at them.

550
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,230
Your nails are too long
to play the piano.

551
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,150
You're still a kid.

552
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,390
You need adults to look after you.

553
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,870
I still remember that song you played.

554
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,800
What is it again?

555
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:51,800
♪Twinkle, twinkle, little star♪

556
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:57,000
♪How I wonder what you are♪

557
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,120
I need to go to work.

558
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,560
Uncle,

559
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,520
I gotta go.

560
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:16,390
Go ahead.

561
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,190
What?

562
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,190
Someone's knocking at the door.

563
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,320
You're having a dream.

564
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,280
Who'd come in the middle of the night?

565
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,390
It's true. Listen.

566
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,560
Is it Wang Yang banging in his room?

567
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,120
It's 1 a.m.

568
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,950
What's he doing?

569
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,910
That punk!

570
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,870
Is it Wang Yang?

571
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,430
That kid's gotta learn it the hard way.

572
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,470
He still hasn't come back at this hour.

573
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,520
Who is it?

574
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:05,560
Who is it?

575
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,320
Don't try to spook me.

576
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,230
Come out!

577
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:43,670
It's Xing Jianchun!

578
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,320
I'll kill you!

579
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,670
What did you do?

580
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,760
What took you so long?

581
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,390
I took a shower.

582
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:02,630
What?

583
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,840
At this hour?

584
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,320
I like it.

585
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,190
Is there a problem?

586
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,360
I can shower at home whenever I want.

587
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,870
What if you catch a cold?

588
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:15,040
Go back to sleep.

589
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,120
Enough is enough.

590
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,150
So annoying!

591
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:59,230
Do you know what Wang Yang is doing
when he's not home at night?

592
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,280
I think he got a gig from a friend.

593
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:08,280
A gig?

594
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:10,630
Like what?

595
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,710
A gig is a gig.

596
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,360
Did he tell you what it is?

597
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,840
I'm asking you.

598
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:50,800
Move up the soldier.

599
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:55,470
Are you busy?

600
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,520
Move up the soldier, not the horse!

601
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,040
That's evil.

602
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:06,190
It's OK.

603
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,800
Hey, play... the cannon and you'll win.

604
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,600
Talk about evil!

605
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,710
Hey, let's play.

606
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,760
Let them finish.

607
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:23,190
Sure.

608
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,800
That move is good, right?

609
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:28,320
Yes.

610
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,560
Thanks, Weijun.

611
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:46,900
(Hongyan Restaurant)

612
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,230
Who owns that bike outside?

613
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,430
Wait.

614
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:37,040
Hold on.

615
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:41,840
Where do you live?

616
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,190
Hualin Steel?

617
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,320
Answer my question!

618
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,910
Are you mute?

619
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,080
He stole it!

620
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,630
How dare you steal it?

621
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,000
That punk is getting away!

622
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:16,950
You stole my babe!

623
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,080
Watch out, Feng!

624
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:03,470
(How much is your bike?)

625
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:09,840
He's asking you how much it is.

626
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:13,320
You can keep it.

627
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:19,950
You can keep it!

628
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:36,560
Who are you?

629
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,840
His name... is Fu Weijun.

630
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:50,710
Got it?

631
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,560
Yes. Of course.

632
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:37,230
Shen Mo!

633
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,630
Let's go watch a movie tomorrow.

634
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,800
It's a new hit,

635
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,600
Titanic!

636
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,630
My family needs me.

637
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,630
I can't go.

638
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,800
Oh, come on!

639
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,280
Do you know how hot the tickets are?

640
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,710
I waited for two hours to get them.

641
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,230
What's wrong?

642
00:50:59,230 --> 00:50:59,950
I can help you.

643
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,150
I'll try to make it.

644
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:06,800
Don't try...

645
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,600
Drinks for Box 5!

646
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,760
Don't try. You have to come.

647
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,000
I'll wait for you.

648
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,600
I will.

649
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:14,230
See you there.

650
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,120
Nobody answered.

651
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,000
Let me go check.

652
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,080
Sure.

653
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,150
Excuse me.

654
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,870
Is Shen Mo in your room?

655
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:41,910
No.

656
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:42,870
She hasn't come back.

657
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:45,760
You can leave everything here.

658
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,000
I'll give it to her.

659
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,840
No, thanks.

660
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,520
I'll give it to her myself.

661
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,000
OK.

662
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,800
Thanks.

663
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,630
You're welcome.

664
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:56,670
Thanks again.

665
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,300
(Girls' Dormitory)

666
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:02,910
Excuse me.

667
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,800
Wait!

668
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,520
Hold on!

669
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:10,520
So, are you and Shen Mo roommates?

670
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,120
Yes.

671
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,910
No wonder I find you familiar.

672
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:14,360
And you are...?

673
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,630
I'm Shen Mo's parent.

674
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,520
Nice to meet you.

675
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,040
Nice to meet you, too.

676
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,430
Shen Mo goes on and on about how close

677
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:25,120
you kids are and how much
you've helped her and looked after her.

678
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,760
I'll have her invite you kids
to our place for dinner someday.

679
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,560
I'll cook for you.

680
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,520
We're all far away from home.

681
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,630
We should have each other's backs.

682
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:34,600
It's nothing.

683
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,430
No need to thank me.

684
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,120
Look how sweet you are.

685
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,760
So, does Shen Mo
always come back so late?

686
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,150
Our dorm closes at 11
and she always gets back an hour before.

687
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,280
It's about time.

688
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:56,800
You kids love hanging out.

689
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,910
I understand that.

690
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:00,320
And I keep telling her
to go out and make friends.

691
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:09,430
Does she have friends out of campus
or maybe a boyfriend?

692
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:12,120
That I really don't know.

693
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,840
We don't talk about it.

694
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:16,670
I see.

695
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,630
If there's nothing else,

696
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:22,040
I need to get some hot water
before the place closes.

697
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:22,760
Sure, sure.

698
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,390
Go ahead!

699
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:24,800
Good night, sir.

700
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,760
Do come and visit us!

701
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,600
Will do!

702
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,520
Here come your birthday noodles.

703
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,600
May you live long and prosper.

704
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,190
(Happy Birthday.)

705
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,870
Where did you get the money?

706
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,760
(I earned it.)

707
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,710
I don't need a pager.

708
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:45,670
It's expensive.

709
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:47,150
Return it.

710
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,390
Why... why?

711
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:52,150
Once our cinema opens,

712
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:59,630
I'll be a boss, and so is Weijun,
and you, too.

713
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,190
A boss needs a pager.

714
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:02,360
OK?

715
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,390
Or you'd look cheap.

716
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,950
(I've got the same model myself.)

717
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:13,190
(I'll be able to find you,
and you'll be able to find me.)

718
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,950
You'll be able to find me,
and I'll be able to find you.

719
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:32,280
May we all live long and prosper.

720
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:43,840
Uncle.

721
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,280
I'm sorry, Uncle.

722
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,600
I had two classes for my major
this morning and I couldn't skip them.

723
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,360
Was yesterday your birthday?

724
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,800
I don't remember.

725
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,760
But I do.

726
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:14,950
I picked up something for you to wear.

727
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:16,600
It's in the bag. Take a look.

728
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,760
Thank you.

729
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:26,280
Try it on.

730
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,760
I will when I get back.

731
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,150
If Aunt is OK,

732
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,320
I'll go back to school.

733
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,230
What's the rush?

734
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,430
Put it on now.

735
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,320
There are no strangers.

736
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,760
I'll change it if it doesn't fit.

737
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,430
I'll get changed in the bathroom.

738
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,080
Is it on?

739
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,800
Yes.

740
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,320
Does it fit?

741
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,320
It does.

742
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,000
Open the door.

743
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,800
Let me see.

744
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,360
It does look good.

745
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,560
Can I go back?

746
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:21,000
I still have classes this afternoon.

747
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,950
Look at that lace.

748
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:42,430
I love those flowers.

749
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:48,280
So pretty, just like a few years back.

750
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,120
You're still a doll.

751
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,760
If only you were docile as before, too.

752
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:03,910
Stop working at night.

753
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,870
You're too young
to handle such a dangerous world.

754
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:19,430
If you do something wrong
or make bad friends,

755
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,520
all my effort into raising you
will be in vain.

756
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:24,710
Understand?

757
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,520
You hear me?

758
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,360
Yes.

759
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,230
Go ahead.

760
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:42,520
Thank you, Uncle.

761
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,120
15...

762
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,000
What's that?

763
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,870
Look, ever since I came to work,

764
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,280
I've never taken time off.

765
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,840
All I need is half a day.

766
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,600
If I let you go, what about the others?

767
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,630
If I got 20 more waiters asking
for a leave, what about my business?

768
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,760
Use this.

769
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:43,000
Three hours, that's it.

770
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,910
I'll be back by 11 p.m.

771
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:46,840
Clients won't come until then anyway.

772
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,670
I promise it won't affect my work.

773
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:50,840
Rules are rules.

774
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,710
I can't bend them for you, right?

775
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:02,190
Qu Bo is my buddy,
so that makes us brothers, too.

776
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:03,840
When I get paid,

777
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,710
I'll treat you to barbecue.

778
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:07,320
I'll make an exception for you.

779
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:10,390
Do come back before 11.

780
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:10,870
If anyone asks,

781
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:11,800
I didn't see you.

782
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,080
Thank you!

783
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,120
Thank you very much!

784
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:14,360
Enough!

785
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:14,950
Let go!

786
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:16,150
Don't mess with my accounts.

787
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:16,630
Just go.

788
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:17,760
See you later.

789
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,280
(Manager's Office)
Bye.

790
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,560
Where was I?

791
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,120
Got you!

792
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:35,560
Dad.

793
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,000
What are you doing here?

794
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,430
Are you asking me?

795
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,190
I should ask you that.

796
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,230
No wonder you aren't home at night

797
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,950
because you're with the wrong people
at the wrong place.

798
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,470
I'm not!

799
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:53,600
Stop lying!

800
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,520
If not, what are you wearing?

801
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,040
You look like a joke!

802
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:03,710
Are you a clown, a busker?

803
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,080
You've grown up.

804
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,320
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

805
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:07,710
Take it off!

806
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,470
Take it off!

807
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:10,190
I said take it off!

808
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:11,150
I won't!

809
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:12,470
I've got a job.

810
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:13,120
I'm making money.

811
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,230
How is that shameful?

812
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,520
Do you call this a job?

813
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,230
Did we raise you to fawn on others,

814
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:22,040
lick their boots,
and serve them whatever they need?

815
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:22,950
Is that a decent job?

816
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:32,630
Your mom and I are racking our brains
to get you into the factory and find you

817
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:34,320
a good job.

818
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:38,120
Yet what you're doing is
a slap in our face!

819
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,320
And not just our face,
the factory's, too!

820
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,390
You ruined its reputation!

821
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:46,630
Do I have to ruin it,
or does it still have a reputation?

822
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,800
Other than you,
who still talks about that factory?

823
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:52,120
The good days are over, Dad!

824
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,430
It's time to wake up!

825
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:54,520
I...

826
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,710
You're so naive!

827
01:02:58,950 --> 01:02:59,800
Me?

828
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,870
I think I know better than you, Dad.

829
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:04,360
You're the naive one.

830
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,150
Enough!

831
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:06,800
We're going home!

832
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,520
Come on.

833
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,000
I won't.

834
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,870
I'm needed elsewhere.

835
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:10,870
Go home!

836
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,800
I said go home!

837
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,800
You aren't going anywhere else.

838
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:36,650
(I'm Jack Dawson.)

839
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,210
(Rose Dewitt Bukater.)

840
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:42,540
(I'll have to get you
to write that one down.)

841
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,180
(Come on! I got you!)

842
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:51,840
(Come on!)

843
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:58,240
(Help, please!)

844
01:03:58,370 --> 01:03:59,780
(Help!)

845
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,420
(Please help me!)

846
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:03,560
(Listen, listen to me!)

847
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,960
(I've got you! I won't let go!)

848
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,650
(Now pull yourself up!)

849
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:08,510
(Come on!)

850
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:15,060
