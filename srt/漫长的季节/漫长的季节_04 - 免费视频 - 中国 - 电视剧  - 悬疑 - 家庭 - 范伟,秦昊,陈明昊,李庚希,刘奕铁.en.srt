00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,340
=The Long Season 4=

2
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,080
It's here.

3
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,870
Which room is he in?

4
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,240
He doesn't say anything.

5
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,390
He sleeps the whole day
and can't be woken up.

6
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,110
How long has he been like this?

7
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,470
Since the dead body was found
at Sun Guilan's home,

8
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,390
he's been acting this weirdly.

9
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,110
I saw it.

10
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,190
Saw what?

11
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,030
Long hair.

12
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,830
A woman.

13
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,960
Woman?

14
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,800
This is all I can tell you.

15
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,190
More information would be
a violation of discipline.

16
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,910
Got it.

17
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,030
I'll keep it to myself.

18
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,750
Have some water.

19
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,750
Captain Ma, you told me that thing
and I thought about it for nights.

20
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,270
What have you got, then?

21
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,750
As for when the murderer dumped the body,

22
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,000
I've got two deductions.

23
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,270
First, on a dark night,

24
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,190
he dumped it silently.

25
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,240
Second, when people were bustling about,
and no one was noticing, he dumped it.

26
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,520
Go on.

27
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,240
OK.

28
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,830
The dustbin of our living quarter is
so tall and big.

29
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,800
It's always messy with rubbish.

30
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,390
I reported many times
that the bin should be cleaned in time.

31
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,080
Have one more dustcart if necessary.

32
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,880
Get to the point.

33
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,360
OK.

34
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,800
If he dumped something in the night,
it would be hard.

35
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
The bin was full,
so he had to get out half of the rubbish

36
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,800
before dumping something in.

37
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,080
What if I dump something now?

38
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,270
That would be easy.

39
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,470
The bin isn't full.

40
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,190
You can dump it directly.

41
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,960
After workers have lunch
and throw the rubbish, it'll be covered.

42
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,910
You figured this out by yourself?

43
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,440
You must have read many detective fictions.

44
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,830
Yes.

45
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,470
Since little, I've been reading
The Great Detective,

46
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,040
and I read Sherlock Holmes, too.

47
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,510
Sometimes, when I think of a case,

48
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,720
I regard myself as Sherlock Holmes.

49
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,830
Then I'm Watson, huh?

50
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,040
No.

51
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,830
Between us, you're Sherlock Holmes
and I'm Watson.

52
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,230
But Captain Ma, every good Sherlock Holmes

53
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,440
has his Watson.

54
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,510
Captain Ma,

55
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,760
I have something to discuss with you.

56
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,600
You've been expecting to say that, huh?

57
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,440
Think twice before you tell me.

58
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,510
I just wonder
if I can join the special task force.

59
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,000
You?

60
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,320
Join the special task force?

61
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,830
Yes.

62
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,670
Oh, wait.

63
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,270
I...

64
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,000
I just...

65
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,600
Umm...

66
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,600
I don't want anything.

67
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,880
Authorized job, welfare,
or the bonus thing.

68
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,230
I just...

69
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,600
So, you brought my coat to me?

70
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,160
You know what?

71
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
I like this coat.

72
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,040
Yeah, yeah.

73
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,070
I mean, after you solve this murder case,
please mention me

74
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,920
in your final report.

75
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,110
For example,
the engine driver of Hualin Steel,

76
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,440
Mr. Wang Xiang, has offered help
in solving this case.

77
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,670
Offered some help.

78
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,830
Just write like this.

79
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,200
You even thought about what to write.

80
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,000
Quite a mature idea!

81
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,160
You decide what to write.

82
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,880
Just mention my name.

83
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,320
What do you need that for?

84
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,480
Then I wouldn't be laid off.

85
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,000
Aren't you a model worker?

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,230
Why would you be laid off?

87
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,640
That title is useless.

88
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,510
Captain Ma, you know.

89
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,320
I'm very familiar with Hualin Steel.

90
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,040
I can help, anyway.

91
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,950
If the case is solved, please mention
my name and this might change my fate.

92
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,670
Look,

93
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,720
I'm a middle-aged man.

94
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,350
I can do nothing, but drive the engine.

95
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,110
And I used to be a model worker.

96
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,070
Being laid off would disgrace me.

97
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,110
Mr. Wang,

98
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,720
I really understand how you feel.

99
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,480
But are you a police officer?

100
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,320
No.

101
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,230
In this case,
how can you join the special task force?

102
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,200
You can't.

103
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,200
But of course,
if you make some special contributions,

104
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,040
maybe I can mention your name
in our final report.

105
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,920
Yeah, that's what I want.

106
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,720
To be mentioned.

107
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,070
Getting excited, huh?

108
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,230
- Yes.
- Just maybe.

109
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,720
Yes, yes.

110
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,510
That's just what I want.

111
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,880
Captain Ma.

112
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,720
You've got work, Captain Ma?

113
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,760
What about my...?

114
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,640
Leave now. I'll talk to you later.

115
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,950
I'm always at your service, Captain Ma.

116
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,950
Cui Guodong!

117
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,790
Cui Guodong!

118
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,480
Captain Ma.

119
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,830
Where's Cui Guodong?

120
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,160
He and Li Qun have gone
to the Security Section of Hualin Steel.

121
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,390
These days, we turn turns to be on duty
in case of any emergency.

122
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,950
Who sent them?

123
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,920
Director Zhu.

124
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,200
Don't get a sprain.

125
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,030
Why are you airing the quilt now?

126
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,200
Can't you do it tomorrow?

127
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,320
It's very cold at night lately.

128
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,280
Being aired will make it warmer.

129
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,110
How are you now?

130
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,230
Getting any better?

131
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,110
I'm fine.

132
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,400
That day,

133
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,030
I was just freaked out.

134
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,710
You have to learn your lesson.

135
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,000
Don't always take advantage
and bring everything home, understand?

136
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,200
What's wrong with your son?

137
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,880
Was he scared, too?

138
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,110
Scared?

139
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,110
What do you mean?

140
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,790
Come on.

141
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,760
You went to school for some education.

142
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,150
Why did you bring back such strange stuff?

143
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,670
Keep your voice down.

144
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,550
Don't yell.

145
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,840
Don't you see
our son has been weird lately?

146
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,470
How?

147
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,200
He's doing something he never did.

148
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,960
He doesn't come out of his room or
say anything, as if he were possessed.

149
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,230
He's in adolescence, isn't he?

150
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,760
It's normal that something bothers him.

151
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,880
Oh, you went to the Public Security Bureau.

152
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,640
What for?

153
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,320
Any information?

154
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,200
I can only tell you very little.

155
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,910
More information would be
a violation of discipline.

156
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,350
Keep it to yourself.

157
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,200
That's a dead woman.

158
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,710
Oh, that's it.

159
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,150
What?

160
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,960
The fortune-teller said a woman
was haunting our son.

161
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,960
Why do I feel so cold?

162
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,230
The door is open.

163
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,440
Of course, you feel cold.

164
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,520
What fortune-teller?

165
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,000
She's just a breakfast seller
at the gate of our factory.

166
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,440
How she can tell this?

167
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,640
If she really can, ask her to help us
find the murderer.

168
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Don't be so benighted.

169
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,110
What's the smell?

170
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,520
What are you doing?

171
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,080
Yang, what happened?

172
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,110
I forgot to turn off the stove.

173
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,030
You don't have a fever.

174
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,280
Here.

175
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,230
Yang.

176
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,320
How about you go to the dispensary
with me to get some medicine tomorrow?

177
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,400
Eat.

178
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,110
Eat as much as you can.

179
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,520
Ghosts are afraid of villains.

180
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,110
Sickness is afraid of a stuffed stomach.

181
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,320
I'm not sick.

182
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,910
Then what's wrong with you?

183
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,840
You look as if you were possessed.

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,230
If something bothers you,
tell me and your mother about it.

185
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,400
Dad, do you believe in fate?

186
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,640
I believe in nothing but myself.

187
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,350
Son, listen.

188
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,080
We are educated.

189
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,760
Don't believe in feudal superstition,
just like your mother.

190
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,470
If one day,

191
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,960
I no longer stay in Hualin,
please take care of yourselves.

192
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:03,910
Son...

193
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,110
What are you talking about?

194
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,640
This is your hometown.

195
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,440
Why do you hate to stay here?

196
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,670
What's so good about other cities?

197
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,080
I don't mean this.

198
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,440
Then what do you mean?

199
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,760
Son, trust me.

200
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,590
What you should do now is stay at home.

201
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,520
And then, your mother and I will arrange
everything for you.

202
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,230
After I solve the murder case,

203
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,470
I'll ask for two days' leave
and take you to Beijing,

204
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:39,000
the capital of our country,
for a wonderful trip.

205
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,470
And after we return, you'll get
into a different phase of your life.

206
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,670
OK?

207
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,000
Did you hear me?

208
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,880
Yes.

209
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,760
Eat.

210
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,520
Eat it up.

211
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,790
Dad,

212
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,470
do you know who the victim is?

213
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,710
I only know that's a dead woman.

214
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,150
Nothing else.

215
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,110
It's none of your business and don't ask.

216
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,230
Just eat.

217
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,320
Wash the dish after you finish.

218
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,660
(Hualin Public Security Bureau)

219
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,030
You have something to say, huh?

220
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,030
What is it?

221
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,080
No, I don't have anything to say.

222
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,840
The woman who beat her director...

223
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,710
Her husband works in the Locomotive Dept.

224
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:37,590
They have to feed their parents
and their child has leukemia.

225
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,030
Many couples work
in Hualin Steel like them.

226
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,440
If such cases aren't properly handled,
what would happen?

227
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,670
Come on.

228
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,230
Stop making that sound.

229
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,400
Just get to the point.

230
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,350
Look at this.

231
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,670
Doesn't it look like us?

232
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,150
You're up there
and watch me getting anxious.

233
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,110
At such a critical moment,
you don't help me.

234
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,790
You've even sent away my men.

235
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,280
If we still dawdle, we'll really miss
the golden time of solving this case.

236
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,000
What do you want, then?

237
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,520
What do I want?

238
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,430
I'm short of men!

239
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,350
Hualin Steel is merely a factory.

240
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,190
If I have enough men,

241
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,400
I can send them all.

242
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,190
After searching this factory several times,

243
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,560
I'm sure I'll force the murderer out.

244
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,350
Which has more men,

245
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,880
Hualin Steel or our bureau?

246
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,310
Hualin Steel.

247
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:28,920
What do you mean,

248
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,520
Director?

249
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,590
Think about it.

250
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,400
To Hualin Steel, we're outsiders.

251
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,680
If you want to work Hualin Steel out,
which way is better,

252
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,310
from outside in or from inside out?

253
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,920
Sometimes, when you try from outside in,
you can't see anything.

254
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,520
But if you do the opposite,
you might get to know something.

255
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
On the face of it,
you sound like you're fooling me.

256
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,590
But with another thought,

257
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,560
I think you made sense.

258
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,760
Come on.

259
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,350
Don't flatter yourself.

260
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,430
Why would I fool you?

261
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,430
Even if you sit here,
you can't solve the case.

262
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,040
Hurry.

263
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,470
Get to your work.

264
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,350
All right.

265
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,230
I'll go there personally.

266
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,400
Take some tea back.

267
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,760
It's good tea.

268
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,830
Have some more to stay refreshed.

269
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,070
You also don't drink this, right?

270
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,560
Famous Chinese tea.

271
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,110
Not going home after school?

272
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,070
Wanna get yourself killed?

273
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,470
If you were dismembered,
you would stop playing! Go home!

274
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,110
Can I not go home now?

275
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,950
Go home!

276
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,070
Naughty.

277
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,110
Stealing?

278
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,350
Captain Ma.

279
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:10,760
What?

280
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,950
Wanna hit a policeman?

281
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,560
What are you doing here?

282
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,230
Have you had dinner?

283
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,070
Not yet.

284
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,350
Then go with me.

285
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,350
Where are we going?

286
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,400
Lock your bike.

287
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,160
OK.

288
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,110
Eat.

289
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,520
Here.

290
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,950
OK.

291
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,920
Eat it before it gets cold.

292
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,350
I didn't have lunch.

293
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,230
I'll have it with dinner now.

294
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,920
Being a policeman is a hard job.

295
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,950
When you work, you have no time for meals.

296
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,590
Mr. Wang, eat.

297
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,280
You don't like the food?

298
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,760
I do.

299
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,110
Captain Ma, last time,

300
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,160
I saw that dead body.

301
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,000
Now, every time I see ribs or mince,

302
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,230
I feel...

303
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,950
Sick, huh?

304
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,190
It was inconsiderate of me.

305
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:00,950
Shall we go somewhere else?

306
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,830
No, no.

307
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,830
I'll have some vegetable filling.

308
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,950
Captain Ma, what do you want me for?

309
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,760
You hugely support our work.

310
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,400
My leader
sent me to express our gratitude.

311
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,230
Famous Chinese tea.

312
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,710
Is your bureau
thinking about my application?

313
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,590
Not really.

314
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But I have something private
to ask you for a favor.

315
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,920
What? Don't want to help?

316
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,760
I do.

317
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,830
You're one of your bureau.

318
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,430
If I help you,

319
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,430
I'll be helping your bureau.

320
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,350
How do you want me to help?

321
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:51,310
I want you to be my eye in Hualin Steel.

322
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,310
Eye?

323
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,230
If the wrapper is Hualin,
the filling will be Hualin Steel.

324
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,920
Hualin Steel is the heart of Hualin

325
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,110
and the soul of it.

326
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:21,000
If anything bad happens to Hualin Steel,
how would the city end up?

327
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,590
When solving this case,
we haven't got deep into Hualin Steel.

328
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,920
A big factory like it is cold and silent.

329
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,190
It has its system and temper.

330
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,950
As outsiders, we can't see through it.

331
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,880
What do we do, then?

332
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,310
Bang, you popped out.

333
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,830
You're not like us.

334
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,560
You were born in Hualin Steel
and grew up there.

335
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,520
You're part of it.

336
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,000
You're a piece of hair of it.

337
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,280
You're a breath of it.

338
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,430
You know really a lot about it.

339
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,040
We fail to see something
but you can see it.

340
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,040
Tastes great.

341
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,400
Captain Ma, you're a poet.

342
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,760
I'm not.

343
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,190
I'm a criminal policeman
and I'm born to be one.

344
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:23,590
Speaking of solving cases, ask about me
in the Public Security Bureau.

345
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,310
Ask everyone if I convince them.

346
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,230
You do.

347
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,110
You do, of course.

348
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,520
The murderer isn't exactly normal.

349
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,110
He first went to the living quarter
then Xu's Cold Noodles,

350
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,350
then the Xiaoliang River.

351
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,920
During this long trip, he might be exposed.

352
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,310
Captain Ma,

353
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,070
I've got a wild guess.

354
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,000
Speak.

355
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,000
The body parts weren't dumped
in the Xiaoliang River

356
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,920
but floated there.

357
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,190
How?

358
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,520
Sir, some vegetable buns.

359
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,350
No, no.

360
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,680
Like you said, this is Hualin

361
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,470
and this is Hualin Steel.

362
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,800
Hualin has its city planning
based on that of Hualin Steel.

363
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,040
Its underpasses,
underground drainage, I mean,

364
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,350
go directly to the Xiaoliang River.

365
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,110
And this river flows to the Songhua River.

366
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,230
Why is there never a flood in Hualin?

367
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,430
Due to its well-connected drainage.

368
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,830
So, I think the murderer

369
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,230
dumped the first body parts as he planned.

370
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,000
But for the rest, maybe he was scared

371
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,710
or maybe he ran into someone,
he just dumped them into the sewer.

372
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,710
Sewers connect everywhere.

373
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,230
The Xiaoliang River and also...

374
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,760
Xu's Cold Noodles.

375
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,590
You're Sherlock Holmes of Hualin Steel.

376
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,640
You really flatter me and thank you.

377
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,280
You're wasted as an engine driver.

378
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,590
Don't say that.

379
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,920
After all, in engine driving,

380
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,640
I'm one of the best.

381
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,710
And I think

382
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,430
I'm the most suitable driver.

383
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,280
Nice demonstration.

384
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,230
Our unit has many police officers.

385
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,590
But I can count on no one.

386
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,680
All of them discussed this case.

387
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,190
But they didn't even get as much
as we got over dinner.

388
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,640
So, we're bosom friends.

389
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,800
No.

390
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,070
You're my eye.

391
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,710
And in this case,

392
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,470
I'll count on you.

393
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,190
OK.

394
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:02,950
Like I promised,

395
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,160
I'm always at your service
and I'll do whatever I'm told.

396
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,000
But I have to seriously remind you.

397
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,680
Leave the fighting thing to us, the police.

398
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,430
Don't think you're too smart.

399
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,470
Don't try to be a hero.

400
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,830
I get it. I'll follow your instruction.

401
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,430
It's too spicy.

402
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,520
Vegetable filling, huh?

403
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,230
Enjoy it.

404
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,590
Get us some garlic.

405
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,760
What a small restaurant!

406
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,710
We seldom have lunch together.

407
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,920
I said I would treat
and you should pick a restaurant.

408
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,230
Why don't we have something better?

409
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,590
Steamed buns here taste great.

410
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,950
Good wrappers and the filling.

411
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,430
The flavor hasn't changed over the years.

412
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,070
Sourdough steamed buns.

413
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,640
How is your health?

414
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,000
Working as a driver in my whole life
gives me some occupational diseases.

415
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,830
But not too bad.

416
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,560
What about you?

417
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Captain Ma looks so strong.

418
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,590
He danced very well just now.

419
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,710
What were you dancing?

420
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,190
Come on.

421
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,920
You nearly swung that old lady up.

422
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,190
Latin dance.

423
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,760
I have to swing.

424
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,640
Rumba?

425
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,590
You must be an amateur.

426
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,280
There are different kinds of Latin dance.

427
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,350
Just like the steamed buns.

428
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,880
Chives filling.

429
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,710
Celery filling.

430
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,800
Carrot filling.

431
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,920
All kinds of steamed buns.

432
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,830
Then what is your filling?

433
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,830
Beef filling.

434
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,430
Awesome.

435
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,760
Captain Ma, you're doing
something quite different.

436
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,520
Trying art, huh?

437
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,400
I'm getting old, you know.

438
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,830
I just want some fun.

439
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,800
Or I would be displeased.

440
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,110
Oh, Captain Ma has the vinegar.

441
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,400
You and I should have some.

442
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,880
Captain Ma, do you remember
there is where we had our first dinner?

443
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,190
When I tasted this bun,

444
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,110
I recalled it.

445
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,950
Still that flavor.

446
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,430
We sat by that table, right?

447
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,160
Right.

448
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,830
I was asking you for help.

449
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,280
What?

450
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,350
Shall we recall the past?

451
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,920
No.

452
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,560
The past was horrible.

453
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,280
I don't dare to recall it.

454
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,310
Then why did you find me?

455
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,640
We're in some trouble lately.

456
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,070
We want you to do us a little favor.

457
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,280
And through this, we can get back together.

458
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,560
Get to the point. What favor?

459
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,190
Well, Biao bought a taxi.

460
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,710
But someone faked his license plate.

461
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,160
It's now detained by the traffic police.

462
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,400
Captain Ma, I know
you were famous in Hualin police.

463
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,400
In traffic police and public security,
you must have many connections.

464
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,110
Right?

465
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,040
Please check this for us.

466
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,800
That's all?

467
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
It's nothing to worry about.

468
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,680
Let me make a call.

469
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,160
See?

470
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,070
We really need Captain Ma.

471
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,070
Go on with your food.

472
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,760
Eat.

473
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,590
Rest assured.

474
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,560
Captain Ma will take care of it.

475
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,460
Hand in hand. Hand in hand.

476
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,920
One more minute.

477
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,880
He'll knock off soon, I guess.

478
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,190
His blood sugar must have risen.

479
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Let him sleep.

480
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,560
He can't help, anyway.

481
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,160
Right.

482
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,310
There he comes.

483
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,520
If you weren't in your uniform,

484
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,310
I would be knocking you down.

485
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,470
How are you doing, Cui?

486
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,470
Good, huh?

487
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,800
I can't drive a police car, anyway.

488
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,680
I have to do this traffic work.

489
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,640
And you?

490
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,880
What made you come here for me?

491
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,560
Come on.

492
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,830
Can't I just visit you?

493
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,470
Do me a little favor, please.

494
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,000
Don't be kidding.

495
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,640
Can't you see?

496
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,350
Every day I work on the street
just like a lamppost.

497
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,470
What can I do for you?

498
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,350
It's within your work scope, actually.

499
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,760
Meet an old friend.

500
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,000
Hi, Cui.

501
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,470
Can you recognize me?

502
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,160
Cui... Cui... Cui...

503
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,470
Mr. Wang.

504
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,800
HUAAW357F.

505
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,280
Right.

506
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,680
Anything?

507
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,000
No.

508
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,310
The picture is too blurred.

509
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,110
Even if

510
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,680
I enlarge it,

511
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,800
I can't see clearly.

512
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,470
Why didn't you take a better one?

513
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,590
I took it from the screen
and it was the best I could do.

514
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,520
Presbyopia.

515
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,310
It's not the picture's problem.

516
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,070
Look.

517
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,350
This license plate...

518
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,310
Too plastic.

519
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:03,920
It is?

520
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,110
Even the color is wrong.

521
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,110
Come on. Let me check.

522
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,520
Check this.

523
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,040
Captain Ma, we caught some guys
who sold such license plates in our city.

524
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,400
These guys keep strutting in front of
the Department of Motor Vehicles.

525
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,640
They're troublemakers,
selling fake license plates all the time.

526
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Are you sure?

527
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,190
Actually,

528
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,230
I can't be sure.

529
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,680
Why don't you go and ask them?

530
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,520
Let's go, then.

531
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,680
There's still time.

532
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,110
Go.

533
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,880
Let me get out.

534
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,310
Oh, yeah.

535
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,950
Here.

536
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,590
Take this.

537
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,560
Open the door for me.

538
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,430
Sure.

539
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,160
Whose mobile?

540
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,520
Here.

541
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,070
It's mine.

542
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,590
I should go.

543
00:30:48,940 --> 00:31:00,260
(Hualin SEI Tanker Inspection Station
Hualin Measurement Institute Tanker Verification Station)

544
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,160
Biao, Biao.

545
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,230
That guy...

546
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,070
What do you want, sir?

547
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,640
Points?

548
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,400
A hundred yuan for one point.

549
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,920
Can you do fake license plates?

550
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,470
No.

551
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,760
You asked so directly
and how could he tell you?

552
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,800
How shall I ask, then?

553
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,040
You do it next time.

554
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,190
I just can't do it right.

555
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,070
Captain Ma, do you think
they have some secret codes or argots?

556
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,590
Where did you get this?

557
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,040
Hello.

558
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,520
Do you do license plates?

559
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,470
I've bought a new car
but the procedures aren't complete.

560
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,070
I need a temporary license plate.

561
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,190
Very urgently.

562
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,830
I'm right here.

563
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,000
In front of the building.

564
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,160
Come over.

565
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,430
I'll be waiting.

566
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,310
Be quick.

567
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,230
OK.

568
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,430
I just got them here.

569
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,280
Humph, they think I can't find them?

570
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,470
Captain Ma.

571
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:17,560
Captain Ma.

572
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,590
You two stay here.

573
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,920
I'm going to the toilet.

574
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,760
Why?

575
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,470
Occupational disease.

576
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,950
Long-time sitting constricts his prostate.

577
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:24,830
That's right.

578
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,350
Off you go.

579
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,920
I'll be right back.

580
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,520
Be quick.

581
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,160
He's just old.

582
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,710
But why are you still healthy?

583
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,830
I have diabetes.

584
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,680
Not healthy.

585
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,230
Yes, yes.

586
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,680
How many plates do you want?

587
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,110
Don't worry.

588
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,830
Our license plates enjoy a reputation.

589
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,190
Very real.

590
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,710
The traffic police can't tell.

591
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,430
Pick any numbers you want.

592
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,280
Right.

593
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,800
No extra charge for the last number 8.
[*In China, 8 is a lucky number.]

594
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,560
When do you want it?

595
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,710
OK.

596
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,280
No problem.

597
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,640
Let's meet somewhere.

598
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,430
Exactly.

599
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,830
Who? What a freak!

600
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,280
I don't mean you.

601
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,760
A freak is peeping in the toilet!

602
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,520
I'll call you back later.

603
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,710
What have you got?

604
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,760
Check the cards.

605
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,640
The same phone number.

606
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,840
This guy is a middleman, I guess.

607
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,390
Let's just wait.

608
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,190
What are you doing?

609
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,360
Check this!

610
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,600
Let me go!

611
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,430
Check this.

612
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,630
Did you sell this license plate?

613
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,000
Hurry.

614
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,150
Show it to me!

615
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,040
Look. Look.

616
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,280
Lift it. I can't see.

617
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,800
Check. Check!

618
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,390
Isn't it the government stuff?

619
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,710
I don't sell such things.

620
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,840
What's wrong, Xiang?

621
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,760
Let go of me!

622
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,760
I caught him.

623
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,280
He was making a call in the toilet
when I heard him.

624
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,760
Oh, Section Chief Xing?

625
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,840
Do you still recognize me?

626
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,040
Who are you?

627
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,150
Gong Biao in the Factory Affairs Office.

628
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,230
It's been years and why are you
still selling illegal things?

629
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,600
Oh, you.

630
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,710
I wondered who you could be.

631
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,120
What?

632
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:51,870
Haven't had enough beating?

633
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,840
Try beating me again.

634
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,040
I won't.

635
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,560
This is a law-based society.

636
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,120
People don't fight anymore.

637
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,320
Besides,

638
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,280
I do legal business.

639
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,000
Got it?

640
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,950
Do license plates for others.

641
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,800
Still lying?

642
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,520
Even the police said
you sold that license plate!

643
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,560
In this case, ask them to arrest me!

644
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,800
Enough of this nonsense!

645
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,040
Or I would sue you for defaming me!

646
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,870
Anyway,

647
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,080
I retired as the chief
of the Security Section of Hualin Steel.

648
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,120
A real cadre.

649
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,800
Don't you know?

650
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,000
Selling fake license plates is a crime!

651
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,950
Can I not know?

652
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,910
Did you retire?

653
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,910
You were fired.

654
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,430
Who was fired?

655
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,040
Who?

656
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,390
How dare you!

657
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:27,840
Stop.

658
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,360
Jianchun, we won't give you any trouble.

659
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,600
Just tell me
who you sold this license plate to.

660
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,320
When you don't know that, how could I know?

661
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,840
What?

662
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,760
Get information from me
and then send me to prison.

663
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,190
Right?

664
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,150
Am I right?

665
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,470
Come on, Wang Xiang.

666
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,080
The older you are, the craftier you get.

667
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,000
Xing Jianchun!

668
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm talking nicely to you.

669
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,080
Don't pretend you're a good man.

670
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,320
You've done quite a lot of crimes!

671
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,910
What are you talking about?

672
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,600
What are you talking about?

673
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,040
When you can't even handle
your own family business,

674
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,120
how could you interfere with me?

675
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,320
I'm gonna kill you!

676
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:04,670
Don't fight.

677
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,390
Beat him!

678
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,120
Come on!

679
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,150
Don't fight.

680
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,520
Come beat me!

681
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,320
I just worried I had no one
to rely on for the rest of my life.

682
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,000
- Come beat me.
- Go away!

683
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,190
Stop the fight!

684
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,390
You just want more beating!

685
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,670
Biao.

686
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,560
Biao, camera.

687
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,800
What camera?

688
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,630
Look, there.

689
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,600
He wants money. Can't you see?

690
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,280
He's so wicked!

691
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,600
Are we just letting him go?

692
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,560
I'll handle this.

693
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,630
Look, just the number on his vehicle.

694
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,360
What's he doing?

695
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,600
What?

696
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,120
You ripped my overcoat.

697
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,150
This isn't over.

698
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:38,870
Follow him.

699
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,460
(Hualin Taxi)

700
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,150
Let's wait.

701
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,360
It's their den, I guess.

702
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,630
It doesn't look like one.

703
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,670
How do you know that?

704
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:05,710
If you can easily tell that,
my police experience would be wasted.

705
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,560
You two spy on him.

706
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,520
I'll go get Li and be right back.

707
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,670
Who?

708
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,470
Keep a close eye.

709
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,520
Li?

710
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,560
His new wife?

711
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,760
She must be young, according to her name.

712
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,470
I guess he got her in the ballroom.

713
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,670
All old ladies there.

714
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,840
Biao.

715
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,500
Go, go, move.

716
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,320
How about we go home?

717
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,710
What den is that?

718
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,560
Just a night watchman.

719
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,040
We must trust Captain Ma.

720
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,280
He's professional.

721
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,320
Li, what did I tell you?

722
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,710
You're on a mission.

723
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,630
Go!

724
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,600
Don't you want triumph?

725
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,670
Hurry up! Hurry!

726
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,670
Go. Come on.

727
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,000
Hurry! Go!

728
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,710
How could he be professional?

729
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,840
He left us here and get away.

730
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,190
What? Anything unusual?

731
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:48,280
By a quarter past eleven, seven cars
drove in and four cars drove out.

732
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,360
One driver didn't want to pay
and they nearly quarreled.

733
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,390
Is that unusual?

734
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,670
Has anyone come for the license plate?

735
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,280
No.

736
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,120
Why did you get it here?

737
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,150
Over all these years,

738
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,120
I've never stayed out.

739
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,390
If I'm not home, no one takes care of it.

740
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,430
It's OK. It won't disturb us.

741
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,000
It's as good as police dogs?

742
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,840
Right, Li?

743
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,520
They're my friends.

744
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,870
We're watching here.

745
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,470
Good dog,

746
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,000
Li.

747
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,190
You three do it.

748
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,120
I can't.

749
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,670
I have to take a nap.

750
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,520
It's still early and you're sleepy already?

751
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,630
We're old
and it's hard for us to stay up.

752
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,190
What? Sleepy, too?

753
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,430
Kind of.

754
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,360
Give me your glass.

755
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,630
Come on. Give it to me.

756
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,360
Why?

757
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,390
I'll give you something great.

758
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,190
What?

759
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,950
Coffee.

760
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:44,760
I brought it here.

761
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,280
I drink this. It works.

762
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,320
Instant coffee?

763
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,040
What?

764
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,630
You want something better?

765
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,000
I thought it was fresh coffee.

766
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,630
Come on.

767
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,520
It works instantly.

768
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,870
Drink it and you'll have energy.

769
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,520
I will?

770
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:58,910
Here.

771
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,470
Fine.

772
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,520
All right.

773
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,150
You can't drink that.

774
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:05,710
Not for you.

775
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,230
What's the time?

776
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,000
The latter half of the night.

777
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:29,950
Your dog...

778
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,320
It doesn't sleep, huh?

779
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,630
Had some coffee, too?

780
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,670
It was well-trained.

781
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,520
Captain Ma,

782
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,520
I have to go to the toilet.

783
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,080
You've been there many times.

784
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,360
What if you keep going
and alert Xing Jianchun?

785
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,800
Don't be so undisciplined.

786
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,190
Hold it back.

787
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,470
I can't really control it.

788
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,430
Coffee has such diuretic effects.

789
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,390
Go, then.

790
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,000
I'll go with you.

791
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,080
I want to pee, too.

792
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,760
Take your dog.

793
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,710
Is it your trouble or mine?

794
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,280
Just a minute.

795
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,230
Be more mindful, OK?

796
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,150
We'll be right back.

797
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,190
Be slow and quiet.

798
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,870
Don't learn from them.

799
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,470
Too humiliating.

800
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,280
Are you done?

801
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,910
It's been a few minutes.

802
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,670
Turn around!

803
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,040
When you keep talking, how can I pee?

804
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,870
We're not watching,
but exactly staying up.

805
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,470
Before we catch him,
we might break down first.

806
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,730
Ma Desheng is so unreliable.

807
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,190
Theoretically, twenty years ago,

808
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,080
he was the captain
of the Criminal Police Unit.

809
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,320
He must be capable.

810
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,000
But according to his plan,
how many days can your weak body last?

811
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,360
How about you tell him to
stop this for the moment?

812
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,950
Why would I?

813
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,360
You invited him.

814
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,630
It's our business, though.

815
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,280
I can't hold it anymore.

816
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,430
Even my blood sugar rose.

817
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,280
Where are you going, Biao?

818
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,390
I have to go home for some sleep.

819
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,230
Wait until I wake up.

820
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,040
Come back, Biao!

821
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,390
How could you throw up your job
just as you wish?

822
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,080
Biao!

823
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,000
What the heck!

824
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,000
I'm back.

825
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,280
What about Biao?

826
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,600
Lost?

827
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,950
No. He has gone home.

828
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,760
Who approved that?

829
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,600
His blood sugar rose and yelled at me.

830
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,760
Then I let him go.

831
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,080
If you and I can't hold on,

832
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,760
I'll get him back to replace us.

833
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,430
Can't hold on now?

834
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,950
When I was hunting criminals,

835
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,080
I didn't sleep for even 48 hours.

836
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,000
Now, it's been only a few hours!

837
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,280
What an amateur!

838
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,000
So weak.

839
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,870
He's not even as strong as my dog.

840
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,430
We can't compare to you.

841
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,040
You were a policeman.

842
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,630
Oh, Captain Ma...

843
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:16,950
Captain Ma, will this really work?

844
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,230
Why do I feel
we're simply trying our luck?

845
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,430
Questioning my deduction, huh?

846
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:22,760
No.

847
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,760
Discuss.

848
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,560
Just discuss.

849
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,080
Drive.

850
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:27,950
Go home.

851
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,360
Let's just stop this.

852
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:32,190
One dog and two losers.

853
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:32,800
Make it over!

854
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:35,710
But...

855
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,280
Do it out there.

856
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:51,870
Dad, you've been peeing
since you returned.

857
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:52,710
Didn't you sleep?

858
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,150
I didn't sleep too much.

859
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,430
My heart beat so fast.

860
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,120
I tossed and turned in bed.

861
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,360
Dad, you look terrible.

862
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,080
Let me take your blood pressure.

863
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,320
Don't bother.

864
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,950
I'm not that fragile.

865
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:26,600
It won't be too high.

866
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,560
I know it.

867
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:34,040
Dad, the maximum is nearly 200.

868
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,390
Let me take you to the hospital.

869
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,360
No, no, no.

870
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,120
It's not the...

871
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,560
I'm fine.

872
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,360
Last night,

873
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,280
I drank too much coffee
and that was strong.

874
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,230
Why did you drink coffee?

875
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,470
For my night shift.

876
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,560
In case I got sleepy.

877
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,230
I'll drink more water, then.

878
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:08,150
Fine.

879
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,360
I'll be right there.

880
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,670
Okay.

881
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,430
Dad, going out again?

882
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:21,470
You just had a night shift
and now you're going on a day shift?

883
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:22,040
Aren't you risking your life?

884
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,150
I've got something to do.

885
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,320
Dad, who were you calling?

886
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,080
Quite furtive.

887
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,430
Are you getting some bad hobbies?

888
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,950
How's that possible?

889
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:32,320
Don't imagine things.

890
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,360
Get dressed and go to work.

891
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,800
I should go.

892
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,120
Tell me.

893
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,560
Are we doing some entrapment?

894
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,840
Not at all.

895
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,520
But you know quite a lot.

896
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,800
You're a good teacher.

897
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,840
I learned it from you.

898
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,670
Look.

899
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:01,470
Do we look like

900
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,230
Sherlock Holmes and Watson?

901
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,320
Yeah?

902
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,120
Let's take a selfie.

903
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,390
You just want him to confess.

904
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,320
I'll record a video
and see if he'll confess.

905
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:16,670
Be seated.

906
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,150
Remain calm.

907
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,120
Why do you stare at me?

908
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:20,910
Stare over there!

909
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:21,520
Don't stare at me!

910
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,190
He's too psychologically weak
to do the dancing competition.

911
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,760
Mind your attitude.

912
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,280
He's helping us.

913
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,710
His appearance isn't good.

914
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:30,390
Just a coward.

915
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,000
There he comes.

916
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:32,800
There he is.

917
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:33,760
Yeah?

918
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:34,870
Shoot.

919
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,950
Humph.

920
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,120
Here it goes.

921
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:44,840
Here.

922
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:49,670
With the money transfer, it'll be settled.

923
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,520
Why did he stand up?

924
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,280
Go text Biao,
asking him to block the door.

925
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,710
Biao, he's leaving.

926
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:08,000
Block the door.

927
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,040
What happened?

928
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,040
I offered to transfer the money.

929
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,080
He held me up and has gone to the toilet.

930
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,520
Were you behaving so nervously
that he saw through you?

931
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,670
It's the first time I'm doing this.

932
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:21,040
What do we do?

933
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:21,870
I can't help being nervous.

934
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:23,430
We have evidence. Catch him.

935
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:24,040
OK.

936
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,280
What are you doing? Never you mind.

937
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,360
Aren't we going to catch him?

938
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,190
You go practice dancing!

939
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,710
Desheng, stay safe.

940
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,120
I'll be back in a couple of days.

941
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,560
Stay safe.

942
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,120
We will.

943
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,120
Biao, come in for him.

944
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:39,760
What?

945
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,190
Come on.

946
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:48,000
Xing Jianchun,

947
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,190
I know you're in there.

948
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,520
Here. Keep shooting.

949
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:52,870
Come on.

950
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:54,080
Come out!

951
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,280
What are you doing?

952
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,120
Are you insane?

953
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,910
Why didn't you flush the toilet?

954
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,080
Be more careful next time.

955
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,560
Stop the shooting.

956
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:05,080
What are you doing here?

957
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:05,760
What happened?

958
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,560
I don't know what you're asking.

959
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,630
They kicked the door.

960
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:08,470
Why did you kick my door?

961
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,390
Who did that?

962
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:10,390
It just fell.

963
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,360
You kicked it down.

964
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:12,520
Yes, he did.

965
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,280
Don't let him go!

966
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,230
The back door. Back door.

967
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:16,150
Talk nicely. Talk to them.

968
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:06,600
Wang Xiang...

969
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,000
Give it to me.

970
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,630
Get off me!

971
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:08,080
Give it to me!

972
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,600
Get off me!

973
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,360
Don't push it, you know?

974
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,040
You hypocritical man!

975
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,800
Calm down and negotiate,

976
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,150
OK?

977
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,710
- You old devil!
- Don't push it!

978
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:13,280
You got him?

979
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:13,670
Get off me,

980
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:14,040
I warn you!

981
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:14,950
Come on.

982
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:15,760
Calm down and negotiate.

983
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,470
Calm down and negotiate,

984
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:17,000
OK?

985
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:18,120
Let it go!

986
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:18,630
Let it go!

987
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:19,230
Stop struggling!

988
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:19,520
Let it go!

989
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,230
Don't struggle anymore!

990
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,630
What else can you argue?

991
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,080
Search him.

992
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:23,840
He must be carrying something else!

993
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,190
Take off his coat.

994
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:24,870
What else have you got?

995
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:25,840
Stop struggling.

996
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,800
Stop it.

997
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:28,080
Take it off!

998
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,390
Don't bother to struggle.

999
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:31,800
Behave yourself!

1000
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,600
Do you hear?

1001
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,150
What are you hiding?

1002
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:34,950
Give it to me.

1003
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:36,600
Give it to me. Do you hear?

1004
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,710
Give it to me. Do you hear?

1005
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:39,560
What is it?

1006
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,080
What's this?

1007
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,390
Using a urine bag?

1008
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,870
Jianchun, what's all this about?

1009
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:20,000
Don't cry.

1010
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,040
Tell us who you sold the HUAAW357F to
and we won't hurt you!

1011
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:26,390
I don't know!

1012
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:35,320
Come on.

1013
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,080
Let's stop trying.

1014
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,150
Send him to the police and he'll confess.

1015
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:45,280
You can't get away from this.

1016
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,150
Confess now and you still have a chance.

1017
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:47,950
Understand?

1018
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,800
Who did you sell that license plate to?

1019
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,800
Tell us and you'll be OK!

1020
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:11,320
Why do you keep denying it?

1021
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:11,670
Biao.

1022
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:12,150
What?

1023
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:12,470
Come on.

1024
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:14,560
Let him go.

1025
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:15,080
Go.

1026
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:18,910
What?

1027
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,910
Don't show unnecessary kindness.

1028
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:30,520
Jianchun, we've known for years.

1029
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,150
Time to let it go.

1030
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,390
Not for my sake, but for my son's.

1031
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,600
OK?

1032
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:18,670
You're back?

1033
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,950
Yang, come have lunch.

1034
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,190
You're back, Dad.

1035
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:38,910
What are you dazing at?

1036
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:40,630
Wash your hands and have lunch.

1037
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:45,910
Yang,

1038
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:50,800
I...

1039
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,600
I came to see you.

1040
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,080
Can you hear, son?

1041
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:06,280
I miss you.

1042
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:12,800
Yang.

1043
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:18,670
Yang!

1044
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:25,190
My son!
