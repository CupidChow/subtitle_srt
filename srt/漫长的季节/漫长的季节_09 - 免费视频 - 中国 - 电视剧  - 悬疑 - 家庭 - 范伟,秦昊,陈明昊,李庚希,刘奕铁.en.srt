00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,900
=The Long Season 9=

2
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,310
- All done, ma'am. Next.
- Thanks.

3
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,080
Applying for retirement.

4
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,440
Let me see your files.

5
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,480
Do you have your Health Records?

6
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,550
Your files are incomplete.

7
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,390
Why?

8
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,080
This page isn't stamped.

9
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,390
You need a stamp here.

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,670
Our factory fell apart a long time ago.

11
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,190
No one is there to stamp it.

12
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Please... do the math yourself.

13
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,270
I've met...

14
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,880
the 30 working years for retirement.

15
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,190
Your case is indeed special.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,720
Can you still make contact with
Zhao Guangzhou

17
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,960
who handled your files back then?

18
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,960
The factory went broke years ago.

19
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,800
I have no idea why he didn't stamp
that page or where he is now!

20
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,830
He can be anywhere!

21
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,960
Is everything OK, Qiaoyun?

22
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,520
What's wrong?

23
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,390
It's OK. Don't worry.

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,360
I'm here with you.

25
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,110
We can talk it out.

26
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,160
I...

27
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,960
(Application for Employees' Retirement)
I started working at Hualin Steel

28
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,800
on October 1st, 1986.

29
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,320
I was responsible for weighing.

30
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,000
And I left on October 4th,

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,630
1998.

32
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,830
I worked there for 12 long years,
and I never took time off!

33
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,800
How come

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,600
I need someone else to prove
that I worked there?

35
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,240
We'll all become old someday.

36
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,720
Her retirement should be approved,
but you're making things hard

37
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,360
and getting in the way.

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,160
What do you want?

39
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,600
Calm down, sir.

40
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,880
We'll verify her length of service.

41
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,270
It won't affect her retirement.

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,190
Don't worry.

43
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,520
Let's go.

44
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,720
Have an ice cream.

45
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,720
That's a waste of money.

46
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,600
Not at all. Eat it.

47
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,440
You always say your life is bitter.

48
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,080
So have something sweet.

49
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,270
My teeth will ache.

50
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,270
Nonsense. I've got worse ones.

51
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,240
Yours can handle a sweet.

52
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,670
Come on.

53
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,750
I...

54
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,030
I can't open it.

55
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,880
It's OK.

56
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,320
Let me see.

57
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,360
See? From here.

58
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,880
Tear it open.

59
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,030
Got it.

60
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,520
Eat up.

61
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,520
I'm just mad at myself.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,880
I got laid off years back
and then I was between jobs.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,760
Now, I still can't do anything
other than make a scene in public.

64
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,160
When will things become less tough?

65
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:24,760
Relax.

66
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,480
Your retirement will be approved.

67
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,270
You heard what they said.

68
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,000
No worries.

69
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,920
Sorry for troubling you
and calling you over from work.

70
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,480
Don't mention it.

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,550
No trouble at all.

72
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,920
It's OK.

73
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,640
By the way,

74
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,480
I need to ask you something.

75
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,350
What is it?

76
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,550
It's about a girl.

77
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,320
You used to work at Victoria, right?

78
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,760
Victoria, remember?

79
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,200
That club.

80
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,110
What's your point?

81
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,640
I wanna...

82
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,600
ask you about a girl.

83
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,670
She played the piano there,

84
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,390
Shen Mo.

85
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,040
Do you know her?

86
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,000
No, we only met briefly.

87
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,160
She had a younger brother,

88
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,920
Fu Weijun, a mute.

89
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,670
Do you know him?

90
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,510
Not at all.

91
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,440
Think hard, OK?

92
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,270
Did you see him back at that club?

93
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,160
The past is the past!

94
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,110
I don't remember anything at Victoria.

95
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,390
It's OK. Take your time.

96
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,720
Does that name ring a bell?

97
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,440
It was back in the '97, '98.

98
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Think about it.

99
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,350
Wang Xiang, do you despise me

100
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,720
for my past all these years?

101
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,350
Yes, I drank with those men.

102
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,670
You can tell me if you think less of me.

103
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,070
No, Qiaoyun, I...

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,040
I don't mind!

105
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
I... I've never thought any less of you.

106
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,230
I... I don't mind it at all.

107
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,440
I've told you everything I know.

108
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,510
That's it.

109
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,950
Alright,

110
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,830
I'm going home.

111
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,830
The rest is yours.

112
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,550
I'm leaving.

113
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,040
Huh?

114
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,510
Eat up.

115
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,110
No, it's too sweet for me.

116
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,830
Then...

117
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,880
let me give you a ride.

118
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,440
No, thanks.

119
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,550
You don't have to.

120
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,350
Come on!

121
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,440
I didn't mean that at all.

122
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,160
She took it the wrong way.

123
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,440
I bought this for nothing.

124
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,480
Let's drink some other day.

125
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,160
Sure, sure.

126
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,040
I'll call you.

127
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,830
You sure can dance.

128
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,670
Did that kid admit the hit-and-run?

129
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,640
That's his car, so he can't deny it.

130
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,070
But as for when and where
and who he hit, he couldn't say much.

131
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,720
If the victim doesn't come forth,
it'll be hard to find that person.

132
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,830
That's all my buddy could say.

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,350
He can't tell us more
or he'll be breaking the rules.

134
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,200
How sneaky!

135
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,040
What's wrong?

136
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,670
It's just a hit-and-run.

137
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,110
Why are you clinging on to it?

138
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,790
You don't understand.

139
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,230
Is there a story behind it?

140
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,270
A bad one maybe.

141
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,550
You want one?

142
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,510
You know, ever since I quit smoking,

143
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,270
I always wanna chew something.

144
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,480
Does that man look familiar to you?

145
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:18,720
Who is it?

146
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,200
That dead college girl
in the dismemberment case, remember?

147
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,070
I remember I kicked that guy hard.

148
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,070
He's that girl's uncle.

149
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,600
You beat him up.

150
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,440
All that beating was exhausting, too.

151
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,350
What's he doing here?

152
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,150
Maybe there is a story.

153
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,520
Like what?

154
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,400
What's that runaway driver's name?

155
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,670
Shen Hui.

156
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,470
Why?

157
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,080
Are you sure?

158
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,000
Absolutely.

159
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,710
Are you and Li Qun still in touch?

160
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,230
Is that what you want to know?

161
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,280
Why should I?

162
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,230
Besides, as the director of the bureau,
he's way out of my league now.

163
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,230
You sound jealous.

164
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,960
Look at you.

165
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,640
Jealousy doesn't suit
a traffic policeman.

166
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,030
Are you free tonight?

167
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,030
Do you want me to be free or not?

168
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,000
You could use a treat.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,790
Did you come here by car?

170
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,350
No.

171
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,000
Do you have one?

172
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,080
Let's take mine.

173
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,030
Problem solved.

174
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,230
When did you get this?

175
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,520
Is it new?

176
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,030
Don't touch it.

177
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,640
That's someone else's car.

178
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,320
A two-wheeler?

179
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,880
Is there a problem?

180
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,520
Put on the helmet.

181
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,110
I look good in pink.

182
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,790
Of course.

183
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,320
It makes you look younger.

184
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:53,910
Sit here?

185
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,030
Hold me tight.

186
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,230
These two wheels outrun
the four-wheelers.

187
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,400
What about my feet?

188
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,520
Drag them.

189
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,140
(Guiying BBQ)

190
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,840
It's hot.

191
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,000
Let's eat without him.

192
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,640
It's late.

193
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,640
I don't think he'll come.

194
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,200
He wouldn't dare stand me up.

195
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,590
Are you hungry?

196
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,670
Have some water.

197
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,400
They're grilling meat while here we're
burning charcoal like a suicide scene.

198
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,470
Let's eat. My treat.

199
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,520
OK?

200
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,150
Yap, yap, yap.

201
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,440
Are you done?

202
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,470
This is serious business.

203
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,790
You have to eat now?

204
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,080
Look,

205
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,880
I've done my part.

206
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,150
Look at you!

207
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,320
Petty as before.

208
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,590
Alright, fine.

209
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,840
I'm going out for fresh air.

210
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,840
Let me know if he's here.

211
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,280
Sir, you aren't using the stove.

212
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,200
I can put it away.

213
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,110
Keep it.

214
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
I'm waiting for a friend
while preheating the grill.

215
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,760
He'll come any minute.

216
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,470
The heat might burn the grill, you know.

217
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,910
Are you the owner?

218
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,710
If not, let her talk to me.

219
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,910
What's wrong?

220
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,960
Are you trying to save some charcoal?

221
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,280
I'll order food later.

222
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,670
You're upsetting the client.

223
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,520
Is your grill made of plastic?

224
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,280
You have to make me mad.

225
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,710
That girl!

226
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,110
Director Li!

227
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,320
Captain Ma!

228
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,080
Sorry, I'm late.

229
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,200
I got caught up in my work.

230
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,670
You're a busy man, aren't you?

231
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,000
Unlike civilians like us,
we're free all day.

232
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,590
You're flattering me.

233
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm merely a public servant
doing bits and pieces.

234
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,790
Look at you talking like a big boss!

235
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,150
Captain Ma, your hair has turned gray.

236
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,550
I'm no longer a captain.

237
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,230
Call me Desheng.

238
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,000
Excuse me. I'm ordering now.

239
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,320
Scan the QR code.

240
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,550
What?

241
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Saves them a lot of work.

242
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,280
Let me.

243
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,110
How should I do it?

244
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,110
Let me do it.

245
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,350
Of course you can't.

246
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,960
Can't I buy you dinner?

247
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,670
Come on...

248
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,150
No need to argue.

249
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,110
This dinner is for you.

250
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,440
Alright.

251
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,790
Let me do it.

252
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,080
I said my treat.

253
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,880
Stop arguing with me.

254
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,760
Fine, you do it.

255
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,200
I'll select a few on the menu.

256
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,880
Beef, streaky pork,
and roast chicken hearts.

257
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,230
It's been a while, really.

258
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,590
They say you're doing square dancing
and quite good at it.

259
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,470
Square dancing?

260
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,470
Who said that?

261
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,960
It's Latin, OK?

262
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,470
Hot and cool!

263
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,280
I'm the hottest in the world!

264
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,710
Latin, of course.

265
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,640
Have some water.

266
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,590
I'll take that cup.

267
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,280
Excuse me.

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,910
We need cups.

269
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,550
Or do we have to scan the code, too?

270
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,200
Desheng, who else will come?

271
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,520
The meat tastes good.

272
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,470
How long have you been doing this?

273
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,550
A couple of years, man.

274
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,470
Really?

275
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,280
I need those ten skewers fast.

276
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,840
Hurry up.

277
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,520
You got it.

278
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,350
You got any chili powder?

279
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,910
Right here.

280
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,520
The more the better.

281
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,110
It's extremely hot.

282
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,670
It's OK.

283
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,840
He's from Sichuan, known for spicy food.

284
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,440
Dig in.

285
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,230
It's cooked.

286
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,030
Come on.

287
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,520
What's wrong? A director like you needs
food to be served on your plate?

288
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,200
I'm so glad to see you!

289
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,670
Eat.

290
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,080
You said you were hungry.

291
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,910
Not anymore after waiting for so long.

292
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,350
Then...

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,590
let's drink.

294
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:00,880
Come on.

295
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,320
Let me fill your cup, Director.

296
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,320
Sorry, I can't drink.

297
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,350
There are rules.

298
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,230
You're off duty.

299
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,150
We were in the police force, too.

300
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,670
Come on.

301
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,320
Please, Desheng.

302
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,790
I really can't.

303
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,400
Sorry.

304
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,520
I can't break the rules.

305
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,470
Bear with him, Captain.

306
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,110
He's a director now,
not some nobodies like us.

307
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,110
Don't push him.

308
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,470
Don't be sarcastic.

309
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,000
Quit it.

310
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,520
Alright.

311
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,470
I'll drink with you.

312
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,910
Come on.

313
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,590
What are you doing?

314
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,030
No drunk riding.

315
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,550
You'll get caught.

316
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,110
To think you're a traffic policeman.

317
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,110
Grill the meat.

318
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,030
Honestly, it's good that I get to
meet my old boss and colleague...

319
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,640
Chicken gizzards.

320
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,230
Chicken gizzards.

321
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,200
I'm glad to see you both.

322
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,640
So,

323
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,470
I'll toast you with tea,

324
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,550
OK?

325
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,350
Is that OK?

326
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,960
Li Qun, sorry to butt in,

327
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,910
but we should let
Captain Ma speak first.

328
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,150
Don't you agree?

329
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,590
I'll go first?

330
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,080
Alright then.

331
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,470
We're all brothers.

332
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,550
Desheng, do you need help or something?

333
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,030
Let's cut to the chase.

334
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,670
Nothing.

335
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,080
What could it be?

336
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,590
I just wanna invite you to dinner.

337
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,520
That's it.

338
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,280
As long as it's legit,

339
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,400
I'll get it done.

340
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,230
Fine, I'll be straight.

341
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,200
You took over Fu Weijun's case,
didn't you?

342
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,000
Look,

343
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,520
I was young and thoughtless.

344
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,640
Honestly,

345
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,830
I'm still unable to let it go.

346
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,830
That's not my point.

347
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:10,920
I said it's nothing.

348
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,710
Really.

349
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:16,230
Fu Weijun had a record of
intentional injury in Songhe.

350
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,310
You know that.

351
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:18,920
I do.

352
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,680
I remember he broke a boy's arm then.

353
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,880
It was added to his sentence.

354
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,800
His buddy, Sui Dong, was sentenced, too.

355
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,830
What's your point?

356
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:32,590
That boy is Shen Hui, driving
an unlicensed taxi in Hualin.

357
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,880
A few days ago,
he got detained for a hit-and-run.

358
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,190
That guy he hit hasn't
come to the police.

359
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,350
No one knows where that person is.

360
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,470
When I called the prison,
they told me that Fu Weijun

361
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,760
died there early this month.

362
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,470
How are those two things related?

363
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,520
That's the problem.

364
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,230
I don't know.

365
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,760
So I need to take a look
at the case file back in '98.

366
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,710
Cheers.

367
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,560
Come on.

368
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,160
Let's drink!

369
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,830
You have to help me.

370
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,950
Desheng,

371
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:18,160
I know this case is your baggage as
I'm carrying it, too, all these years.

372
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,070
But only the police
can access case files.

373
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,040
You should know that.

374
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,800
If you have any leads,
you can report them to us.

375
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,680
And we'll see what we can do.

376
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,590
Listen to you talking shop.

377
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,520
You're treating me
as other civilians, huh?

378
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,920
I played this kind of game 20 years ago.

379
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,040
When I was your captain, you...

380
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,280
So are you gonna help me or not?

381
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,160
Just say it.

382
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,160
I can help you with other things,
but not looking at the case file.

383
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,310
Sorry.

384
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,310
It's against the rules.

385
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,190
Li Qun, this is important to me.

386
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,710
As it is to me.

387
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,560
- Let's... Well, forget it.
- Stop.

388
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,680
Let's eat.

389
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,560
Eat up.

390
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,680
Try the meat.

391
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,190
Eat it.

392
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,110
Can't do anything on an empty stomach.

393
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:29,590
Look,

394
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,350
Director Li,

395
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,760
I picked up skewers
from a stall outside.

396
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,680
Try it.

397
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,110
Give me one.

398
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,880
It might be overcooked.

399
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,880
This is tender.

400
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,830
We've pulled out the case file
of the dismemberment case.

401
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,160
Shen Hui is at the police station.

402
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,430
Bring him here.

403
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,190
Already on it.

404
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,830
We've got the video of
that hit-and-run, too.

405
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,710
Everyone is here.

406
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,590
Captain Ma,

407
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,880
I don't mean to upset you,
but you've hit a dead end, literally.

408
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,710
That guy is dead. He can't talk.

409
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,190
Is No. 2 Prison in Fengshan District?

410
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,950
Yeah.

411
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,710
So, if their prisoners died,
where will they be cremated?

412
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,470
Fengshan Funeral Parlor.

413
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,070
How could you be so careless
and lose his urn?

414
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,040
Unbelievable.

415
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,160
Weijun was related to us.

416
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,520
He did bad things, yes,
but you can't lose his ash.

417
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,400
Come on!

418
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,680
No smoking here.

419
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,640
No smoking or open flames.

420
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,520
What about them outside
burning joss papers

421
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,350
and that huge chimney smoking every day?

422
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,230
No smoking or open flames my foot!

423
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,350
You're wasting your time
as well as mine.

424
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,280
Not anyone can come
and withdraw the ash.

425
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,430
It has to go through a proper procedure.

426
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,400
How is it proper that you don't know
who withdrew the ash?

427
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,640
Please check in your system
and give us a name.

428
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
It's simple.

429
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,040
You can't provide any identification.

430
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,920
I can't help you.

431
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,470
Identification?

432
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,310
This man is a retired police officer.

433
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,680
He was a captain in the police force.

434
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,070
Captain Ma,
show her your retirement certificate.

435
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,640
I have it with me.

436
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,070
Did you bring it?

437
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,230
I gave it to you, didn't I?

438
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,760
You have it.

439
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,310
Come on. Just check it.

440
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,680
Once Captain Ma shows his ID,
your boss will have to come

441
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,230
and greet him, you know.

442
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,110
The director of the bureau now
was promoted by him.

443
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,190
Check your back pocket.

444
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,680
It's there.

445
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,280
Don't have one.

446
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,350
Alright, fine.

447
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,880
Stop digging in your pockets.

448
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,350
I got it.

449
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:46,950
Here's a record.

450
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,830
It was withdrawn by his relative,

451
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,000
Shen Dongliang.

452
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,640
And when was it?

453
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:10,260
(Hualin Taxi)

454
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,040
Hi.

455
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,590
It's ten yuan.

456
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,190
Invoice, please.

457
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,040
Plus the one from the last time.

458
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,640
When was that?

459
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,950
I came a few days ago but forgot
to get the invoice for my ticket.

460
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,920
On what day?

461
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,160
Don't remember.

462
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,040
Run it in your system,

463
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,040
HUAAW357F

464
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,800
Found it.

465
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,590
No, you got the invoice.

466
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,920
I did?

467
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,560
Give me the new one.

468
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,830
He makes no mistakes.

469
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,800
What's for lunch?

470
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,640
Anything you like. It's on me.

471
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,160
How about something fancy?

472
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,470
Fill yourselves up
and watch closely this time.

473
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,710
Once we get in, you two be quiet.

474
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,470
I'll do the talking.

475
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,000
Be careful.

476
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,230
Don't pull your muscles.

477
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,470
It's easy to tell who's fitter.

478
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,800
Cut it out!

479
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,470
You're nuts.

480
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,680
Why is she so mad?

481
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,190
I don't get it.

482
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Xiang, you can't blame her.

483
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,230
You don't know how to talk to people.

484
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,280
You always get under their skin.

485
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,680
You got lucky that she didn't
throw the thermos at you.

486
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:50,470
A widower and a divorcee-to-be don't
get to lecture me on relationships.

487
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:56,430
Women, especially the mature ones,
want to be pampered.

488
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,040
Please them before asking for favors.

489
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,310
Listen to that big old romanticist.

490
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,000
He's more experienced.

491
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,920
Not tired at all.

492
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,640
Hey, romanticist, how
should I please her?

493
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,040
She keeps ignoring my calls.

494
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,880
What's this?

495
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,830
Be careful!

496
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,310
Easy.

497
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,160
Get down. Come on.

498
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,950
I got you.

499
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,640
Take a look.

500
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,640
Let me see.

501
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,560
You could be charged with harassment.

502
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,830
Send her a message.

503
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,710
Put it like this:

504
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,760
Dear Yun,

505
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,280
I'm so sorry!

506
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,560
Sobbing face.

507
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,350
Add an emoji.

508
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm not making any excuses,

509
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,880
but please... don't be mad.

510
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,470
Add this.

511
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,040
You're breaking my heart.

512
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,920
You're breaking my heart.

513
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,230
You're good.

514
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,920
Please give me a chance.

515
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,920
Let me take you out tonight.

516
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,160
I'll apologize to you again.

517
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,920
See? Are you gonna send it?

518
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,470
Already sent.

519
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,590
She'll give me a good talking-to.

520
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,680
Come on!

521
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,470
All your square dancing is worth it.

522
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,590
I'll say it again.

523
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,680
It's not square dancing. It's Latin!

524
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:15,830
Get down!

525
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,400
Is it him?

526
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,640
Get down!

527
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,350
Look away, look away.

528
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,160
Where are we going?

529
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,230
Biao, Biao, Biao.

530
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,920
Relax. Take it easy.

531
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,830
He's in.

532
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,530
It's him?

533
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,070
Come on!

534
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,710
OK.

535
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,640
This one?

536
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,190
It is.

537
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,000
Knock. What are you waiting for?

538
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,160
Go ahead!

539
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,560
Is anyone in?

540
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,190
Property Management.

541
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,160
Your neighbor downstairs said
your pipe is leaking.

542
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,760
We're here to check and fix it.

543
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,160
Please open the door.

544
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,590
Keep going.

545
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,110
Open up. Property Management.

546
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,470
Are you sure it's this one?

547
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,280
Keep knocking.

548
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,880
That's the wrong one.

549
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,430
Over here. I reported the leak.

550
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,950
It is this one.

551
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,830
When you finish with them,
could you come to my place?

552
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,110
I can wait.

553
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
What's wrong?

554
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,680
The kitchen pipe is leaking.

555
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,430
Go home.

556
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,400
Someone will help you in a minute.

557
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,920
I can wait here.

558
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,680
Can you fix it?

559
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,680
I guess.

560
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,640
Can you stop it?

561
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,800
It can't be harder than fixing trains.

562
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,350
So your pipe is leaking, yeah?

563
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,760
We made a mistake.

564
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,920
Do you know who lives there?

565
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,040
Is he a Shen?

566
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:50,800
I need your phone.

567
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,760
Shed light.

568
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,070
Let's go if you can't fix it.

569
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,520
Don't push yourself.

570
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,350
Hey, you, you can come in.

571
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,920
It's cool outside.

572
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,590
They can handle it.

573
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,710
It's broken.

574
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,880
Beyond repair?

575
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,950
Ma'am, this thing fell off,
so water keeps coming out.

576
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,640
What to do?

577
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,590
Where's the master valve?

578
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,070
On the 6th floor.

579
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,280
Look,

580
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,040
I'll go upstairs and turn off the
master valve to stop the leakage first.

581
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,760
Then we'll install a new valve
on your pipe to fix it.

582
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,160
He's Biao.

583
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:44,070
Give him a few dry rags so
that he'll wipe your entire floor.

584
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,560
I'll do what?

585
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,070
I don't even do chores at home.

586
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,560
Why should I do it for others?

587
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,000
Ma'am, are you alone?

588
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,280
Where are your kids?

589
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,350
They live in another city.

590
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,680
Fine, get me the dry rags.

591
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,230
OK.

592
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,230
So what's the point of having kids?

593
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,760
Pigeons are better.

594
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
So are dogs.

595
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,800
Don't just stand there.

596
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,470
Give me a hand.

597
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,400
You were working out so hard downstairs.

598
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,160
Swinging on it.

599
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,800
Stop talking and start wiping.

600
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,110
Where's your energy when we need it?

601
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,160
(Is that 305?)

602
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,710
(Yes, over there.)

603
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
Are you trying to be helpful now?

604
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:19,640
Give me a rag.

605
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:20,950
I need one.

606
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,160
Wring out the water in the basin.

607
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,430
Did you report a leaking pipe?

608
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,310
We've fixed it and here you are.

609
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,190
Thanks.

610
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,160
Who are you?

611
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,880
Property Management.

612
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,760
They said they are.

613
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,110
OK, you guys take it from here.

614
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,110
- Wait.
- Who are you?

615
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,520
The same.

616
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,470
Property Management.

617
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,470
Do you know them?

618
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,190
You work in Property Management?

619
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,040
I thought we are!

620
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,800
We're new guys.

621
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,400
Wait.

622
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:50,920
Hold on.

623
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,590
New employees?

624
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,280
You're at least 60.

625
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,760
Aren't you too old?

626
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,310
Excuse me?

627
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,590
Watch your tone.

628
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,680
Ma'am, did you lose anything?

629
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,110
We've got frauds in the neighborhood,
targeting the seniors.

630
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,830
It's happened more than once, you know.

631
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,070
Look at you, two old men working
together to rip off the seniors!

632
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,110
We aren't!

633
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,110
Show some respect!

634
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,680
You know who he is?

635
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
Enough. Calm down.

636
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,640
I'll be honest.

637
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,680
We're the police.

638
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,520
We're here for a case.

639
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,190
Why not call yourself the president
in plain clothes?

640
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,230
What's that supposed to mean?

641
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:21,880
Nothing.

642
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,470
Come with us and tell us everything.

643
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,310
Don't touch me!

644
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,710
Back off!

645
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,350
- I'm not afraid of you!
- Are you picking a fight?

646
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
I don't care about Property Management.

647
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,520
What are you doing?

648
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,160
I'm calling the police.

649
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,000
Go ahead!

650
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,400
I'm not afraid!

651
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,640
Call it in!

652
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,230
Do it!

653
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,310
Stop. I'll go with you.

654
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,280
Let me go!

655
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,070
You first!

656
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:36,680
You first!

657
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,760
Enough. Break it off!

658
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,590
What about my pipe?

659
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,920
Fix it.

660
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,710
Get your job done!

661
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,430
Come on.

662
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,190
Bring them back.

663
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,430
Where were you?

664
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,520
We've got it fixed.

665
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,110
Go ahead!

666
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,000
Move!

667
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,800
Don't push me!

668
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,800
I'll go.

669
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,830
Keep moving!

670
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,920
You're a wuss.

671
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,520
Will it kill you to shut up?

672
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,230
I can't hold it!

673
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,430
Hadn't it been for you,
we would've been fine.

674
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,350
If that guy hadn't stopped me,
his partner would be doomed!

675
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,400
Is anyone in?

676
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,000
Hello?

677
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,880
Are you OK?

678
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,470
Do you feel better?

679
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,230
You two again.

680
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,870
What's wrong with him?

681
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,080
Seasonal gastric disorder
or he got spooked.

682
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,600
Come here.

683
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,520
Go ahead.

684
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,320
Me?

685
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:36,840
Yes.

686
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,190
Don't give it to me.

687
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,600
Throw it in the bin.

688
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,000
Your name?

689
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,950
Wang Xiang,

690
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,600
"Xiang" as "loud".

691
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,630
You went in alone?

692
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,390
Yes.

693
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,520
Those two left with the guys
from Property Management.

694
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,780
(Qiaoyun)

695
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,870
I got a call.

696
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,910
Do you mind if I take it?

697
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,040
What do you think?

698
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,470
Officer, please let him take it.

699
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,800
An old man like him
has finally got a date.

700
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,190
Did I ask you to speak?

701
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:55,560
Sit back.

702
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,390
I'll deal with you later about
impersonating the police for the fraud.

703
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,230
Read it and see
if the statement is accurate.

704
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,040
If there's nothing wrong, sign it.

705
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,870
Their boss used to work for you, right?

706
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,230
Tell him about it.

707
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,910
You do it.

708
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,600
Now, you're dropping the ball.

709
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,040
This is embarrassing.

710
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:15,840
It's OK.

711
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,670
Bring me that man in the corner.

712
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,910
Come here!

713
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,320
He asked for you.

714
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,430
Pull the strings.

715
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,040
What a huge table!

716
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,430
Much better than we had back in the day.

717
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,950
Take a seat, Captain Ma.

718
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,710
So cool.

719
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,320
What happened?

720
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,670
You and those two outside,
what are you up to?

721
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,560
Impersonation, trespassing,
and tempering with the crime scene.

722
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:35,950
What's all this? Mission: Impossible?

723
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,630
We were following a lead.

724
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,520
Don't be mad.

725
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,190
How could I not be?

726
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,670
Following a lead to what?

727
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,600
You think you can track down a criminal?

728
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,470
If you can do it, why need us?

729
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,840
Is that what you mean?

730
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,840
We were trying to bring you
the first piece of the puzzle.

731
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,870
Should I thank you?

732
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,390
Are you onto Shen Dongliang?

733
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,280
18 years ago, he worked in the
labor union at Songhe No. 2 Textile Mill.

734
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,230
Also, he's Shen Mo's uncle by blood
and her foster father.

735
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,390
The driver of the hit-and-run using
a fake plate is his son, Shen Hui.

736
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,800
What else do you know?

737
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:37,840
Like I said last time,
any case-related info is confidential.

738
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,630
I tell you so that you can continue
your little investigation?

739
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,910
What if something bad
happened to the three of you?

740
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,230
Then what?

741
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,840
What should I tell your family?

742
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,120
You're ruining our case!

743
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,280
What about that?

744
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,320
I haven't said anything.

745
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,600
Why are you so sad?

746
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,760
Alright, Director Li.

747
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,670
Don't.

748
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,710
Don't call me that.

749
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,150
Li Qun is fine.

750
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,520
Captain Ma.

751
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,320
Please do me a favor.

752
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,390
What is it?

753
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,670
Stay out of it.

754
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,280
How did it go?

755
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,520
Did you pull any strings?

756
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:28,910
What did you say?

757
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,430
Nothing except for small talk.

758
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,470
Just wait.

759
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,800
What took him so long?

760
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,800
Come on!

761
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,390
Are you leaving?

762
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:32,950
No.

763
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,950
Mr. Wu, what brings you here this late?

764
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,910
My back pain is acting up again.

765
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,080
It hurts really bad.

766
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,840
Are you free?

767
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,840
Yes, of course.

768
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,760
Come on in.

769
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,520
I brought you some tangerines.

770
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,120
Thanks.

771
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,000
Don't mention it.

772
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,360
Have you had dinner?

773
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,190
Not yet.

774
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,910
Me neither.

775
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,230
I picked up wontons to eat at home,
but they gave me enough for two boxes.

776
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,150
How about we share them?

777
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,360
Let's eat before the massage.

778
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,080
Sure. Let's eat first.

779
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,040
Take a seat.

780
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,320
This one has coriander,
and this one doesn't.

781
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,000
I remember you don't like it, do you?

782
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,000
Yes, I don't like coriander.

783
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,520
How perfect!

784
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:42,950
Thanks.

785
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,190
Dig in.

786
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,520
Is it still hot?

787
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:14,470
Captain Ma.

788
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:15,190
Captain Ma,

789
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,390
what's next?

790
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,870
What's next?

791
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,320
The police will handle it.

792
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,470
Wait for their news.

793
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:27,560
I'm off.

794
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,230
Where are you going, Captain Ma?

795
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,230
I can give you a ride.

796
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,760
Stop calling me captain.

797
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,670
I quit a long time ago.

798
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,150
Let's go home, Xiang.

799
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,120
Go ahead.

800
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:44,840
I need a walk.

801
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,320
Where are you going?

802
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,000
A massage parlor?

803
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,670
Director.

804
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,430
Shen Dongliang was stabbed
multiple times in the back.

805
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,360
We believe the killer attacked him
from behind when he was cooking.

806
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,280
His wife, Zhao Jing's oxygen
concentrator was unplugged, too.

807
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,910
There's no trace of property loss.

808
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,320
Shen Dongliang must've fought back.

809
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,870
We found skin tissues under his nails.

810
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,840
They're being tested for DNA.

811
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,230
Also, in his apartment, there are

812
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,520
Fu Weijun's letters.

813
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,390
Shen must've got them from the prison.

814
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,390
The addresses on those letters
are the same.

815
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,230
We've run it.

816
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,600
It's Hongyan Sand Factory
in Gening Banner, Inner Mongolia.

817
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,150
The contact is listed as Yin Hong.

818
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:32,840
According to the local police,

819
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,360
Yin Hong bought a coach ticket
on October 19th.

820
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,840
The destination was Hualin.

821
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,120
Put out a BOLO and find Yin Hong.

822
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:48,230
Director, a few things didn't add up
in Fu Weijun's statement back then.

823
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,800
Was he covering for Shen's killer now?

824
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,910
What is this?

825
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,390
The image keeps freezing.

826
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,360
Change it!

827
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,000
That noise!

828
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,760
It's too loud the entire afternoon.

829
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,800
Another one!

830
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,190
What's wrong with it?

831
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,430
The image looks fine.

832
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:20,630
Oh, well, you only change
when it freezes up?

833
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:22,120
Can't you show something like...

834
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,670
The special kind, you know?

835
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,870
Your board outside says
there will be today.

836
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,280
That has to wait until 9...

837
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:31,430
9 p.m.

838
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,520
It's... it's not even dark yet.

839
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,430
I'm here for fun,
not to wait until dark!

840
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:38,190
I want the exotic stuff.

841
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,120
Let's see it.

842
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,560
I only smoke 555.

843
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,190
Go get it.

844
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,320
Don't push me!

845
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:59,390
I'll go.

846
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,080
That's more like it.

847
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,950
Are you leaving?

848
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,430
Get your refund!

849
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,430
Hello again.

850
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:31,800
Oh, I forgot you're mute and deaf.

851
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,260
(Cinema)

852
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:17,210
Minus 68, minus 32,

853
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:19,570
minus 85 equals 325.

854
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,320
That's all.

855
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,520
And I fought hard to get you this much.

856
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,800
I didn't expect
you'd quit all of a sudden.

857
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,360
It takes time and a lot of work
to find a replacement, right?

858
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,230
I gotta deduct your pay for it.

859
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,390
Come here anytime if you need help.

860
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,560
When will your
fried starch cubes shop open?

861
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,390
Soon. I'm looking for a place.

862
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,150
Once it opens, you should all come.

863
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:49,950
My treat.

864
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,670
Did you win the lottery or something?

865
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,150
Shen Mo.

866
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:00,040
Where are you going?

867
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,080
I'm looking for you.

868
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,360
What's the rush?

869
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,630
We need to talk.

870
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:13,710
Mr. Lu said we're all friends.

871
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,710
He wants to invite us to a hotel later.

872
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:21,950
How could you?

873
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,950
How could you?

874
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,360
How could you?

875
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,360
Are you done?

876
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,470
Have I ever done you any harm?

877
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,320
Why did you set me up?

878
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,320
You drank too much.

879
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:49,560
That wasn't my fault.

880
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:54,840
Besides,

881
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,910
I gave you such a good opportunity.

882
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:03,000
Tons of girls would throw themselves
at Mr. Lu, but he didn't like them.

883
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,670
Don't feel so good about yourself.

884
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,800
Although I entertain men
while you play the piano,

885
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,560
we're doing what we do for money.

886
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,910
So you're no better than me.

887
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,670
Think it over.

888
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,040
Let me know your answer.

889
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,390
Are you sorry?

890
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,360
Hey, stutterer,
you know sign language, right?

891
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:58,360
Come on.

892
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,080
Translate my words to your mute buddy.

893
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:05,600
You've got a dirty mouth.

894
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:06,870
Fatty.

895
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,430
Here you go.

896
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,390
Any more swear words?

897
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,940
I'll kill you!

898
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,280
Are you trying to say something?

899
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,390
That mute wants to speak.

900
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,230
Don't provoke me.

901
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,760
You don't belong to Hualin Steel.

902
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,190
Get out for good!

903
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:44,610
Add more ice.

904
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:45,120
Boss.

905
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,430
Don't boss me.

906
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,800
You skipped work for days.

907
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,560
Where were you?

908
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,190
Have you seen Shen Mo?

909
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,190
Are you here to work or to mess around?

910
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:00,080
Are you paying my salary?

911
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,950
You've skipped work and come late for...

912
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,320
I'm talking to you!

913
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:13,870
Hello.

914
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,280
Page

915
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,910
9532657.

916
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,360
Yes. Leave a message.

917
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,230
I'm sorry about that day.

918
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:26,840
Where are you?

919
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,230
I want to see you now.

920
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:35,150
Did you and that college girl fight?

921
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,120
No. It wasn't a fight.

922
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,280
I heard

923
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,600
Lu Wenzhong slept with her.

924
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,560
Is that true?

925
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,800
It's nothing special.

926
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:50,320
Mr. Lu has had tons of girls like her.

927
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:52,760
They're all the same in bed.

928
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:56,870
She's a good actor,
sitting there like an angel.

929
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:17,520
How... can I help you, young man?

930
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,430
Did you touch Shen Mo?

931
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,840
I see.

932
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,870
You must be her boy toy!

933
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,120
He's handsome!

934
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:35,910
But I think you aren't too smart.

935
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:43,150
Go back and tell Miss Shen
that good looks don't make good dates.

936
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:47,840
What are you doing?

937
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,470
Am I too nice to you?

938
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,870
I apologize, Mr. Lu.

939
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,040
He's nuts.

940
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:07,470
Look, handsome, you know
how much my suit is worth?

941
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,520
12,000 yuan.

942
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,430
I look hot in it, don't I?

943
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,520
But you'd be a clown in it.

944
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,430
We choose the suit,
but that suit may not suit you.

945
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,630
You should find the right one.

946
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,280
Get him out!

947
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:27,710
Go!

948
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:30,560
I'll be right back.

949
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:33,430
Hey, bring Mr. Lu some fruit!

950
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:37,560
Relax.

951
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,910
That was nothing.

952
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:39,910
Happens all the time.

953
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:40,520
Come on.

954
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,120
Don't let that kid ruin our night.

955
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,360
Did I hire you to hook up with girls?

956
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,120
You're fired!

957
00:57:58,950 --> 00:57:59,910
Keep him away from my club.

958
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:04,190
You called me a watchdog.

959
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:07,000
What about yourself? You dirty dog!

960
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,080
Where's Shen Mo?

961
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:42,910
Sui Dong.

962
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:46,670
Sui Dong?

963
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,520
He's in hospital.

964
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:44,120
The three of us
must have the worst luck in the world.

965
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,320
It should be them.
