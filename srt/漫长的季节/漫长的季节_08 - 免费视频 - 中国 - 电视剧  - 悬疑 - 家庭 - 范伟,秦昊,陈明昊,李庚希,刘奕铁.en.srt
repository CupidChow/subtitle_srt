=The Long Season 8=

2
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,720
Wang Yang.

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,680
Wang Yang.

4
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,720
Mr. Wang.

5
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,880
I came for Wang Yang.

6
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,110
He isn't in.

7
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,320
Then I should go, Mr. Wang.

8
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,080
Wait.

9
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,470
These days, do you know
where Wang Yang usually goes?

11
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,110
No.

12
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,750
I haven't seen him for days.

13
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,960
Stop telling lies.

14
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,360
You always stay together.

15
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,440
How could you not know?

16
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,910
Come on, Mr. Wang.

17
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,750
I really don't know.

18
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,360
It's been days
since I met him last time.

20
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,240
Qu Zhifei is your father, right?

21
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,440
A dispatcher, huh?

22
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,440
Every time he meets me, he calls me
Mr. Wang very respectfully and greets me.

26
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,190
You know?

27
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,270
Shall I ask your father to find my son?

28
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,080
Don't.

29
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,160
Where are they?

30
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,670
I'm asking you!

31
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,670
Where's Shen Mo?

32
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,270
Something happened to her, right?

33
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,080
I don't know.

34
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,910
Here.

35
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,390
Weijun asked me to give you this.

37
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
Mr. Wang, ride slowly.

38
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,360
Turn left ahead.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,880
Here we are.

40
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,040
Mr. Wang, I'm not getting in.

41
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,350
I seldom came here.

42
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,320
Keep up.

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,950
Who do you want?

44
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,550
Wang Yang.

45
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,110
Dad.

46
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,830
What are you doing here?

47
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,640
Go home.

48
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,200
You go home, Dad.

49
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,760
I'll be back soon.

50
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,160
Go home!

51
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,790
Dad,

52
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,600
I...

53
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,880
Go home!

54
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,390
I...

55
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,720
You didn't recognize me, huh?

56
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,000
At the police station, you tried
to run away but I tripped you up.

59
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,230
Listen to me.

60
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,720
Don't send for him anymore.

61
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,670
He isn't one of your kind!

62
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,110
Go home.

63
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,550
But, Dad,

64
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,550
I've got something to do here.

65
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:37,920
Go home.

66
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,350
I...

67
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,480
I said, go home!

68
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,110
I'm not going home.

69
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,510
Qu Bo, help me!

70
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,350
Wang Yang, go home
and talk to your father.

71
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,070
Get lost!

72
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,000
Go home first.

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,640
Go home.

74
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,790
- Why did you tell my father?
- What are you doing?

75
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,920
How dare you!

76
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,040
What do you think you're doing?

77
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,640
You loquacious idiot!

78
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,920
Now you beat people!

79
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,760
Who taught that?

80
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,670
Him?

81
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,830
Go home!

82
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,200
Get up. Come on.

83
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,550
Sorry that he punched you.

84
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,830
Don't let him get to you.

85
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,110
Go home!

86
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,510
Go!

87
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,390
Fine, I'll go.

88
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,720
I warn you.

89
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,510
Never send for him again.

90
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,070
As you saw, in the police system,

92
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,550
I have friends.

93
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,600
Don't ask for trouble!

94
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,950
Oh, son.

95
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,720
What happened to you?

96
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,920
If anything bothers you, tell Mom, OK?

98
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm fine, Mom.

99
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,110
You go to bed.

100
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,550
So will I.

101
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,390
Yang...

102
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,200
Stop.

103
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,320
What are you doing with that man?

105
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,040
Nothing.

106
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,320
I'm going to sleep.

107
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,550
Yang.

108
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,110
Come on, son.

109
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,200
Son, don't rush to sleep.

111
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,390
Stop shouting and stop pushing me, OK?

113
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,110
How were you talking to your mother?

114
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,880
Talk that rudely again
and I'll break your legs!

116
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,510
What on earth has happened?

117
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,040
You... Go back to your room.

118
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
I'll talk to you later.

119
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,810
Don't lose your temper.

120
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,670
Be nice. Do you hear?

121
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,760
You know your mother's health condition.

122
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,390
Don't keep her worried.

123
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,320
You and I shall talk.

124
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,390
These days, what have you done?

126
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,070
Nothing.

127
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,390
Then why?

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,110
Why was there blood on your coat
after you climbed a mountain?

129
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,510
Son, did you kill someone?

130
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,230
Son,

131
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,280
I'm your father.

132
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,760
Even if I die,

133
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,150
I wouldn't let you die.

134
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,150
But first, you have to tell me
the truth.

136
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,640
Don't keep anything from me.

137
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,470
Whatever it is, let's solve the trouble.

139
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,590
This is the last chance for you and me.

141
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,350
To surrender or to be arrested
are two different things.

143
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,910
Don't be silly, son.

144
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,400
Dad, give me two more days.

146
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,470
What for?

147
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,520
I have something to do.

148
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,320
I have to do that.

149
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,320
Before you tell me everything,
you're not going anywhere!

151
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,550
Dad,

152
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,910
I have to go.

153
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,550
In the cinema,
what did you put in your pocket?

155
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,080
Take it out!

156
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,280
Take it out!

157
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,880
Who wrote this?

158
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Where are you going on the 17th?

159
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,230
Dad, later,

161
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,670
I'll explain everything to you.

162
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,760
But now, I can't.

163
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Meisu! Meisu!

164
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,150
Dad!

165
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,790
Rope.

166
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,280
Mom!

167
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,880
Keep this.

168
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,200
Mom, don't.

169
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,790
Son, hang in there.

171
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,320
- We do this for your own good.
- Dad!

172
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,790
Don't struggle, son.

173
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
- Stop struggling. Stop.
- Dad, Mom!

174
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,520
We do this for your own good, son.

175
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,550
Don't struggle, please.

176
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,670
If he said he didn't kill anyone,

177
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,790
I trust him.

178
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,590
He doesn't even dare to kill a chicken.

179
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,670
We can trust him!

180
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,960
What about the police?

181
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,440
What about Ma Desheng?

182
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,150
Think about it.

183
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,110
Did he make some bad friends?

184
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,910
He must have been deceived.

185
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,790
These guys must be behind this.

186
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,710
Go talk to Ma Desheng.

187
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,400
Tell him to catch these guys.

189
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,670
Then our son would be safe.

190
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,230
Just tell him our son is innocent
and he must have been deceived.

193
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,520
OK, OK.

194
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,550
- Tell him and everything will be OK.
- Say no more.

195
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,670
That's it.

196
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,280
Say no more.

197
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,080
What do we do?

198
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,440
You and I

199
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,550
will keep him in his room.

200
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,080
Staying under my nose
would be the best way.

202
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,030
And then,

203
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,150
I'll find out the truth.

204
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,000
Our son would be clean, then.

205
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,350
(Take Hualin Line on the 17th.)

206
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,280
Listen to the sound.

207
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,440
What sound?

208
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,550
The sound of money.

209
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,760
Clop-clop,
the money goes into your pocket, Mr. Lu.

211
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,520
It's humorous of you, Mr. Song.

212
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,840
I signed the bank draft.

213
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,790
On the 17th, it will be in your account.

215
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,640
I understand, Mr. Song.

216
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,440
I can't do without you.

217
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,350
However much money I make,

218
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,440
I'm always your demand deposit.

220
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,440
Don't use improper words.

221
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,000
We're just developing our factory.

222
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,080
Tonight, in Victoria,
let's have a drink.

224
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,110
You mean it's a misunderstanding, huh?

225
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,760
Yes, it is.

226
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,030
Where was your son caught?

228
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,230
In the Finance Office, right?

229
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,350
Yes.

230
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,080
What is Xing Jianchun?

231
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,520
Chief of the Security Section, right?

232
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,470
When he caught your son,
how could it be a misunderstanding?

234
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,320
Come on, Mr. Song.

235
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,910
Here's the thing.

236
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,150
Xing Jianchun lured my son
to the Finance Office.

239
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,590
He was taking revenge.

240
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,760
You and Xing Jianchun have a problem?

241
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,670
Well, not exactly.

242
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,080
He resold public properties
and I caught him.

244
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,520
In some sense,

245
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,910
I was defending our factory.

246
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,150
Mr. Wang, if Xing Jianchun really did that,
even though you didn't tell me,

249
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,280
I would also investigate it.

250
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,440
But now, this isn't
what we're talking about.

252
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,960
We're talking about your son, Wang Yang.

254
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,230
According to the Security Section,
he wanted to steal in the Finance Office.

256
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,710
What is Hualin Steel?

257
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,470
The honor of Hualin.

258
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,520
We tolerate no one
who would nearly commit a crime.

260
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,840
That's it.

261
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,790
And I've made myself clear.

262
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,400
I have a meeting later.

263
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,320
You may leave.

264
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,840
Mr. Song.

265
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,440
Mr. Song,

266
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,670
I have something to explain to you.

268
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,350
Go ahead.

269
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,080
That night,

270
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,080
I really didn't see anything.

271
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,520
What's your point?

272
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,030
I mean, when I delivered the wine,

274
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:29,030
I indeed heard
some noises of making out.

276
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,710
However...

277
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,520
I really didn't see who the woman was.

279
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,320
That's a different thing.

280
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,150
I think

281
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,470
I should explain this to you
in case it hinders my son's job.

283
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,280
Threatening me, huh?

284
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,960
I get it.

285
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,080
If I give your son a job,
you would be seeing nothing.

287
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,430
But if I don't, you'll discredit me
with this any time you want.

290
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,710
Is this your plan?

291
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,190
No, Mr. Song.

292
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:08,920
I...

293
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,560
Mr. Wang, so much for this conversation.

295
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,710
Wait, Mr. Song, let me finish.

297
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,160
Get lost.

298
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,470
Out!

299
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,350
Anyway,

300
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,710
I have to finish.

301
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,640
Speak.

302
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,000
My father was
a founding worker of Hualin Steel.

304
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,830
I'm always the advanced worker
of my department.

305
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,040
And for my son...

306
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,430
I don't allow a bad guy to frame him up.

308
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:55,430
If anyone plays dirty tricks to harm our
factory or workers, it's hard to tell

312
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,950
who would get lost in the end!

313
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,280
(Factory Manager's Office)
You have an affair with a mistress

314
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,520
and you think that's justified?

315
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,110
I'm gonna sue you!

316
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,920
In the trade union,
the Women's Federation,

317
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,920
newspapers, radios, and TV stations.

318
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,280
Xiang, what are you murmuring?

319
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,590
No... Nothing.

320
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,470
What are you doing here?

321
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,400
To visit a friend.

322
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,430
Fine, then...

323
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,520
You're OK, huh?

324
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,640
Yes, yes.

325
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,430
Why are you waving your hand?

326
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,920
I just moved some beer.

327
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,110
And my arm is sour, Ge.

328
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,190
I just stretched it.

329
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,760
I'm getting to work.

330
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,350
Drink off, OK?

331
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,110
Yes.

332
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,800
Come on. Cheers.

333
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,470
You can hold your liquor, sir.

334
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,800
Come on. Let me fill his glass.

335
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,350
OK.

336
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,430
What did you do?

337
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:57,830
Nothing.

338
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,040
Spit it out?

339
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,560
No.

340
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,920
Sir, I drank it up.

341
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,350
You...

342
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,110
What's this?

343
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,160
Lady, fooling me?

344
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,640
No.

345
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,680
Sir, come on.

346
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,000
I'll drink more. I will.

347
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Put it down.

348
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,710
Stop singing.

349
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:17,800
Stop.

350
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,000
She isn't that kind of woman.

351
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,710
Lady, do you think I'm drunk?

353
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,800
Am I drunk?

354
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,560
No, sir.

355
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,070
Am I?

356
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,800
No, sir. No.

357
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,680
Sir, everyone comes here to get drunk.

359
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,640
I'll drink it up.

360
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,430
Is that all?

361
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,350
No.

362
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,350
How much more do you want?

363
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,110
Three glasses.

364
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:46,520
Three.

365
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:46,920
Some more.

366
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,640
Three...

367
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,160
Some more.

368
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,760
Don't bother.

369
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,470
I'll drink this up.

370
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,070
You can really hold your liquor.

371
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,160
Awesome.

372
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,560
That's right.

373
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,710
This is the way people drink.

374
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,830
Just some wine.

375
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,230
- Not some drug.
- I'm OK.

376
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,760
Right?

377
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,040
Come on, cheers.

378
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,880
Come on.

379
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,350
Come on, cheers.

380
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,160
Cross our glasses.

381
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,310
Of course.

382
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,920
You can drink quite a lot.

383
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
Don't drink that much.

384
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,920
Let me fill your glass.

385
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,040
It's OK.

386
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,160
Keep drinking.

387
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
Keep singing.

388
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,710
Mr. Song, see you tomorrow.

390
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,470
See you tomorrow.

391
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,800
I should go.

392
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,640
Be careful and drive safely.

393
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,640
Get... Get the money up here.

394
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,520
Put them beside the piano.

395
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,430
Move inside.

396
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,560
Put them in a row, beside the piano.

398
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,680
Bonus for you.

399
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,110
From Mr. Lu.

400
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,190
100 yuan for a flower basket.

401
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,710
If someone is appointed, she gets 50.

402
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,350
And you'll get

403
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,470
300.

404
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,310
Who's Mr. Lu?

405
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,040
The man over there.

406
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,350
His hair is slicked back.

407
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,710
Say thank you.

408
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,680
That's all?

409
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,470
Or what else?

410
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,280
He's paid the money for you
because he likes you.

412
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,680
You...

413
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,430
Do something.

414
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,430
How about you return the flowers to him?

416
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,830
I can't take anything without paying.

417
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,520
How can you just return them?

418
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,160
It's not vegetable shopping.

419
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,070
You can't return as you wish.

420
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,070
If you want that, when you get off work,
talk to him face to face.

423
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,920
After work, I'm going back to school
and I have no time.

425
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,350
That's not in a hurry.

426
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,110
Mr. Lu is a big client of our place.

428
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,470
He just wants a talk with you.

429
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,680
And then, when you're parched,
drink some beer to moisten your throat.

433
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,590
I don't want you to be thirsty.

434
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
I never drink with a guest.

435
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,350
That's not the thing.

436
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,190
Just do me a favor.

437
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,760
For my sake, OK?

438
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,190
If it's hard for you to cope with him,

439
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,110
I can resign.

440
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,760
You...

441
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,800
What a girl!

442
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,710
You don't need to.

443
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,760
He didn't ask for anything. You...

444
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,230
Just play the piano.

445
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,190
The song is for you.

446
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:09,380
(Watch out for the door. )

447
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,110
Wait.

448
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,400
Wait.

449
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,110
Thank you.

450
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,310
How about you get off?

451
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,800
What if you vomit here?

452
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,880
Let me get you off.

453
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,590
Be careful.

454
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,070
Be careful.

455
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,280
Are you OK?

456
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,680
Aren't you the college student
who plays the piano?

457
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,950
Don't drink that much.

458
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,400
It's bad for your health.

459
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,350
Everyone knows too much wine is harmful.

461
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,190
But how can I get money then?

462
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,950
From you?

463
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:05,300
(Cinema)

464
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Are you OK?

465
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,590
Where... Where am I?

466
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,280
My brother's cinema.

467
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,110
I'm fine.

468
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,400
I'm going home.

469
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,110
Sleep here for tonight and leave tomorrow
after you feel better.

471
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,230
This is my brother, Fu Weijun.

472
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,590
In case you have a stomach ache,

473
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,160
I sent him to buy you some wonton.

474
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,560
Thank you.

475
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,590
I'm Yin Hong.

476
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,400
He can't hear.

477
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,350
(Thank you.)

478
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,430
She'll sleep here.

479
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,350
Get her a clean shirt.

480
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,560
You can do sign language?

481
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,190
I worked in a massage parlor.

482
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,400
Some people there can't hear or talk.

483
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,430
I learned some from them.

484
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,560
Your brother is cool.

485
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,280
Thanks.

486
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,110
Pity that he can't talk.

487
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,800
I have classes tomorrow morning.

488
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,920
Have the wonton and sleep.

489
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,560
(Thank you.)

490
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,760
(You're welcome.)

491
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,300
(Cinema)

492
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,760
Where's Shen Mo?

493
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,040
(She's gone to school.)

494
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,680
(You look better with the ponytail.)

495
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,280
I'll return the shirt after I wash it.

496
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,040
Goodbye.

497
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,070
Miss Shen.

498
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,710
Sorry, I got the wrong girl.

499
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,470
It's OK, Mr. Lu.

500
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,430
Have we met?

501
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,830
Yes.

502
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,110
You might not remember.

503
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,830
But I was in your box a couple of times.

504
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,400
So, we're acquaintances.

505
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,640
Sorry. Sorry.

506
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,760
How about today
we impress each other deeper?

508
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,110
Why are you drinking alone?

509
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,070
Mr. Lu, here. Let me drink with you.

511
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,280
Drinking that much may get you drunk.

512
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,680
You want girls to be drunk, don't you?

513
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,710
Drink this.

514
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,950
Better for your stomach.

515
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,710
Red wine?

516
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,950
I'll get some Sprite, then.

517
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,160
That's not how you drink red wine.

518
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,400
Listen.

519
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,430
Come on.

520
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,160
How did it sound?

521
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:17,830
Great.

522
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:21,400
This sound is known
as The Sigh of a Lady.

524
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,040
Red wine is just like a lady.

525
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,230
They should be nicely treated.

527
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,560
No one can be that rude to them.

528
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,800
I've never met
a customer like you before.

530
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,880
I've never met
a customer like you before.

532
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,640
We're friends, aren't we?

533
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,190
Would you be my friend?

535
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,560
You're up?

536
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,760
Would you like breakfast?

537
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,000
I'll go order some.

538
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,040
Have something to drink.

539
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,840
I ordered it for you.

540
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,320
What's this?

541
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,080
Open it and see.

542
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,360
Do you like it?

543
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,390
Yes.

544
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,560
I like everything from you.

545
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,870
Are you familiar with Shen Mo?

546
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,390
The girl who plays the piano.

547
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,670
Why?

548
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,710
Answer me.

549
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,630
I know her.

550
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,280
Then when possible,
ask her out for me to have some fun.

552
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,430
What do you mean?

553
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:27,760
What fun?

554
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
Don't you understand?

555
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,520
Am I not as good as her?

556
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,710
You...

557
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,390
You're good.

558
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,390
So is she.

559
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,520
But you are not her.

561
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,760
She's my friend.

562
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,040
Is Victoria where you make friends?

563
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,910
Think big.

564
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,040
She isn't your rival.

565
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,760
If you help me, she'll be your chance.

567
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,600
Money is something great.

568
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,630
With money, you will have
quite many good friends.

571
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,470
And I'm very generous to my friends.

572
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,710
Think about it.

573
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,600
I'm still using it.

574
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,560
Be patient.

575
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,950
You aren't picked yet.

576
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,870
Lend me your perfume.

577
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,760
Yin Hong, some asked to see you.

579
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,800
(What's up?)

580
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:14,560
(You look great with this.)

581
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,230
You're handsome.

582
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,390
But you have no other advantages.

583
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,800
Take care of your cinema.

584
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,360
This isn't where you belong.

585
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,430
(Thank you.)

586
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,800
Are they away for the rooms?

587
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,520
Yes, I guess.

588
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,190
Qiaoyun, where did you get the lollipop?

589
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,520
Xiaoli gave it to me.

590
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,390
Only one piece.

591
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,080
Would you like it?

592
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,280
No, keep it to yourself.

593
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:57,470
Qiaoyun, you look pretty, actually.

595
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,080
Don't tease me.

596
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,840
Everyone wants
to pay for a young pretty girl.

598
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:08,840
Qiaoyun,

599
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,670
I'll take you to Room 888.

600
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,520
Get in with me and take a seat.

602
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,120
It'll work.

603
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,800
Ge!

604
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,760
What?

605
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,320
Has Mr. Lu come?

606
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,800
I saw his car down there.

607
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,760
He's been here for a while.

608
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,430
Having even finished a crate of beer.

609
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,390
Why didn't he invite me?

610
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,910
He didn't?

611
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,000
Then how could he start?

612
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,470
I thought you went in there.

613
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,120
Have you picked the room?

614
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,670
If you haven't, come and have fun.

615
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,840
Nothing is real.

616
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:22,950
Mr. Lu, what shall we drink for tonight?

618
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,560
It depends on you.

619
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,760
You pick some for us.

620
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,150
I don't have too much work tonight.

621
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,320
You don't need to pick me up.

622
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,320
Why isn't Song sleeping yet?

623
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,120
Has he taken the medicine?

624
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,840
After you finish dinner,
make some porridge for him.

626
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,910
That's digestible.

627
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,630
Put him on the phone.

628
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,840
I'll... I'll talk to him.

629
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,600
Hello.

630
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,190
Song.

631
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,320
Song, this is Mom.

633
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,080
Mom is working overtime in the factory
and can't go back home now.

635
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,080
Are you sleepless?

636
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,280
Say something.

637
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,670
If you're sleepless,
let me sing a song for you.

639
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,470
OK?

640
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,190
Listen.

Look, it's her.

648
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,600
Shen Mo in our Department of Pharmacy

649
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,040
misbehaves out of school.

650
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,230
She offers sexual services in a karaoke

651
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:05,390
and gets illegitimate income
from drinking or sleeping with men.

652
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:10,630
She had sex scandals on campus
and compromising photos.

654
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:12,950
All right. All right.

655
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:13,950
Get out of here.

656
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:14,430
Go.

657
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,000
Stop reading. Stop.

658
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,760
Stop reading.

659
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,280
Stop.

660
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,410
I haven't seen enough of it.

661
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,900
Fine. Let's go.

662
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,640
Away you go. Go.

663
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,870
This is the secretary
of our Security Office.

664
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,630
This is Shen Mo.

665
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:42,950
Come and sit.

666
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,800
I'll just get started.

667
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,840
You work in Victoria, right?

668
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,190
Yes, I play the piano.

669
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,760
Four days a week.

670
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,000
Two hours a day.

671
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,000
How much are you paid?

672
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,840
30 yuan for one night.

673
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,870
I'm paid every week.

674
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,150
In Victoria,
do you have any other income?

676
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,190
No. This is all that I get.

677
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,950
That's my part-time job
and I have no other income.

679
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:16,630
Have you got any improper dealings
with members of society?

681
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:19,390
No.

682
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,560
Has anyone offered a quick buck?

684
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,710
What?

685
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,670
You're an adult.

686
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,470
I'll just get to the point.

687
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:35,840
Sexual services...

688
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,390
Have you offered any?

689
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:48,600
No.

690
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,630
Are you saying information
in this letter of accusation isn't true?

693
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,560
Give an explanation to these photos.

695
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,520
Is it you?

696
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,560
May I take away the...?

697
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,470
Before everything is clear,

698
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,320
I'll have to keep the photos.

699
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,390
But don't worry.

700
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,150
No one else will see them.

701
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,120
How clear do you want?

702
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:39,080
Shen Mo, you should at least trust us.

704
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:43,950
If you don't cooperate,
there might be serious consequences!

706
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:52,630
Shen Mo.

707
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,900
(Dean's Office)

708
00:45:59,080 --> 00:45:59,800
Shen Mo!

709
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,710
Shen Mo!

710
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,760
Who sent the photos and letter?

711
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,040
Don't you have anything to tell me?

712
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,520
Qu Bo told you everything, didn't he?

713
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,360
I've got nothing to say now.

714
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,280
You should go home.

715
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,390
What are you looking at?

716
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,470
Go look at your mother!

717
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,560
Are you insane?

718
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,360
If you don't want to say anything, fine.

719
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,670
What's gone is gone.

720
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,190
I won't bother about that.

721
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:25,000
But when you need money,
could you please tell me?

723
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,040
I can make money.

724
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,120
If you expect anything or want
to do anything, just let me know!

726
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,040
Don't get to know those terrible guys.

728
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,670
Or they would think you're a pushover!

729
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,710
You also think I'm that kind of woman?

730
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,560
I don't mean that.

731
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,040
I know what you mean.

732
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,840
Whether I wanted it or I was forced,

734
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,230
I have to make you forgive me, huh?

735
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,470
I told you a long time ago.

736
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:58,430
I don't deserve to be loved by you.

737
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,520
And I'm not good enough for you.

738
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,390
Am I clear?

739
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:05,320
If I am, go back home
and let's never meet again.

742
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:16,470
She's just naked and lying in bed.

744
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,230
Really?

745
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:20,470
She's said to offer
sexual service in a karaoke.

746
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:25,840
I'm going for dinner.

747
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,840
What about you?

748
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,630
OK. I'll go with you.

749
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,000
What are you doing here?

750
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:26,800
Come on.

751
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,840
Dinner is on me.

752
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:32,100
(Yuanyuan Restaurant)

753
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,190
Don't drink that much.

754
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,670
You'll have to work later.

755
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,280
I'll vomit in the toilet.

756
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:46,120
It's quite easy for me
to deal with those dirty men.

758
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,080
But it's bad for your stomach.

759
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,470
Don't sacrifice your health for money.

760
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,950
Without money, health is worthless.

761
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,000
Why must you make money in Victoria?

763
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,320
Is there no other way out?

764
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,600
What else can I do?

765
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,520
Play the piano?

766
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,520
I don't mean that.

767
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,520
Don't get me wrong.

768
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,800
Come on.

769
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,190
Don't be nervous.

770
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,600
It's OK.

771
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,320
I know exactly what kind of woman I am.

773
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:43,560
I had some odd jobs.

774
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,600
For example, feet-washing
in a massage parlor.

775
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,360
What I do in Victoria
can be the easiest work.

777
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:51,560
Fried rice noodles.

778
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,630
I even sold fried rice noodles.

779
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,630
You did?

780
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,470
You don't believe it?

781
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,190
My mother used to sell that.

782
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:07,520
A snack car of two square meters,
a pan, and a gas tank.

784
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,560
My mother stood in there and cooked.

785
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,000
Every day after school,

786
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,150
I helped her, too.

787
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,560
She led a life, pinching and scraping,
just to afford my education.

789
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,000
She even used the cheapest gas tanks.

790
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
From private sellers.

791
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,910
One day after school,

792
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:26,470
I didn't see her.

793
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:33,000
When I ran into the hospital,
all the skin over her body

795
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,560
had been burned.

796
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,040
The gas tank exploded.

797
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:50,560
So, now, how's she?

799
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:56,710
She drank some pesticide and died.

800
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,320
We couldn't afford
high medical expenses.

801
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:09,950
I'm sorry.

802
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:10,840
Come on.

803
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,840
It has nothing to do with you.

804
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,600
Why did you apologize?

805
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,280
Worse than what my mother cooked.

806
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,230
Since then,

807
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:30,230
I've been reminding myself
that I can't die from poverty

809
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,470
just like my mother.

810
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,390
Oh, why did I tell you this?

811
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:47,710
Drink.

812
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:03,670
Do you know how I felt
when I first met you?

814
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,710
How?

815
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:14,950
I was thinking that one day,

817
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:16,630
I would be you.

818
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:22,360
I would wear pretty dresses
and get love from people.

820
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,360
If you were me,
you wouldn't think like this.

822
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:43,230
Your stories can be told,

823
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:48,040
but mine can't.

824
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,120
Shen Mo, are we friends?

826
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,040
Yes, of course.

827
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,950
Then when you want to tell your stories,

829
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,800
I'll be all ears.

830
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,120
OK.

831
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:28,430
Shall I go with you?

832
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:57,390
It's too late.

833
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:58,520
I should go back to my dorm.

834
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,710
Not until you drink this up.

835
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,430
I'll walk you back.

836
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:08,150
To friendship.

837
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:14,120
To friendship.
