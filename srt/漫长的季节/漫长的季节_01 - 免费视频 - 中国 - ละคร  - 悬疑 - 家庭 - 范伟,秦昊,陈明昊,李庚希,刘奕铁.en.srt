00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,150
Cuts and bruises. No fractures.

209
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,110
All have been taken care of.

210
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,840
He's fine.

211
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,350
Are you his friends?

212
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:48,960
Sort of.

213
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,910
Let me see that.

214
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,000
Sorry, you can't.

215
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,150
Hey, Miss, when will your shift be over?

217
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,000
It depends.

218
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,150
Where do you live?

219
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,000
Don't get me wrong.

220
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,320
It's hard to get a cab in the evening.

222
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,960
We can friend each other on WeChat.

223
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,760
I can pick you up.

224
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,520
Why should I let you?

225
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,110
I work for the taxi company.

226
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,590
Don't worry.

227
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,640
I'm kind of a public servant, too.

228
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,470
Is there a discount?

229
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,840
You bet!

230
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,440
Sounds good.

231
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,320
Should I scan your code or you do it?

232
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,470
I've got mine.

233
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,960
You do it.

234
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,230
That's a nice photo of you.

235
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,230
Not retouched?

236
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,280
No.

237
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,550
Are you gonna scan it or what?

238
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,110
Sure.

239
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,110
Come on.

240
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,910
Let me see.

241
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,230
Scanning it now.

242
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,590
All done.

243
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,840
OK.

244
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,790
You got it?

245
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,880
Accept my request.

246
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,590
Yeah, yeah, sure.

247
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,880
You were so slow!

248
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,150
It was too loud.

249
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,760

You've emptied the whole plate
so quickly!

Here you go.

It's the correct number.

261

I don't understand!

262
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,590
Why did the victim run away?

263
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,670
In case they paid his medical bill?

264
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,110
Excuse me.

The victim's gone.

268
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,470

Lin Muhua.

Yep, we can't find him
when his name is an alias.

There's more than one way to Rome.

It's hard to find that guy,
but not the car.

288

You're stoned and overconfident.

290
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,000
Even the cops can't find it.

291
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,790
How could you?

292
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,110
It's just a fake-licensed car.

293

Don't forget what we do.

294

Hualin isn't too big.

295
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,150
We'll find it.

296
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,350

Once you see that plate
or a yellow sticker

307
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,880
on the back of his car,
call me immediately.

309
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,670
Hit it if you spot the car.

310
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,590
I'll pay for the repair.

Not you.

316

You forgot to turn at that corner.

I'm needed elsewhere this afternoon.

Go ahead then.

You do it!

Why me? I've got mine.

343
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,760
You almost ripped my jacket.

That's a smudge.

345
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,520

She used to sell cold noodles
behind our factory.

I liked your spicy bellflower root
and ordered it a lot.

358

Are you still running the shop?

359
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,830
Not me, my mom's doing it.

360
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,880
Did you touch my insulin pen?

361
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,350
Of course not!

362
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,040

How's your business?

364
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,160
That braised bone shop across the hall
has developed a chain.

366

A chicken rib used to be 2.5 yuan,

I'm good.

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,430
I'm on a diet.

371
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,590
Whip something up yourself.

372
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,590
I'd like a bowl of noodles.

373
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,640
Fry some scallion. Easy-peasy.

374
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,640
I'm busy.

375
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,470
Make whatever you like.

376
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,230
I'm drained after driving all day.

378
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,190
Hurry up.

379
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,640
How are your eyes?

380
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,040
Not too bad.

381
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,400
Bad weather again.

382
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,070
When will it stop?

383
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,280
Liru,
why not open your own beauty salon?

385
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,350
You'll have enough space and less noise.

387
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,800
Already on it.

388
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,070
It's just that the rent is too high.

390
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,070
True.

391
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,110
You'll be working for the landlord.

393
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,880
That's stupid.

394
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,830
Why bother?

395
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,520
I'm trying to make things work
at home for now.

397
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,430
Think long term.

398
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,520
Clients expect good service.

399
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,280
If you do everything at home,
it'll get crowded and loud.

401
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,520
Is the TV too loud?

402
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,040
I'll turn it down.

403
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,760
Sorry.

404
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,000
What?

405
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,920
It's already on mute.

406
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,160
Now, I can't even see the image?

407
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,310
Go pick up some scallion.

408
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,520
Don't you want to have noodles?

409
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,190
I can eat them without it.

410
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,110
Plain noodles are fine.

411
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,470
Go!

412
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,710
I'll finish here in 30 minutes.

414
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,470
Stop talking.

415
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,680
You're annoying.

416
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,400
Take a walk downstairs.

417
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,040
I can't even watch TV at home.

419
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,070
Ms. Xu, are you gonna stay for dinner?

421
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,800
I don't mind.

422
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,040
My pigeons haven't been fed.

423
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,880
That eye is almost done.

424
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,760
It's OK. Don't move.

425
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,470
Keep staying still.

426
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,640
Here you go.

427
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,950
Hey, can you do something
about your pigeons?

429
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,350
Like what?

430
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,920
They're caged.

431
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,430
I mean their poop.

432
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,310
It stinks!

433
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,430
I can't take it!

434
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,350
Pigeons are tiny.

435
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,430
They don't smell.

436
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,590
Besides, their feed is all organic.

437
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,110
I don't smell anything.

438
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,880
Do you have a nose problem?

439
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,000
The roof is a public area,
but look how messy it is!

441
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,190
Can you be less selfish?

442
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,470
The public area belongs to all of us,
including me, right?

445
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,400
My breed is rare.

446
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,350
The zoo doesn't even have it,
and now, you're seeing it for free.

448
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,470
- You're lucky!
- Unreasonable!

449
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,520
No one else is complaining.

450
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,310
Come on.

451
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,400
Eat up.

452
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Don't listen to her.

453
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,470
Wang Bei, what are you doing?

455
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,470
Come here.

456
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,680
Are those packs in the right place?

457
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,710
Seriously, what are you here for?

459
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,800
Did you come without your brain?

460
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,950
Listen, if it happens again,
you'll be fired.

463
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,560
Sorry, Manager.

464
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,400
Fix it.

465
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,470
How can I help you, sir?

466
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,000
Let him do it.

467
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,190
What do you want?

468
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:00,880
Gum.

469
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,640
Two yuan.

470
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,310
No small change?

471
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,070
No.

472
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,470
You can pay with your phone.

473
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,430
Don't know how.

474
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,400
And this.

475
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,760
9.5 yuan.

476
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:36,920
Here you go.

477
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,800
Sir?

478
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,800
I'm paying for it.

479
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,430
Don't you have change?

480
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,800
I don't want to use it.

481
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,110
Here's 100.

482
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,920
Is there a problem?

483
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,760
Can't break it.

484
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,640
Ask others!

485
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,800
What's wrong?

486
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,190
Is everything OK?

487
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,680
Can you break 100 or not?

488
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,160
Sure, no problem.

489
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,190
Do it, Wang Bei!

490
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,310
A word.

491
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,040
Sure.

492
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,310
Let's go.

493
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,760
Yeah.

494
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,160
Stop messing with me, OK?

495
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,950
I won't.

496
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,880
I enjoy seeing you mad.

497
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,520
Come on, Dad.

498
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,190
My manager is watching me.

499
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:40,760
I need to go.

500
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,000
She isn't here.

501
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,880
Take a break with me.

502
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,110
I was testing you.

503
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,400
You gotta be tough outside.

504
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,560
If you can't handle someone like me,
what about those drunkards

508
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,280
or street punks?

509
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,280
I know what to do.

510
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,640
People like you are few.

511
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,640
Really?

512
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,230
Stop. I drew it.

513
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,950
No wonder your manager scolded you.

514
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,520
You did everything but work.

515
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,680
Have you told her
that we're going to Beijing?

517
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,560
We're leaving next week.

518
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,830
I've booked the tickets.

519
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,760
You're going, too?

520
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,470
I can go and take the exam myself.

521
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,350
Been there, done that.

522
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,470
I have to go.

523
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,400
I'll be there with you and you'll
get in the Art Academy in one shot.

525
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,000
You should take some time off.

526
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,070
so that you can study
or practice your drawing at home.

528
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,070
Tell your manager
this is your last week.

530
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,920
So you can't break 100?

531
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,190
I don't believe it!

532
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,350
Your exam won't take too much time.

533
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,070
We can make a travel plan.

535
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,800
List all those places you want to go.

536
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,920
After the exam, we can cover
every corner of Beijing.

539
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,350
You know what?

540
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,680
I do have a few spots in mind.

542
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
That's great.

543
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,110
(Hey, where are you?)

545
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,950
(Come over now!)

546
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,190
Slow down...

548
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,820
(Shengtai Auto Repair)

547
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,710
Are you sure?

548
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,950
357F with a yellow sticker on the back
and a dent mark on the hood.

551
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,000
Is anyone in the car?

552
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,000
See for yourself.

553
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Are there other gates?

554
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,800
Just this one.

555
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:33,950
OK.

556
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,110
That guy's doomed!

557
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,430
Wait!

558
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,430
What are you doing, Biao?

559
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,190
What's the plan?

560
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,950
My plan is to kill him!

561
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,590
You can't!

562
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:43,800
I... I... I...

563
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,590
I can't let him go!

564
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,040
Come on!

565
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,640
Hey, take this.

566
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,560
You don't know where he is.

567
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,760
Don't get all worked up.

568
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,880
Once we're in, you're on your own.

570
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,350
Stop it.

571
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,000
Wait here, you two.

572
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,400
I'll go and take a look.

573
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,640
See how many they are.

574
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,470
Call me if you need backup.

575
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,310
Back.

576
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,070
Don't get in the way!

577
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,590
Back! This isn't a train.

578
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,430
What are you doing?

579
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,800
How clumsy!

580
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,520
Apologies.

581
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,680
I'm old and half-blind.

583
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,430
I knocked it off.

584
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,520
Is this your car?

585
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,350
Mine or others', you gotta pay.

586
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,640
The bumper is off.

587
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,920
No worries.

588
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,310
My insurance will cover it.

589
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,880
Where's the driver?

590
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,470
I'll talk to him.

591
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,950
No need.

592
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,520
You can talk to me.

593
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,470
I...

594
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,470
Sir, the driver just left.

596
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,110
The pipe is still warm.

597
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,590
Who are you?

598
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,880
Can you stop talking?

599
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,590
I'm a nobody, humble as anyone else
but older and clumsier.

602
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,230
Look, give me a grand and you can go.

604
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,190
Wait...

605
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:34,710
Hey,

606
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,430
I have to bust my chops
to make that amount of money.

608
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,710
We can't let the insurance company win,
right?

610
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,310
Give me that guy's number.

611
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,590
I'll negotiate with him,

612
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,350
OK?

613
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,110
His number?

614
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,830
Don't have it.

615
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,160
Then tell me what he looks like.

617
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,880
How old is he, please?

619
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,070
Do me a favor.

620
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,070
Stop the car, Biao!

621
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,040
Get out.

622
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,950
Get out and I'll kill you!

623
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,310
Now!

624
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,680
You almost ran over me!

625
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,760
Awesome!

626
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,280
Xiang is badass!

627
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,190
My cousin-in-law used to drive trains.

628
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,830
That punk is toast.

Clearly, you can drive.

00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,070
Then why did you
hit that guy on the road?

649
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,230
Stay put.

650
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
The door's stuck.

651
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,950
You can't open it from the inside.

652
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,560
Let me help you.

653
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,070
Your shoe!

654
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,350
Go ahead!

655
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,110
Keep going!

656
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,430
Here you go.

657
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,430
Put on your shoe!

658
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:01,040
Stop it
and I'll put in a good word for you

660
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,640
at the police station.

661
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,310
You rat!

662
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,040
Kid's got skills!

663
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,380
(Qiaoyun Massage)

664
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,560
Right there. Easy.

665
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,800
Are you still young?

666
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,680
Act your age!

667
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,470
A car chase?

668
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,190
Really?

669
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:00,880
Had he seen you were alone, stopped the car,
and fought you, what would you do?

673
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,070
He's guilty of using a fake license.

674
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,880
I'm not afraid.

675
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,560
Good prevails over evil.

676
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,040
Biao bought the car,
so let him handle it.

678
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,710
You stay out of this mess.

679
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,590
Him?

680
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,160
He has more bark than bite.

681
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,760
He can't do anything.

682
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,040
Whoosh! I drifted and stopped
that punk's car.

685
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,920
I picked up a stone
and meant to whack him, you know?

688
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,070
I thought

689
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,800
I had him for good.

690
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,880
But he slipped out from the back.

691
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,310
He was good.

692
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,110
Then he ran straight into the cornfield.

693
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,070
Your feet.

694
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,950
I like such smell.

695
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,880
The smell of what?

696
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,760
Disinfectant.

697
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,070
Loved it when I was a kid.

698
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,760
It makes me feel safe and secure.

700
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,310
Use chopsticks.

701
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,680
You got nothing to eat at home again?

702
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,590
Noodles with fried scallion.

703
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,680
Don't like it.

704
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,710
Too greasy.

705
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,830
So what are you gonna do?

706
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,310
What else can I do?

707
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,280
Both the driver and the victim are gone.

708
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,680
Gotta leave it to the Traffic Police.

709
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,430
Did you ask Xiang?

710
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,160
He can talk the talk.

711
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,830
That's it.

712
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,400
Pack your staff and go to Beijing
with Wang Bei for his exam.

714
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,560
You've got a pension.

715
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,230
Why not sit and relax at home
and mind your own business?

717
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,560
If I were you,

718
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,070
I'd close this shop.

719
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,000
People are complicated.

720
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,280
You're fine when you have things to do.

722
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,830
And you're uncomfortable
when there's none.

723
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:37,950
What are you doing?

724
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,280
Get down.

725
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,400
I'll give you another rub.

726
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,560
Spread your arms.

727
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,520
Oh, OK.

728
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:59,110
If you're tired,
you can stay the night here.

731
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,310
Can't you show a little compassion?

732
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,470
Go home and ask your wife for it.

733
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,320
The thing about marriage, well,
it's not that simple, you know, Xuelu?

737
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,950
My weakest spot of all
is that I'm too nice.

740
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,280
You'll see
when we know each other better.

741
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,360
I'll pass.

742
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,560
You're annoying!

743
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:27,950
I'm checking your lunchbox.

744
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,560
The food is cold.

745
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,000
Wait,

746
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,470
I... uh...

747
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,840
My back is sore.

748
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,840
I need to sit up.

749
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,190
Let me sit.

750
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,760
Is everything OK?

751
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,520
What's going on?

752
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,670
Nothing. Let me sit.

753
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,870
I was fine earlier, but now...

755
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,950
Give me a minute.

756
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,800
Let me go get you some soup
from the congee shop nearby.

758
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,870
No, thanks.

759
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,870
Almost done.

760
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,520
Cold food will give you a stomachache.

761
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,430
You don't feel it because you're young.

762
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,630
It'll come back to you when you get old.

763
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,710
You don't need to go!

764
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,430
Be good.

765
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,280
Tomato and egg soup or seaweed soup?

767
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,080
Whatever. Surprise me.

768
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,760
OK.

769
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,360
Be right back.

770
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,150
Lock the door.

771
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,120
Is it closed?

772
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,950
What can I offer you?

773
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,470
Xuelu!

774
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,430
Eat it while it's hot.

775
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,390
Got you a boiled egg, too.

776
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,120
You said that guy got hit
by the fake-licensed car.

778
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,000
Where was he injured?

779
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,600
His leg. Why?

780
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,280
Someone came to buy medicine just now.

781
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,950
He didn't say anything and showed me
what he wanted on his phone.

784
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,840
When he left,

785
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,600
I noticed a slight limp.

787
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,320
And the medicine he asked for
was for trauma.

789
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,760
What does he look like?

790
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,390
He kept his head down,
so I didn't get a good look.

792
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,600
But I snapped a photo of his back.

794
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,630
Look.

795
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,500
The two drugs he needs are out of stock.

796
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,080
I got his number to contact him later.

797
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,760
Send me the photo.

798
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,190
Night shift again?

799
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,520
Isn't it better to study at home?

801
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,040
I can do that at work.

802
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,390
Few people come at night.

803
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,390
Give me a voice call when you get there.

804
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,470
Let me know.

805
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,840
Got it.

806
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,800
Go back to sleep, Dad.

807
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,230
(Xiang, Xiang,)

808
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,150
(I found something
at Xuelu's drugstore.)

809
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,670
(A guy came to buy medicine
but acted all sneaky.)

811
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,080
(Xuelu took a photo of him.)

812
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,120
(Take a look.)

813
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,520
(Does he match the victim in the video?)

814
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:15,820
(Chapter 2 "Xiang")

815
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,580
(Good morning, everyone.)

816
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,380
(Welcome.)

817

(Welcome to Morning News)

820

(The Asian financial crisis keeps spreading
and deepening...)

821
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:47,820
(Hualin General Steel Works 1998)

822
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,520
Where are your manners?

823
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,600
Can't hold it!

824
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,870
It's gonna explode!

825
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:56,470
Go ahead.

826
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,230
Do it and my spot is yours.

828
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,800
The driver is always the boss.

829
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,390
Be careful, Mr. Wang.

830
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,150
I'm dying!

831
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,710
It's coming out!

832
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,230
So that guy's gone?

833
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,560
Afraid so.

834
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,520
No wonder those coking coal shops
are so quiet these days.

836
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,320
After that Hong Kong businessman left,
the furnaces were shut down.

838
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,600
They're staging a strike.

839
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,390
Mr. Wang, is everything gonna be OK?

841
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,630
Why not?

842
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,430
Hualin Steel isn't any factory.

843
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,600
Others might close, but not us.

845
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,760
Don't worry.

846
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,840
Stop yapping.

847
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,430
Come and rub my back.

848
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,600
Enough!

849
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,190
Come out now!

850
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,000
Stop yelling.

851
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,120
Will it solve anything?

852
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,560
Listen, get out of here.

854
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,950
File your complaints
via proper channels.

856
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,520
Like that will work!

857
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,630
Where's the head of the shop?

858
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,520
We demand a solution!

859
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:04,910
Yes!

860
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,760
That's right!

861
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,800
- Calm down, guys.
- Yes, come on!

862
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,950
We can talk it over,

863
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,950
OK?

864
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:10,830
That's him!

865
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,430
Settle down.

866
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,230
There he is.

867
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,630
Come out.

868
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,600
No more hiding.

869
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,360
Come.

870
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,360
Come here.

871
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,040
Is this your director?

872
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:25,520
Yes!

873
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,230
It's him.

874
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,800
He's the guy!

875
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Alright. Be quiet.

876
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,150
Go ahead.

877
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,320
Talk to them.

878
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,870
Calm down and listen.

879
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,870
Management said
we'll resume when the material arrives.

881
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,040
Resume?

882
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,910
Don't fool us!

883
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,390
Without that businessman,
we won't have any material.

884
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,910
We'll find him.

885
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,520
You have to trust the police.

886
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,670
My name is Ma Desheng.

887
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,390
Now, I'm in charge of this case.

888
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,120
Whatever.

889
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,320
Your name means nothing!

890
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,950
Shut up, or you'll be arrested first!

892
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,470
Come again?

893
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,440
Calm down!

894
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:11,360
Enough!

895
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,040
Back off!

896
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,800
I said back off!

897
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,040
Dumpster diving so early?

898
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:22,040
What a mess!

899
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,800
Check out that pile of trash.

900
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,670
You think you'll strike gold?

901
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,840
We share a community.

902
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,870
Gotta keep it nice and clean.

903
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,390
You're retired, but your morals aren't.

905
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,600
Put everything back when you're done.

906
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,280
Smells OK.

907
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,800
Who's decocting herbs
early in the morning?

909
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,430
I'd like congee after a night shift.

910
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,950
Is this our breakfast?

911
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:18,560
Bitter and yucky!

912
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:23,760
My...

913
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,040
My left lung is aching.

915
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,280
I can't breathe.

916
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,230
Could it be TB,

917
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:30,560
I mean?

918
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,600
You're having all sorts of problems
every day.

920
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,120
Nothing works for you.

921
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:37,710
Where's Wang Yang?

922
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,120
Still sleeping.

923
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,390
Maybe

924
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,230
I should go to the factory hospital
and get an X-ray.

926
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,950
Do you own the hospital?

927
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:44,910
Getting an X-ray?

928
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:46,120
Get me some cucumbers.

929
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,630
Cucumbers for breakfast?

930
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:51,000
My mouth is dry.

931
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,840
When did Wang Yang get home last night?

933
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,280
After midnight, I think.

934
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,520
That black sheep!

935
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:02,630
Wang Yang!

936
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:04,670
Wang Yang!

937
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:12,430
Get up!

938
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,710
What did you do last night?

939
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,230
Nothing.

940
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,000
I hung out with my friends.

941
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:24,120
Your friends
don't hang out with others all day.

943
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,120
Come and eat.

944
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,120
Don't be so lazy.

945
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,320
Go get a plate.

946
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,230
Will that make it taste better?

947
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:42,190
No, but I'll feel better
when eating fried dough sticks from a plate.

950
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,710
Yeah, because you don't wash it.

951
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:46,230
Lazybones!

952
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:47,630
Dig in, Yang.

953
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,910
I'd like some rice with water, Mom.

954
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,470
The sticks are still hot. They're good.

955
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,360
You have to eat water-soaked rice?

956
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,320
It cools me down.

957
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,470
Are you feeling hot?

958
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:03,190
It's autumn already.

959
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,040
Stop eating cold food.

960
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,600
You don't have the palate for it.

961
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,870
What about like father, like son?

962
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:14,950
Back in the day when the factory
was making a killing, they made fat pork

966
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,230
for us to eat at breakfast.

967
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:18,320
I couldn't have enough of it.

968
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:25,150
My eyelid's twitching. Yikes!

969
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,800
Does it say conjunctivitis
or a bad omen?

971
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,360
First, TB, and now, conjunctivitis?

973
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,390
You're fine.

974
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,670
That thing in your heart is worth
a Santana, more than this building's worth.

977
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,190
Knock it off!

978
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,080
Like I want it.

979
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,840
Would any healthy people
want stents in there?

981
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,560
And they cost tens of thousands!

982
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,600
Do I want to spend it?

983
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,600
I'm sick of you nagging all morning.

984
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,190
Are you done? What's your point?

985
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:52,320
Will you stop?

986
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,560
Don't be mad.

987
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,760
It's bad for your heart.

988
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,910
If that "Santana" of yours breaks down,
so will I.

990
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,470
When will we be reimbursed
by the factory for the stents?

992
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,670
They've been holding it back for years.

993
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,630
It's been so long.

994
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:08,950
Are they still gonna pay us?

995
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,840
Listen, a giant like Hualin Steel
won't be so cheap.

998
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,390
You're worrying too much.

999
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,390
I'm done.

1000
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,000
You've barely touched it.

1001
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:23,600
Where are you going?

1002
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,150
Out for a walk.

1003
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,230
I need some space.

1004
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,280
What's wrong with the kids these days?

1005
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,280
He needs more space?

1006
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:30,840
There's plenty at home.

1007
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,800
Back then, my family had to make do
in a 16-square-meter hut.

00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:38,840
And yours, was it

1012
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,600
14 square meters?

1013
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:42,600
Isn't your mouth dry?

1014
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,150
Come on, finish the cucumbers.

1016
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,000
Shush.

1017
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:15,910
Today's your lucky day.

1018
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,600
The meat is all yours.

1019
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,390
You'll have a feast.

1020
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:34,910
Come here!

1021
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:35,870
Come on!

1022
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:38,760
Stand straight.

1023
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,710
Did you hit me?

1024
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,040
No.

1025
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,190
Come again?

1026
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:49,710
It's fine even if it was you.

1027
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,120
You were aiming at
that director behind me, right?

1029
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:55,840
Your precision was way off.

1030
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,560
So what did you use?

1031
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,910
A self-made slingshot?

1032
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,520
Impressive!

1033
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,630
You meant to be a hero?

1034
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,760
Which shop is your dad in?

1035
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,870
Coking coal?

1036
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,280
Now, you're scared?

1037
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:18,710
We'll take your slingshot.

1038
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:22,000
But next time...

1039
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,430
Next time,

1040
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,320
I'll tell your dad to come and get you.

1041
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:33,190
Off you go.

1042
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:34,840
Wait!

1043
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:39,430
Give it back.

1044
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,080
Work on your skills.

1045
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,470
So naughty!

1046
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,040
I was more of a guard
than a police officer.

1048
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:51,080
Are you OK?

1049
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:51,670
I'm good.

1050
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:52,320
I need to head back.

1051
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,520
You stay and watch.

1052
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:55,040
Is there a new case?

1053
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,190
I'll go with you.

1054
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,470
Li Qun can run point.

1055
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,470
Can he?

1056
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:00,910
Yeah.

1057
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:01,910
Of course.

1058
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:03,910
Step back! Back off!

1059
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,470
Guys, listen, listen to me!

1061
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,320
Look, listen,

1063
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,000
I've contacted your manager,

1064
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,670
OK?

1065
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,800
He will take care of everything...

1066
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,000
Li Qun, Li Qun, stay with them!

1068
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,150
Keep a close watch!

1069
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,080
He'll be here soon,

1070
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,760
OK?

1071
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:25,630
Stop pushing!

1072
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:26,190
Yes, you!

1073
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:37,840
Wang Xiang!

1074
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:40,280
Wang Xiang!

1075
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,430
Hey, wake up.

1076
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:46,910
Wake up!

1077
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,760
What now? I just dozed off.

1078
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:53,190
Go and take a look.

1079
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:54,390
Why?

1080
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,360
I heard the police cars coming.

1081
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,150
I'm nervous.

1082
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,840
Why? You didn't do anything wrong.

1083
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,040
Listen.

1084
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,390
It's still ringing.

1085
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,560
Hey, you're everywhere, aren't you?

1086
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,760
Is that your kid?

1087
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:10,430
Such things aren't for kids.

1088
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:11,360
Just go.

1089
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,000
Coming through.

1090
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,520
Step aside.

1091
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,320
Stay back.

1092
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:16,600
Hey, dude.

1093
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:17,360
What?

1094
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:18,710
I mean Jianchun,

1095
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,950
Section Chief Xing, what's going on?

1097
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,840
Why?

1098
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,080
I don't need to report to you.

1099
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,630
Do you remember

1100
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:30,520
I'm an elected vigilante?

1101
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,710
Oh, give me a break!

1102
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:32,670
You're elected?

1103
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:33,710
When?

1104
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,120
Where's your certificate?

1105
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:36,360
And the armband?

1106
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,840
Don't need one.

1107
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,150
I know my duty.

1108
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:40,230
Step back.

1109
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:40,600
You should leave.

1110
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,000
Excuse me.

1111
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:43,950
Is there anyone
with the Security Section?

1113
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:44,470
Right here.

1114
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:46,230
I'm the Section Chief,

1115
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:46,910
Xing Jianchun.

1116
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:47,800
Hello, sir.

1117
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:49,630
Perfect.

1118
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:50,560
Let's go inside the house.

1119
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,800
And I need to ask you a few questions.

1121
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,760
Go inside?

1122
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,040
Is there blood in the house?

1123
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:00,800
I... I... Well...

1124
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,760
It's...

1125
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,230
it's not like I'm scared,
but when I see blood,

1127
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,080
I get dizzy.

1128
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:06,280
And you're working in Security?

1129
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,040
It's not like every day...

1130
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,360
May I help you, officers?

1131
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,430
Who are you?

1132
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,800
He works here as an engine driver
and an elected vigilante.

1135
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,230
He's legit.

1136
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,910
He can help you.

1137
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:22,670
Fine, let's go.

1138
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:23,170
OK.

1139
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,190
So you're...?

1140
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:26,800
Wang Xiang,

1141
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,630
"Xiang" as "loud".

1142
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:51,670
Come here.

1143
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:56,560
Captain Ma, here he is,
an elected vigilante by the factory.

1147
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:02,910
Where are you going?

1148
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:04,320
The scene is off-limits.

1149
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,150
Stay here.

1150
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:05,470
Yes, sir.

1151
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,000
He's not in Security?

1152
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,470
No.

1153
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,320
That guy can't see blood.

1154
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,430
Oh, let me introduce him to you.

1155
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:22,870
Captain Ma of the Criminal Police Unit
under the Public Security Bureau.

1157
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,390
Hello, Captain Ma. Wang Xiang here.

1158
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,000
Is that a bruise?

1159
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,670
I'm going in.

1160
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:36,470
Captain Ma, from now on,
we're on the same side.

1164
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:37,910
Let me know if you need anything.

1165
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:40,280
Please, make yourself at home.

1167
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:43,840
Is that evidence? What case is it?

1168
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,520
How bad?

1169
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,040
Dismemberment. Bad enough for you?

1170
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,870
How much did you eat?

1171
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:25,000
I'm good.

1172
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,430
I'm fine.

1173
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:30,760
Just having the seasonal flu.

1174
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,320
The wind makes me sick,
but it's temporary.

1176
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:38,560
How long have you been working here?

1177
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:45,390
I started at 18 to take my dad's post.

1179
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:46,950
It's been 30 more years.

1180
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,280
Occupation?

1181
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,080
Engine driver.

1182
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:52,800
Driving trains for the factory?

1183
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,710
You're a big shot.

1184
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,560
Well, they do respect me.

1185
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,280
Are you familiar with this area?

1186
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:57,600
Yes.

1187
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,150
We've got six living quarters here.

1189
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,280
This is the first one
with some 20 buildings of four stories.

1191
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,760
This is Building 4.

1192
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,040
I live in Building 6.

1193
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,120
And that lady...

1194
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,800
Sun Guilan, a retired worker.

1196
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:19,560
Her kids live in the provincial capital,
so she's here alone.

1198
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:24,000
She goes through trash a lot
to find things to sell.

1200
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I've told her off more than once.

1201
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:27,520
You told her off?

1202
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,150
You see,

1203
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:31,000
I'm also an elected environmentalist.

1205
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:38,630
Alright.

1206
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:41,800
They'll give you my pager number.

1208
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,320
If there's anything new,
just let me know.

1210
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,360
I'm Ma Desheng. Thanks for your help.

1211
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,120
Coming through!

1212
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,390
Make a way!

1213
00:56:59,390 --> 00:56:59,950
Step aside.

1214
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,800
Easy, easy. Make a way!

1215
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,120
You took one for the team?

1216
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,040
Was the killer still there?

1217
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:10,800
Not that bad.

1218
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,470
Don't worry.

1219
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,280
Enough.

1220
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:12,840
Stop talking.

1221
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,560
You almost puked your lungs out.

1222
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,080
Come on!

1223
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,280
Let's go. To the ambulance!

1224
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:15,670
Come on!

1225
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:18,840
Oh, hey, aren't you in Security?

1227
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,470
Go with him.

1228
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:22,600
I'm needed here.

1229
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:24,280
This is a major case.

1230
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,190
As the head of Security,

1231
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,080
I gotta stay and protect others.

1232
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:27,870
What to do?

1233
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,360
Hey, you, Factory Affairs Office, right?

1234
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,120
Go with him.

1235
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,430
I like the smell of disinfectant.

1236
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,520
It's good.

1237
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,000
Really?

1238
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,800
I liked it when I was little.

1239
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,840
I went to the hospital
with my mom a lot.

1240
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,230
Such smell is soothing.

1241
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:57,430
Is that

1242
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,630
D5W?

1243
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,280
You studied medicine?

1244
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,560
No.

1245
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,150
My mom got sick a lot,
so I'm kinda self-taught.

1248
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:08,230
I work in the Factory Affairs Office.

1249
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,080
Gong Biao. They just assigned me here.

1250
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:13,870
You were assigned?

1251
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:14,870
Yes.

1252
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,150
What's your background?

1253
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,630
Bachelor at Hualin Institute of Technology.

1254
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:21,630
My major matches this job.

1255
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,560
Lie down, Mr. Wang.

1256
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,360
You know me?

1257
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,760
Like I said I'm in Factory Affairs
and I saw your name

1259
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,470
in the history of our factory.

1261
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:34,560
Yeah.

1262
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:37,360
I accidentally made a name for myself.

1264
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,600
Lie down.

1265
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,560
You know what happened?

1266
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:41,080
Don't move.

1267
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:46,040
To celebrate International Labor Day,

1268
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:53,800
I, a model worker,
got to meet with our management team

1270
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,840
and officials
of the Municipal Party Committee.

1272
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,390
It was nothing. I almost forgot.

1273
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:58,430
Then lie down.

1274
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:00,910
I got you.

1275
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,800
Oh, Liru, give me the spittoon!

1276
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,710
Are you OK?

1277
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:04,800
Stop talking.

1278
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,390
You're...

1279
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,080
You know each other?

1280
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,230
She's my wife's cousin.

1281
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:11,950
Cousin, you say?

1282
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,560
That's pretty close.

1283
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:15,760
Use this.

1284
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,150
Here you go.

1285
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,560
Are you OK?

1286
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,760
Did you eat something bad?

1287
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,080
I'm good.

1288
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:20,800
Don't worry.

1289
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,870
Just a seasonal gastric disorder.

1290
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,120
Happens only once a year.

1291
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,320
That's manageable.

1292
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,230
Or, it's a disaster.

1293
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,360
Captain Ma.

1294
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:34,630
What do you know?

1295
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:36,320
The body's severely damaged.

1296
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,870
Only fractured bones and limbs
are found.

1297
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:40,710
Preliminary analysis says
the victim is a female at a young age.

Hey!

1305
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:33,840
Freshman?

1306

Yes.

1307
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,560
Which department?

1308
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,710
Nursing.

1309
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,470
Me too.

1310
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:39,560
I'm on the orientation team.

1311
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,000
Are you going to your dorm?

1312
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,560
Come on.

1313
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,150
Follow me.

1314
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:42,670
This way, this way.

1315
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:43,470
No, thanks.

1316
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:43,840
I'm fine.

1317
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,390
Thank you.

1318
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:45,040
Hey!

1319
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:46,910
Wait!

1320
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:56,430
What's so funny?

1321
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,840
What went wrong?

1322
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,430
Was it my hair?

1323
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:14,120
A new semester's begun.

1324
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,040
Are you going back to school or not?

1325
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,520
I won't.

1326
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,560
I'm not built for studying.

1327
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,600
Or, I would've been in college by now.

1328
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,150
Besides, I've looked around.

1329
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:25,190
Going to college isn't that fun.

1331
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:27,280
Then what's your plan?

1332
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:27,910
I'm not sure.

1333
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:29,080
Don't have one yet.

1334
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,670
My cousin's karaoke is hiring waiters.

1336
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,950
You can make some pocket money
instead of doing nothing.

1338
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:36,910
We'll see.

1339
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,630
I'm finally out of school.

1340
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:40,840
I'd like to chill out for a while.

1341
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:53,830
That one.

1342
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,470
She's OK.

1343
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,280
That's my type.

1344
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:01,040
Hello.

1345
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:03,910
Which department?

1346
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:04,760
Pharmacy.

1347
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,080
It's that way. I'll show you.

1348
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,040
Thanks.

1349
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:07,390
Give me that.

1350
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,190
It's OK.

1351
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,080
Excuse me.

1352
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,120
Hello?

1353
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:12,150
Do you know where Building 8 is?

1354
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,600
I'm not a student here.

1355
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:17,630
Thanks.

1356
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,280
Did he harass you?

1357
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,630
No. I was asking for directions.

1358
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:24,120
Are you our student?

1359
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,150
Your school was my first pick.

1361
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:29,840
I've been watching you.

1362
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,000
Go to the Security Office with me.

1363
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,190
- Wait, sir...
- Come on!

1364
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:32,950
Wait!

1365
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:33,950
Hold on!

1366
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:37,150
Hey, may I know your name?

1368
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,430
It's Shen Mo.

1369
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:47,870
Shen Mo...

1370
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,710
Hey, son, let's eat.

1372
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:17,910
Are you cold?

1373
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,280
It's autumn. Put on more layers.

1374
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,600
Let me go get you a heater.

1375
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,000
Alright.

1376
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:33,950
Dinner first.

1377
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:42,910
There's fish, stewed green beans,
and stewed cabbage with vermicelli.

1378
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:45,670
They're all your favorites.

1379
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,870
Let me go get rice.

1380
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,320
Rice with water again?

1381
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:21,600
Son, that guy is back.

1383
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:26,470
I saw him.

1384
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:32,560
I promise that I will finish
what's left undone.
