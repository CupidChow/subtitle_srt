00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,340
=The Long Season 2=

2
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,720
Wait, wait.

3
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,080
You just can't stop vomiting, huh?

4
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,160
You must be sick now.

5
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,960
Feeling any better?

6
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
Don't talk such rot.

7
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,190
Do I look like I'm any better?

8
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,000
At... At Sun Guilan's home,
what on earth did you see?

9
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,470
Don't be nosy.

10
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,160
It's an internal affair.

11
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,440
Internal?

12
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,670
Between you and the police?

13
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,880
The police and civilians are a family.

14
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,800
Haven't you heard of it?

15
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,670
Nonsense.

16
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,910
Bed No. 15.

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,520
Injection time.

18
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Still in the buttock?

19
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,000
That's what scares me.

20
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,550
No cover?

21
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,000
Who would peep?

22
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,000
You, I'm afraid.

23
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,190
Cover me.

24
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,830
Fine, fine.

25
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,750
You turn around.

26
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,520
Come on.

27
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,800
Did I never see it?

28
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,670
Take off your pants.

29
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,270
Come off the bed, too.

30
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,080
Can't you give the injection like this?

31
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,030
I can't!

32
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,750
You have a muscle tension
and how can I give it?

33
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,960
But I would still be nervous.

34
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,550
Wait... Wait a second.

35
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,750
Let me prepare for it.

36
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Turn around, please.

37
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,190
OK. Thanks.

38
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,830
You must be new.

39
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,630
Done.

40
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,360
What? Don't make such a noise.

41
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,550
Or the new nurse would be angry.

42
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,240
Young guys just suck.

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,030
What a manner!

44
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,440
Get me... Get me out of the hospital
so that I'll no longer suffer.

45
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,030
Come on. Be careful.

46
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,360
Raise your leg.

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,390
I can't.

48
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,830
My right buttock aches.

49
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,960
You... You do this.

50
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,030
Follow my move.

51
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,910
Take it slow.

52
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,670
Slow, slow.

53
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,000
I... I can't sit.

54
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,160
Wait.

55
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,670
Who gave me the flowers?

56
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,080
And they're white.

57
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,960
Why didn't he just give me a wreath?

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,080
Gong Biao.

59
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,160
Who?

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,360
The college student who sent you here.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,470
When he came, you were asleep.

62
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,360
He put down the flowers and then left.

63
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,230
Oh, he's a college student.

64
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,350
Then I can understand.

65
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,670
He means I'm as pure as white flowers.

66
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,720
He's a nice young man.

67
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,320
Well-educated and affectionate.

68
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,230
Good.

69
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,480
He's up to something, too.

70
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,550
What are you looking at?

71
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,670
No... Nothing.

72
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,320
I... I came to check on Mr. Wang.

73
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,270
He's in the ward.

74
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,320
How can you find him here?

75
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,600
I came to see if his medicine is ready.

76
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,600
Don't stroll here unless you have to.

77
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,950
Or you would disturb our work.

78
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,110
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,110
It's also bad if others see you here.

80
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,670
I'm... I'm leaving immediately.

81
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,160
Idiot.

82
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,880
I should go.

83
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,270
Who pulled up my flowers?

84
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,100
(Office Building of Hualin
No. 1 General Steel Works)

85
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,320
Hualin Steel has
a glorious history of 50 years.

86
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,070
It can't be ended in our hands.

87
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,230
The shortage of raw material is temporary.

88
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,160
But if spreading rumors

89
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,000
(Song Yukun)
to disturb the production is a crime.

90
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Yesterday, some workers caused trouble.

91
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,880
Find them.

92
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,880
Punish them accordingly!

93
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,790
I'm not afraid to offend!

94
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,270
I'm not afraid to crush
those troublemakers, you know?

95
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,920
Who are those troublemakers?

96
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,270
I won't mention their names now.

97
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,830
Lay off some workers and redirect some.

98
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,160
Make a list.

99
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,000
And why do we have to do this?

100
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,640
We're suggesting a piece of information

101
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,110
that we must abolish the
lifetime employment and accept change.

102
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,200
Right?

103
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,350
Accepting change is
the best solution for our factory.

104
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,040
We only do what we think is best for it!

105
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,440
As for recent problems,
do you have any thoughts?

106
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,350
Speak up!

107
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,160
Gong.

108
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,640
Mr. Song,

109
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,760
I have something to say.

110
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,070
Our factory has a problem now...

111
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,390
Get me some more water.

112
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,480
If you don't object,
all branches and departments

113
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,070
should submit the layoff list asap.

114
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,510
Mr. Song, as for what you just said,

115
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,760
I have some ideas.

116
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,270
When you have time, may I...?

117
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,440
Mr. Song,
some police officers have come.

118
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,720
Will you go? They're waiting.

119
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,070
Water, water.

120
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,550
Bring your water.

121
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,790
Go make some good tea in the VIP room.

122
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:00,790
Okay.

123
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,550
I'm Ma Desheng
with the Criminal Police Unit.

124
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,550
I know you.

125
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,480
Director Zhu often talks about you.

126
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,200
You've been keeping order in my factory
these days and I really appreciate it.

127
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,640
Be seated, please.

128
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,390
You know what?

129
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,350
The workers' riot has had
a terrible effect on my factory.

130
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,790
The leaders
has to receive severe penalties!

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,720
Even if you didn't come,

132
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,200
I would go talk to Director Zhu.

133
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,600
I didn't come for this.

134
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,880
I want to talk to you
about the dismemberment case.

135
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,200
I had too many meetings a day
that I muddled it.

136
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,470
How about we talk in the VIP room?

137
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,350
No need.

138
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,960
Just a few words.

139
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,280
The dismembered body
was found in your living quarter, right?

140
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,400
Hope you'll cooperate
with our investigation.

141
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,790
I will.

142
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,110
As much as I can.

143
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,150
I've quit.

144
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,520
Go.

145
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,080
He mentioned a driver.

146
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,760
Who's that?

147
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,710
I'll come to get it next week.

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,470
OK.

149
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,840
Don't forget to handle mine early.

150
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,320
OK.

151
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,910
Thank you.

152
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,440
Liru.

153
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,590
Wang Xiang?

154
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,880
What are you doing out here?

155
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,150
I have something to ask you.

156
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,150
Go ahead.

157
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,200
We're relatives.

158
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
I'll help as much as I can.

159
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,910
Something happened in the living quarter
and you must be aware.

160
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,470
I am, you know, a vigilante.

161
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,320
I offered a little bit help
but ended up in hospital.

162
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,760
Now, our factory doesn't have money
or other support.

163
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,960
Then, I don't want
to take advantage of the government.

164
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,280
What do you want exactly?

165
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,030
I want an early discharge.

166
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,350
Could you please check
how much the bill is.

167
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,000
However much it is,
the factory will pay.

168
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,230
I don't think so.

169
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,440
Your cousin has had her stents
for nearly three years

170
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,760
but we haven't got even a penny yet.

171
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,440
Tens of thousands.

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,110
With this much money,
we can even afford a Santana.

173
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,230
Right?

174
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,320
Wang Xiang.

175
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,440
Cousin.

176
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,790
Come back for the medicine.

177
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,350
Check the bill for me, please.

178
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,960
It was so rude of you.

179
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,280
She's your cousin.

180
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,470
She's dissolute
and that's not family stuff.

181
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,640
How could you say that
about your cousin?

182
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,590
What?

183
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,640
What's wrong?

184
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,550
Oh, no!

185
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,030
You should have added some cold water.

186
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,470
Don't bother. I swallowed it.

187
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,840
No, come on.

188
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,760
I just asked her to check the bill
so that I would be prepared.

189
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,350
The independent accounting is ongoing.

190
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,110
I don't want to be urged for the bill.

191
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,520
But they still owe me for my stents.

192
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,150
That's a different case.

193
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,200
Our bills can't be mixed.

194
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,710
I'm to blame.

195
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,640
My poor body has wasted all our money.

196
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,230
And Wang Yang can't work in our factory.

197
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,000
Stop, stop.

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,840
Don't. Don't.

199
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,910
Don't whine.

200
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,200
If you screw my expensive injection,

201
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,000
I would whine.

202
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,320
Look where we are.

203
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,840
He's up there.

204
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Thanks for your hard work, nurse.

205
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,440
Come on.

206
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:09,880
Right there.

207
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,590
Hualin Steel's future.

208
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,910
Hope you'll recover soon.

209
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,000
Mr. Song has come.

210
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,960
What did he come for?

211
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,110
It can't be anything good.

212
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,790
This way, please.

213
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,320
Wait, wait.

214
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,760
Mr. Song, there he is.

215
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,030
Mr. Song.

216
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,710
You've gone too far.

217
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,520
This ward.

218
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,780
(Multi-share Ward)

219
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,110
Mr. Wang.

220
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,280
Where's Mr. Wang?

221
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,710
I remember this is his ward.

222
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,670
Mr... Mr. Wang.

223
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,110
Mr...

224
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,280
Here I am, Mr. Song.

225
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,520
My spittoon was full.

226
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,110
I was cleaning it.

227
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,230
Mr. Wang, you've set
a good example for our workers.

228
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,790
Mr. Song, what... what did I do?

229
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,670
The other day, a terrifying murder case

230
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,350
happened in the living quarter
of our factory.

231
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,790
At the crucial moment,

232
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,080
Mr. Wang Xiang rushed out to help.

233
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,640
Yes.

234
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,710
I mainly assisted the police...

235
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,440
Don't interrupt.

236
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,150
Please, Mr. Song.

237
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,400
This shows how responsible and active
our workers can be.

238
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,280
Because of that, he was injured
physically and mentally.

239
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,670
Now, he's still vomiting.

240
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,910
Nervous vomiting, actually.

241
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,710
But once he vomits,
he even spits his gall out.

242
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,670
Mr. Song,
can it be a work-related injury?

243
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,230
He didn't shrink back.

244
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,520
Nor did he regret it.

245
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,910
Here,

246
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,520
I'd like to declare something.

247
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,440
Workers of Hualin Steel are brave.

248
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,350
Don't believe rumors or spread them.

249
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,400
Remember.

250
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Whatever happens,
our factory will be your support!

251
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,640
Mr. Song, my medical bill...

252
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,590
My wife means...

253
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,550
First, solidarity.

254
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,470
Second, stability.

255
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,000
Mr. Song.

256
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,880
He sounds quite reasonable.

257
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,440
The honor came so expectedly.

258
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,910
I wasn't prepared.

259
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,550
Even you weren't prepared...

260
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,000
There you are.

261
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,280
Let alone the scared murderer
who is hiding somewhere secret.

262
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,910
Right.

263
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,550
I didn't see you and I thought
you didn't work today.

264
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,590
I was on duty over there.

265
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,840
Why do you look so tall today?

266
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,710
Wedge-soled shoes, huh?

267
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,470
Mr. Wang Xiang, have a good rest.

268
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,960
Okay.

269
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,000
Hope you'll come back to work
as soon as possible.

270
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,350
Our leader has come here
to see Mr. Wang.

271
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:37,790
Take this.

272
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,110
I...

273
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,440
You take it. Come on.

274
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,200
My hands are dirty.

275
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,670
Nurse. Nurse.

276
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,150
Take this.

277
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,200
Give them a hand.

278
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,230
But I...

279
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,030
Hurry.

280
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,550
I can't.

281
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,110
Go ahead. Go.

282
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,080
Come on. Hurry.

283
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,710
Here. Take this.

284
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,960
I'm too shy.

285
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,910
Don't let Mr. Song hold it.

286
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,670
Sorry, sorry.

287
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,150
Here.

288
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,230
We're a family.

289
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,080
Sorry.

290
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,080
A nurse is a warrior, too.

291
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,760
Come on, Mr. Reporter.

292
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,550
Take a photo of us.

293
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,910
Move inside.

294
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,470
Stand close.

295
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,960
Okay.

296
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,910
Come on.

297
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,640
But...

298
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,200
Go away.

299
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,110
Look here.

300
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,440
One, two, three, cheese.

301
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:16,260
(Song Yukun, the factory manager,
paid a caring visit to vigilante Wang Xiang.)

302
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,000
Move over. I'm watching TV.

303
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,440
Come and check if it's straightened.

304
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,080
Just so-so.

305
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,200
Come on.

306
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,200
Walk aside and check it from afar.

307
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,880
OK. It's straightened.

308
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,150
What a huge honor!

309
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,150
In this photo,

310
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,760
Huang Liru's face is even
bigger than yours.

311
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,880
Only half of my face can be seen.

312
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,960
Don't care about such useless stuff.

313
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,590
Why did you compare the faces?

314
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,760
My name here is what really values.

315
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,440
Wang Xiang.

316
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,710
Honor is what we should compare.

317
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,880
Will the murderer see the photo,
and take revenge on you?

318
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,880
Why?

319
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,230
I just told the police
about our living quarter.

320
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,230
If I hadn't, others would have.

321
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,550
I can be recognized, huh?

322
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,030
Yes, almost.

323
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,790
It doesn't scare me, anyway.

324
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,030
Get Wang Yang here to learn his lesson.

325
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,230
He's asleep. Keep your voice down.

326
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,590
These days,
why does he go to bed so early?

327
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,640
Wang Yang.

328
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,760
Come down.

329
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,310
In a second.

330
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,060
(The police should serve the people.)

331
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,000
Some workers offered information.

332
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,800
Take a quick investigation.

333
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,560
Hualin Steel has thousands of workers.

334
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
If they make trouble, we can't handle that,
how many officers we have.

335
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,880
As for that information,
we made a preliminary check.

336
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,560
The businessman from Hong Kong
has been providing raw material

337
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,040
for Hualin Steel.

338
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,640
But he hasn't shown up this month.

339
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,760
Sintering and steel-making have stopped.

340
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,590
So, the workers are getting inflamed.

341
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,950
Is it possible
that he decamped with all the money

342
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,190
and is now eloping everywhere
with his mistress?

343
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,710
You know, it's quite common.

344
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,070
You think it's a novel?

345
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,160
Eloping?

346
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,190
Any evidence?

347
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,590
Just guess, huh?

348
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,040
Come on.

349
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,800
What do you say, Captain Ma?

350
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,350
Ma Desheng.

351
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,350
Ma Desheng.

352
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,760
Go on with the meeting.

353
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,950
What's this?

354
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,680
The whole night,
you've been absentminded.

355
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,950
Did you hear what I just said?

356
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,920
I'm trying to think in some other way.

357
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,640
About the dismemberment case
in Hualin Steel.

358
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,070
Today, I checked the missing persons.

359
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,760
These girls

360
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,350
(Registration Form of Missing Persons, Shen Mo)
fit the profile of the dead woman.

361
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,880
Shen Mo isn't back yet?

362
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,640
No. We failed to contact her.

363
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,520
Tell me when she's back.

364
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,000
Your advisor has been worried sick.

365
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,110
Got it.

366
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Can Shen Mo be in trouble?

367
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,310
That's scary.

368
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,040
I can't even fall asleep.

369
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,310
What's wrong with you?

370
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,400
Why are you so quiet?

371
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,710
Nothing.

372
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,400
Did you see Shen Mo these days?

373
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,160
No.

374
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
We're looking for her.

375
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,760
We haven't seen her for days.

376
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,590
She isn't in her dorm, either.

377
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Can she be in danger?

378
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,640
What are the police doing there?

379
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,160
How do I know?

380
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,310
Did they come for Shen Mo?

381
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,000
What are you talking about?

382
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,680
What do you mean?

383
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,280
I just asked. What's the problem?

384
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:51,060
(Victoria
International Entertainment Center)

385
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,280
Come.

386
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,800
Your job can be very easy.

387
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Nothing complicated.

388
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,590
Every morning from half past seven
to nine in the morning,

389
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,310
you play the piano
for one and a half hours.

390
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,070
What songs?

391
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,310
It's up to you.

392
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,000
Foreign, elegant, and classy songs.

393
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,880
How can you play the piano?

394
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,110
Not bad.

395
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,920
I can play most songs.

396
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:25,950
Quite enough.

397
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,280
Do a good job and you'll get tips.

398
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,640
If a guest tips you, take it.

399
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,560
It's yours, then.

400
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,110
Let me show you around.

401
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,230
Within the one and a half hours,
you can't drink water,

402
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,350
go to the toilet, or stop playing.

403
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,710
As for the songs, repeat if necessary.

404
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,640
It doesn't matter,
because nobody really listens.

405
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,350
What we want is the feeling.

406
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,710
I mean, make it classy, you know?

407
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,590
Yes, Mr. Ge.

408
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,400
I get it.

409
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,880
For one night,

410
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,920
I'll try not to repeat the songs.

411
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,160
Think of me as your brother.

412
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,470
Ge.

413
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,160
What are you doing here?

414
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,400
Have you cleaned this room?

415
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,280
Hurry.

416
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,710
Why are you still on the phone?

417
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,920
You'll have to work soon.

418
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,000
Dress yourselves up.

419
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,640
What are you staring at?

420
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,400
Come on in.

421
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,590
Having a job through college
can be a good thing.

422
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,590
But...

423
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,400
Are you really a college student?

424
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,560
School just started.

425
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,190
This is my student ID.

426
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,880
I'm a freshman
at Hualin Health Vocational College.

427
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,590
Student ID isn't convincing.

428
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,710
I can tell it from your face.

429
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,710
Our place is quite upscale.

430
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,760
So, your look...

431
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,070
I mean, how you're dressed...

432
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,520
You...

433
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
You should accord with us.

434
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,350
Come over here.

435
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,040
Come on.

436
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,830
Your legs are straight.

437
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,830
Why do you wear pants?

438
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,470
I'm used to pants. Quite handy.

439
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,830
But they don't look pretty.

440
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,110
We offer uniforms.

441
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,680
See?

442
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,430
Continental dresses.

443
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,310
They're gorgeous.

444
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,640
If you wear that dress,
you'll look way better.

445
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,560
Let me take your size.

446
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,430
One hand span.

447
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,070
Two.

448
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,110
Three...

449
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,680
Ge,

450
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,590
I'll measure it myself.

451
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,560
You're too thin.

452
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,110
I'm afraid the dress is too big for you.

453
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,680
Let me take your chest measurement.

454
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,160
See how...

455
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,800
Don't.

456
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,230
Annoyed?

457
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,640
This is an entertainment place.

458
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,590
Without an entertainment spirit,
how could you work?

459
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,560
What...

460
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
What can I really do to you?

461
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,640
Sorry, Ge.

462
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,230
Then can I work here?

463
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,000
One pair of aces.

464
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:34,950
Four of a kind.

465
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,280
Sorry.

466
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,760
Shuffle the cards.

467
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,280
Haven't you been reading
the newspaper the whole morning,

468
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:44,880
Mr. Wang?

469
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,520
He finally managed
to be in the newspaper.

470
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
He has to read it many times.

471
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,000
Is the dead woman one of our workers?

472
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,830
Even the police don't know.
Who else knows?

473
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:56,950
Deal the cards.

474
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,190
Hello, Locomotive Dept.

475
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,070
Okay.

476
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,920
No raw material.

477
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,590
We can knock off.

478
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,800
Let's go home.

479
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,000
- Don't move.
- Wake up.

480
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,920
- Pay the bills first.
- Time to knock off.

481
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,590
Keep the accounts.

482
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,400
Don't do that.

483
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,000
For some money, people would even kill.

484
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:28,590
Pay me.

485
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,470
Let me go.

486
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,310
What are you doing?

487
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,000
Behave yourselves.

488
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,920
This is the workplace.

489
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,590
Mr. Wang, how about a rubdown?

490
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,800
No.

491
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,350
I didn't move at all.

492
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,520
Quanli, what did you do last night?

493
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,310
You look so sleepy.

494
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,470
Having a great time with your wife?

495
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,110
Your wife Li Qiaoyun

496
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,190
has gone to the Factory Affairs Office
with some other women.

497
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,230
Don't you get her back?

498
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,800
Stop the sarcasm.

499
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,590
Male workers in our factory can't even be
as brave as a wonderful woman.

500
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,640
I should go.

501
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,520
Why can he be so proud?

502
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,880
When the train doesn't work, he isn't
even as valuable as the coin in my hand.

503
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,430
Could you ever shut up?

504
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,830
Make way!

505
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,470
What's the fuss again?

506
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,710
Too crowded to move.

507
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:30,830
Stop quarreling.

508
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,710
What's the problem?

509
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,190
Come out. You.

510
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,520
Man, why do you keep yelling?

511
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,590
Put down the stick!

512
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,430
Making trouble, huh?

513
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,590
Beating someone
is a violation of laws, you know?

514
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,710
We don't beat anyone.

515
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,590
We want the list.

516
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,070
What list?

517
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,040
The layoff list.

518
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,830
We've been working for a lifetime.

519
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,680
Why can he fire us as he wishes?

520
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,110
Who would fire you?

521
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,760
All you can do is make trouble.

522
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,880
Didn't you hear?

523
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,640
Your director just explained this.

524
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,950
Your work is suspended
because of the businessman of Hong Kong.

525
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,880
What does it have to do
with the layoff thing?

526
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,070
Don't try to fool us.

527
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,760
We all know Mr. Song's relationship
with that businessman.

528
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,310
Four furnaces are stopped now!

529
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,470
Even the factory may close down!

530
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,430
All right. Stop arguing!

531
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,350
If everyone solved the problem
in his own way, there would be a total mess.

532
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:18,640
For this solution,
we have to take your leaders back

533
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,160
and get to know what exactly happened.

534
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,230
Go. Take him away.

535
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,230
Don't crowd here.

536
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,400
Clear away.

537
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
Stop the fight.

538
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,590
I even sprained my ankle.

539
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,310
Go.

540
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,710
You can't go!

541
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,050
You just can't!

542
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:32,880
Don't touch me!

543
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,680
- I know you guys.
- You can't leave!

544
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,560
Weight workers, huh?

545
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,190
If there's a layoff list,
you would be the first!

546
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:36,880
How dare you mess with me!

547
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,430
Let go of me!

548
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:42,830
Excuse me.

549
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,920
Excuse me.

550
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,920
Why are you back?

551
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,680
I told you
that you couldn't get the medicine.

552
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,710
I had the operation two years ago
and I've been taking medicine

553
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,280
from this dispensary.

554
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,560
Why can't I take any today?

555
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,800
I warn you.

556
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,190
If you dare to cut my medicine,

557
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,470
I'm gonna kill myself.

558
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,040
Believe it or not.

559
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,710
Ms. Luo, scaring me won't help.

560
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,230
If you want some medicine,
you need Mr. Song's signature.

561
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,830
Without it, I couldn't give you any.

562
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,400
I don't mean to owe you the money.

563
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,000
But I haven't been paid
for my operation yet.

564
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,230
The factory owes me this.

565
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,230
I don't mean to owe you.

566
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:13,520
All right.

567
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,190
Understand?

568
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,710
Look.

569
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,520
Enough.

570
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,880
Don't bother to say this.

571
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,400
What?

572
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,470
Isn't this still the hospital
of Hualin Steel?

573
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,760
You know what?

574
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,230
I've devoted my youth to Hualin Steel!

575
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,070
But now,

576
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,880
I can't even afford the medicine!

577
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,470
How could you

578
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,640
(Dispensary)
bully me like this?

579
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,920
How unreasonable you are!

580
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
What's the problem, Cousin?

581
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,590
What happened?

582
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:35,760
Look.

583
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,710
I have the accountant's signature.

584
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,590
So far,

585
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,830
I haven't been paid for my operation yet.

586
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,280
He doesn't even give me the medicine now!

587
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,950
Then my stents wouldn't work!

588
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,590
Calm down.

589
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:43,950
Come on.

590
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,040
Why must you be so angry?

591
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,880
They're being such a bully, you know?

592
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,560
Your blood pressure may rise later.

593
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,680
Your heart beats so fast.

594
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,710
Wait here.

595
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,710
Just a second.

596
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,310
I feel dizzy.

597
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,880
Zhang, sorry for that.

598
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,800
That's my cousin.

599
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,680
It won't help.

600
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,310
Rules are rules.

601
00:28:59,310 --> 00:28:59,830
I know.

602
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,430
Well, you...

603
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,920
Fine. Just this once.

604
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,950
Thank you.

605
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,590
It's OK.

606
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,350
- Thank you.
- Take it.

607
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,350
Keep it between us.

608
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:12,950
I know.

609
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,430
Cousin, come on.

610
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,230
Take the medicine.

611
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,640
Later,
let's figure out another solution.

612
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,710
Don't be angry anymore.

613
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,430
You paid for it?

614
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,710
I didn't.

615
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,710
I have a very low wage.

616
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,040
He didn't flirt with you, did he?

617
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,470
What are you talking about?

618
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,800
Don't imagine things.

619
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,830
He sold the medicine on credit.

620
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,950
Next time you come for the medicine,
you have to pay for it.

621
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,880
All right.

622
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,280
Calm down.

623
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,830
Listen, young man.

624
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,760
When you're still young, do good deeds.

625
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,830
Because you also get old someday!

626
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,470
Stop it.

627
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:40,830
Remember this!

628
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,800
This is the hospital.

629
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,400
Don't shout.

630
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,920
Be careful, Cousin.

631
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,920
Oh.

632
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:08,800
Still working,

633
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,110
Gong?

634
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,590
Director.

635
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,710
The attendance sheet is almost finished.

636
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,950
I'm going home after it's done.

637
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,040
Song didn't ask for me, huh?

638
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,590
I told him you went to the workshop.

639
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,430
Is everything OK, Director?

640
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,000
Yes.

641
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,430
The health needs a new stamp.

642
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,760
But Li Qiaoyun...

643
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,040
I'll give her a good lesson!

644
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,070
Good, Gong.

645
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,470
I observed it.

646
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:33,110
Our office has these young guys
and you're the most enterprising.

647
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,640
You'll have a great future.

648
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,560
This is my job.

649
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,350
Later, lock this in the cabinet.

650
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,280
The leader just signed it.

651
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,000
Keep it to yourself.

652
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,710
Don't worry.

653
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,040
I won't read anything
I'm not meant to see.

654
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,310
Never let anyone see it.

655
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,470
I should go.

656
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,190
Then, I'll sign the attendance sheet
on your behalf, OK?

657
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,350
OK.

658
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,620
(The First Layoff List
of Hualin Steel, 1998)

659
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,070
Eat.

660
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,760
Don't just sit there.

661
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,950
I just ate some.

662
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,590
Well, Gong,
you work in the Factory Affairs Office, huh?

663
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,800
That's right.

664
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,800
What's your job?

665
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,400
I usually help Mr. Song
with the management thing.

666
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,230
So, you're a leader, right?

667
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,710
Not really. Just a middle-level cadre.

668
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,040
You're so young and promising.

669
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,680
Gong, umm...

670
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,070
You know, three years ago,

671
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,160
I had a heart surgery
and it cost thousands of bucks.

672
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,590
But so far, it hasn't been claimed.

673
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,680
Tell me.

674
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,040
Who takes care
of this medical bill thing?

675
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,950
It's something about logistics
that I don't usually bother about.

676
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,830
I'll ask Mr. Song about it later.

677
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,070
Umm, well,
when does Mr. Song usually get off work?

678
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,590
If... If I want to stop him,
where should I go?

679
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,000
Mr. Wang called me, I guess.

680
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,710
He did? No.

681
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,590
Excuse me for a second.

682
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,230
Mr. Wang.

683
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,430
Get back to the sitting room.

684
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
The smoke is choking.

685
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:08,710
It's OK.

686
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,350
Let's chat.

687
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:11,880
Sure.

688
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,760
I love chatting.

689
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,350
Let's do it.

690
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,110
Gong, you're not native, right?

691
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,190
I'm from Shenyang.

692
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,520
See?

693
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,280
You're obviously from a big city.

694
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,400
Shenyang is the economic, cultural,
and political center

695
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,950
of the three provinces in the northeast.

696
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,560
Right.

697
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,640
Are you accustomed to life here?

698
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,350
Yes.

699
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,160
Just starting from the bottom.

700
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,110
That's right.

701
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,560
A real man is always ambitious.

702
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,680
Tonight, I'm gonna
make you some big dishes.

703
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,430
Mr. Wang.

704
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,830
One of the big dishes,
fried pork in scoop.

705
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,350
Go ask around.

706
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,230
Unless at a festival,
who would make such pork for a guest?

707
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,520
The first layoff list has come out.

708
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,110
You're on it.

709
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,230
What?

710
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,800
You're on the layoff list.

711
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,950
Just now, I saw the list in my office.

712
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,630
Me?

713
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,870
Layoff?

714
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,840
You must be joking.

715
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,390
The joke isn't funny.

716
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,560
But the way you say it is funny.

717
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,150
Why would I joke about this?

718
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,190
Mr. Song signed it.

719
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,360
At the workers' assembly next month,
it'll be announced.

720
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,840
Did you clearly see
my name on it, Wang Xiang?

721
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,000
Yes, Wang Xiang.

722
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,230
X-I-A-N-G.

723
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,120
I'm the engine driver
and model worker of 1990.

724
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,230
I'll be laid off?

725
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,190
The pork is burnt.

726
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:58,760
Mr. Wang.

727
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,470
What's wrong?

728
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,000
Think positively.

729
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,870
I'll go and ask Song Yukun.

730
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:10,950
Why? Don't go.

731
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,000
Or you would sell me out.

732
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,190
I risked quite a lot
to tell you about this.

733
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,950
Think about it.

734
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,800
The other day, he called on
other workers to learn from me.

735
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,760
But then he'll lay off me.

736
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,000
What can other workers learn?

737
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,870
The layoff thing?

738
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,150
Don't be angry.

739
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,040
In some cases, Mr. Song made sense.

740
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,040
I really admire him.

741
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:37,910
What did he say?

742
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,120
We should accept change.

743
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,190
Accept it if you wish!

744
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,870
I do a great job as the engine driver.

745
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,910
What change do I have to accept?

746
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,120
Tell me.

747
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,190
Why did you inform me so stealthily?

748
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,390
Did Song Yukun, that rotter,
sent you to tell me in advance?

749
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,000
Who do you think I am?

750
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,520
Can I be that evil?

751
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,710
Speaking of relationships,
you and I must be on the same side.

752
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,870
Who's on the same side?

753
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,840
Tell me the truth.

754
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,600
What are you up to?

755
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,950
Well, let me be frank.

756
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,470
I want you to do me a favor.

757
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,560
Be specific.

758
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,000
I want to get to know Liru.

759
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,630
Closer, I mean.

760
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:23,950
Closer?

761
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:28,950
Gong!

762
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,760
Gong!

763
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,000
Mr. Wang?

764
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,190
What's up?

765
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,630
You want to get closer to Liru.

766
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,560
As her cousin-in-law,

767
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,230
I'm okay with it.

768
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,950
And...

769
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,470
When necessary,

770
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,910
I can bring your messages to her.

771
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,390
I really appreciate it, Mr. Wang.

772
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,280
I should go, then.

773
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,840
Gong, that...

774
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,470
That thing we just talked about.

775
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,560
If...

776
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,080
I mean if...

777
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,120
If I'm really on the list,
under what circumstances

778
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,360
can I be removed from it?

779
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,430
From what?

780
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,120
I mean, from layoff.

781
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:21,840
You work in the Factory Affairs Office
and you know the rules.

782
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,560
Is there any rescue plan or free pass?

783
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,000
There might be some.

784
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,600
A worker who has made
brilliant contributionsor had an award

785
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,360
from a unit of the city-level
or above the city-level

786
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,760
has to be given
adequate attention and protection.

787
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,210
What do you mean by contributions?

788
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,390
If I catch the murderer of the dismemberment
case, is that a contribution?

789
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,190
What murderer?

790
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,190
His face can't even be seen in the photo.

791
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,190
Did you recognize the right guy?

792
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,000
I can recognize him
even when he's skinned.

793
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,000
After he was hit,
why didn't he dare to call the police?

794
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,320
Have you thought about it?

795
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,950
What about we call the police?

796
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,120
That year, I told the police
all that I could say.

797
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,560
What else can I say now?

798
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
Let's catch them, then.

799
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,190
Didn't he kill Xiang's...?

800
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,320
Shut up.

801
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,360
Don't blab.

802
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,600
What is your problem?

803
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,670
I'll shut up, then.

804
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,910
Don't yell.

805
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,910
Xuelu, listen to me.

806
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,950
You text him,
saying the medicine is ready.

807
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,870
Ask him to come to get it.

808
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,560
I'll be waiting here.

809
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,040
Then I'll get him down.

810
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,470
Okay.

811
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,520
Can it really be such a coincidence?

812
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,760
The one who faked my license plate
just hit him?

813
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,760
Catch him and we'll know.

814
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,000
Scared?

815
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,000
Why would I?

816
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,360
I'm gonna skin him, without doubt.

817
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,430
He texted back.

818
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,670
He said he couldn't come now
and asked me to deliver the medicine.

819
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:13,280
Do it.

820
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,430
Ask him for the address.

821
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,190
OK.

822
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,120
Don't worry about me.

823
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,710
I won't be scared.

824
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,040
If he wants to hurt me,

825
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,520
I'll punch him and that's okay.

826
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,390
What are you doing?

827
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,080
Come on.

828
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,320
Drop this thought.

829
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,600
Why does my eyelid
keep twitching today?

830
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,150
Left or right?

831
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,320
The right one.

832
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,520
Is it an omen of misfortune?

833
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,670
Stick a slip of paper on it.

834
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,190
Which side?

835
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,390
The white side.

836
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,360
To stop it from twitching, huh?

837
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,560
We can't follow her anymore.

838
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,190
Or we would be exposed.

839
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,190
What would you like?

840
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,470
I'd like five skewers of potato.

841
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,390
Not afraid of high blood sugar now?

842
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,320
A little risk
can't stop me from living.

843
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,710
That's how you got diabetes.

844
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,600
Don't eat any, then.

845
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,520
I won't.

846
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,840
Just starch.

847
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,910
Why is she getting in there?

848
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,520
She asked us to get in, too.

849
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,470
Shall we?

850
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,470
Yes!

851
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,360
Heat it for me.

852
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:18,910
Where's she?

853
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,670
Let's search separately.

854
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,910
What, Biao?

855
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:27,800
Did she answer it?

856
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,470
She hung up.

857
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,470
Keep searching.

858
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,230
Biao!

859
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,840
Here's a door!

860
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,560
Did he see us?

861
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,360
Where shall we go?

862
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,150
We go separately.

863
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,320
Xuelu!

864
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,320
Xuelu!

865
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,630
Xuelu!

866
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,230
Hu Xuelu!

867
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,120
Xuelu!

868
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:18,910
Hu Xuelu!

869
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,280
Xuelu!

870
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,710
Xuelu!

871
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,630
How can we find her?

872
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,120
We've got no clue.

873
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,190
Something happened.

874
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,520
Xuelu!

875
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,740
(Emergency Center
First Aid)

876
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,470
Remove it.

877
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:30,870
What?

878
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:32,950
The slip on your eyelid.

879
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,760
You asked me to use it.

880
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,120
What the heck!

881
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,950
It didn't work at all.

882
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,190
Did I use the wrong side?

883
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:47,840
Xuelu!

884
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,630
(Operation Room)

885
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,230
Xuelu!

886
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:50,710
Keep your voice down.

887
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,470
This is the hospital.

888
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,150
Doctor, is that Hu Xuelu?

889
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:55,000
Yes.

890
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,520
Doctor, can she live now?

891
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,080
It's hard to tell.

892
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:00,840
Your wife is so badly wounded.

893
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:02,870
She's not my wife.

894
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,470
Then who's her family?

895
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,470
Come with me
and I have something to tell you.

896
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:11,230
Well, then...

897
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:12,760
I... I'll go.

898
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,760
Come on, then.

899
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,470
You wait here.

900
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,880
How did she hit
the high-voltage substation?

901
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,440
I didn't see that.

902
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:29,780
When I got there, she was wounded.

903
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,560
And who are you?

904
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,120
I'm her friend.

905
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:35,280
What about her family?

906
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,950
Her parents are exported workers,
in Korea now.

907
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,470
They can't get back very soon.

908
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,870
Be prepared.

909
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,390
For her death?

910
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,320
Who said that?

911
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,670
You need to repay for ICU deposit.

912
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,190
Get the money ready.

913
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,280
Pay it tomorrow.

914
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,560
How much is the deposit?

915
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,430
What did the doctor say?

916
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,000
Biao, don't be too worried.

917
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,390
We don't know if this is an accident.

918
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,320
But the police will figure it out.

919
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,950
Now, I understand.

920
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,080
Whenever you interfere,
everything goes wrong.

921
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:27,950
To catch the murderer, huh?

922
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:28,950
What murderer?

923
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,390
If you hadn't wanted this,

924
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:31,600
Xuelu wouldn't have been hurt.

925
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,800
Biao, you...

926
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,150
How can we explain this to her parents?

927
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,630
She is so young.

928
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,080
She isn't even married yet.

929
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:39,870
Who would take care of her all her life?

930
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,710
I would.

931
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,710
How could you?

932
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:45,560
What did the police tell you?

933
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,760
Does the man you described really exist?

934
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,470
No one believes you except me.

935
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:52,910
I'm such an idiot.

936
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,710
Where... Where are you going?

937
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:56,870
What else can I do?

938
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:57,520
Going home.

939
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,360
Let me drive you.

940
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,000
No need.

941
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:06,820
(Important place of guardianship
Non-staff members out of bounds)

942
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,280
Xuelu.

943
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,360
Xuelu!

944
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,080
Xuelu!

945
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,600
What's wrong, Biao?

946
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:27,870
You don't have the key?

947
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:28,560
I do.

948
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:29,670
A little bit suffocating in the room.

949
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,760
I came out for some fresh air.

950
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:31,280
Fine.

951
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:42,760
Hello,

952
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:43,560
Dali.

953
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,430
What have you been up to lately?

954
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,120
Do you have spare money?

955
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,760
When did it happen?

956
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,560
But last year,
your father was still very well.

957
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,120
Hello, Xiaofei.

958
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:57,320
Where are you?

959
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,120
Are you flush with money lately?

960
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:01,390
I need some money.

961
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:04,760
You got divorced with no money?

962
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,080
When?

963
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,800
Then let's have dinner someday.

964
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,560
Hello, Shuang.

965
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:14,630
Do you...

966
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:15,840
Do you have Sheng's phone number?

967
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,430
Why can't I get through to him?

968
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,000
He's in prison?

969
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:34,320
Hello, Hao.

970
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,150
This is Biao.

971
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:37,870
Gong Biao.

972
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:40,710
A few days ago,

973
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,520
I bought some pigeons from you.

974
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,870
Can you buy them back?

975
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:44,560
What?

976
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:47,080
90% off the price?

977
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,080
You must be kidding!

978
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,520
I would rather boil the pigeons!

979
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:53,630
You guys keep cooing.

980
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,120
What's the point of that?

981
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:56,600
Other animals have babies.

982
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,120
But you can't even lay one single egg.

983
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:00,560
What? You all took contraceptives?

984
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,670
None of these friends
can be counted on.

985
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,190
Gong Biao.

986
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,000
Gong Biao.

987
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,560
Gong Biao.

988
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:05,360
You're home?

989
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,710
I thought you were out.

990
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:08,910
Where were you last night?

991
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,670
Driving the taxi.

992
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:14,470
And what about the money?

993
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,280
What money?

994
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:19,910
You tell me.

995
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,430
Money in the bankbook!

996
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,120
There was more than 100,000 yuan.

997
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,470
But now, only 3,000 yuan!

998
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,630
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

999
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,950
A couple of days ago,

1000
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:34,390
I met a man who sold a taxi license.

1001
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,630
The taxi and the license
cost 150,000 yuan in total.

1002
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,150
That was quite cheap.

1003
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,630
In this city,
no other license can be this cheap.

1004
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:42,910
Some young guys wanted it, too.

1005
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,760
I decided to buy it first.

1006
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,630
So, I didn't discuss it with you.

1007
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,870
What about my beauty salon?

1008
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,800
I've paid the rent and deposit.

1009
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:57,080
But I think you can offer
such beauty service at home, after all.

1010
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,470
I'll drive the taxi
and save some money this year.

1011
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,190
When the license is worth 200,000 yuan,

1012
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,000
I'll sell it.

1013
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:03,040
By then,

1014
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,000
I can rent a bigger salon for you.

1015
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,040
Once for all, isn't it?

1016
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:13,710
Now that you have your own taxi,
whose night shift did you take?

1017
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:20,800
Where's the taxi?

1018
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:22,670
Don't mention it.

1019
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,670
Shortly after I had it,
the traffic police detained it.

1020
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,280
They said someone faked my license plate
and it's being investigated.

1021
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,430
What bad luck!

1022
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,150
Biao, you've got a talent.

1023
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:34,670
Really.

1024
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,230
You win.

1025
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,080
I've been married to you for years,
but I didn't know you could do this.

1026
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:41,600
Do what?

1027
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:43,390
If a competition was held in Hualin
about making up stories,

1028
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:44,910
you would be the champion, seriously.

1029
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,470
Why don't you believe me?

1030
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:47,870
It's true.

1031
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,670
Ask Wang Xiang if you don't believe it.

1032
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,390
Wang Xiang?

1033
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,910
He's just like you, you know?

1034
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,000
You both tell lies!

1035
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:57,870
I'm done with this.

1036
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,710
Liru.

1037
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:00,840
Liru.

1038
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:04,190
What? Where are you going?

1039
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,320
Live with any other woman you want!

1040
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,000
What are you doing? Don't...

1041
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,190
You're being a terrible bully!

1042
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:09,520
Why are you even crying?

1043
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:10,710
Seriously?

1044
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:13,280
You're breaking my heart.

1045
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:15,760
Do you even have a heart?

1046
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,120
Yes, of course.

1047
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:17,840
Listen.

1048
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,600
It's beating fast.

1049
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:22,040
Stop crying.

1050
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,470
If your eyes are swollen,
the double eyelid operation would be wasted.

1051
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,120
Fine.

1052
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,470
You still have some money, right?

1053
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:35,430
What?

1054
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,430
The other day, you said
you wanted to buy some new machines.

1055
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:39,800
Don't buy them for the moment.

1056
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,360
I want the money for some emergency.

1057
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,150
Not a chance!

1058
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,430
I won't borrow the money.

1059
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:46,080
I won't borrow it, OK?

1060
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,080
Go find any other woman you want!

1061
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,120
Come on. Don't go.

1062
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,800
You sound like
you wouldn't come back anymore.

1063
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,150
You're awake?

1064
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,760
Would you like something to eat?

1065
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:31,840
I had a nap.

1066
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,600
Where are my socks?

1067
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,320
I took them off and washed them.

1068
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,430
They are as hard as rocks.

1069
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:53,910
Why did you sweat so much?

1070
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:54,670
Had a nightmare?

1071
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,710
I didn't sleep very soundly.

1072
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,840
Dad, I feel
you're not doing very well lately.

1073
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:02,520
Is anything wrong?

1074
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,470
Nonsense.

1075
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:07,320
How can you tell

1076
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,430
I'm not feeling very well?

1077
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:12,470
We should go
buy some new clothes for you.

1078
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:15,840
For the interview,
you have to look energetic.

1079
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,230
OK.

1080
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:18,670
Oh, this.

1081
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:20,470
Dad,

1082
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:22,390
I made a travel schedule.

1083
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,080
When we arrive, we can first visit
the art gallery in the Art Academy.

1084
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,190
It's near Huajiadi.

1085
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:35,320
Then we'll visit the
National Art Museum of China on Wusi Street.

1086
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:37,600
And another place...

1087
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:38,630
Here.

1088
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:39,870
But it's a little bit far.

1089
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,520
We can take the subway.

1090
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:47,080
Son, I rescheduled the tickets.

1091
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:49,840
What... What tickets?

1092
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,670
The train tickets.

1093
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:56,360
I think
we can go there just before the exam.

1094
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:57,470
What do you say?

1095
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:59,320
Just before the exam?

1096
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,120
I've got a lot of things to do lately.

1097
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:04,870
Is it OK?

1098
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:08,150
OK.

1099
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:10,670
We can visit those places next time.

1100
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:19,910
Dad, have some porridge.
