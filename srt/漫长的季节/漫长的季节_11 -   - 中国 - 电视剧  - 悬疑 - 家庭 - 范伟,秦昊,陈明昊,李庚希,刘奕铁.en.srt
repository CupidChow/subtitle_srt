(Huangchao Cinema)

3
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,860
(Chlorpromazine Hydrochloride Injection)

4
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,790
Who is it?

5
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,320
Hualin Public Security Bureau.

6
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,440
I'm Ma Desheng.

7
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,790
We met in the bureau.

8
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,440
I remember you. Captain Ma, yeah?

9
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,920
What brings you to Songhe?

10
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,040
I drove by and I'd like to ask you
something else about Shen Mo.

11
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,720
Come on in.

12
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,230
Please.

13
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,110
This way.

14
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,390
Take a seat.

15
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,110
Is that a tiger?

16
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,790
Quite a beast.

17
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,070
Just a cover.

18
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,070
Or a cover for something shady.

19
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,200
I'm joking.

20
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,070
Captain Ma, remember?

21
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,320
Sorry for my abrupt visit.

22
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,070
Make yourself at home.

23
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,760
Do you smoke?

24
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,320
Not anymore.

25
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,200
So, about Shen Mo, when did she
come to live with you?

26
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,760
I've told you last time.

27
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,550
Nine years old, no, before that.

28
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,440
Before she turned nine.

29
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,040
Were you close?

30
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,550
Did you two talk regularly?

31
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,440
We were a family.

32
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,760
Are you nervous?

33
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,640
Not used to having a cop in your place?

34
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,950
Relax. Just making small talk.

35
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,480
How about you stay for lunch and drinks?

36
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,950
No, thanks. I simply dropped by.

37
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,110
The case hasn't been solved.

38
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,550
We're...

39
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,950
We're under pressure.

40
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,320
Was she seeing anyone before
going to college in Hualin?

41
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,390
As far as I know, no.

42
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,160
Impossible.

43
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,720
Which room was hers?

44
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,000
May I take a look?

45
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,320
Do you mind?

46
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,350
Not at all.

47
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,440
Is it this one?

48
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,480
Yes.

49
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,200
No one is using it now.

50
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,670
Yeah.

51
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,550
Since Mo left us,
this room has remained empty.

52
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,040
Nice piano.

53
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,160
Was it for Shen Mo?

54
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,790
It must be expensive.

55
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,440
I treated her as my own daughter.

56
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,720
Have some water.

57
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,550
Have some.

58
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,390
Thanks.

59
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,350
You pampered her so much.

60
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,720
What if she ran into bad guys?

61
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,510
What are you talking about, Captain Ma?

62
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,350
The police like you would protect her.

63
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,220
(Gong Hui (Labor Union))

64
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,270
I remember
you work at No. 2 Textile Mill, right?

65
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,070
Yes. I'm a driver in the labor union.

66
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,520
Let's talk somewhere else.

67
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,520
This bank draft can be cashed
on the 17th which is today.

68
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,960
The bank opens at 9 a.m.

69
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,590
I'll bring a team to cover the inside.

70
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,000
The other two teams
will take the two ends of the road.

71
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,230
We're talking about a fortune.

72
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,000
If he didn't get it the first time,
he'll go there again.

73
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,440
Other than the bank,
the train station, coach station,

74
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,640
and all the other hubs to go in
and out of the city are under our watch.

75
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,280
The suspect
won't be able to get out of Hualin.

76
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,350
Who let you in?

77
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,550
I'm here for Captain Ma.

78
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,470
Mr. Wang.

79
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,740
Wait outside.

80
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,840
Director Zhu, please excuse me.

81
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,710
Go on. Continue.

82
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,840
Captain Ma left for Songhe yesterday.

83
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,520
Did he say when he'd come back?

84
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,520
He'll be back tonight, I guess.

85
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,520
What's up? You can tell me.

86
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,880
I see. Never mind.

87
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,150
Are you sure?

88
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,840
Yeah.

89
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,400
What's that in your jacket?

90
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,470
A bag to pick up groceries.

91
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,000
Is everything OK?

92
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,880
Yeah, it's fine.

93
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,280
You're sweating.

94
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,880
I rushed over. See you.

95
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,590
You can tell me!

96
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,670
I'm fine. Go back.

97
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,200
Yang.

98
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,790
Would you like anything to eat?

99
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,640
I made fried eggs.

100
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,710
Mom,

101
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,710
I don't feel well.

102
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,150
What's wrong?

103
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,350
It's my head.

104
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,710
Did you hit it yesterday?

105
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,470
Let me see.

106
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,790
Did you hit your head?

107
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,840
Have some water.

108
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,880
Let me massage it.

109
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,150
How does it hurt?

110
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,030
Is it throbbing
or the pain goes on and off?

111
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,150
Throbbing.

112
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,640
You didn't sleep well.

113
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,710
Have some eggs.

114
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:43,790
Eat it.

115
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,590
I'm not hungry.

116
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,790
But you...

117
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,230
you haven't had anything.

118
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,110
You must be hungry.

119
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,030
It's OK, Mom.

120
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,150
I'm fine.

121
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,790
You got tied up. I'm worried!

122
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,230
Could you untie me, Mom?

123
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,550
OK.

124
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,520
Your wrists!

125
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,960
Son, now that your dad isn't here,

126
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,670
could you please tell me what happened?

127
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,550
Mom,

128
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,590
I'd like some rice with water.

129
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,910
Sure.

130
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,550
I'll go make it.

131
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,760
Here you are.

132
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,470
Slow down.

133
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,150
Mom, my quilt is kinda thin.

134
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,030
I felt cold at night.

135
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,350
I thought

136
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,200
I got you a thick one days ago.

137
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,960
The cotton in the corners may be loose.

138
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,910
Let me see.

139
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,960
I'll get you another one.

140
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,910
Mom,

141
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,640
I'm so sorry.

142
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,470
Yang, Yang, Yang! What are you doing?

143
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,440
Open the door!

144
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,520
Please, let me out!

145
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,520
Don't go, please!

146
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,710
Whatever it is,
your dad will help you when he's back!

147
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,640
Please!

148
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,400
Mom,

149
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,200
I have to go out.

150
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,910
I'll take care of what I've done.

151
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,880
Wait for me.

152
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,710
I promise I'll come back.

153
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,960
Please don't go, Yang!

154
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,080
Open the door!

155
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,320
Wang Yang! Wang Yang! Wang Yang!

156
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,280
Let me out! Wang Yang!

157
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,470
Wang Yang!

158
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,520
Wang Yang, don't go!

159
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,150
Wang Yang!

160
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,710
Wang Yang!

161
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,080
Open the door, Wang Yang!

162
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,710
Wang Yang!

163
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,470
Wang Yang!

164
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,880
Wang Yang!

165
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,440
Where's Wang Yang?

166
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,230
He left. It's my fault.

167
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,910
What else can you do?

168
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,350
What to do?

169
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,790
Where did he go?

170
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,910
Shut it!

171
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,790
Let's think.

172
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,790
Hello.

173
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,350
Page 96

174
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,350
52827.

175
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,320
Wang Xiang's got important news.

176
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,760
Call him back ASAP.

177
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,550
Do you have kids, Captain Ma?

178
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,640
I've seen too many monsters at work.

179
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,550
I'm too scared to have kids.

180
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,840
I understand.

181
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,150
I also have a son, Shen Hui.

182
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,790
But, Mo is...

183
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,350
Mo is different.

184
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,000
I love her more than him.

185
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,280
You know,
she lost her parents at a young age.

186
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,760
I took care of her for a decade,
ten long years!

187
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,560
I can tell you
that I gave her the best kind of life.

188
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,710
She lived like a princess
and I even bought her a piano.

189
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,310
Whenever I think of that...

190
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,470
I can't help it.

191
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,070
No other men in this world
would love her as much as I did.

192
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,830
No one.

193
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,350
What kind of love?

194
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,920
Someone took nude photos of her,
wrote a letter to report her,

195
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,000
and made them public at her school.

196
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,350
You know that, don't you?

197
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,830
Who would do such horrible things?

198
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,880
Could it be someone close to her

199
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,920
who meant to control her with those nude
photos and treated her as a plaything?

200
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,190
Shen Mo couldn't do anything about that.

201
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:14,070
Then when she grew up,
certainly, she'd want freedom,

202
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,800
but that person wouldn't let her go.

203
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,830
Don't you think
whoever did that is a monster?

204
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,880
Captain Ma, what's your point?

205
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,880
Just cut to the chase.

206
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,190
See that thermos in the photo?

207
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,590
Doesn't it look familiar?

208
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,040
I found the same one in your place.

209
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,400
What's your explanation?

210
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
That thermos?

211
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,430
You must be joking.

212
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,520
Everyone in my mill
has such a thermos at home.

213
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,190
What you really want to know
is if I took this photo, right?

214
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,350
So did you take this photo?

215
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,280
You're a cop.

216
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,920
You tell me.

217
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,350
Shen Dongliang,

218
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,160
I'll dig to the bottom of this case.

219
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,310
Murder and anything else that's
evil will not be left unanswered.

220
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,350
Good.

221
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,110
That's a relief.

222
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,520
Once you find out the truth,

223
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,160
I'll thank you with a banner.

224
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,640
No need to wait that long.

225
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,800
We can talk it over in Hualin.

226
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,470
OK.

227
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,190
Once we...

228
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,640
once we get there, I'll need
an explanation from your director.

229
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,950
As a police officer,
is this how you serve the public?

230
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,880
I mean...

231
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,920
how could you trick the victim's family
into your car to grill them in private?

232
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,560
I'll ask him if the police force

233
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,640
can violate civil rights like this
and if you can

234
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,310
bend the rules and go this far.

235
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,430
Do you know what my biggest regret is?

236
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,000
Do you know what my biggest mistake is?

237
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,280
My biggest mistake is

238
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,880
I didn't kill her myself.

239
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,830
Look at her.

240
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,950
She was so pure.

241
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,710
You're sick!

242
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,520
You're an animal!

243
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,190
Get out!

244
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:41,830
Screw you!

245
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,850
You're sick!

246
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,530
I'll kill you!

247
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,430
Is this the best you can do?

248
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:17,310
You can't solve the case
and you're taking it out

249
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,640
on the bereaved?

250
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,310
Go on!

251
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,280
Hit me.

252
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,890
Stop playing innocent!

253
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,400
A police officer beat me!

254
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,000
A police officer beat me!

255
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,680
Help!

256
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,400
A police officer beat me!

257
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,040
Ma Desheng...

258
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,040
Ma Desheng...

259
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,640
You'll never...

260
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,590
solve this case.

261
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,280
You know...

262
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,400
You know why?

263
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,520
The dead tell no tales.

264
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,000
Hit here.

265
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,310
Come on.

266
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,560
Do it.

267
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,070
Do it!

268
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,190
Hit me!

269
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,880
Excuse me.

270
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,590
One more plate of dumplings, please.

271
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,160
(Do you remember when we were little,)

272
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,400
(I got hungry and went to steal food
from the kitchen at night?)

273
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,560
(Dad caught me and meant to beat me,
but you said you wanted the food.)

274
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,830
(Then he beat me up.)

275
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,230
(Why did you bring that up?)

276
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,520
(Their dumplings taste the same
as we had back then.)

277
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,400
(My stomach hurts.)

278
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,400
(I need to use the bathroom. Wait here)

279
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,760
(Would you like anything else to eat?)

280
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,350
(Cheer up.)

281
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,950
(Smile.)

282
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,590
Please hold on.

283
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:14,880
Money order for 200 yuan.

284
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,470
Check, please.

285
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:11,520
- Don't move!
- Freeze.

286
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,760
Cuff him! Cuff him!

287
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,070
Behave yourself!

288
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,830
(If I didn't come back,
leave with Wang Yang.)

289
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,310
(I'll take responsibility for everything)

290
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,680
What's up, Mr. Wang?

291
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,000
Last time, you said you'd thank
me if I set you up with Huang Liru.

292
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,520
Do you still mean it?

293
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,560
Of course.

294
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,710
Maybe we'll become cousins-in-law.

295
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,920
Of course, I'll pay you back.

296
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,590
Now is your chance.

297
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,470
Let's catch him tonight.

298
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,880
Him who?

299
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,800
My son.

300
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,520
He's hanging out with some bad kids.

301
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,110
Maybe they'll flee tonight.

302
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,520
Mr. Wang, you know, teenagers
these days can be rough.

303
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,400
If there's a fight,
we might not be their match.

304
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,280
What do you suggest?

305
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,830
Why don't you tell Captain Ma
about it and have his men go with us?

306
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,110
I tried but couldn't reach him.

307
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,430
Does your wife know about this?

308
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,680
If you and Liru get married,
my wife will become your cousin,

309
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,280
and my son, your nephew.

310
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,680
As his uncle-to-be,
are you joining me or not?

311
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,680
Yes, of course.

312
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,680
I'll do anything for family.

313
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,160
Good.

314
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,710
So what do you need me to do?

315
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,190
What do you think?

316
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:36,560
Watch and learn.

317
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,110
Give me that.

318
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,070
Let me do it.

319
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,190
You suck!

320
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,760
Excuse me.

321
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,110
Do you know which room Gong Biao is in?

322
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,230
Gong Biao? Biao?

323
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,710
Yes.

324
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,400
In Factory Affairs Office?

325
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,280
That's right.

326
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,310
Turn left. Room 222.

327
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,680
OK. Thanks.

328
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,520
Have we met before?

329
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,800
Really?

330
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,190
I don't think so.

331
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,350
Are you a nurse in our hospital?

332
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,160
You gave me injections.

333
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,190
They didn't hurt at all.

334
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:02,950
Oh, yeah?

335
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,680
Watch it, punk!

336
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,800
Watch it!

337
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,040
I said watch it!

338
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,350
You hear me?

339
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,640
Put away your fingers!

340
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,280
Hey, Biao!

341
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,000
What?

342
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,190
Stop it!

343
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,310
I said no cards today.

344
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,680
You got a visitor. Come out!

345
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,830
Who is it?

346
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,640
Liru? What brings you here?

347
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
Are you going out?

348
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,520
Is this a bad time?

349
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,710
If so,

350
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,800
I'll come again some other day.

351
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,590
No, not at all.

352
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,830
Come, come on in.

353
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,830
Not you!

354
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,710
We know each other.

355
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,560
We can talk.

356
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,350
Forget it. Get out.

357
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,710
Your coworkers are nice.

358
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,040
Don't be fooled.

359
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:39,950
They're young.

360
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,520
Didn't even finish junior high.

361
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,310
They're countrified.

362
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,470
Take a seat, Liru.

363
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,760
I always tell them
to keep their rooms clean.

364
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,590
Don't make a mess.

365
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,880
And they messed around my room.

366
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,230
Have a seat.

367
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,350
It's clean.

368
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,070
Let me get you some water.

369
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:27,920
Sure.

370
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,470
The glass is also clean.

371
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,470
Thanks.

372
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:43,230
Is it too hot?

373
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:43,590
It's OK. It's fine.

374
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,310
Do you need some cold water?

375
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,350
I've got my hanky.

376
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,230
So what's up?

377
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,760
Nothing really.

378
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,350
Recently,

379
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,590
I've been having these dreams.

380
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,150
About what?

381
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,910
I forgot where I picked up this
line, but it does make you think.

382
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,910
Basically, it says,

383
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:23,120
"The people in our dreams, we
should call them when we wake up.

384
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,280
It would make life simpler."

385
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,320
Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, a French movie.
[*The Lovers on the Bridge (1991)]

386
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,360
You know everything.

387
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:40,190
By the way, that book about
dreams you said, may I borrow it?

388
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:45,080
The Interpretation of Dreams
by Sigmund Freud, Austrian.

389
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,670
Let me find it.

390
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,470
I've got nothing but books.

391
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,760
Can you find it?

392
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,190
Don't worry.

393
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,040
I don't have to read it.

394
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,000
I'll find it.

395
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,080
Last night,

396
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,000
I read it before bed.

397
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,320
I've got too many books.

398
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,840
Are you OK?

399
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,230
I'm fine. I'm good.

400
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,390
Did you get hurt?

401
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,710
Come here.

402
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,910
I got you.

403
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:29,800
What's wrong?

404
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,150
I've got dirt in my eye.

405
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,910
Sit here. Sit down.

406
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,800
Let me check.

407
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,230
Which eye?

408
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:37,910
This one.

409
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,120
Do you feel better?

410
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,280
No, blow it again.

411
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,360
How about now?

412
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,710
What's wrong?

413
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,360
You smell so nice.

414
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,230
The smell of what?

415
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,390
Disinfectant.

416
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,470
Where is he?

417
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:07,630
Hello.

418
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,190
I need to speak to Gong Biao.

419
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,800
Room 222, working in
Factory Affairs Office.

420
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,230
(The Interpretation of Dreams)
Found the book!

421
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,710
No wonder I didn't find it.

422
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,000
Biao, you're such a book lover.

423
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,910
I know.

424
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,710
Books make me a better man.

425
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,390
We haven't talked about
our relationship.

426
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,040
Isn't this too soon?

427
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:38,840
Let me ask you.

428
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,390
Do you love me?

429
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,800
I do.

430
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,910
Then it's settled.

431
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,120
Biao, answer the phone in the gatehouse!

432
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,870
Tell the guy I went out.

433
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,950
Did he say where he went
or leave a message before he left?

434
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,430
OK. Thanks.

435
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,760
Unreliable!

436
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,280
Stop!

437
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,760
Stop!

438
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,190
Don't move.

439
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,080
I'm armed!

440
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,390
Where's Wang Yang?

441
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,390
I know you hang out together.

442
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,320
The police are on their way.

443
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,800
Once they get here,
things will be different!

444
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:28,390
Turn around.

445
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
Tie yourself up.

446
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,080
Stop!

447
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,040
Could you please let Wang Yang go?

448
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,910
What do you want?

449
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,150
Leave my son alone.

450
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:31,670
I...

451
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,710
I'll do anything for you.

452
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,800
Trust me.

453
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,150
I won't tell anyone.

454
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,320
As long as you let him...

455
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:45,910
go,

456
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,320
I...

457
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,630
I'll keep my mouth shut.

458
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,000
Please!

459
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,150
Wang Yang is our only child.

460
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:05,390
His mom is worried sick at home,
and she has a heart problem.

461
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,670
She can't take this.

462
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,630
Besides, I've promised her
that I'll bring Wang Yang back today.

463
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:14,670
Please!

464
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,120
I'm sorry.

465
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,560
Wang Yang is all I've left.

466
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,710
I'm so sorry.

467
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,800
Please forgive me.

468
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,390
It's OK.

469
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,360
Where were you guys these days?

470
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,710
I thought you were in trouble.

471
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,630
Are you alone?

472
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,000
Where's your brother?

473
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,430
The police got him.

474
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:15,430
Let's go back.

475
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,870
What?

476
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,190
I've thought it over.

477
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,360
We should go back.

478
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,390
I'll turn myself in.

479
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,910
But why?

480
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,470
Didn't we agree
to leave the city together?

481
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,190
You can't be a fugitive
for the rest of your life.

482
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,710
Come back and you can start over.

483
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,600
Too late, Wang Yang.

484
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,430
There's no coming back!

485
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,120
There is.

486
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,560
I'll take responsibility
for Lu Wenzhong's death.

487
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,080
I killed him and took care of his body.

488
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:58,840
It had nothing to do with you.

489
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:05,600
You can go back to school,
play the piano, and be a doctor.

490
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:14,430
If I get to live, you'll wait for me.

491
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,190
I killed Yin Hong.

492
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:32,670
They thought that was me.

493
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:39,630
I killed her.

494
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,390
Wang Yang, you're all I've left.

495
00:45:55,120 --> 00:46:00,390
We've decided
that we'll go somewhere else

496
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,760
and start anew, right?

497
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,840
Wang Yang, I can only depend on you.

498
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,430
Please, let's go!

499
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,040
I see.

500
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,230
We're different after all.

501
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:03,320
You've got your family, your parents...

502
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,190
Unlike me, I've lost everything.

503
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:15,980
(The Interpretation of Dreams)

504
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:19,040
Mr. Wang!

505
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,120
Sorry, Mr. Wang.

506
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,120
I got caught up in something.

507
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,120
Your wife said you had gone out.

508
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,430
Here am I to find you.

509
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:30,150
Are we watching those kids in turns?

510
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,360
I... I'll do it.

511
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,080
You look like a mess.

512
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,000
What happened?

513
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,150
Nothing.

514
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,600
I fell.

515
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,040
Biao, please do me a favor.

516
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,560
No need to ask. I'll do it.

517
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,630
What's up?

518
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,560
Don't tell anyone
about what my son did,

519
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,630
OK?

520
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:04,280
Rest assured.

521
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,430
I won't say a word to others.

522
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:06,520
So where is he?

523
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,470
Don't ask. Go home.

524
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:45,470
Where's Yang?

525
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,320
Where's my son?

526
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,080
Hey, I'm asking you!

527
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,230
Where is my son?

528
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,120
He ran away.

529
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,320
You saw him?

530
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:10,360
I didn't.

531
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:13,190
I think

532
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:14,390
I ran into his partner.

533
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,840
How could you let Yang go?

534
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,120
You promised that you'd...

535
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,230
Shut up already!

536
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,280
My head hurts!

537
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,120
But...

538
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,670
He couldn't have left.

539
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:29,560
He asked me to wait for him at home.

540
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,190
Where could he go?

541
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,040
Where is he?

542
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:52,800
Calm down.

543
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,630
Here, take your pills.

544
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,630
Take your pills. Come on.

545
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:04,230
Don't worry too much.

546
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:06,760
Our son is fine.

547
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:07,710
Look,

548
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:09,360
I'll go out to look for him again.

549
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:10,760
Take your pills.

550
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:23,120
You promised to bring my son back.

551
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,230
Relax.

552
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,520
That boy is smart.

553
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,630
Once he settles down, he'll contact us.

554
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,950
Then we'll go get him back together.

555
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:37,800
Take your pills.

556
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,670
Lie down.

557
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:02,470
You need to rest.

558
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:10,760
What are you doing?

559
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:13,870
Reheat the food.

560
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,840
When Yang comes back,
he can't have cold food.

00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:53,800
Stop polishing it.

563
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,520
The train isn't going anywhere.

564
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,000
That's our fault, not the part's.

565
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:02,280
It pains me to see it's so dirty.

566
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,000
Quanli won't come again.

567
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,260
He broke his leg in a gig.

568
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,040
He tried to support his family.

569
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:14,390
When they read the layoff list later,

570
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:15,910
I'll be the first one in Locomotive.

571
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:16,950
Relax.

572
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:20,040
I'll go before you.

573
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,280
Come on, Mr. Wang.

574
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,870
They're playing the song.

575
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:28,800
You go first.

576
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,000
I'll join you when I'm done.

577
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,430
Aren't you gonna hear the list?

578
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,800
It is what it is now.

579
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,000
Why bother?

580
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,230
Fine, I'll go.

581
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,360
Hey, you!

582
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Show some respect.

583
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:09,800
What you got?

584
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,560
The layoff list?

585
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,190
Let me sneak a peek.

586
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:13,430
It's classified.

587
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:14,670
You can't look at it.

588
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:15,840
Also,

589
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,360
I'm different now.

590
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,150
Be polite in public.

591
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:18,600
Fine.

592
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,390
They'll announce his promotion soon.

593
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,520
Fine. Director Biao.

594
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:22,800
Shut up.

595
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,950
Without the formal document,
it's not official yet.

596
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,280
We'll have
a little celebration in Canteen 2.

597
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:30,600
You're all invited.

598
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:31,390
Celebrate what?

599
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,470
My wedding!

600
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,320
Liru and I are getting our certificate.

601
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,230
Huang Liru?

602
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,390
That nurse in our hospital?

603
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,150
Who else would it be?

604
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:40,950
I won't settle for any women.

605
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,280
Some scarf you got.

606
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:44,950
Liru bought it.

607
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:45,950
It matches my clothes.

608
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,360
Nice color.

609
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,630
Gong Biao, no more chitchat!

610
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:50,150
Come on!

611
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:54,910
Biao is a spare.

612
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,000
What do you mean?

613
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,040
You know,

614
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:01,000
Song Yukun's wife made a scene
in our hospital this morning,

615
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,800
saying Huang Liru seduced her husband.

616
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,120
Really?

617
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:06,470
Yes.

618
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,600
Their affair goes way back.

619
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,520
Listen, keep it to yourselves.

620
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,520
Don't tell others.

621
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,910
Sure. Got it.

622
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:13,710
Give me your lighter.

623
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:21,300
(Song Yukun)

624
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,390
What are you doing here?

625
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:42,470
Have you filled all the cups?

626
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,280
Yes.

627
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,870
I came to ask
what else you need me to do.

628
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,840
Well, make sure the flowers
on the stage are neat.

629
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,910
Then go over the meeting agenda
with our staff again.

630
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:50,840
- Go ahead.
- Got it.

631
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,000
(Say no more.)

632
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,360
(I've made up my mind.)

633
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,150
I won't keep this baby.

634
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,040
Don't make such a rash decision.

635
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,600
Please give me some time.

636
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,670
I'm not rash.

637
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,910
I'm getting married.

638
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,230
We're done.

639
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:27,910
We shouldn't see each other again.

640
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:28,560
Liru!

641
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,120
Liru!

642
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,140
(Workers' Congress
of Hualin No. 1 General Steel Works)

643
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:55,390
Dear workers,

644
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:00,600
I'm glad to see all of you here,
but I'm also having mixed feelings.

645
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:07,230
I'm sure that I love Hualin Steel
as much as all of you do,

646
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,080
and some love it more than me.

647
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,600
But I have to tell you the
harsh truth about our factory.

648
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:17,910
It's bad.

649
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:19,710
- Really bad.
- Mr. Wang.

650
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:24,040
The heavy burden is slowing us down.

651
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,470
Where was he?

652
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,600
Just started.

653
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:28,670
I'm sick of his nonsense.

654
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:30,520
We're here for the list.

655
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,230
You gotta warm up the scene
before the show.

656
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,670
It's the same old stuff.

657
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,840
It's time for us
to pay our factory back!

658
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,230
Some of you have complaints.

659
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:51,150
I understand that.

660
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:56,150
But they shouldn't spread rumors
because rumors can kill.

661
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,760
What are you doing?

662
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:02,630
Fill his cup.

663
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,560
Also, I'd like to add
that if some of you,

664
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:11,190
especially the couples working here,
need help, we'll provide it in time.

665
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:14,430
And we have to
increase our production and efficiency.

666
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:16,760
That's the priority
in the next stage of work.

667
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,280
Go big or go home!

668
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,320
We must be confident and determined.

669
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,150
Nothing can stop us!

670
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:25,520
Enough.

671
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,670
What are you doing?

672
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,080
Why did he stop?

673
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,870
What's your relationship with Liru?

674
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,760
I'm giving a speech. Go away.

675
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,910
You set me up!

676
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:41,710
Gong Biao, don't push me!

677
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:42,280
Get out!

678
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,760
Gong Biao, come back!

679
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:44,910
Come back, punk!

680
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:45,950
Something is wrong.

681
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:49,360
Security...

682
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:50,560
I'll kill you, Song Yukun!

683
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:51,600
Are you insane?

684
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,600
Song Yukun!

685
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,120
What are you doing?

686
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,150
What's wrong with you?

687
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:55,840
Security!

688
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,430
Biao!

689
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,150
Biao!

690
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:58,150
Biao!

691
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,630
Biao!

692
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,840
What got into you?

693
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:03,950
What are you doing?

694
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:05,800
Unbelievable!

695
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,870
Are you OK, sir?

696
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:17,540
(Song Yukun)

697
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:19,190
Harder!

698
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:19,760
Kick him!

699
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,230
Beat him!

700
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,000
You'll be doomed if you kill him!

701
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,710
Harder!

702
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:25,870
Jianchun, come on!

703
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:27,870
I know you're doing your job,
but this is too much!

704
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,120
Who are you to lecture me?

705
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:34,710
Look, if he's crippled or dead,
you'll have to take responsibility.

706
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,190
Wang Xiang, you're a senior.

707
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:40,670
I respect you.

708
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:41,710
If it were someone else,

709
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:42,360
I wouldn't give a hoot.

710
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,120
Yes, yes, I know. Thanks,

711
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:44,630
Jianchun.

712
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:46,630
Enough.

713
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:47,800
Guard the door.

714
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,710
They're still having a meeting.

715
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:51,520
Don't let him in. Got it?

716
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,360
Go ahead.

717
00:59:57,710 --> 00:59:59,190
I'm only letting him go because of you.

718
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,670
Well, one of you kind
of lost it just now.

719
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,320
It's understandable.

720
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,600
After all, we have to
make a historic but tough decision.

721
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:42,910
Talk to me.

722
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,000
What was that about?

723
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,840
I know you're more concerned about
the layoffs and suspensions, yeah?

724
01:00:56,230 --> 01:01:01,470
I'm changing the meeting agenda
and I'll announce

725
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:02,910
that list now.

726
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,560
Speaking of that,

727
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:09,120
Factory Affairs Office
will lead by example.

728
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,360
Layoff of Factory Affairs:

729
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,520
Gong Biao.

730
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,190
Layoffs of Locomotive:

731
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:25,150
Zhang Youcheng,

732
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,630
Hao Chenggang...

733
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,320
I don't need this uniform.

734
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:29,950
Li Qing,

735
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,120
Fang Zhonghua.

736
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:36,080
Layoffs of Facility Management:

737
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,910
Sun Liqiang,

738
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:42,230
Tian Mingzhi...

739
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,600
What's Mr. Wang doing?

740
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:46,470
Jiang Yanquan.

741
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,000
What's up, Wang Xiang?

742
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,120
You're such a scumbag!

743
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:05,950
Did you see Biao?

744
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:07,040
He was up there just now.

745
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,150
Pardon?

746
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,840
Scumbag!

747
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,190
Come on, Locomotive!

748
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,710
Break it off! Break it off!

749
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:35,910
Useless!

750
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:38,360
You security people
are good-for-nothing!

751
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,560
You couldn't stop a few workers!

752
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:46,230
I assure you, sir, that we'll deal with
all those in the fight up there!

753
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:46,600
Yes!

754
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,470
Punish them severely.

755
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:48,560
Set an example.

756
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,630
I want severe punishment!

757
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:52,040
No one will get away,
especially Wang Xiang, who started it!

758
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,080
I'll deal with him first!

759
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:54,670
Don't be too mad.

760
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:08,600
Sir, did your watch stop?

761
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:09,600
Get out of my face!

762
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,000
Who are you?

763
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:11,630
Who are you looking for?

764
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:12,520
Is Song Yukun here?

765
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:13,560
Our boss is busy.

766
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,390
Get out, out!

767
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,280
I'm talking to you!

768
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,150
You hear me?

769
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,560
Song Yukun?

770
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:21,800
Who are you punks?

771
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,840
Municipal Commission
for Discipline Inspection.

772
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:26,120
Someone accuses you
of embezzling state assets

773
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,390
and laying off workers as revenge.

774
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,320
Please cooperate with us.

775
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:55,040
Here come the police.

776
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:58,000
Are you gonna arrest me?

777
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:00,150
Go ahead.

778
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,360
It's about Wang Yang...

779
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:10,430
We found him.

780
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:23,150
What are you doing? It's off-limits.

781
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:23,630
I'm going in.

782
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:24,150
Please step back.

783
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:25,190
Let him in.

784
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,150
Captain Ma.

785
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:43,120
Cui, are you sure it's him?

786
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:47,150
It must be a mistake.

787
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:53,670
It's a mistake, isn't it?

788
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,150
Fang He!

789
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:21,190
Get up!

790
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:24,320
Don't sleep here!

791
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,600
Go home and sleep!

792
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:31,630
Get up!

793
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:35,630
Come on, son!

794
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,390
Yang...

795
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,360
Yang...

796
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:02,870
Yang, don't do this to me.

797
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,120
Yang...

798
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:08,950
Get up, please.

799
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,560
Get up. Let's go home.

800
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,040
Come on, son.

801
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,470
Let's go home...

802
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,360
I'll stop scolding you.

803
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:24,760
You can do whatever you want.

804
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:27,910
Get up...

805
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:31,560
Your mom is still waiting at home.

806
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:36,000
What about our trip to Beijing?

807
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,000
Yang...

808
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,120
My boy...

809
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,150
Don't scare me, please.

810
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:48,150
Don't do this to me.

811
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,840
Yang, please, don't...

812
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,230
You're making me scared, son.

813
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,600
Don't do this to me.

814
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,320
You can't do this to me...

815
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:21,360
What would you like, sir?

816
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,280
What should I pick as a gift?

817
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,840
These are perfect for patients.

818
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:28,120
Hypoallergenic.

819
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,390
It's not for a patient.

820
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:32,320
It's for a friend, you know...

821
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,230
a woman. That kind of friend.

822
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:36,230
I can arrange some for you.

823
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:37,040
Perfect. Thanks.

824
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:37,800
Excuse me.

825
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,280
I'll take these.

826
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:39,950
- Please wrap them up.
- Sure.

827
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:40,670
No problem.

828
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:41,360
I'll be with you later.

829
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,000
OK. I'll wait.

830
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:52,600
Picking up flowers?

831
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:53,230
Yes.

832
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,230
For... your girlfriend?

833
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:05,630
You can take what I've picked.

834
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,840
11 roses and two lilies.

835
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,430
Do they have a special meaning?

836
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:14,840
Love you and only you forever and ever.

837
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:17,310
That sounds great.

838
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,310
Perfect.

839
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:26,240
Also, if I want to apologize to her,

840
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,640
tell her I'm sorry,
are there any flowers for that?

841
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,470
Add some forget-me-nots.

842
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:32,560
Great.

843
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,080
Don't forget me.

844
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,720
Don't be mad at me.

845
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,040
Here's your bouquet, sir.

846
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:41,520
Thank you.

847
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:42,560
Have a good one.

848
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,160
Good day.

849
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:44,750
You too.

850
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:51,750
11 roses, two lilies,
and more forget-me-nots.

851
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:52,600
Got it.

852
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,160
The more the better.

853
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:53,680
I see.

854
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,120
Do you need a cab?

855
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:03,040
Come on. Take mine.

856
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:04,720
Are you sure?

857
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:05,950
Don't you have somewhere else to go?

858
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,240
Where are you going?

859
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:09,200
Wenhua Street to pick up a friend.

860
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:10,910
Get in.

861
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:11,640
It's in the same direction.

862
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,160
I won't charge you
as you helped me pick flowers.

863
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:16,560
Thanks.

864
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,240
Please, take my bouquet.

865
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,160
Sure, no problem.

866
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:22,470
Don't mix them up.

867
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:25,350
That one with forget-me-nots is mine.

868
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:26,750
Alright.

869
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:37,600
Is that for your girlfriend, too?

870
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,910
We... we aren't together yet.

871
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:43,870
Nothing is settled.

872
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,470
I'm going to ask her later,
but I'm kind of nervous.

873
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:50,560
You'll be fine.

874
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:56,470
You know, judging by your looks
and your tone, you're a gentleman.

875
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:58,790
She'll say yes for sure.

876
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:00,910
I certainly hope so.

877
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,120
What do you do?

878
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,430
I had been a teacher in Academic Affairs
at No. 10 Middle School

879
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:09,390
before I retired last year.

880
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:11,640
Look,

881
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,200
I drive around town all day
and get to meet all sorts of people.

882
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:15,870
I'm good at reading them.

883
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,520
I can tell you're educated.

884
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:23,950
Do teachers like you get high pensions?

885
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:25,270
It's OK, I guess.

886
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:27,310
I get a raise every year.

887
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,600
My wife passed away years ago,
and my kids are independent.

888
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,430
My pension is more than enough for me,

889
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:38,790
so no pressure.

890
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,790
Good for you.

891
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:47,520
Once you and your girlfriend get
together, your life will be even better.

892
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,640
Qiaoyun.

893
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:57,270
Don't worry.

894
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,310
I've got a cab.

895
01:10:58,910 --> 01:10:59,720
I'll be there in a minute.

896
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:16,080
So, did... did your girlfriend
work at Hualin Steel?

897
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:17,520
Yes.

898
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,350
Now, she owns a massage parlor.

899
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:21,790
Why? Do you know her?

900
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,430
That name sounds familiar.

901
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:28,830
Maybe I'll recognize her face.

902
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:30,520
What are the odds?

903
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,720
She keeps telling me about your factory

904
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,200
and her retirement
has just been approved.

905
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:42,080
She means to close her parlor so that
we can travel around and have fun.

906
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,790
We'll be spending
the rest of our life together.

907
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,950
Turn at Wenhua Street.

908
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,470
You... you can turn in and pull over.

909
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:58,950
She's waiting beside the road.

910
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:13,600
I went to pick up flowers.

911
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:14,790
This is yours.

912
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,160
I couldn't get a cab there
and ran into him.

913
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,350
He gave me a ride.

914
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:20,750
And he worked at your factory, too.

915
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,720
What a small world!

916
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:23,200
Li Qiaoyun.

917
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:25,040
You're Li Qiaoyun, right?

918
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:27,520
Do you remember me?

919
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:32,560
I was in Locomotive, surnamed Wang.

920
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:38,430
I know you, Mr. Wang.

921
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:40,830
She remembers me.

922
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,350
Look at that!

923
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,790
Shall we... go on by his car?

924
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,790
Mr. Wang and I got along well.

925
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,750
We're going to Daguang Mall.

926
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,790
Is it OK if you take us there?

927
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,240
Sure, no problem.

928
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:55,950
But I have to pay you this time.

929
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:56,750
OK.

930
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,350
Look, Qiaoyun, this is for you.

931
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:09,520
Are you hungry?

932
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:13,310
Shall we eat first or after the movie?

933
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:17,870
Both are fine.

934
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:22,600
Then let's eat first.

935
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,680
Do you have anything in mind?

936
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:27,560
All is fine.

937
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,160
OK.

938
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:30,910
Let me check.

939
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:46,600
Mr. Wang.

940
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,120
You got a beautiful bouquet.

941
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:56,790
Well,
your friend helped me pick the flowers.

942
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:02,310
It's the same as his
with a few forget-me-nots.

943
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,600
I wanna say...

944
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,720
please don't be mad at me.

945
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,680
I'm sorry.

946
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:16,000
Isn't it too late to send the bouquet
after you drop us off?

947
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:17,310
Not at all.

948
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:21,910
She worked at our factory, too.

949
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:25,720
She gets me
with or without the bouquet.

950
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:31,750
Do I know her?

951
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,160
I think so.

952
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:42,160
She was responsible for weighing,
a nice woman

953
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:48,520
living a hard life, but she's tough.

954
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,560
When others have problems,

955
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:57,390
they might be sad and cry,
but she's always optimistic.

956
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,520
That's admirable.

957
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,310
Have you never thought about
taking things further with her?

958
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:25,560
You know what?

959
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,560
Well, something happened to me lately,

960
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,390
and I gotta meet with those
from the factory.

961
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:37,160
I realize
that whatever happened to them,

962
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,830
good or bad, they're moving on.

963
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,560
But I'm not.

964
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:43,640
I just can't let it go.

965
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:47,910
I heard that friend of mine
is doing well now.

966
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,870
Things are picking up.

967
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:51,790
I'm happy for her.

968
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,270
I hope
she'll be able to live a better life.

969
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:03,200
If she's with an old fart like me,
she won't feel safe or happy.

970
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:04,790
She deserves a better man.

971
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,350
Mr. Wang, you're nostalgic.

972
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:11,870
That's one way to say it.

973
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,430
Actually, I'm too stubborn.

974
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:16,240
I'm hopeless.

975
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,560
It's annoying.

976
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,720
Why are you crying, Qiaoyun?

977
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:27,310
Nothing.

978
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:31,870
Don't worry.

979
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:36,240
He reminds me of the past, too.

980
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:41,790
Trust me, the past is the past.

981
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,240
Let it go.

982
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:45,680
Look ahead.

983
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,200
That's right.

984
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:51,310
Look ahead.

985
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:54,790
Yes, look ahead.

986
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,200
How much is it?

987
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:12,160
No need.

988
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,270
Just do me a favor.

989
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,200
Treat Qiaoyun well.

990
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,200
Or her old colleagues
won't forgive you.

991
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:22,160
I will. Of course.

992
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:23,470
Thanks.

993
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,720
Let's go, Qiaoyun.

994
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,270
Thanks, Mr. Wang.

995
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:47,950
Hey, all the best!

996
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:49,310
You...

997
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:50,390
I don't need it anymore.

998
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,830
Forget me not!

999
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:55,830
Thanks.

1000
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:57,430
Thanks again.

1001
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:05,870
Mr. Wang is such a good man.

1002
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:14,310
His name is Wang Xiang,

1003
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,270
"Xiang" as "loud".

1004
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:30,000
Biao.

1005
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,830
The transfer is done.

1006
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,720
These are your copies.

1007
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:38,270
Don't lose them.

1008
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:42,600
Give me that certificate, too.

1009
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:45,870
Why?

1010
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:46,750
It's no longer valid.

1011
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,720
I... I wanna keep it as a memento.

1012
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,430
It's got my photo, too.

1013
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:51,830
OK.

1014
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:54,310
I've talked to the buyer.

1015
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,910
Give him the car before next month.

1016
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,430
You got it.

1017
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:58,950
It'll be clean and tidy
when your guy gets it.

1018
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,080
Good.

1019
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:02,040
Thanks.

1020
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:09,260
(Hualin Taxi Driver Certificate
Name: Gong Biao)

1021
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,750
Why not put the sign over there?

1022
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:36,910
Everyone can see it.

1023
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,910
If you put it here, they can't
see anything from that way.

1024
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:41,520
Who are you?

1025
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:42,600
Who am I?

1026
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:44,430
I'm the co-owner of this salon.

1027
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,080
Take a break.

1028
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:50,080
Thank you, Boss.

1029
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:50,790
Here you go.

1030
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,790
I was too busy to drop by.

1031
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,430
Where's your other boss, Ms. Huang?

1032
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:57,560
(Tattoo, Skin Care, Body Care)

1033
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,600
She's inside.

1034
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,160
I see.

1035
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:00,870
Keep up the good work.

1036
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:02,720
Move the sign here.

1037
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:17,910
Hey, make sure every corner up
there is fully covered, got it?

1038
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:18,910
- It has to be completely dry.
- Sure.

1039
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:19,950
Then paint the wall again.

1040
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:27,040
What brings you here?

1041
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,310
The shop looks good.

1042
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,640
We can talk at home.

1043
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:34,470
I'm swamped.

1044
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:36,310
Look at this mess.

1045
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,080
You didn't answer my calls
or messages on WeChat.

1046
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:40,830
Why?

1047
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,000
Are you planning a big surprise?

1048
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,080
What surprise?

1049
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,640
Don't be mad.

1050
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,870
You aren't that petty.

1051
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:50,910
Let me go.

1052
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,200
Don't touch me!

1053
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,040
We're in public!

1054
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,310
Enough is enough.

1055
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:55,160
What are you doing?

1056
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:55,870
Let go of me!

1057
01:20:55,870 --> 01:20:56,750
What's wrong, Liru?

1058
01:20:59,200 --> 01:20:59,870
Who is he?

1059
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,350
My husband, Gong Biao.

1060
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,080
Meet Hao.

1061
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:07,680
You're that Biao?

1062
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:09,600
Liru's told me a lot about you.

1063
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,720
Why aren't you driving your cab?

1064
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,040
Who is he?

1065
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,750
Hao is my partner.

1066
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:22,040
Hao, huh?

1067
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:24,790
You look sharp.

1068
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:27,160
What do you do?

1069
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:28,750
I've got a small business.

1070
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:31,750
And I've invested in Ms. Huang's salon.

1071
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:35,560
Also, I own
a few repair shops in Daowai.

1072
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,680
If there's anything wrong with your car,
feel free to go there.

1073
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:38,950
Tell them we're friends. Cigarette?

1074
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:40,120
Not my brand.

1075
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:44,310
My car is fine, but my marriage is not.

1076
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:45,000
Can you fix that?

1077
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,390
What do you mean, Biao?

1078
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,240
Hey, watch it.

1079
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,240
Don't call me Biao.

1080
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,120
We aren't that close.

1081
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:54,160
Show some respect.

1082
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:55,680
Oh, come on.

1083
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:56,560
Don't start a fight.

1084
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,520
What are you looking at? Do your thing!

1085
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,160
- Leave him alone.
- It's OK.

1086
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,560
Come on. Let's talk outside.

1087
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,390
Hey, when did you meet him?

1088
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:07,520
What's so good about him?

1089
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,040
Showing off in front of me!

1090
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,310
What's going on between you two?

1091
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,520
Do you have amnesia?

1092
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,640
Didn't I just tell you?

1093
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:14,600
He's my partner!

1094
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,830
He's got money,
and I've got skills. Is there a problem?

1095
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:19,080
Partner? What kind?

1096
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:20,910
What about me? We're married!

1097
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:25,350
Get your mind out of the gutter,
or we're done here.

1098
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:26,830
Liru,

1099
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,600
I didn't mean that.

1100
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:29,560
Let go!

1101
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,270
You ignored my messages
to get back at me, didn't you?

1102
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,430
Yes, I shouldn't have bought that cab
behind your back,

1103
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,750
but I've sincerely apologized, right?

1104
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,520
Don't push it.

1105
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:42,390
We're a couple.

1106
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:44,310
We bicker and make up.

1107
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:46,390
Look,

1108
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:47,870
I stayed at Xiang's
for the past few days.

1109
01:22:47,870 --> 01:22:48,830
I didn't go anywhere else.

1110
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,200
You can trust me on that.

1111
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:51,950
I don't care.

1112
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,520
I've given you up.

1113
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,560
Give me some more time.

1114
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,080
We don't need that guy's money.

1115
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:05,790
It's never about the money, Biao.

1116
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:07,240
I'm not leaving you because of that.

1117
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,350
I don't get it.

1118
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:09,830
What else could it be?

1119
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:11,080
It's because I'm over you.

1120
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:12,950
Got it?

1121
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,120
I'm done!

1122
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:15,270
I've had enough!

1123
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:45,560
Be careful.

1124
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:47,310
Let me take your suit.

1125
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,080
It's getting dirty.

1126
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:50,430
It's OK. Don't worry.

1127
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:08,310
Is there anything else?

1128
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:09,950
No.

1129
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:10,950
I'm off.

1130
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:14,270
Liru.

1131
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:17,870
Come home tonight.

1132
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:18,830
Let's sit down and talk.

1133
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:43,560
There you are, Biao.

1134
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:44,910
No one has hit the jackpot yet.

1135
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:45,790
Wanna try your luck?

1136
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:47,350
I'll never win.

1137
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:57,520
Come on.

1138
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,080
Eat up.

1139
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,160
The more you eat, the longer you go.

1140
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,390
When will you clean up the pigeon poop?

1141
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,560
How many times have I asked you?

1142
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:22,680
It makes everything stink.

1143
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:23,830
My kid can't even study.

1144
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:25,870
Shut up.

1145
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,390
Go home and teach your kid.

1146
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:30,390
I'm cleaning it now.

1147
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:32,680
You won't smell it even if you want to.

1148
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:34,080
Hurry up!

1149
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:54,520
Are you kids full?

1150
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:00,520
Are you done?

1151
01:26:52,830 --> 01:26:53,430
Hi, there.

1152
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:57,750
I haven't cooked for years.

1153
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:59,680
Taste it and see if it's still the same.

1154
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:06,560
What's wrong?

1155
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:09,040
You're freaking me out.

1156
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,870
Biao, what's this about?

1157
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:18,470
I gotta go back to my shop.

1158
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:20,080
I have to be there
during the decoration.

1159
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,160
Can't you spare a minute?

1160
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:26,830
This is our last meal together.

1161
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:28,910
Let's eat before you leave.

1162
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:32,910
Last meal?

1163
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:36,750
I've drafted a divorce settlement.

1164
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:38,270
You can take a look.

1165
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:40,520
I've signed my name on it.

1166
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:42,390
I won't take anything.

1167
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,350
Our money and apartment are all yours.

1168
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:47,560
And the pigeons,
well, there aren't any left.

1169
01:27:47,910 --> 01:27:48,640
I've set them free.

1170
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:51,430
If there's nothing else,
sign it and we're done.

1171
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,640
Have some soup before it gets cold.

1172
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:22,790
Come on. I'll do it.

1173
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,270
You never do any chores.

1174
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:33,160
Liru,

1175
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,560
I've come around, really.

1176
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,350
All these years,
you've suffered a lot with me.

1177
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:43,520
You've barely had anything.

1178
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:47,270
I can't give you what you want.

1179
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:52,470
My life goes as it is,
but I want you to be happy.

1180
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:01,310
Do you think you're so cool
by doing this?

1181
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:03,430
You bet.

1182
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,560
I went to college in the 90s.

1183
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:09,040
Our generation
gotta look cool no matter what.

1184
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:20,950
Let's eat.

1185
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:21,950
The food is getting cold.

1186
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:23,120
Come on.

1187
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,160
When will your shop open?

1188
01:29:38,350 --> 01:29:39,350
At the end of this year.

1189
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:40,950
What's it called?

1190
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:43,270
Still working on that.

1191
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:44,870
You went to college.

1192
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:45,790
What do you suggest?

1193
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:48,640
Forget it.

1194
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:51,080
I don't think
your partner will be happy.

1195
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,040
Alright.

1196
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:55,790
Say no more.

1197
01:29:57,430 --> 01:29:59,040
I'll toast you with soup.

1198
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,310
I'll drink up.

1199
01:30:08,830 --> 01:30:09,720
Forget about the soup.

1200
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:10,600
It's too salty.

1201
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:12,720
Yikes!

1202
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:22,240
Well, it's all settled.

1203
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,600
Liru, best wishes to you.

1204
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:40,910
I'll leave the keys over here.

1205
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:43,790
Biao...

1206
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:51,160
You know,

1207
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,160
I do have a name for your shop.

1208
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,000
Beautiful Dream.

1209
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:56,560
What do you think?

1210
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:03,720
All those years we spent together
seem to be

1211
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:05,950
a beautiful dream.

1212
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,160
It's time to wake up.

1213
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,160
So all the best to us.

1214
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:22,240
All the best.

1215
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:25,600
Beautiful Dream is perfect.

1216
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,270
Life is too short!

1217

Like Biao said life is but a dream.

1218
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:49,870
I've picked up this line.

1219
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:55,270
Things that didn't work out in life
are many.

1220
01:31:56,390 --> 01:32:00,600
Friends that you can open your heart to
are a few.

1221
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:06,350
I'm glad that I've got two such friends
with me right now!

1222
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:07,950
My life is worth it!

1223
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:10,470
Hey, Xiang, where did you get all that?

1224
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:11,310
Chicken soup for the soul, huh?

1225
01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:12,640
Those are my heartfelt words.

1226
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:16,390
This song, Where the Peach
Blossoms Bloom, is for you!

Oh, are we done?

1232
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,040
Of course not.

1233
01:32:31,790 --> 01:32:33,040
I've even got my insulin pen
for the night.

1234
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:34,390
I'm not here to watch you sleep.

1235
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:35,160
Bravo!

1236
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,430
We're staying up all night.

You're going down!

1239
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:40,950
We'll see about that.

1240
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:43,390
Li's still waiting for me at home.

1241
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:45,600

Xiang's got us the best booze,
you know?

1247
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,240
I've known it for 20 years.

1248
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:09,270
It was old enough to be my uncle.

1249
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,720

Have fun!

1254
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:21,040
You keep singing that same old song,

1255
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,000
Xiang.

1256
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,750
Play something hot
so that Captain Ma can dance.

1257
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:25,560
He's sleepy.

1258
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:31,000
Hey, play the hottest song you've got.

1259
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:31,600
You got it!

1260
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:34,750
Knock it off.

1261
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:39,240
Now, let's welcome
the King of Dance in Hualin,

1262
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:44,600
Marlon Delansheng!

1263
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,040
I've got no partner.

1264
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,680
How lonely!

1265
01:33:51,350 --> 01:33:52,240
He's the King of Dance?

1266
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,240
I don't think so.

1267
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:56,040
I killed it in college
with my disco moves.

1268
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:58,390
Let's do it!

1269
01:33:58,390 --> 01:33:59,040
Come on!

1270
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:39,790
Keep drinking.

1271
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:42,950
Come on, Captain Ma.

1272
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,390
Captain Ma, let's drink.

1273
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:49,120
I've had enough.

1274
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:50,870
I'm going home.

1275
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,560
Come on. Don't be such a buzzkill.

1276
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:55,000
Are you drained already?

1277
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:56,080
Who was showing off all the time?

1278
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,270
I'm old.

1279
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,350
How did we live our lives?

1280
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:22,950
When I wanna revisit the past,
however hard I think,

1281
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:24,910
I don't remember anything.

1282
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:33,200
Biao, that's actually good.

1283
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:40,200
Certain things shall be remembered,

1284
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,520
and the others shall be let go.

1285
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:45,870
Am I right, Captain Ma?

1286
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:47,430
What now?

1287
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:50,390
Are we done for good?

1288
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:52,790
Yes, we are.

1289
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,680
Go our separate ways.

1290
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:01,430
I really appreciate both of you

1291
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:03,200
for everything you've done.

1292
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:03,720
Come on.

1293
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:04,680
Cheers!

1294
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:06,720
I don't wanna hear it.

1295
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,350
There are things that I can't let go.

1296
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:12,310
This isn't just about you.

1297
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:16,350
I'll get to...

1298
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:17,790
the bottom of it.

1299
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:32,950
Biao, when I was young,

1300
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:35,830
I didn't believe in fate.

1301
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,270
But the older I get, the more I do.

1302
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:45,310
Our fate is predestined.

1303
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:51,470
By whom?

1304
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:56,200
So are we destined to suffer?

1305
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:00,200
I don't buy it.

1306
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:01,830
Where's that guy?

1307
01:37:01,830 --> 01:37:02,950
I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind.

1308
01:37:08,430 --> 01:37:09,870
If I could find him,

1309
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:11,560
I'd fight him to death.

1310
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:20,680
Listen to me, Xiang, have fun when
we still can until we find that guy.

1311
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:26,720
Come on.

1312
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:27,470
Cheers.

1313
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:28,310
Cheers.

1314
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:29,830
Drink up.

1315
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:30,270
Sure.

1316
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,270
Hey, Xiang, are you two up?

1317
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:04,120
Get up and sober up.

1318
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,520
Be a man.

1319
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,160
A new day has come.

1320
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:10,350
I've picked up breakfast.

1321
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:11,040
I'm on my way back.

1322
01:38:16,830 --> 01:38:18,520
Excuse me. Are you staying or not?

1323
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:20,310
It's time for us to close.

1324
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:21,350
We're leaving.

1325
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:22,310
OK.

1326
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:23,750
Are you paying the bill?

1327
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:24,560
Yes, sure.

1328
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,600
Pack up the leftovers.

1329
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:26,390
Sure. No problem.

1330
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:27,080
Bag them separately.

1331
01:38:27,350 --> 01:38:28,040
- Got it.
- Thanks.

1332
01:38:30,830 --> 01:38:31,310
Captain Ma?

1333
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:32,790
Wake up.

1334
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:34,520
It's morning already.

1335
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,720
Go home and sleep.

1336
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:37,430
Captain Ma?

1337
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:43,350
♪Be strong in the wind and rain♪

1338
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:45,790
♪Dry your tears, don't be afraid♪

1339
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:47,870
♪At least, we still have our dreams♪

1340
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:52,600
Here come the results of
the 16,129th draw of the Super Lotto.

1341
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:57,200
If you missed yesterday's live draw,
check your tickets now.

1342
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:01,160
Maybe one of our listeners
will be the winner!

1343
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:02,520
OK.

1344
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:05,600
The results of the draw are

1345
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:10,870
07, 08, 19,

1346
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,830
30, 35,

1347
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:18,950
07, 08, 19,

1348
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:20,470
30,

1349
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:22,040
35.

1350
01:39:22,350 --> 01:39:25,310
Let's see the results
of the bonus numbers.

1351
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:27,750
The first one is 08...

1352
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:07,640
Do you feel better?

1353
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:12,910
What are you doing?

1354
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:14,910
Holding your breath?

1355
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,080
I didn't cancel the banquet.

1356
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,830
When you get better, let's get married.

1357
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:40,830
You should go.

1358
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:47,390
What?

1359
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:49,240
What did you say?

1360
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:50,870
You should go!

1361
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:52,950
I lied to you.

1362
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:57,600
What now? Having second thoughts?

1363
01:42:58,640 --> 01:42:59,720
You don't wanna marry me?

1364
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:04,560
I don't deserve you.

1365
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,870
I'm a liar.

1366
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:18,240
Forget it.

1367
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:19,430
Let it go.

1368
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:28,680
Maybe

1369
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,120
I can no longer have babies.

1370
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:38,910
All the more reason to marry you.

1371
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:41,040
We can have something else.

1372
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:46,270
Are you sure you still want me?

1373
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:48,350
Why would I lie?

1374
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:50,120
I even brought you flowers.

1375
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:55,750
White arum lilies, your favorite.

1376
01:43:58,680 --> 01:43:59,950
You stole them from my pot again?

1377
01:44:02,350 --> 01:44:03,350
No, I bought them.

1378
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:12,470
Biao...

1379
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:21,680
There, there.
