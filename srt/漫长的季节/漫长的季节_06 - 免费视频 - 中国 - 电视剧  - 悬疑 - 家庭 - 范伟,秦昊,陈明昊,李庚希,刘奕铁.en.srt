00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,340
=The Long Season 6=

2
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,340
(For hire)

3
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:18,980
(Hualin Taxi Pause)

4
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,470
When you're out of home,
eat less of this food.

5
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,080
Come back home early tonight.

6
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,800
I'll make you some good dishes.

7
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,110
You can't have them in Beijing.

8
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,080
OK.

9
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,880
Let's have a simple lunch now.

10
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,360
Bei,

11
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,360
I have something to discuss with you.

12
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,360
That is...

13
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,240
When you have the exam,

14
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,190
I won't go with you.

15
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,880
When school starts,

16
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,390
I'll go there
and help you clean the dorm.

17
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,320
Dad, lately,
you've been weird. What's wrong?

18
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,390
Nothing.

19
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
How about I quit the exam this year
and take it next year?

20
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,360
Don't be ridiculous.

21
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,800
You have to take the exam
and you must pass it.

22
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,440
Beijing is a great city.

23
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,800
The cultural, political,
and economic center.

24
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,600
In that big city,
you'll make a difference.

25
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,550
But if you stay here alone,

26
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,160
I'll be worried.

27
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,520
What would you worry about?

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,550
What are you staring at?

29
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,030
Your sweater has holes.

30
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,600
When I get paid, I'll buy you a new one.

31
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,750
Don't bother.

32
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,550
I'll repair it.

33
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,830
It's imported, of good quality.

34
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,630
Made of imported wool.

35
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,000
Here, son.

36
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,830
I don't like this kind of food.

37
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,800
What great wool!

38
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,160
It makes a very thick sweater.

39
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,160
It'll last at least 20 years.

40
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,440
Why is it a little bit tight?

41
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,160
Wear it and it'll be loose.

42
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,830
It's a little small, isn't it?

43
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,920
It'll be bigger after being washed.

44
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,000
How could you be so offhand with me?

45
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,000
When our son just got paid,
he bought you a sweater.

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What else do you want?

47
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,760
He didn't even buy anything for me.

48
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,600
Shut me up with the sweater?

49
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:40,950
Not a chance.

50
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,110
Doesn't he know what he did?

51
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,160
What did he do?

52
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,880
Don't make a fuss.

53
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,640
I asked him.

54
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,510
He just sang songs and had some drinks.

55
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,760
When you were young,
you often went to the ballroom.

56
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,200
That's a different thing.

57
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,830
In the ballroom,
young guys like us were pure friends.

58
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,350
But he goes where people act tyrannically
and lead a voluptuous life.

59
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,200
Don't take the moral high ground.

60
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,230
Keeping spoiling your son.

61
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,640
Then he would make trouble.

62
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,200
Why did he buy a red sweater?

63
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,600
It's pretty.

64
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,350
Do I look a bit naughty in this sweater?

65
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,070
What does it have to do with this sweater?

66
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,110
It has something to do with you.

67
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,320
Stop the rivalry with our son.

68
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,110
If you don't want him to work out there,
get him a job.

69
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,790
How can I just get him a job?

70
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,230
Am I the factory manager?

71
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,440
I have to wait for a chance.

72
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,200
Hurry up, then.

73
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,550
Then we have to bow to someone.

74
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,230
Give them gifts if necessary.

75
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,320
Think about it.

76
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,720
Song Yukun...

77
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,510
Can we talk to him?

78
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,200
Why would I?

79
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,200
In Hualin Steel,

80
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,160
I may not recognize him,
but can he not recognize me?

81
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,880
It's quite prickly.

82
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,160
What?

83
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,880
Let me take it off.

84
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:07,720
Very prickly.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,760
Why? It's imported wool.

86
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,790
Come on.

87
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,670
Wool of every kind is prickly.

88
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,760
It's wool, after all.

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,790
The better, the pricklier.

90
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,550
You just don't deserve this.

91
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,790
I'll... I'll do it myself.

92
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,950
It's not a festival.

93
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,160
I don't need a new sweater.

94
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:26,640
Fold it.

95
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,950
You must be feeling sweet.

96
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,000
Did you see Shen Mo?

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,720
No.

98
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,670
Shen Mo's parents worked in Songhe.

99
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,350
In the factory accident of 1987,
they passed away.

100
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,270
I didn't cause that accident.

101
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,040
Why did you talk to me?

102
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,070
Right.

103
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,320
But I brought Shen Mo up.

104
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,920
I have the duty to educate her
and guard her.

105
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,950
Don't I, Mr. Ge?

106
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,160
In college, she has a part-time job.

107
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,920
I support her and I can understand.

108
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:44,000
But a girl like her
works in this kind of place...

109
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,270
What are you looking at?

110
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,950
What kind of place?

111
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,640
This is a legal entertainment center.

112
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,200
See?

113
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,200
We have a license.

114
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,670
We hire employees with a labor contract.

115
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,950
What were you talking about?

116
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,110
You're right.

117
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,350
Very legal.

118
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,200
Someday,

119
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,510
I'll bring my comrade-in-arm,

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,760
Director Zhang of firefighting management,
for some fun here.

121
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,200
By then, hope you will entertain us.

122
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,200
Who?

123
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,070
Zhang Lixin.

124
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,390
You don't know him?

125
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,950
This isn't his territory?

126
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,270
When Director Zhang comes,

127
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,600
I'll certainly handle everything.

128
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:37,350
Then first help me
handle Shen Mo's case, Mr. Ge.

129
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,960
If you still have her work here,
our conversation would be wasted.

130
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,840
Right?

131
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,150
All right, Mr. Ge.

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,520
Thank you for this.

133
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,440
No, no, no.

134
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,550
Not at all.

135
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
It's no trouble at all.

136
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,400
Well...

137
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,550
Please take my regards to Director Zhang.

138
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,470
It depends, you know.

139
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,670
OK, Sir.

140
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,400
See you.

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,590
Ge.

142
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,670
Don't call me that.

143
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,470
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,550
Yesterday, that was quite expected.

145
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,000
Get down.

146
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,640
It won't happen again, Ge.

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,470
If it does, you'll have to leave.

148
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,470
Don't worry. I promise you.

149
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,400
Ge,
why hasn't Shen Mo come yet?

150
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,280
She resigned.

151
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,670
Why?

152
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,080
How do I know?

153
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,030
Ask that man who just left.

154
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,550
Who's he?

155
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,520
Sir.

156
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,590
Sir.

157
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:54,670
Sir.

158
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,960
Me?

159
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,670
Who are you?

160
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,030
Shen Mo's colleague.

161
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm Wang Yang.

162
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,280
We've met there.

163
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,760
What's up?

164
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,520
Ge told me that Shen Mo resigned.

165
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,000
What happened to her?

166
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,880
Is she OK?

167
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,960
Why do you ask?

168
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,550
Just... Just asking.

169
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,840
What do you want to know?

170
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,440
What's your relationship with her?

171
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,110
We're...

172
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,590
We're good friends.

173
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,400
In a relationship?

174
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,230
No.

175
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,640
No.

176
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,440
What have you done yet?

177
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,550
You know what?

178
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,520
Shen Mo won't be working here anymore.

179
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,000
Piano is just her hobby.

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,590
You know, huh?

181
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,960
She'll be a doctor, to rescue people!

182
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,590
You want to be her boyfriend?

183
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,080
You're not good enough.

184
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,440
However hard you try.

185
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,320
Do you understand?

186
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,230
Do you?

187
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,520
Yes, yes.

188
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,400
Thank you, Wang Yang.

189
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,840
Hello?

190
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,350
Hello, this is Wang Yang.

191
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,640
Sorry for yesterday.

192
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,110
When I left home, my father stopped me.

193
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,910
It's OK.

194
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,150
I didn't go there, either.

195
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,790
Then why didn't you come today?

196
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,250
Ge told me that you had resigned.

197
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,000
Why?

198
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,080
Nothing. I just don't want to work there.

199
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Anything else?

200
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,790
I bought another two tickets.

201
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,150
Shall I go watch it tomorrow?

202
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,000
No, thanks.

203
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,520
I'm busy lately.

204
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,400
Don't call me unless you have to.

205
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,760
I'll hang up.

206
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,110
Wait, wait.

207
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,200
Can we meet?

208
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,470
I have something to tell you.

209
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,230
Wang Yang.

210
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,440
I thought you wouldn't come.

211
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,000
What would you like to say? Say it.

212
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,400
I adore you.

213
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,230
We don't match.

214
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,880
Don't waste your time.

215
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,000
My time is worthless.

216
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,710
I should go back.

217
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,880
Your uncle said
I wasn't good enough for you.

218
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,550
Do you also think so?

219
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,440
Wang Yang, you're a good man.

220
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,910
But we're different.

221
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,110
You can pursue what you like
and who you like.

222
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,790
But I can't.

223
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,280
Why not?

224
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,230
I told you.

225
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,350
I can only have feelings for something.

226
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,280
And that's enough.

227
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,960
I believe in fate.

228
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,550
Don't call me anymore.

229
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,350
Farewell.

230
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,670
Shen Mo, let's bet on something.

231
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,200
What?

232
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,150
You believe in fate, huh?

233
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,030
If I jump from here and get drowned,
that'll be my fate.

234
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,910
I'll accept it.

235
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,350
But if I'm not drowned,

236
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,790
I will be your boyfriend.

237
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,710
Oh, dull.

238
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,640
Wang Yang!

239
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,880
Wang Yang!

240
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,550
Wang Yang!

241
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,590
Shen Mo!

242
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,350
Wang Yang!

243
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,470
Wang Yang!

244
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,030
Wang Yang!

245
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,840
Don't come over. Back off!

246
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,350
Shen Mo!

247
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,080
Shen Mo!

248
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,280
Put on the blanket.

249
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,880
Don't catch a cold.

250
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
You can be angry with me.

251
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,880
But don't hurt yourself.

252
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,400
What a silly girl!

253
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,840
You can't swim.

254
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
How did you dare to get into the water?

255
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,030
How could you be so irresponsible
for yourself?

256
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,280
What if you died?

257
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,320
I wouldn't die.

258
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,030
I was just teasing you.

259
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,840
It's the dry season
and the water is shallow.

260
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,790
I wouldn't be drowned.

261
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,470
Stop joking like this anymore.

262
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,590
Fine.

263
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,080
I won't tease you anymore.

264
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,070
Sorry.

265
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,230
I held you up here.

266
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,920
My uncle talked to you?

267
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,160
He talked to Ge.

268
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,430
I happened to see him.

269
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,950
Did he say anything to you?

270
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,830
Nothing much.

271
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,590
He just said I wasn't good enough for you
and asked me to stay away.

272
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,040
Why does he take care of you?

273
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,680
What about your parents?

274
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,590
They died.

275
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,800
Sorry.

276
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,190
Do you really believe in fate?

277
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,350
When I was little, a fortune-teller
told my mother

278
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,680
that my little finger had four lines
which made me tough.

279
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,640
I didn't understand then.

280
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,400
But later, I did.

281
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,590
Since the day I was born,
my fate has been set on my finger.

282
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,310
You're wrong.

283
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,230
It's in your hand.

284
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,040
You master your own fate.

285
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,710
No one but you can decide how you live.

286
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:25,820
(Victoria International Entertainment Center)

287
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,680
Looking for someone?

288
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,920
Wang Yang, my son.

289
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,520
He's a waiter here.

290
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,070
Waiters are still working.

291
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,160
Go wait back there.

292
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:51,950
There.

293
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,070
OK.

294
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,400
Wait.

295
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,590
Why do you look so familiar?

296
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,040
Have we met before?

297
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,560
You get the wrong guy.

298
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,070
I have to go.

299
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,110
I've got a meeting tomorrow.

300
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,560
You seldom come out for fun.

301
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,880
Sing a song with me before you leave.

302
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,950
I can't. I can't.

303
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,070
It's too late.

304
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,560
I have to go home and prepare
for the meeting.

305
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,950
Why is my watch slow?

306
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,070
Mr. Song,

307
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:34,040
I should learn from you
to have a tight time budget.

308
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,040
What... What are you doing?

309
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,190
Mr. Song, you're quite busy
and you're always punctual.

310
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,800
With this watch, you can read
the right time and lead the Hualin Steel.

311
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,710
Only when Hualin Steel develops
can you and I have a better life.

312
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,470
I can't... I can't take this.

313
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,640
It's too expensive.

314
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,430
It's...

315
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,920
Why can't I take it off?

316
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,230
In Hong Kong, there's a saying.

317
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:02,040
When you have a Rolex,
you don't need any other watches.

318
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,000
You should follow our saying, then.

319
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,680
We say, the more you give,
the more you get back.

320
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,430
Mr. Song,

321
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,310
I like your watch.

322
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,470
Let's exchange them.

323
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,160
That's not appropriate.

324
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,350
It is. Very appropriate.

325
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,640
Just wear this.

326
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,710
For further stuff,

327
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,400
I'll count on you.

328
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,710
Not a problem.

329
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,760
I'll drink first.

330
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,800
Come on.

331
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,800
It even has mixed colors.

332
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,430
Yang, come have lunch.

333
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,710
I won't have it!

334
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,920
Don't call him.

335
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,640
Such good dishes.

336
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,760
It'll be his own loss.

337
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,830
What a dish!

338
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,310
Why did you buy such stale vegetables?

339
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,040
For a much lower price.

340
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,830
Just eat it.

341
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,520
You eat the fresh part
and I'll eat the stale part.

342
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,830
You eat the fresh part
and then dump the stale part.

343
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,800
Why?

344
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,520
I can eat it.

345
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,470
Even a rabbit doesn't eat this.

346
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,920
I'm heading out.

347
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,470
Will you be back for dinner?

348
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,590
No.

349
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,830
Still going to that place?

350
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,310
I'm not doing anything illegal
and I get paid regularly.

351
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:01,880
What is the problem?

352
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,760
Why don't you wear that sweater?

353
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,470
See?

354
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,560
Gift blinds the wise.

355
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,430
I don't mean that.

356
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,350
I should go, Mom.

357
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,400
What a son!

358
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,280
You've been thinking for days, huh?

359
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,880
Have you decided what to give Song Yukun?

360
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,190
Think about it.

361
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,280
I was a model worker, after all.

362
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,560
At the model workers' conference,

363
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,040
I blabbed.

364
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,950
If people know I try to pull strings,
how disgraced would I be?

365
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,000
Fine, fine.

366
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,520
You care more about your pride
than your son.

367
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,070
Then don't go.

368
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,640
I didn't say I wouldn't go.

369
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,520
I'm just discussing what to give him.

370
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,710
I can't go, empty-handed.

371
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,110
What are you doing?

372
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,190
Take it back.

373
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,190
Take it back!

374
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,040
Your father gave this to us
on our wedding day.

375
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,880
We didn't even drink it
at our son's first-month dinner.

376
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,680
Take it back.

377
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,190
What do we keep it for?

378
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,470
Nowadays, if you don't give something,
you can't get what you want.

379
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,470
Go talk to him first.

380
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,040
Then we'll know how far we can go.

381
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,590
Where shall I go?

382
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,590
Wherever Song Yukun is, you go there.

383
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,710
Mr. Wang.

384
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,310
What are you staring at?

385
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,040
Nothing.

386
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,310
Just stretching myself.

387
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,830
What are you holding?

388
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,280
Something from the workshop.

389
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,680
Need any help?

390
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,230
No.

391
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,310
How nosy!

392
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,830
Why would I tell you what I'm holding?

393
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,070
The manager is a public servant
while the workers are the masters.

394
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:36,760
A master will talk to the servant
and have a drink together.

395
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,950
What's the problem with it?

396
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,310
Just some drinking stuff.

397
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,000
Here I go.

398
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,800
Mr. Song.

399
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,000
Who's that?

400
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:05,880
Mr. Wang!

401
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,310
What did you want to see me about?

402
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,760
Nothing.

403
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,280
What are you holding?

404
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,040
Alcohol.

405
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,680
It's a couple of months
before the Spring Festival.

406
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,590
This alcohol is great.

407
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,760
Years of it.

408
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,640
I don't usually drink.

409
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,160
I've kept it for years.

410
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,830
The best I have.

411
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,470
In life or work,
have you got any difficulties?

412
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,070
You're older and more experienced than me.

413
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,520
In some cases,

414
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,830
I should pick your brain.

415
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,590
Don't say that, Mr. Song.

416
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,430
I have no difficulties.

417
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,560
Really?

418
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,350
No, I don't.

419
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:10,800
Then...

420
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,640
Fine.

421
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,110
Umm...

422
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:17,880
Mr. Wang.

423
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,000
Up there,
you didn't see anything, huh?

424
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:29,950
No.

425
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,880
It was dark in your office.

426
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,000
Our factory is a big family.

427
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,160
We workers should take it as our home
and take ownership.

428
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,230
Now that it's our home,
shouldn't we protect it?

429
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,280
Of course.

430
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:02,430
My father did the first shovel of soil
on the construction of Hualin Steel.

431
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,800
Oh, really.

432
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,590
I am kind of the...

433
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,070
The parent of this family.

434
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,760
If some rumors spread out,

435
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,470
I don't care, actually.

436
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,280
But it'll hurt our factory.

437
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,760
You know, people can be very big-mouthed.

438
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,280
When they spread rumors,
they can make up a lot of things.

439
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,950
Then in the end, rumors may be ridiculous.

440
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,520
Who would suffer?

441
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,710
You? Me? Or anyone else?

442
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,560
It's actually our factory
and everyone in it.

443
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,830
Am I clear?

444
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,400
Yes.

445
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Very clear.

446
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,880
Mr. Song, honestly,

447
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,470
I didn't see anything.

448
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,590
It was so dark.

449
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,070
Absolute darkness.

450
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Glad you didn't see anything.

451
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,920
If you have any problem with life or work,
let me know.

452
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,560
No, no.

453
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,350
I have no problem at all.

454
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:29,880
Fine.

455
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,760
OK.

456
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,800
You're back?

457
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,040
You gave him the alcohol?

458
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,760
And Song Yukun accepted it?

459
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,160
Then there's hope.

460
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,430
In this case, he has to help us.

461
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,680
Which workshop can our son work in?

462
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,040
Let's not get him a forefront job.

463
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,710
Try the logistics.

464
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,110
What about the warehouse?

465
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,830
Can we try getting him a job
in the warehouse?

466
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,880
He didn't say that.

467
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,760
He didn't?

468
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,350
We didn't talk about the job thing.

469
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,800
What?

470
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,070
Then...

471
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,160
Then what did you talk about?

472
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,950
Who's that woman?

473
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,260
(Xiyuan Guesthouse)

474
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,800
Why are you standing there?

475
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,110
Take a seat.

476
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:03,950
Sit here.

477
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,230
Come over.

478
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,590
I want to talk to you.

479
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,680
Talk to me?

480
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,400
About what?

481
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,760
I won't come over unless I have to.

482
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,110
I've grown up.

483
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,560
You don't need to worry about me.

484
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,040
I can support myself.

485
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,520
You can support yourself?

486
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,800
Getting fledged, huh?

487
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,400
Wanna break off with me?

488
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:51,880
What?

489
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,110
Have I ever been unkind to you?

490
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,070
And is this how you repay me?

491
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,920
Name a number.

492
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,400
What number?

493
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,160
Since I was little,
how much money have you spent on me?

494
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,160
Do the calculation.

495
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,920
After I make money, I'll pay you back.

496
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,680
What did you say?

497
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,590
Come on.

498
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,880
Shave the hairs on your body
and count them.

499
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,350
Cut off your flesh and weigh it.

500
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,110
Then pay me back.

501
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,800
Pay me back!

502
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,760
What?

503
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,310
Repaying your seniors with your body?

504
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,560
What are you? Nezha?
[*Role in ancient Chinese myth]

505
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,760
Having three heads and six arms?
[*Nezha has three heads and six arms.]

506
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,950
Darn it!

507
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,040
I afford your school in Hualin,
not your relationship with a man!

508
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,880
How old are you?

509
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,760
Childish!

510
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,280
Do you know what love is?

511
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:03,070
Besides, if he knows what happened to you,
would he still love you?

512
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,360
You have to be with me.

513
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,120
We're a family!

514
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,600
You have to be with me.

515
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,430
Forever!

516
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,320
Understand?

517
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,430
My parents died years ago.

518
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,760
You and I have never been a family.

519
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,630
What did you say?

520
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,320
What?

521
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:38,360
Get down here.

522
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,040
I said, get down here!

523
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,040
Darn it!

524
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:57,710
How dare you!

525
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,040
How dare you say that!

526
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,560
How dare you!

527
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,800
How dare you!

528
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,470
What?

529
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,560
What?

530
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,560
You didn't hear me, huh?

531
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:05,630
Don't move.

532
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,360
Give it to me!

533
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,560
Getting bold, huh?

534
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,710
Are you?

535
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:15,710
Are you getting too bold?

536
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,600
Are you?

537
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,760
You dared to stand against me, huh?

538
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,670
Try again.

539
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,390
What are you doing here?

540
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:20,870
Come on.

541
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,470
Did you annoy him again?

542
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,280
Just apologize.

543
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,040
Get out!

544
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:36,230
Before I die, you can't leave me.

545
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,430
Do you hear?

546
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,040
Hold back your tears.

547
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,560
Hold back your tears.

548
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,280
Hold back your tears.

549
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,040
Hold back your tears.

550
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,430
Hold them back.

551
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,360
Hold back...

552
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,120
Hold back your tears!

553
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,080
Hold back your tears!

554
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,950
How dare you...

555
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,950
How dare you stand against me!

556
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,840
How daring!

557
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,390
Challenge me again.

558
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,840
9532657.

559
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,710
Has the owner replied?

560
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,760
Make a few more calls, then.

561
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,230
Yang.

562
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,320
Here.

563
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,600
Go to the Locomotive Dept.

564
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,040
and deliver dinner to your father. Go.

565
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,390
Why?

566
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,600
I've got something to do tonight.

567
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,870
And there are canteens.

568
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,150
Your father will work overtime tonight.

569
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,470
No hot dishes in the canteen then.

570
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,390
Stop dawdling and just go.

571
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,600
Don't shake it or it'll spill.

572
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,600
Got it.

573
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,520
Go quickly.

574
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,390
Or it'll get cold.

575
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,390
OK.

576
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:53,660
(Focus on safety, Promote production,
Pursue good quality, Get benefits)

577
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:54,840
Yang.

578
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,560
Mr. Xing.

579
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,320
Why are you riding so fast
inside the factory?

580
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,280
My father is working overtime
for the inspection.

581
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,600
My mother asked me to deliver dinner.

582
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,600
Inspection?

583
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,670
It's the payday today.

584
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
Your father is in the Finance Dept.

585
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,150
Where is it, then?

586
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,760
I'll make a call and take you there.

587
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,470
Thank you, Mr. Xing.

588
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,280
Come on.

589
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,000
Luckily, you met me.

590
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,040
Or you would have gone the wrong way.

591
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,390
The round trip would take two hours.

592
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,910
Thanks, Mr. Xing.

593
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,080
Don't mention it.

594
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,150
Your father and I are close.

595
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,470
Here we are.

596
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,870
I won't get in with you.

597
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,000
Fine. I'll go, Mr. Xing.

598
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,390
Go ahead.

599
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,000
Yang.

600
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,710
(Finance Dept.)

601
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,630
Just get in.

602
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,230
They won't hear your knock.

603
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,040
Fine, I get it, Mr. Xing.

604
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,080
Get back to your work.

605
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,080
Dad.

606
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:58,950
Dad?

607
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:09,100
(Restricted Area
Authorized Personnel Only)

608
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,320
What are you doing there?

609
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,630
I delivered dinner to my father.

610
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,760
My father is Wang Xiang
with the Locomotive Dept.

611
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,800
What dinner? Come out.

612
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,390
The door is locked.

613
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,000
Go get the key.

614
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,280
Go.

615
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,080
Let me go!

616
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,040
I just delivered dinner to my father!

617
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,230
Why did you catch me?

618
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,670
You delivered dinner to the safe?

619
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,870
Let your father see you in prison!

620
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,150
Go!

621
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,360
What are you doing there?

622
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,670
Mr. Xing.

623
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,760
What happened?

624
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,710
Section Chief Xing,
we caught a thief in the Finance Office.

625
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,080
Mr. Xing, just tell them
that I delivered dinner to my father.

626
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,150
They accused me of stealing.

627
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,230
Delivered dinner to your father?

628
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,360
Was he transferred to the Finance Dept.?

629
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,910
What do you mean, Mr. Xing?

630
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,280
What do I mean? Take him away!

631
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,040
Go!

632
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,600
Go!

633
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:22,870
Go!

634
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:23,670
But Mr. Xing...

635
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,800
Mr. Xing!

636
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,630
Go!

637
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,390
Let go of me!

638
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,390
Stop struggling and go!

639
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,000
Don't touch me!

640
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,560
So fragile?

641
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,950
You have no idea.

642
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,390
It's made of imported wool.

643
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,080
Really?

644
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,280
Let me have a look.

645
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,120
My son bought this for me.

646
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,840
Why don't you keep it in a shrine?

647
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,870
Jealous, huh?

648
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,360
Have a son
and he'll buy one for you.

649
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,120
Mr. Wang, Mr. Wang.

650
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,040
What? What's wrong?

651
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,080
Something happened.

652
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,040
Go take a look.

653
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,760
What happened?

654
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,710
Another failure of the steam valve?

655
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,360
No.

656
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,910
Go take a look. Wang Yang!

657
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,840
What happened to Wang Yang?

658
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,120
He's accused of stealing
and being sent to the Security Section.

659
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:16,910
Stop!

660
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:20,320
We should protect
everything in our factory.

661
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,190
- This is what
- Stop!

662
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,320
every worker should do.

663
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,600
Protect everything in our factory...

664
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,320
Let go of him!

665
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,710
Let him go!

666
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,280
Hands off him!

667
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,150
Let... Let go of him!

668
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,390
What are you doing?

669
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,520
Ask them to free my son!

670
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,950
Disturbing our work, huh?

671
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,910
Wang Xiang, I warn you.

672
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,950
If you keep making trouble, you'll be
punished immediately. Believe it or not.

673
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,600
Xing Jianchun,
if we have a problem, say it.

674
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,670
Let go of my son!

675
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,320
Let him go!

676
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,080
We can't.

677
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Back in your home, he's your son.

678
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,840
But here, he's a thief.

679
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,670
I'm not!

680
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,360
What did he steal?

681
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,760
What did he steal?

682
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,840
Let me tell you.

683
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,000
The lock of the Finance Dept.

684
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
was defeated.

685
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,950
When we arrived, he was in there.

686
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,600
And the safe was open.

687
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,230
I didn't.

688
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,120
I didn't touch anything!

689
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,840
What were you doing in the Finance Dept.?

690
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,320
Xing Jianchun told me you were there!

691
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,320
Did you hear him?

692
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,000
How impolite!

693
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,670
Xing Jianchun, Xing Jianchun...

694
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,150
How could a young man like him
call me that?

695
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,230
You trapped him, huh?

696
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,950
Xing Jianchun, if you want something,
come at me!

697
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,600
Why did you trap my son?

698
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,910
What are you talking about?

699
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,360
Your son was caught
in the Finance Dept.

700
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,120
You know?

701
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,840
In the safe is
everyone's pay for this month!

702
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,470
If I hadn't gone there early,
he couldn't even be standing here!

703
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,320
Think it over, OK?

704
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,040
How about this?

705
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,320
Let go of my son and let's talk over here.

706
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,560
Where?

707
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,360
What?

708
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,630
Pulling me?

709
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:44,910
Wang Xiang, tell me.

710
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,080
What am I?

711
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,470
The chief of the Security Section.

712
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,150
Business is business, right?

713
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,840
Lately, we've lost a lot of things, right?

714
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,390
Yes.

715
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,760
A lot of things, small or big.

716
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,630
Even a five-ton machine was lost.

717
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,040
What do we do?

718
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,800
Mr. Song gave an order.

719
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,430
Whenever we catch a thief,
we give him severe penalties.

720
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,910
Dad, Dad, he framed me up!

721
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,600
Let's call the police!

722
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,360
Go ahead!

723
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,760
There's a phone in the office.

724
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,670
Shall I dial for you?

725
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:18,950
Call the police.

726
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,000
Give Wang Yang a criminal record.

727
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,390
OK.

728
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:29,800
Jianchun.

729
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,280
Jianchun.

730
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,120
Come on.

731
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,000
What?

732
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,840
Just a minute.

733
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,760
What for?

734
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,120
Come.

735
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,360
Don't pull me.

736
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,040
Jianchun, from now on,

737
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,800
I'll certainly help you.

738
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:52,600
I mean, if you want me to
transport something, let me know.

739
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,390
I'll help, OK?

740
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,430
You will?

741
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:57,910
Yes.

742
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,760
I don't think so.

743
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,560
I promise.

744
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,040
Wang Xiang, here's the thing.

745
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,910
It's not about whether you'll help me,
but that I'm helping you.

746
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,600
I'm helping to save your son.

747
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,080
Yes.

748
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,390
If you can't realize this logic,

749
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:16,040
I'll have to stay out of this.

750
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,630
The police will take care, then.

751
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,150
In the Public Security Bureau,
no matter what your son did,

752
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,800
it would be written in his file
for the rest of his life, you know?

753
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,710
Yes, yes. You...

754
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,390
Laosi.

755
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:25,470
Okay.

756
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:26,390
Laosi!

757
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:26,840
What?

758
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,230
Come back.

759
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,800
Jianchun, I used to be childish.

760
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:36,080
Please help me and help my son.

761
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:36,910
Don't hurt him, please.

762
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:38,080
Come on.

763
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,560
You changed your mind really fast.

764
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:49,390
Beg me, then.

765
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,390
I'm begging you! I am.

766
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,710
Dad, don't beg him!

767
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,040
You...

768
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,710
Shut up!

769
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,040
Let go of my son.

770
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,000
How should you beg me?

771
00:43:59,360 --> 00:43:59,910
Louder.

772
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:02,800
Fine.

773
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,950
Section Chief Xing is
doing the right thing.

774
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,430
Saplings should be trimmed
and children should be educated!

775
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,190
My son is ignorant
and should be given a lesson.

776
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,150
Sounds reasonable.

777
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:20,280
Come on.

778
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,080
Come on.

779
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,710
Let him go.

780
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,080
Let him go. Do it.

781
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,870
Wang Xiang,
laws are ruthless but humans aren't.

782
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,360
Today, I'll do you this favor.

783
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:33,230
Take your son back and educate him.

784
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:33,710
OK.

785
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:34,080
OK.

786
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,430
Our colleagues are watching.

787
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,150
Make an apology.

788
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:43,760
OK.

789
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,150
Come on.

790
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,150
Wang Yang,
make a formal apology to Mr. Xing.

791
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,520
But he framed me.

792
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:51,710
Shut up!

793
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,280
Apologize!

794
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:53,560
Hurry.

795
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:56,670
Apologize!

796
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,510
Mr. Xing.

797
00:45:12,724 --> 00:45:14,116
Screw you!

798
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:35,710
The pork bones make nutritious soup.

799
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,910
With some pickled cabbage.

800
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,000
My son loves that.

801
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:40,800
OK.

802
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,600
OK.

803
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,800
Have you had dinner?

804
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,040
Wang Xiang.

805
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:09,520
Coming for revenge?

806
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,080
I do want it.

807
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,470
But I'm too weak to fight.

808
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:16,800
What?

809
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:18,630
Still living here?

810
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,560
I didn't dare to move away, in case
Wang Yang couldn't find his way home.

811
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,520
Guess what?

812
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,000
In the past few years,

813
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,190
I've often had dreams.

814
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,320
And in my dream,

815
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:36,470
I still live here.

816
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,000
Why do you carry that urine bag?

817
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,520
I have uremia.

818
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,430
Can it be cured?

819
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,470
Anyway,

820
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,040
I'll just live as long as I can.

821
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,560
Have dialysis three times a week.

822
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:03,710
All right. Don't stand here.

823
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:04,230
Let's get in.

824
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,870
I brought you some native eggs.

825
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,150
For your green onions.

826
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:10,910
Perfect match.

827
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,080
Have you brought some sauce?

828
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:14,910
Why would I?

829
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,430
What were you thinking?

830
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:17,360
Sauce?

831
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,150
How about I prepare everything for you?

832
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,230
Keep the eggs to yourself.

833
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:21,950
You're in poor health.

834
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:23,320
Take good care of yourself.

835
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,670
I can afford eggs.

836
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:26,520
If so, why did you sell
fake license plates?

837
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,950
I just came to tell you about that.

838
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,600
You came to confess, huh?

839
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:30,870
Welcome.

840
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,560
Don't pick a quarrel, OK?

841
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,520
I'm a mere deliveryman.

842
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,120
Scalper, in the jargon.

843
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,360
And what's it called in Hong Kong?

844
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,760
Minion.

845
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,360
I know.

846
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,800
It means hatchet man.

847
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,870
People in Hong Kong
like to use the word "man".

848
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,120
Something like the ganger.

849
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:49,870
Yeah, you know.

850
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:50,910
You know everything.

851
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:51,760
You said a Cantonese word.

852
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,950
I'm afraid they couldn't understand.

853
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,520
It's called mule in foreign countries.

854
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,150
Do you also know that?

855
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:56,430
Yes, I do.

856
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:57,520
Always the animal.

857
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:58,040
Who are you calling an animal?

858
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:58,910
Stop, stop.

859
00:47:58,910 --> 00:47:59,630
Useless information.

860
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:01,190
Say something meaningful.

861
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:02,080
Come on.

862
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,710
I only deliver the license plates,
instead of making any.

863
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,280
Based on my professional ethics,

864
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:13,390
I won't tell you
who makes the license plates.

865
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:17,390
Anyway, 357F was really sold by me.

866
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:18,280
I'm sure.

867
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,800
But why was my license plate copied?

868
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,800
The plate makers
never care whose plate it is.

869
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,080
It's just like the lottery.

870
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,190
The luck thing.

871
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:25,670
Drop the useless information.

872
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,120
Come on. Tell us.

873
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:27,760
When was it sold?

874
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,190
About half a month ago,
in front of Jianmei Community.

875
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:32,430
I remember clearly.

876
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:34,950
Have you got that guy's number?

877
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,120
No.

878
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:39,910
When I'm asked to deliver something,

879
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:40,910
I just deliver it.

880
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:41,950
I don't ask about anything else.

881
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:46,840
But, through my analysis and deduction,

882
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,870
this guy must be living
in that community.

883
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,230
How did you know?

884
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,080
If you delivered it to the police station,
would he be a policeman?

885
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,190
You shut up!

886
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:58,710
What was my job?

887
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:59,120
Huh?

888
00:48:59,120 --> 00:48:59,800
What was it?

889
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,190
The chief of the Security Section, OK?

890
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,800
I got some skills.

891
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,840
Was that an authorized job?

892
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,430
What does it have anything
to do with you?

893
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:06,630
He was that authorized guy.

894
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:07,600
Did you have a police number?

895
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,390
Anyway, I was doing better than you.

896
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:11,520
Don't waste time.

897
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,150
Come on.

898
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:13,760
Continue.

899
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,600
If I hadn't found some signs,

900
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,600
I wouldn't be talking nonsense now.

901
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,800
Would I? Huh?

902
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,150
Go on.

903
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,840
That guy came out of this community,
wearing slippers.

904
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,600
What kind of slippers?

905
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,000
What kind of slippers?

906
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,360
Non-peep-toe slippers.

907
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:28,910
What color?

908
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,230
Color of what?

909
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:31,520
Toes?

910
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,670
Slippers, I mean.

911
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,080
What a weird question!

912
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,150
You didn't see that?

913
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:37,430
How... How could I…?

914
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:37,870
I just...

915
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:38,470
What the heck!

916
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:39,760
Jianchun,
what does that guy look like?

917
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,520
Do you still remember?

918
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,710
A rough image.

919
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,600
My son is back.

920
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,280
Uncle Biao.

921
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:49,840
You're back, Bei.

922
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,520
How are you prepared for the exam?

923
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,390
Can you pass it?

924
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:53,150
Not bad.

925
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:54,470
My son is clever.

926
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,080
Why are you back so late?

927
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,230
I did some shopping.

928
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:58,870
Having a girlfriend?

929
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,040
No.

930
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:00,950
Don't tease him.

931
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:01,910
This is Mr. Ma.

932
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,520
Mr. Ma.

933
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,230
This is Mr. Xing.

934
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,150
Hello, Mr. Xing.

935
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,190
He looks like you, Wang.

936
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,840
I mean, you're getting more
like your father, young man.

937
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,870
I was lost in chatting
that I forgot to make dinner for him.

938
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:10,630
It's OK, Dad.

939
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:11,320
Go on with your conversation.

940
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:11,800
I'll make dinner later.

941
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,560
Bei, are you hungry?

942
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:13,910
Not really.

943
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,520
If you're not,
can you get us your drawing board?

944
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,840
What do you want it for?

945
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,120
The mouth...

946
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:32,360
Drooping a little bit.

947
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:34,000
OK.

948
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:36,560
You know what?

949
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,120
Bei... He really has a painting talent.

950
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:41,760
Can you confirm this?

951
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,430
Look. I can almost confirm.

952
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:46,520
The one you nearly caught in the garage?

953
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,800
I didn't see him clearly.

954
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,080
He crawled through the fields.

955
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,000
Dad, who would you catch?

956
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:54,080
Someone faked
my license plate, you know?

957
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,000
Just this guy.

958
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,470
Your father tried to catch him but failed.

959
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:59,150
Let's... Let's get out and talk.

960
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,320
And have some water.

961
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:00,840
Go.

962
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:02,840
I don't want any water.

963
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,000
Where's the toilet?

964
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,520
My bag is full.

965
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,950
I'll make you something delicious to eat.

966
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,330
OK.

967
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,320
Get going.

968
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,120
Let's guard there for him.

969
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:21,840
That community has only one entrance.

970
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,430
He can't get away this time.

971
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,320
Captain Ma,
how about you two go there?

972
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,190
Wang Bei is leaving tomorrow.

973
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:30,870
I want to have dinner with him
to see him off.

974
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:31,760
Leaving tomorrow?

975
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,230
You should have told us.

976
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,870
Fine. We'll go first.

977
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:36,430
Well, umm...

978
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:37,800
Your son is going to college.

979
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,320
What are you doing?

980
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,430
No, Biao.

981
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,080
It's for Wang Bei.

982
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,280
I know your condition.

983
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:44,870
Don't struggle.

984
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:45,670
It's not for you!

985
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:46,280
Just take it. Take it.

986
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,600
But he's in poor condition.

987
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,120
Going to Beijing tomorrow?

988
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:51,360
Give him some instructions.

989
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,000
OK. OK.

990
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:52,390
Fine.

991
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:59,230
I'm no longer needed, huh?

992
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:01,800
They've left?

993
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:03,430
Thank you for this.

994
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:06,360
What are you doing?

995
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,520
Don't bother to thank me.

996
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,870
How about you stay for dinner?

997
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,230
Stop pretending, huh?

998
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Even if you really wanted me to stay,

999
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,320
I'm not in the mood.

1000
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:16,280
I have to earn money for my dialysis.

1001
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:20,040
Jianchun.

1002
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:24,520
What?

1003
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:29,320
From now on,
don't do anything illegal anymore.

1004
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,360
What an insult!

1005
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,470
Don't do that.

1006
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:33,870
I mean...

1007
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:35,320
Take it back. Take it back.

1008
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:35,630
I mean...

1009
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:36,520
Well, listen to me.

1010
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,630
Just a token of my care.

1011
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,840
Take the money back.

1012
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,360
I have more money than you.

1013
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:46,230
Well, just...

1014
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,360
Call me Jianchun.

1015
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,600
Sounds closer.

1016
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:53,760
Got it?

1017
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,760
I...

1018
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,150
I won't do anything illegal anymore.

1019
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,910
Even if you didn't stop me,
the police would.

1020
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:03,630
Right?

1021
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,910
No one wants to die in the prison, does he?

1022
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,430
Bei, come and have dinner.

1023
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,230
Come on.

1024
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,560
Bei, dinner is ready.

1025
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,230
You just drink the juice.

1026
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,560
Let me propose a toast.

1027
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:49,870
My son, hope you will succeed
in the exam and get a high score.

1028
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,870
Enjoy the food when it's still hot.

1029
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:02,560
Have some pork.

1030
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:03,760
Thanks, Dad.

1031
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:10,840
Taste this.

1032
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:11,600
Smells great.

1033
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:15,800
Dad.

1034
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:19,320
May I ask you something?

1035
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,190
Don't keep anything from me.

1036
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,760
Are you doing something
related to my brother's case?

1037
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:36,080
Sort of.

1038
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,800
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

1039
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,470
I just didn't want you to be involved.

1040
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,120
Now, you should do
what you're supposed to do.

1041
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:51,000
When you're doing very well,

1042
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,950
I would be pleased.

1043
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:08,080
Back then, my brother was
nearly as old as me, huh?

1044
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:16,760
He wanted to go out of this city
but I stopped him all the time

1045
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,360
and didn't let him go.

1046
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,000
At that time,

1047
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:22,230
I didn't know what he wanted.

1048
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,470
Now I do.

1049
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,190
But it's too late.

1050
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:34,910
Dad, I...

1051
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,230
I don't want to go to Beijing.

1052
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,320
I don't care
about the college thing, actually.

1053
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:42,710
But you're getting old.

1054
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,040
I don't want to stay too far.

1055
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:06,520
Bei, you and your brother have something
in common and something different.

1056
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:10,670
Because you're not my biological son,

1057
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,280
you don't need to stay with me here
for the rest of your life.

1058
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,230
As the old saying goes,
home is where the heart is.

1059
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,150
I have to end up dead in Hualin.

1060
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:27,950
And...

1061
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,150
Without you,

1062
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:34,840
I wouldn't still be alive.

1063
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:40,840
You and I have no regrets.

1064
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,600
I get it, Dad.

1065
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,280
Drop this topic.

1066
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:49,710
It'd disturb our appetite.

1067
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,470
Come on. Another drink.

1068
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:56,560
Cheers.

1069
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,190
Well, Dad,

1070
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,630
I have a train to catch tomorrow morning.

1071
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:10,870
I'll go get packed.

1072
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:12,150
I'm full.

1073
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,230
You are?

1074
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,470
Yes.

1075
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:18,040
Fine. Go to bed early.

1076
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:19,560
Tomorrow morning,

1077
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,150
I'll drive you to the train station.

1078
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,150
Are you sitting tight?

1079
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,040
Yes.

1080
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,150
Hold me tight.

1081
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:15,710
I'm speeding up!

1082
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:22,710
Dad.

1083
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,630
Do you know who I am?

1084
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,390
Wang Yang.

1085
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:34,320
Oh, you're Wang Bei.

1086
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:46,840
Bei?

1087
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:51,910
Yang?
