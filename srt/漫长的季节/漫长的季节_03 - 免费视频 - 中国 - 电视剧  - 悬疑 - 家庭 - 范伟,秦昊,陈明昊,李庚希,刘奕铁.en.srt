=The Long Season 3=

2
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,860
(Xingtun Quarter 2)

3
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
Biao.

4
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,960
Gong Biao?

5
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,960
Are you in?

6
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,220
(Hualin Taxi)

7
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,750
See you, Hao.

8
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,600
Bye.

9
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,670
Drive safe.

10
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,240
Back it slowly.

11
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,830
See you.

12
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,360
Hey, Liru.

13
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,800
Hi.

14
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,270
What brings you here?

15
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,000
Did Biao go out?

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,390
He didn't answer my calls.

17
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,960
Aren't you two driving in turns?

18
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,000
If you don't know where he is,
how could I?

19
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,390
Did you check that drugstore?

20
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,550
I heard you two fought.

21
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,670
You see,

22
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,910
I shouldn't have stepped in,
but I know Biao.

23
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,440
He's a good man in general.

24
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,720
Couples bicker all the time.

25
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Look, you've stepped in
from the very beginning.

26
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,320
Without you, we wouldn't have met,
let alone married.

27
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,110
Marriage is about two people

28
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,830
building a life together
and living it on their own.

29
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,750
Don't you agree?

30
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,750
Is there anything else?

31
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,630
Uh, no.

32
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,110
Well, please tell him
that I need to see him.

33
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,470
Sure.

34
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,360
Hey, would you like to come upstairs?

35
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,190
Oh, no, no, thanks.

36
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,080
I'll see you around.

37
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,000
If he's busy, just call me.

38
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,110
Got it.

39
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,110
Alright. Come on.

40
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,950
Look at you addicts,
playing cards so early.

41
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,640
Business is slow at this time anyway.

42
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,550
We could use some fun.

43
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,200
Have you seen Biao?

44
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,880
No.

45
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,760
I saw him earlier.

46
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,600
Where was he?

47
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,880
Banging it at the arcade.

48
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,720
Banging on what?

49
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,160
Let's see the card!

50
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,790
You can't beat me!

51
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,950
Come on!

52
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,200
Lost a couple of rounds last night.

53
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,920
It's about time.

54
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,510
Biao, why didn't you answer my calls?

55
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,270
How did you find me?

56
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,510
Seriously?

57
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,600
Now isn't the time to play.

58
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,550
Stop lecturing me.

59
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,640
I'm earning points.

60
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,830
See? They're almost enough.

61
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,510
I'm this close to winning the money
for Liru's beauty salon.

62
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,760
Such high stakes?

63
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,110
What's going on?

64
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,160
Move!

65
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,230
Come on!

66
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,230
I got it.

67
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,160
Hey, I'm cashing in.

68
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,230
That's a lot of money.

69
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,040
I got lucky today.

70
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,600
Skip this machine.

71
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,510
I drained it.

72
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,110
Use another one.

73
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,920
Come on, pay up!

74
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,510
Hurry!

75
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:16,950
Coming.

76
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,600
Don't move!

77
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,950
Don't move, all of you!

78
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,920
Get down!

79
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,880
I haven't got my money.

80
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,320
Stop, you two!

81
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,510
Where are you going?

82
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,950
He played, not me.

83
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,790
I simply watched.

84
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,350
Shut up and get down.

85
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,720
We'll find out
when we get back to the station.

86
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,070
Get down!

87
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,070
Sir...

88
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,830
Who's moving over there?

89
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,160
Sir...

90
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,720
Don't move!

91
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,600
Don't move!

92
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,720
Sir!

93
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,950
What?

94
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,760
All for nothing.

95
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,230
Sir!

96
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,640
They didn't even let me speak.

97
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,230
My legs are numb.

98
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,230
Are you a dragon?

99
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,510
Yeah.

100
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,160
Why?

101
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,510
Once we get out,
let's go to the fortuneteller.

102
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,510
You must be a jinx.

103
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,640
I was doing great and about to win,
then you waltzed in and ruined everything.

104
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,040
I thought you're a jinx.

105
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,760
If you hadn't gambled,

106
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
I wouldn't have been here.

107
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,600
I did it for Xuelu...

108
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,670
What are you guys doing?

109
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,040
Hey, you, go over there.

110
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,950
Let's switch places.

111
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,920
The police officer says so.

112
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,720
Get down!

113
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,640
Did I ask you to stand up?

114
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,320
I did it for Xuelu.

115
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,830
Huang Liru keeps all our money.

116
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,670
She won't give me any.

117
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,830
And ICU costs eight grand per day.

118
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,600
What could I do?

119
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,550
I said I'll take care of it.

120
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,600
With what?

121
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,600
I paid the deposit last night.

122
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,720
Why didn't you tell me?

123
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,000
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

124
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,350
What are you looking at?

125
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,790
You seem familiar.

126
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,390
Because I'm your dad?

127
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,440
Wang Li, come here.

128
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,510
Some attitude you got!

129
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,640
Are you from Guangdong?

130
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,790
Fleeing hither and thither
all the way here?

131
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,080
Qiao.

132
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,280
Go with him.

133
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,280
Fix him!

134
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,840
Wang Xiang, come here.

135
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,760
Gong Biao.

136
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,400
Sir.

137
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,000
You too.

138
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,150
I've reviewed your statements.

139
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,470
Wang Xiang is free to go.

140
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,000
Gong Biao, you'll be fined
for your minor offense, and...

141
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,200
you won't be detained.

142
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,880
But no more gambling.

143
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,320
Yes, sir.

144
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,320
Sign it.

145
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,960
You can go once the paperwork is done.

146
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,080
Alright. You may leave.

147
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,710
Yes, sir.

148
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,230
Dad.

149
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,520
Oh, you don't need to come.

150
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,320
What did you do?

151
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Why did they arrest you?

152
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,350
We weren't arrested.

153
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,030
They needed us for their investigation.

154
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,320
What on earth happened?

155
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
I'm worried sick!

156
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,200
He went there to find me
and got dragged in as a looker-on.

157
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,760
He was one even when he was young.

158
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,350
Clearly, you haven't changed a bit.

159
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,030
Enough. Let's talk outside.

160
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,670
I need air.

161
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,880
What's wrong with your leg?

162
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,030
It's numb after hours of sitting.

163
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,790
Hey, Bei,
good luck with your exam in Beijing.

164
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,550
Don't be like your old man
driving trains and then cars.

165
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,550
He's been behind the wheel all his life.

166
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,960
Uncle Biao, didn't you also go to college?

167
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,150
I'm not a good example.

168
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,960
I'm unappreciated,
and your dad is making things worse.

169
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,150
Look at you.

170
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,790
Hold my arm.

171
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,590
I'm fine.

172
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,230
The veins in your lower limbs are
still blocked.

173
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,960
I guess. I'll be fine.

174
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,590
Hey, Bei, go get a cab for Qiaoyun.

175
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,960
OK.

176
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,880
Let's go back together.

177
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,400
Go to my place.

178
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,550
I'll give you a massage.

179
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,150
My car is still over there.

180
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,470
I need to get it back.

181
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,670
I'll go to your shop later.

182
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,320
Just go.

183
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
Are you sure you're OK?

184
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,030
Go.

185
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,470
Aunt Qiaoyun!

186
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,030
I'm going back.

187
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,440
Go ahead.

188
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
See you at the shop.

189
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,520
See you later.

190
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,350
I'm leaving, too.

191
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,760
Haven't slept for two days.

192
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,710
Hold on.

193
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,000
Come here.

194
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,520
What now?

195
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,110
Come.

196
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,110
I feel like an owl.

197
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,710
Where did you get it?

198
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,150
Near the substation,
less than five meters.

199
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,840
What are you thinking?

200
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,470
Are you saying what happened
to Xuelu isn't an accident?

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,880
What do you think?

202
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,670
Accident or not, we don't know yet.

203
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,080
But if we don't get to the bottom of it,
you won't have your car back, right?

204
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,640
Without your car,
what are you gonna tell Liru?

205
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,670
More importantly,
what are we gonna tell Xuelu?

206
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,640
All I hear is words.

207
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,910
What's your point?

208
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,080
To dig deeper?

209
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,400
This series of incidents began
with that fake-licensed car, right?

210
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,960
In that case, we should start from there.

211
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,880
Anyway, it's your call.

212
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,110
If I'm doing it,
it's not for you or the car.

213
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,280
I'm doing it for Xuelu.

214
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,030
Whatever works.

215
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,470
But we can't do it alone.

216
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,080
We need someone's help.

217
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,880
Who is it?

218
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,300
(To Dance, To Live, To Love)

219
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,670
Desheng.

220
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,280
Desheng, Desheng, Desheng!

221
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,760
I could've done better.

222
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,640
You know I'm good.

223
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,880
We did three turns, down by a half.

224
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,910
Li failed to keep up.

225
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,960
Are you alright?

226
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,030
Desheng,

227
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,550
I like your dance moves and your look.

228
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,590
Have you seen The Godfather?

229
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,030
Italian movie, starring Marlon Delansheng.
[*He said the actor's name wrong.]

230
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,520
You two will be able to compete
at the city level.

231
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,880
We can all do better.

232
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,640
You two did well, too,
but your moves need more power.

233
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,230
I mean...

234
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,440
No power, no charm.

235
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,670
Gather round, everyone.

236
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,540
And be more passionate.

237
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,080
We're gonna select those

238
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,030
- to compete at the city level.
- You need more practice.

239
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,840
We've had a discussion
and made the decision.

240
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,280
Those who will compete

241
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,670
at the city level for our U3A
[*U3A=University of the Third Age]

242
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,590
are Sun Wancheng and Zhou Xiaoyan.

243
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,760
Quit it!

244
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,440
You chose them based on what?

245
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,230
Why those two?

246
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,110
Clearly, our routine is more difficult.

247
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,080
And we've got better looks.

248
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,790
Look, your moves are fine,
but Latin is also about coordination.

249
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,520
You and your partner failed to dance
as a team.

250
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,760
What do you mean?

251
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,150
So they're better than us?

252
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,470
They even missed the beats.

253
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,440
Everyone saw it, right?

254
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,960
The last few moves...

255
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,520
They were slow!

256
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,640
Calm down, Desheng.

257
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,550
It's OK. You can go.

258
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,520
It's not about that.

259
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,350
Go away.

260
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,640
This isn't about the dance moves...

261
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,840
Don't change the subject.

262
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,280
It's no secret that his daughter bought
you guys two speakers.

263
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,520
It's rigged, isn't it?

264
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,000
Did you take bribes?

265
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,320
Alright, enough.

266
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,640
I won't argue with you.

267
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,670
Dismissed, everyone.

268
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,640
You can't keep my mouth shut!

269
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,760
Playing dirty tricks in such a sanctuary?

270
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,790
I quit.

271
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,080
As long as I'm committed,

272
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
I can dance anywhere.

273
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,280
Captain Ma.

274
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,710
We've been watching you dance.

275
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,350
Do you recognize me?

276
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,080
Wang Xiang?

277
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,400
What brings you here?

278
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,030
It's been a while, and you're
as charming as always.

279
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,670
Swill!

280
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,670
Dump your swill!

281
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,460
(Xu's Cold Noodles)

282
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,640
You're late.

283
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,230
I made it.

284
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,000
What took you so long?

285
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,000
Hurry.

286
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,520
What's the rush?

287
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,590
I'm working around the clock.

288
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,080
Do you feel cold?

289
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,760
I'm OK.

290
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,840
When you're done, take a break inside.

291
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
Maybe later.

292
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,840
It's stuck.

293
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,400
I'll remove the clog.

294
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,520
What is it?

295
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,710
Be careful!

296
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,840
Look!

297
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Look at it!

298
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,550
Who'd dump that in?

299
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,590
Of course it'd stuck.

300
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:04,920
Goodness!

301
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,760
Shame on you!

302
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,190
What an animal!

303
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,800
(Lard's Stewed Bones)
You're sick!

304
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,680
You got jealous of our business
and meant to sabotage it!

305
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,280
You pig!

306
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,520
You'll be doomed!

307
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,760
Don't let me catch you, or I'll go to
your place and flood it with poop!

308
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,590
There's more.

309
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,590
How evil!

310
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,560
That guy is a monster!

311
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,470
This is a bag of evidence.

312
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,640
Hey, Gui.

313
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,590
What?

314
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,800
Take a look.

315
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,950
What's wrong?

316
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,950
Is... is that a foot?

317
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,800
Are you Ms. Xu?

318
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Did you find it?

319
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,640
I didn't do it, not me.

320
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,110
I didn't say you did it.

321
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Not me, either.

322
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,230
They freaked out.

323
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,470
Too scared to say anything.

324
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,710
So you two...

325
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,920
Nothing.

326
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,400
We're just friends.

327
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,070
Where's, uh, Cui Guodong?

328
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,560
I just saw him outside.

329
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,400
I don't care about your relationship.

330
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,070
I'm asking about this case.

331
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,230
I don't know.

332
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,280
I don't know anything.

333
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,950
Captain Ma!

334
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,470
Where are you?

335
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,400
Right here.

336
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,280
Look up.

337
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,400
(Xu's Cold Noodles)
What are you doing up there?

338
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,950
See for yourself.

339
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,470
Here.

340
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,590
Is the roof strong enough for you?

341
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,400
Don't worry.

342
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,920
Have you had breakfast?

343
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,520
Not yet.

344
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,160
Look over there.

345
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,430
The Thermal Power Plant has regrouped
long ago.

346
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,560
They've got severance pay
and professional training.

347
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,350
What are you talking about?

348
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,190
We're worried about the layoffs
given our factory's current situation.

349
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,110
Other factories are doing well,
but why not ours?

350
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,640
Hey, it's lunchtime.

351
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,590
Chitchat won't fill your stomach.

352
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,430
Don't you know there's a layoff list?

353
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:07,000
For those on it, there will be
seniority buy-outs.

354
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,680
No severance pay.

355
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,000
So that's only thousands of yuan.

356
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,350
Thousands?

357
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,070
Tens of thousands won't cover
the rest of my life.

358
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,760
I don't need a few coins
as a handout jingling in my pocket.

359
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,710
I know, right?

360
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,310
But, hey, Mr. Wang,
you have nothing to worry about.

361
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,920
They'll lay off anyone but you.

362
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,310
Mr. Wang, they found
another bag of remains

363
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,310
at the cold noodles shop in the back.

364
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,280
You know that?

365
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,680
I was there just now.

366
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,280
Ms. Xu looked overwhelmed.

367
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,070
Were the police at the scene?

368
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,590
They didn't tell you this time?

369
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,920
They know I'm a busy man.

370
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,230
If you ask me, we can set up a BBQ stall.

371
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,400
The cost is minimum.

372
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,230
We can find a place and do it.

373
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,640
Eat without me.

374
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,880
I'm going out.

375
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,760
Where are you going?

376
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,920
The food will get cold.

377
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,680
We've run out of oil.

378
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,760
I'll go get some.

379
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,350
Dad, what did they find?

380
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,590
None of your business.

381
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,110
Go home.

382
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,000
More remains?

383
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,830
That's not your concern.

384
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,590
Go back.

385
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,160
The dump site is right outside.

386
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,800
I want your Security Section
to keep a close watch.

387
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,800
If anything happens here, if you see
anyone suspicious, do let me know.

388
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,230
Of course.

389
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,310
You know,

390
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,680
The Security Section of Hualin Steel
has established a good reputation

391
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,350
among management and workers.

392
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,880
Where's the spare tire?

393
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,560
Where did it go?

394
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,190
Did you earn your reputation like this?

395
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,430
Well...

396
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,710
Are you out of your mind?

397
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,920
How dare you
steal from the police in broad daylight!

398
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,760
Do you know what Captain Ma does?

399
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,760
Captain Ma is
the best detective in the bureau.

400
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,070
Give it back before you get caught.

401
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,520
Alright.

402
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,760
The spare tire can wait.

403
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,830
Let's go back to the office.

404
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,470
Captain Ma!

405
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,520
Give me two minutes.

406
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,070
Just two minutes.

407
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,400
You can't find it with words.

408
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,040
Alright, your turn.

409
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,760
Let's see it.

410
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,830
Good. Well done.

411
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,280
Score every point.

412
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,880
Give it back.

413
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,920
What do you mean?

414
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,920
Do you prefer prison meals
to homemade food?

415
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,160
No one in the neighborhood would even go
near the police car except for you.

416
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,680
You're wrong about me, Uncle Wang.

417
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,190
Your dad was in charge of
all the parts in the factory.

418
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,590
He wouldn't even take a screw cap.

419
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,560
What happened to you?

420
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,680
Don't bring him up.

421
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,470
He worked diligently his entire life,
but what did he get?

422
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,590
I couldn't even take his spot.

423
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,230
So you stole from others?

424
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,920
The police are right outside.

425
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,160
I didn't take them here
for the sake of your old man.

426
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,430
Where's the tire?

427
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,070
Excuse me.

428
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,430
Watch out! Watch out!

429
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,760
Yeah, here's the tire.

430
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,640
A few kids removed the screws
and took the tire.

431
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,590
Is anything missing?

432
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,000
Go home.

433
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,760
Thanks.

434
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,640
Do you think you outsmart everyone?

435
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,110
Who are you covering for?

436
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,160
Do I look like a fool?

437
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,430
Listen, young man, I...

438
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,430
Wang Xiang, right?

439
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,950
Look, your captain knows me.

440
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,280
Put the tire back on.

441
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,800
He's got quite a temper.

442
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,560
Section Chief Xing is here, so I'll leave
such petty theft to your own people.

443
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,000
Now that the tire is back,

444
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'll let it go.

445
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,590
Captain Ma, you have my word.

446
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,680
We'll round up the wrongdoers
and deal with them strictly.

447
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,830
I remember you.

448
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,070
Also, come to my office when you're free.

449
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,470
I have a few more questions to ask.

450
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,800
I'm free now, so here I am.

451
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,000
Then let's go.

452
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,470
Sure.

453
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,520
Young man, hey, load my bike, please.

454
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,040
Load your bike into the police car?

455
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,950
It doesn't fit.

456
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,920
What are you doing?

457
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,230
You're making our factory look bad!

458
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,310
No one here wants your trash.

459
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,950
Well,
we don't know about the outsiders.

460
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,560
I'll take care of it.

461
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:18,260
(The police should serve the people.)

462
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,160
I'm going to the ME's Office.

463
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,760
Meet me in the conference room
on the 2nd floor.

464
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,710
Got it.

465
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
Still enjoying it?

466
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,560
Maybe another ride?

467
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,830
Officer Cui,

468
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,590
I was thinking that I've sat
behind the wheel for so long,

469
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,310
but this is the first time

470
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,590
I've sat in a police car.

471
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,400
Whether I can get back at the wheel
or not depends on you guys.

472
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,310
What are you mumbling about?

473
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,190
Get out.

474
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,590
OK.

475
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,260
(The police should serve the people.)

476
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,470
Stop!

477
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,590
Don't move! Come back!

478
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,920
What happened?

479
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,160
How dare you escape from the police!

480
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,520
Are you nuts?

481
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,800
What happened?

482
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,830
What's going on?

483
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,190
He said he was going number two
and asked me to uncuff him.

484
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,070
What did he do?

485
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,190
Patrols caught him stealing purses
at the North Station.

486
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,920
Are you even old enough to drink?

487
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,640
Are you in a gang?

488
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,470
I'm not!

489
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,230
I... I don't know anything!

490
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,680
Zip it!

491
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,400
Get up!

492
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,110
Cuff him!

493
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,070
Give me a hand!

494
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,280
You can't escape from an engine driver!

495
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:43,590
Got you!

496
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,280
Yeah.

497
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,160
Officer Cui?

498
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,760
I'm here.

499
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,430
I got you.

500
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,350
Mr. Wang, you shouldn't have been here.

501
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:54,640
I'm fine.

502
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,230
I heard someone needed a hand.

503
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,920
Let me see how bad it is.

504
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,640
It's... it's fine.

505
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,070
Let me check.

506
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,640
I'm OK...

507
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,350
Is it bad?

508
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,710
I'm good.

509
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,190
Cover your nose.

510
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,950
Come on!

511
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,280
OK.

512
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,830
Which way?

513
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,950
This way, this way.

514
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:04,400
I got you.

515
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,000
Thanks.

516
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,640
Captain Ma.

517
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,190
Not bad at all.

518
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,160
You were swift.

519
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,880
Captain Ma...

520
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,400
Sorry.

521
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,400
Captain Ma, don't forget what I do.

522
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,000
I drive trains.

523
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,000
I've seen all sorts of things
within a short distance,

524
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,560
such as suicide, vandalism, and theft.

525
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,000
Drivers like me are trained to be
observant and thorough, bold and calm.

526
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,710
What did that kid do?

527
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,710
Petty theft.

528
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,160
He's been caught more than once,
but he's unable to change.

529
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,160
What about his parents?

530
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,560
Don't have any.

531
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,520
He grew up in an orphanage.

532
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,070
Poor kid.

533
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,160
Kids like him can go the wrong way easily
without proper guidance.

534
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,880
Including that tire thief?

535
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,830
Well, nothing gets past you.

536
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,110
Look, the truth is

537
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,760
our factory hasn't recruited anyone
for years.

538
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,560
Those kids have nothing else to do
other than make trouble.

539
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,160
You know why I asked you to come?

540
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,800
Those two bags of remains were found
in your neighborhood.

541
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:37,710
I'm afraid the killer and the victim
may be tied to your factory.

542
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,400
You're a senior there.

543
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,470
You know better than others.

544
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,950
I need your help.

545
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,800
You got it.

546
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,040
Anytime, sir.

547
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,280
Captain Ma!

548
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,920
Here!

549
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,950
Director Zhu is calling for a meeting.

550
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,520
Take off your jacket.

551
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,950
I... I...

552
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,070
This is too kind of you.

553
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,710
I've got a spare.

554
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:58,950
Wait here.

555
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,560
I...

556
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,640
We'll discuss more details later.

557
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,040
I... I don't need to go to the meeting?

558
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,830
It's private.

559
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm not looped in yet.

560
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,500
(ME's Office)

561
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,710
I learned about this new technique
to quickly identify the victims.

562
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,520
Yep. DAN.

563
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,520
What's DAN?

564
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,830
It's DNA.

565
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,710
You fool.

566
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,310
Then do it.

567
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,310
The bureau doesn't have it yet.

568
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,070
It's not widely available.

569
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,830
I thought you got it, showoff!

570
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,920
Like you're an expert or something.

571
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,280
Do you think identification is
still possible given the dismemberment?

572
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,400
We found something unique on the remains.

573
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,470
What is it?

574
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,000
Normally, we only have
three finger creases,

575
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,430
but we found
one piece of the finger with four.

576
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,070
So fingers crossed, huh?

577
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,520
Who are you?

578
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,230
A magician?

579
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,950
What's a watchdog's salary?

580
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,350
Are you looking for trouble?

581
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,190
No, sir.

582
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,160
I'm looking for Mr. Ge.

583
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,590
Qu Bo sent me.

584
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,470
Second floor.

585
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,330
1, 3, 7...

586
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,190
So you know Qu Bo?

587
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,880
That cousin of mine
never stops troubling me.

588
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,710
What can you do?

589
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,040
What can you offer?

590
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,110
Listen to you!

591
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,640
Any decent jobs here are
beyond your ability.

592
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,430
How about a waiter?

593
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,350
A waiter?

594
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,520
How much can I make?

595
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,560
400 per month without tips.

596
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,950
However much they tip you is all yours.

597
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,710
Not too bad. I'll think about it.

598
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,920
You need to think about it, huh?

599
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,070
Fine, do it outside.

600
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,230
I've got clients coming.

601
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,350
Hey, by the way, tell Qu Bo to study hard.

602
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,520
Don't make bad friends.

603
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,320
Play something else.

604
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,110
Hey, you!

605
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,350
What would you like, sir?

606
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,040
That one,

607
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,710
The Love of a Boat Tracker.

608
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,110
The Love of a Boat Tracker...

609
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,430
OK.

610
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,310
It requires quickstep.

611
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,430
So follow my lead.

612
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,710
Ready?

613
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,590
Play it.

614
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,280
Sorry, but that's not for the piano.

615
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,920
You can choose one from these, sir.

616
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,880
I can play all of them.

617
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,110
So they're all pieces of music, yeah?

618
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,880
Yes, sir.

619
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,040
Isn't my song also music?

620
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,070
Yes, sir.

621
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,920
So why can't you do it?

622
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,190
Like I said, sir,
that's not for the piano.

623
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,920
Is everything OK, Hai?

624
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,760
I thought you'd be in the box.

625
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,710
Go away!

626
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,830
What now?

627
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:30,280
I came here
and paid for your services, right?

628
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,000
Just ignore her.

629
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,070
Come on.

630
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,830
Let's drink in the box,

631
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,310
OK? Come on.

632
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,000
I need no drinks.

633
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,800
Listen,

634
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,520
I won't leave until I hear

635
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,950
The Love of a Boat Tracker
that you played!

636
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,920
Sure, of course.

637
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,310
No problem.

638
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,640
The Love of a Boat Tracker goes
like this...

639
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Play it now.

640
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,190
I really can't.

641
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,190
Who do you think you are?

642
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,430
Playing hard to get?

643
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,950
You can't do it?

644
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,190
Fine.

645
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,950
How about 200 yuan?

646
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,680
500?

647
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,000
Please...

648
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,670
What about now?

649
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,800
Do it.

650
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,560
I can't.

651
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,080
Don't...

652
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,320
Please...

653
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,910
Calm down.

654
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,150
It's not worth it.

655
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,710
She doesn't deserve your money.

656
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,520
If you don't discipline her,

657
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,670
I will!

658
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,230
What's that attitude?

659
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,280
Calm down, please!

660
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,800
How about this?

661
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,230
A free box plus 20 percent off,
and beer, free beer, too.

662
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,230
Come with me.

663
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,800
I'll sing
The Love of a Boat Tracker for you.

664
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,000
I'll do better than Andy Lau.
[*A top singer in China and Asia.]

665
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,520
Come on.

666
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,670
This isn't over...

667
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,390
Pick up the cash and give it back.

668
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,080
Yeah, yeah.

669
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,430
Go away. Get out of here.

670
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,710
Take Hai upstairs.

671
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,430
Thank you.

672
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,280
Was it Clair de Lune that you played?

673
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,560
I've heard it.

674
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,120
Claude Debussy's work.

675
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,230
Actually, we met
when you first arrived at school.

676
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,470
I forgot to introduce myself then.

677
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,230
My name is Wang Yang
as "Yang" means the sun.

678
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:27,190
♪Love so deep, towlines swing♪

679
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,040
Are you blind?

680
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,150
What were you doing?

681
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,120
Sorry, sir.

682
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,950
My bad.

683
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,520
I couldn't stop it.

684
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,000
You hit my car!

685
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,870
Look what you've done!

686
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,870
I'm really sorry.

687
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,560
Cigarette?

688
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,950
Cut it out!

689
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,430
Hey, what's that look?

690
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,910
Is this funny to you?

691
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,520
Please... calm down.

692
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,470
Don't be... so mad.

693
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,280
We can... talk nicely.

694
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,430
I won't be nice!

695
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,430
No, I won't!

696
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,190
What can you do?

697
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,280
Well, I've...

698
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,600
warned you, haven't I?

699
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,800
Look at you!

700
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,710
What's this?

701
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,910
An ambush?

702
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,040
You know what I like the most?

703
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,000
The more, the merrier!

704
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,560
Bring it on!

705
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,600
Come on!

706
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
(Why waste time on him?)

707
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,630
(I was only teasing.)

708
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,630
Hey, are you with him, a mute?

709
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,230
Look,

710
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:04,280
I don't have all day for you,
so I'll let this side.

711
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,950
Teeth got knocked out?

712
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,230
You deserve it!

713
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,520
One, two!

714
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,320
One, two!

715
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,560
One, two!

716
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,600
Come on, it's raining.

717
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,710
Let's go.

718
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,390
Come on!

719
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,870
Halt, all of you!

720
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,630
Did I say you can go?

721
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,120
Stand still!

722
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,360
Don't move if it's raining cats and dogs!

723
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,800
Parade step!

724
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,630
One, two!

725
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,800
One, two!

726
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,390
Excuse me.

727
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,600
Sorry, sorry.

728
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,230
Coming through, sorry.

729
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,120
Excuse me.

730
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,630
One, two!

731
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,230
Silence!

732
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,080
Hey, you, which class are you in?

733
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,950
I'm not a student.

734
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,280
If not, what are you doing here?

735
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,150
Get out!

736
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,080
Sorry, sir,

737
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,870
I'm not your soldier,
so I won't follow your order.

738
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,190
Excuse me?

739
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,080
What are you doing? Just go.

740
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,430
I will when the rain stops.

741
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,670
Call security.

742
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,430
Yes, sir!

743

(Letter of Apology)

744
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,800
That's quick.

745
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,600
This isn't my first time.

746
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,560

00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,120
Close the door for me.

748
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,280
Yes, sir.

749
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,190
So what if your school teaches medicine?

750
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,520
Our factory makes steel!

751
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,840
Karma is real.

752
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,230
Hai got beaten up.

753
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,360
He even lost a few teeth.

754
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,190
I wonder who did that.

755
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,840
They were rough.

756
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,150
Revenge got served almost immediately.

757
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,800
Even punks are afraid of thugs.

758
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,360
And he got lucky.

759
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,910
Had it been me,

760
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,950
I would've whacked him so bad that
he wouldn't be able to move for days.

761
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,360
Is that why you came to see me?

762
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,950
I thought that news would cheer you up.

763
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,360
It wouldn't.

764
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:31,390
I don't care what happened to him.

765
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,430
I almost forgot
before you brought him up.

766
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,390
He was so mean.

767
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,230
How could you forget?

768
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,670
You've got a big heart.

769
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,360
Good for you.

770
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:48,040
I don't wanna torture myself,
so I won't keep a tab on the bad things.

771
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,670
So...

772
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,600
am I a good thing or a bad thing?

773
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,390
You could use a smile.

774
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,910
I only worked in that club
to pay for my study.

775
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,760
Thanks for helping me that day, but please

776
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,150
don't come to see me at school again.

777
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,760
And when you're not at school?

778
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,910
I'll take that as a yes.

779
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:15,320
Oh, hi.

780
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,150
I'm grabbing a crate of beer.

781
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,150
What's taking you so long?

782
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,360
Hurry up!
