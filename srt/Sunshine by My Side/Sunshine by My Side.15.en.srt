[Episode 15]

4
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,020
Director, take a look.

5
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,700
This is the shooting order for tomorrow.

6
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,900
See if we need to adjust it.

7
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,220
There's nothing to adjust.

8
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,020
You do it. I'm a little tired.

9
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,740
Your student is here.

10
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,140
Okay, I'm leaving.

11
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,100
Director Jian.

12
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:49,940
Hello.

13
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,259
Why are you here?

14
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,180
Shouldn't you be at

15
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,420
an art exhibition?

16
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,140
That's right.

17
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,740
But she went with another colleague.

18
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,500
Something's up?

19
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,300
Yes.

20
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,860
Why don't we eat Luosifen noodles first?

21
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,780
My treat.

22
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,780
It's fine. Just go ahead.

23
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,220
Okay.

24
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,100
Then...

25
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:13,940
I'm going to go ahead.

26
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,420
Actually...

27
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,420
we knew each other ten years ago.

28
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,420
I learned art

29
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,660
because of you.

30
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,850
And majored in commercial design in university

31
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,100
I know.

32
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,620
Although the chance of us meeting again is very small,

33
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,570
I still hoped

34
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,700
to see you one day.

35
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,730
We've met, haven't we?

36
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,380
Yes, we did.

37
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,700
Song Chen often teases me.

38
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,980
He said the image I have of you in my mind is too perfect.

39
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,740
He said if I see you in person one day,

40
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,770
my fantasies will be all gone.

41
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,740
He's right.

42
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,620
Not at all.

43
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,500
Although you're a little different

44
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,140
from what I remember,

45
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,540
but

46
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,850
you've become more vivid.

47
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,140
You are no longer

48
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,820
the perfect goddess

49
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,180
in my mind from ten years ago.

50
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,820
You had an imperfect marriage.

51
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,740
You are stubborn and have a temper,

52
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,540
and have a harsh attitude towards work.

53
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,940
But all these have made you more realistic

54
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,340
in my heart.

55
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,620
Since I was young,

56
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,060
I have never been like this towards anyone.

57
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,020
Recently, my emotions

58
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,020
have always been

59
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,340
influenced by you.

60
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,100
If you are happy,

61
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,220
I'll be happy.

62
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,700
If you are unhappy,

63
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,260
I'll be sad with you.

64
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,180
If you didn't reply my message one day,

65
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,420
I'll keep refreshing your WeChat Moments repeatedly.

66
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,420
I just want to know how your day has been,

67
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:42,820
and whether you were happy.

68
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,980
So you see,

69
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,220
the meeting ten years ago

70
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,900
is already no longer important.

71
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,220
What matters is

72
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,980
you are standing in front of me now.

73
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,740
I know

74
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,940
you just ended

75
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,420
an...

76
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,420
an unhappy relationship.

77
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,020
You can't accept someone so soon.

78
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,780
And I...

79
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,420
I have nothing now.

80
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,740
I can't give you anything.

81
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,780
But I will work hard.

82
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,780
I will work hard and make money

83
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,580
and become someone

84
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,019
who can match you both mentally

85
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,779
and materially.

86
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,860
Sheng Yang, you...

87
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:22,740
Wait.

88
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,420
No problem.

89
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,580
I can wait.

90
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,220
I don't give up easily

91
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,020
once I have a target.

92
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,620
But I hope

93
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,420
don't reject me flat out directly, okay?

94
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,940
Jian Bing.

95
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,050
I like you.

96
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,700
Sheng Yang.

97
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,740
We are not suitable for each other.

98
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,780
I'm...

99
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,820
ten years older than you.

100
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,500
Have you ever been in a relationship?

101
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,980
How many girlfriends have you had?

102
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,060
No, none.

103
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,020
Okay, let's not talk about this.

104
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,180
I know why you like me.

105
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,770
Because the film I filmed ten years ago

106
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,820
changed your view of your dad.

107
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,540
So, you

108
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,170
want to realize a dream you had ten years ago.

109
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,180
You can go back and think about it properly.

110
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,660
In our interactions,

111
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,700
you've been

112
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,730
looking at me with the image you had of me ten years ago.

113
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,620
No, I–

114
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,220
Don't interrupt me so quickly.

115
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,580
Also,

116
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,740
how long have we known each other?

117
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,860
Three months?

118
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,659
Two months...

119
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,420
and seven days?

120
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,420
Yes, only two months and seven days.

121
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,980
So you think

122
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,260
I'm fooling around.

123
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,100
No, no.

124
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,580
I think you are very serious right now.

125
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,940
But you are only 26 years old.

126
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,580
Isn't it too hasty

127
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,890
to set your mind on someone

128
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,940
or something?

129
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,420
Well,

130
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,420
I can prove it in the future.

131
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,620
Let me make it clear.

132
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,500
I don't think

133
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,860
you should waste your time on me.

134
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,380
Senior or elder aside,

135
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,740
I don't think you should even be calling me sister.

136
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,740
You should be calling me auntie.

137
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,020
Why do you take age so seriously?

138
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,700
Yes, I'm 26 years old.

139
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,580
Because of that I'm definitely reckless about relationships?

140
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,940
I'm younger than you.

141
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,220
But I don't fall in love with just anyone.

142
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,980
Lest not think about the future.

143
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,980
Besides,

144
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,940
you don't have to keep telling me

145
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,300
about our ten-year age difference.

146
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,780
I know.

147
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,420
But I don't care.

148
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,100
What I care about is that I know

149
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,820
the person I like is you.

150
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,050
For any excuse,

151
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,740
the real reason is you don't like me.

152
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,580
I don't need your analysis

153
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,050
to help me determine whether we are suitable for each other.

154
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,060
I just want you to tell me

155
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,540
whether you

156
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,420
like me.

157
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,380
I don't like you.

158
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,220
Thank you...

159
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,140
for liking me, and telling me so much.

160
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,580
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,780
Actually, I know

162
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,290
you would definitely reject

163
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,860
my confession today.

164
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,580
But I still want to say,

165
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,850
I don't want to lose this chance I've waited

166
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,340
for ten years

167
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,700
because of my lack of courage or weakness.

168
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,220
Thank you.

169
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,180
For giving me this chance.

170
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:04,480
[Liang Shanshan: Where are you? Let's go out and eat.]
[Jian Bing: I'm a little tired. Let's eat at home.]

171
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,500
What's wrong with your son?

172
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,020
We keep calling him and he's still not coming out for dinner.

173
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,260
He said he had dinner.

174
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,500
With that girl surnamed Pan?

175
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,260
I think so.

176
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,900
Good.

177
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,500
What's good?

178
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,300
I don't think he's in a good mood.

179
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,940
As soon as he came back, he laid down on the bed,

180
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,860
not saying anything.

181
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,660
Did the date go bad?

182
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,540
I don't know.

183
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,500
I'll make a call

184
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,580
and ask Tian Limei.

185
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,740
You're back.

186
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,700
I'm back.

187
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,780
You're back just in time.

188
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,030
-You're so nice.
-I ordered a lot of takeout.

189
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,340
These are all your favourites.

190
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,260
Thank you, Liang.

191
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,340
Let's eat. I'll get some porridge.

192
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,650
Liang Shanshan, you ordered...

193
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,300
a little too much.

194
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,180
It's suspicious.

195
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,140
You've been working so hard lately.

196
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,060
Besides,

197
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,620
I've never been stingy.

198
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,250
Have some soup.

199
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,580
Here's your tissue.

200
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,140
What happened?

201
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,900
Is something bothering you?

202
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,020
Did you break up?

203
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,580
The boy who came to your house last time?

204
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,340
I don't know what's going on

205
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,900
but I know there must be a lot that has happened

206
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,420
between you two.

207
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,380
You mean Sheng Yang?

208
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,340
There's really nothing between us.

209
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,220
He confessed to you.

210
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,900
You rejected him.

211
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,660
Did you installed a CCTV on me?

212
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,180
Did you say yes?

213
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,620
He's only 26.

214
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,540
So?

215
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,020
You're ten years younger than me.

216
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,740
He's not a minor.

217
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,580
When I was in third grade,

218
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,130
he was not born yet.

219
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,860
What you need now

220
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,660
someone to stay with you.

221
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,100
Why so serious?

222
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,380
Besides,

223
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,010
you don't know the kids now.

224
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,660
They are more open-minded than you.

225
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,180
The way he looks at me

226
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,180
scares me.

227
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,860
Scares you?

228
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,700
Why?

229
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,340
Because

230
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
he's very serious.

231
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,900
You keep saying

232
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,220
you shouldn't be together.

233
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,260
But you never said if

234
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,700
you like him or not.

235
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,180
Sheng Yang this kid is really...

236
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,020
different from any of the boys

237
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,660
that are around you.

238
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,100
He's very good.

239
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,300
Very clean.

240
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,700
Did you fall for him?

241
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,980
I just got divorced, okay?

242
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,380
So what?

243
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,820
No one said that a divorce requires a three-year mourning.

244
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,170
Xue and I

245
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,340
have been together for more than ten years.

246
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,420
Even if I don't feel sad,

247
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,780
it is still the end of

248
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,900
a long and deep relationship.

249
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,980
That means

250
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,420
you don't want to start a new relationship right away.

251
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,500
You know what?

252
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,980
When I'm with this kid,

253
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,300
eating and chatting away,

254
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,580
it felt very comfortable.

255
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,010
But now,

256
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,340
I don't want to be responsible for anyone.

257
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,820
You're a scumbag then.

258
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,140
Did I inherit Xue's scumbag quality?

259
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,980
Really, I'm enjoying

260
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,890
my single life very much now.

261
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,500
I just want to be alone.

262
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,020
I don't want to,

263
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,660
having just left a marriage,

264
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,820
start yet another relationship.

265
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,340
I'm happy alone now.

266
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,090
When I want to be around people, I can look for you,

267
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,540
and some other friends,

268
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,220
to drink and eat together.

269
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,380
When I want to be alone, I can just go home and space out alone.

270
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,580
I don't have to care about anyone's feelings,

271
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,180
or explain anything to anyone.

272
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,490
I understand.

273
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,060
There is light in Sheng Yang’s eyes.

274
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,340
Of course,

275
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,660
Xue used to have light in his eyes too.

276
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,060
But at our age,

277
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,650
we've experienced the process of going from naivety to complication.

278
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,770
The light in our eyes became more and more blurred.

279
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,180
I'm a little tired.

280
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,180
When I think of starting a new relationship,

281
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,500
especially with someone

282
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,180
who's so much younger than me,

283
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,860
I don't want to see

284
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,500
the light in someone's eyes go from bright

285
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:48,730
to blurred.

286
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,260
Even the best couple

287
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,260
will end up in a mess.

288
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,140
That's true.

289
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,340
So,

290
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,819
I can't mobilize my motivation

291
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,339
to establish a relationship with someone,

292
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,700
date, make adjustments, have problems arise,

293
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,180
quarrel and hate each other.

294
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,380
You make me

295
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,540
feel despair.

296
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,780
That's why I just want to work and make money.

297
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,780
Only work and money won't let me down.

298
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:27,810
What do you think?

299
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,380
You finally figured it out.

300
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,140
Only work and money

301
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,380
won't betray us.

302
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,180
Yes.

303
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,370
Come.

304
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:36,780
Come on.

305
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,580
Cheers.

306
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,660
Hao Junjie, stop cleaning up.

307
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,260
Come here.

308
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,570
-Coming.
-Your thesis topic selection.

309
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,580
I've made a list for you.

310
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,890
Take a close look.

311
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,740
I think you can pick

312
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,540
from among

313
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,020
these three.

314
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,540
And these information,

315
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,860
I've printed them out for you.

316
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,300
Take a look when you have time.

317
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,810
You must finish

318
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,860
these three books.

319
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,810
It's good for your thesis defense.

320
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,820
Look.

321
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,300
The Implications of Fingering on Musical Tone.

322
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,740
A Brief Analysis of Chopin's Influence on Field.

323
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,700
The Spread and Development of Piano Nocturnes.

324
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,140
The Expression of Strength in Piano Works.

325
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,300
Should I call Jian Shuang over?

326
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,140
Didn't you say you'll take her with you last time?

327
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,580
Yes.

328
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,060
I asked her sister out for dinner

329
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,420
to talk about this.

330
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,980
But it didn't happen.

331
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,820
So you're just letting it go like this?

332
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,500
Maybe she doesn't want it.

333
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,060
No, Fang.

334
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,540
Are you going to never see her again?

335
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,220
That's not what I meant.

336
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,500
You should ask her out then.

337
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,980
The point is we don't know each other well.

338
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,340
If I ask her out,

339
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,140
it'll be awkward if she doesn't agree.

340
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,220
What's so awkward about that?

341
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,980
If you're afraid of the awkwardness,

342
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,180
just call me.

343
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,490
And Jian Shuang.

344
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,660
It won't be awkward

345
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,620
if there are four of us.

346
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,060
Practice hard.

347
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,700
I'll read it later.

348
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,250
Hao Junjie.

349
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,580
Think of your uncle

350
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,090
when you have good ideas like this in the future.

351
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,010
Then, do the dishes

352
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,340
tonight.

353
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,140
As long as this can succeed,

354
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,380
I'll do the dishes

355
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,380
for this entire month.

356
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:15,980
Director Jian.

357
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,500
Sorry to keep you waiting.

358
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,820
Put it here.

359
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,420
Mr. He told me about you.

360
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,060
I finally meet you in person today.

361
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,100
Isn't Mr. He coming?

362
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,500
He has a board meeting.

363
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Otherwise, he will definitely come to see you in person.

364
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,700
Drink mine.

365
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,300
No, thanks.

366
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,500
I'll just drink water.

367
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,060
I've been telling Shanshan

368
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,780
to get an opportunity to work with you.

369
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,740
Look.

370
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,300
We finally got some of your time

371
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,180
Don't say that.

372
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,140
I'm also looking forward to this project myself.

373
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,060
We sent the revised contract

374
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,380
to Mr. He yesterday.

375
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,020
Is there any problem?

376
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,810
No, none at all.

377
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,500
Look.

378
00:20:59,330 --> 00:20:59,980
That's good.

379
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,820
I can start preparing after the contract has been signed.

380
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,970
Time is tight.

381
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,100
There's no rush.

382
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:05,780
Director Jian,

383
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,780
I have a small question.

384
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,340
How are you going to decide

385
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,860
on the actors?

386
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,900
The casting director gave me some information.

387
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,180
The audition will be held next week.

388
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,100
Don't wait till next week.

389
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,940
We have one here.

390
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,740
Have a look.

391
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,980
She's my niece.

392
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,090
She dances very well.

393
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,860
I think she will

394
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,700
partner up well with Yi Sen.

395
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,060
What do you think?

396
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,490
You niece is already so old?

397
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,330
I got married young.

398
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,740
Does she have any shooting experience?

399
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,730
Yes.

400
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,700
She takes some videos herself.

401
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,660
Vlogs.

402
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,220
Most importantly, she's an influencer.

403
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,300
She has hundreds of thousands of followers.

404
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,100
Sure.

405
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,140
Mr. Huang, please give me a copy of her information.

406
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,700
I'll arrange for her audition next week.

407
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,050
If she's really suitable for this rolem

408
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,180
I have no problem.

409
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,860
She has to do the audition?

410
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,540
Of course.

411
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,340
If

412
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,820
Mr. He agrees to it,

413
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,060
then I-I have no problems with it.

414
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,740
Director Jian, you're using Mr. He to pressure me.

415
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,420
How dare I?

416
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,660
I'm just a director.

417
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,980
I'm afraid

418
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,900
of making mistakes too, right?

419
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,060
How about this?

420
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,780
I just remembered

421
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,900
there seems to be something wrong

422
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,060
with our contract here.

423
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,060
I need to modify it.

424
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:28,860
How about this?

425
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,860
You go back first.

426
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,940
After the modification,

427
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,140
I'll ask my secretary to contact you.

428
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,740
What do you think?

429
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,980
I think that's fine.

430
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,740
I'll go back and wait for your news.

431
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,220
Hello?

432
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,580
Where are you?

433
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,500
I'm discussing something with someone outside.

434
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,260
Where are you?

435
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,980
Who is this Mr. Huang?

436
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,380
I've never seen him before.

437
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,770
It's our first time meeting and he's already trying to get someone into the cast.

438
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,010
He even threatened me with the contract.

439
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,490
I hate people like this the most.

440
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,380
Mr. Huang?

441
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,500
Calm down. Say it slower.

442
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,620
What happened?

443
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,340
I'm here to sign the contract today.

444
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,140
You should do this in the future.

445
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,140
Don't let me do it.

446
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,940
So annoying.

447
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,500
I didn't get to see Mr. He.

448
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,060
A project manager surnamed Huang

449
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,020
met me instead.

450
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,700
Do you know him?

451
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,810
I know of a Mr. Shao that's by Mr. He.

452
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,820
But I don't remember any Mr. Huang.

453
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
What's going on?

454
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,490
You...

455
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,900
don't know him, right?

456
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,140
Okay.

457
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,940
I got it.

458
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,300
She said this won't work and that has to be changed too.

459
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,260
Director Jian.

460
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,820
-Is there anything else?
-I heard

461
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,220
she has a big project outside.

462
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,020
Mr. Huang...

463
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,330
-Mr. He is in a meeting.
-Who knows?

464
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,380
Let me take you to the guest room.

465
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,940
All right.

466
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,940
I'll call Shanshan.

467
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,300
Director Jian, I...

468
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:01,740
No.

469
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,210
Mr. He, what's the use of calling at this time?

470
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,050
Mr. He?

471
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,660
Are you busy?

472
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,500
Mr. Huang said you went out for a meeting.

473
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,420
I thought I wouldn't see you today.

474
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,180
I couldn't stop her.

475
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,420
Sorry.

476
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,540
I didn't have a meeting today.

477
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,820
Maybe Mr. Huang's message  passed on the wrong message then.

478
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,300
Director Jian.

479
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,380
Last time we drank,

480
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,300
we had a smooth deal.

481
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,500
If you have

482
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,860
any problems with the contract,

483
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,380
just tell me.

484
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,540
I have no problem.

485
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,180
I...

486
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,020
I even brought the official seal here today.

487
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,980
Do you think I don't want to sign it?

488
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,220
But Mr. Huang said

489
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,260
you have to take a look at the contract so I left.

490
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,380
When I got downstairs,

491
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,900
I thought since I'm already at your company,

492
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,050
it's rude to leave

493
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,500
without saying goodbye.

494
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:49,940
Yes.

495
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,620
Don't blame Mr. Huang.

496
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,940
There must be some misunderstanding.

497
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,940
We can use

498
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,500
any actor.

499
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,660
After all, she's Mr. Huang's niece.

500
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,820
We are all related.

501
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,220
As long as you agree,

502
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,820
I will cooperate.

503
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,130
No, I–

504
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,020
How about this?

505
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:06,810
Director Jian.

506
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,900
Today,

507
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,180
you go back first.

508
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,380
I need to investigate this matter.

509
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,940
I'll personally get someone to send the contract

510
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,820
to your company tomorrow.

511
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,700
What do you think?

512
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,300
Sure.

513
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,660
I'll leave you to it then.

514
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,420
See you, Mr. He.

515
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:19,740
Okay.

516
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,500
See her off.

517
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,660
I won't see you off.

518
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,420
No need.

519
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,900
Mr. He, that's not my niece–

520
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:29,820
I...

521
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:31,700
Well...

522
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,620
I can't live hiding

523
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,740
like this anymore.

524
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,940
Yes, I can't either.

525
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,100
It's fine if it's behind someone else's back.

526
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,580
But I can't do it behind

527
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,700
Jian Bing's.

528
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,340
How about

529
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,700
we

530
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,820
stop here.

531
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,610
Sure.

532
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,820
Delete your

533
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,300
WeChat records.

534
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,420
Don't look for me if there's nothing else.

535
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,380
From now on,

536
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,220
we are just work partners.

537
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,700
Let me remind you.

538
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,140
Stay away from those young boys in the future.

539
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,780
They're unreliable.

540
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,100
Look for someone who's similar to you.

541
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,940
Who are you to remind me?

542
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,140
What about those you're looking for?

543
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,860
All of them have dorito faces and silicon breasts.

544
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,940
I'm doing this for your own good.

545
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:32,980
Well,

546
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,140
the one from the karaoke.

547
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,660
From one look, I can tell they're up to no good.

548
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,900
Do you think just because you're a scumbag

549
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,500
the whole world is just like you?

550
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,970
No, I mean, why would I harm you?

551
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,820
Didn't you harm Jian Bing?

552
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,900
Can we stop talking about this?

553
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,100
Let's move on, okay?

554
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,500
You're right.

555
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,420
Even Jian Bing has moved on.

556
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,820
It's good that we can move on.

557
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,720
No, wait. How did she move on?

558
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,240
She's got someone?

559
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,780
Is he the guy

560
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,630
who took her to the hotel last time?

561
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,480
I don't know.

562
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,550
What do you mean you don't know?

563
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,070
Last time you called me

564
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,830
and asked me to fix the sewer.

565
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,300
I thought she was suspicious,

566
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,650
as if there's someone in her house.

567
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,960
I'll call her.

568
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,760
Are you crazy?

569
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
It's none of your business.

570
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,980
-No–
-You two are divorced.

571
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,070
What are you doing?

572
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,640
Tell me.

573
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,410
Tell me who's that man.

574
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,260
Do you still want to rekindle your relationship?

575
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,010
You're right.

576
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,940
We're divorced. It's none of my business.

577
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,310
But don't be silly like her.

578
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,500
It's even more none of your business if it's me.

579
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,310
Who are you to me?

580
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,930
Fine.

581
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,400
From now on,

582
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,550
you go your way

583
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,970
and me on my own.

584
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,710
Alright.

585
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,310
I'm leaving.

586
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,920
What?

587
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:29,880
I want the bill.

588
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:30,890
To foot the bill.

589
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,250
I thought too much.

590
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:36,940
Give it to me.

591
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,040
Are you...

592
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,170
too used to paying the bill

593
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,470
for your clients?

594
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,400
Just go.

595
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,820
I'll pay for it.

596
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:52,810
Be careful.

597
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,150
Waiter.

598
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:14,780
Hello.

599
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,950
How can I help you?

600
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,230
It's 108 yuan in total.

601
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,610
You can take a look.

602
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,790
The design of our booth this time

603
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,260
shouldn't overlook the integration

604
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,020
of the product because of

605
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,910
overemphasis on our design.

606
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,640
For the lighting,

607
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,450
I won't choose lights with high voltage and are too bright.

608
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,260
It's hot now too.

609
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,230
If the temperature gets too high,

610
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,700
and the reflection of the light is too strong,

611
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,670
it will not be good for the product we are exhibiting.

612
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:05,980
Note it down.

613
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,040
Pathing

614
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,600
is our focus this time.

615
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,480
Take a look.

616
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,170
The mall has limited space.

617
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,640
So our design

618
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,440
must be calculated based on

619
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,530
the number of people in the mall.

620
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,710
We must avoid

621
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,140
repeated paths

622
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,570
and ineffective flow.

623
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:23,660
In any way,

624
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,720
our design concept this time is

625
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,980
of reasonable costs,

626
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,570
highlights the theme,

627
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,010
aesthetically pleasing, and easy to implement.

[Focus on the viewing experience
Lighting]

629
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,250
We can use flexible exhibit assembly.

630
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,760
In that case, we can use them repeatedly

631
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,770
to save cost.

632
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,650
Got it?

633
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,830
Yes.

634
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,500
Write it down.

635
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,770
Who's going to check out the venue this Saturday?

636
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,070
Me.

637
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,500
Aren't you going to...

638
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,780
[Lighting]

639
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,830
I think that dress is really pretty.

640
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,240
It's still early.

641
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,300
Why don't we have a cup of coffee here?

642
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:04,690
Sure.

643
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,290
Hello, can I order?

644
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,020
Hello, please scan and order.

645
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,120
Let me do it, Mr. Fang.

646
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,490
No.

647
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,670
I still owe you a meal.

648
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,640
Let me do it.

649
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,640
I've scanned it.

650
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,690
What would you like?

651
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,960
Americano is fine.

652
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:20,940
Where's Junjie?

653
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,420
He should be on the way.

654
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,650
What does he want to drink?

655
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,660
Forget about him.

656
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,750
Let's wait until he comes.

657
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,210
Okay.

658
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,810
Let them order by themselves.

659
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,120
Tell Jian Shuang

660
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,340
we are in the cafe.

661
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,060
Yes.

662
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,320
My sister sent me a WeChat message.

663
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,580
She asked us to come over.

664
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,430
My uncle also sent me a WeChat message.

665
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,240
Well...

666
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,420
Let's go then.

667
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,970
If not they're gonna nag again.

668
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,440
Mr. Chen, look.

669
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,490
Based on the original foundation,

670
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:03,990
we added

671
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,420
a logo plaque at the back.

672
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,640
And the logo here,

673
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,560
we've raised it a bit.

674
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,500
To ensure that the band and our product

675
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,340
are not conflicting.

676
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:10,880
Also,

677
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,440
we have also adjusted

678
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,990
the color of the logo slightly

679
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,670
to complement the stage lighting.

680
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,850
Watch your step.

681
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:25,890
Not bad.

682
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,990
Very good.

683
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,930
It's exactly what we thought.

684
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,830
That's good.

685
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,760
I was very surprised

686
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,100
when I got the design blueprint.

687
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,570
It's very creative.

688
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,050
I'm very satisfied with the

689
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,560
actual results today.

690
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,990
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

691
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,870
Actually,

692
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,390
the whole design

693
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,060
was done by

694
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,370
a young and upcoming designer of our company.

695
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,840
Sheng Yang. Sheng Yang.

696
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,640
Come here.

697
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,030
Let me introduce.

698
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,050
This is our company's top designer Sheng Yang.

699
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,400
Hello.

700
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,250
This young lad is very serious.

701
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,350
From the draft to the factory communication,

702
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,910
he's been keeping an eye on everything in the company.

703
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,970
He keeps a close eye on the details.

704
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,060
How close?

705
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,610
You haven't slept for a week.

706
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,830
He's very serious.

707
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,720
You worked hard, young man.

708
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,990
It's my duty.

709
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,710
Okay.

710
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,140
I'm looking forward

711
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,230
to the official event then.

712
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:17,900
Don't worry.

713
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,960
It was hard to get this band.

714
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,770
Don't make any mistakes.

715
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,160
Mr. Chen.

716
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,710
Don't worry.

717
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,230
Our company has done hundreds of activities like this.

718
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,370
We have enough experience.

719
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,120
Okay.

720
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,390
Okay, I'll see you off.

721
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,160
This way.

722
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,830
You two go home.

723
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,430
The construction is almost done.

724
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,190
I'll take care of the rest.

725
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,460
That's impossible.

726
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,680
You should be the one going home.

727
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,740
Alright, stop it.

728
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,510
I have to do a few more tests.

729
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,580
Just go back and rest.

730
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,920
Take a good rest.

731
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,520
Listen.

732
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,530
You'll be busy tomorrow.

733
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,730
Let me go to the bathroom first.

734
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,909
Has Ms. Jian contacted you these few days?

735
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:33,960
It's nothing.

736
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,730
Look at me.

737
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,150
How many times have I been rejected by girls?

738
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,920
I'm still alive and kicking.

739
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,730
You just need to get used to it.

740
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,500
Besides, it's normal for her to reject you.

741
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,090
Think about it.

742
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,360
Both of you have quite a huge gap

743
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,639
in terms of age, social status and income.

744
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,639
She's a director.

745
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,110
She has seen all kinds of young attractive men.

746
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,120
I admit that

747
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,550
you are indeed handsome.

748
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,600
-But–
-Look.

749
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,360
I keep thinking that this frame here

750
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,460
is higher than the one on the left.

751
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,970
See if I'm right.

752
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:01,390
Look.

753
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,660
Don't interrupt and don't run away.

754
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,840
There's no outsider here.

755
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,390
Just tell me the truth.

756
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,910
I'm analyzing

757
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,540
why you failed.

758
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,040
What reason can there be to failures?

759
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,630
I'm just not good enough.

760
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,270
Then you're totally wrong.

761
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,460
This is just a superficial reason.

762
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,720
To be frank,

763
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,530
I think you scared her.

764
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:27,680
Mr. Fang.

765
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,520
Well,

766
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,750
I will count on you to

767
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,980
keep a close eye on Jian Shuang's studies.

768
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:34,950
No problem.

769
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,340
I'll keep an eye on her for you.

770
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,060
I will ask Junjie to help Jian Shuang out too.

771
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,370
So that they can improve together.

772
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,100
I'm going to be honest with you.

773
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,530
Our meeting today

774
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,960
is to bring your sister and my uncle together.

775
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,320
I want to give them a chance to be alone.

776
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,650
How old

777
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,290
is your uncle?

778
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,090
37 years old. One year older than your sister.

779
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:04,930
Has he ever been married?

780
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:05,560
He's divorced.

781
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,050
Her ex-wife found a foreigner in America.

782
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,920
He's also divorced.

783
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,540
After the divorce, he hasn't found a suitable partner.

784
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,510
So he's been single till now.

785
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,540
My uncle is quite sentimental.

786
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,960
Why does your uncle have such short legs?

787
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,320
They look almost as long as my sister's.

788
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,960
Does he work out?

789
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,520
He's too thin.

790
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,900
He's not thin.

791
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,710
It's a matter of angle.

792
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,660
His hairline is a bit worrying too.

793
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,390
It's receding to the back of his forehead.

794
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,030
Can you stop paying attention to people's appearance?

795
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,220
Shouldn't you ask about his temper,

796
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,610
personality, and values?

797
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,930
Ask your uncle to come to the ice rink

798
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,100
and teach him skating.

799
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,550
It's not a bad thing to train his body.

800
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,230
I know. You don't have to tell me this.

801
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,020
Stop looking. What are you looking at?

802
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,070
You scared me.

803
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,330
I'll look from here.

804
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,510
What you said

805
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,440
may be useful to other girls.

806
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,000
She's older.

807
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,980
She just returned to being single and regained her freedom.

808
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,200
What's her biggest fear?

809
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,350
What she fears the most is that a man insists on being with her.

810
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,730
Looking all serious,

811
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,990
restricting her personal freedom.

812
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,840
I'm looking all serious?

813
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,440
W-what do you mean?

814
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,590
Have you seen "The Shawshank Redemption"?

815
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,060
The main lead escaped from the prison

816
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,250
and shouted "freedom!" in the rain.

817
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,770
But there you are behind him shouting "Come back quickly!

818
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,450
I built a new prison for you!"

819
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,920
How can she not run?

820
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,840
Let me ask you.

821
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,810
You're so funny.

822
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,450
"Freedom" was "Braveheart," bro.

823
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,720
Is that the point?

824
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,820
You understand the underlying meaning,

825
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,240
right?

826
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,080
Listen.

827
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,430
You are too serious.

828
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,520
You need to follow a rhythm,

829
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,030
read the room,

830
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,540
and take it slowly

831
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,350
when it comes to confessions.

832
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,650
Don't alert them

833
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,290
and give them pressure.

834
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,760
I saw them!

835
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,890
Slow down.

836
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:06,900
Don't fall flat on your face.

837
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,030
You're already ugly to start with.

838
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,060
The cafe on the second floor.

839
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,860
She's upstairs.

840
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,540
Who?

841
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:15,970
That

842
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,100
Director Jian.

843
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,160
Did you see it clearly?

844
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,340
It must be her.

845
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,680
With whom?

846
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,400
A...

847
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,830
man.

848
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,300
A man.

849
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,330
So, Jian Shuang's major course and

850
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,050
and thesis supervision

851
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,520
will be with Junjie, right?

852
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,440
Yes, they will be together.

853
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,050
I...

854
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,730
How do I pay you?

855
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,710
No need. How can I charge you?

856
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,260
No, this is a different matter.

857
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,820
Just accept the normal tuition fee.

858
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,020
How about this?

859
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,590
Treat me to dinner

860
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,690
as a fee.

861
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,950
Once every two weeks.

862
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:56,750
Is it...

863
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,470
too much?

864
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,350
No, no.

865
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,270
But...

866
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,160
this is not very appropriate.

867
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,510
And for my line of work,

868
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,650
my schedule is not fixed.

869
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,910
It doesn't matter.

870
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:06,830
We can save it for now.

871
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:08,760
Not bad.

872
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,740
They look good together.

873
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,990
They seem to be having a good chat.

874
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:17,920
Right?

875
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,100
Don't expose yourself.

876
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,530
I won't.

877
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,460
Look at your grin.

878
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,850
Grinning so wide.

879
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,220
It's not a loss–

880
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,150
To be with my uncle.

881
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,280
Hush.

882
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,800
They can't hear us. They're so far away.

883
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,330
They're not answering the phone.

884
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,850
Are they lost?

885
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,040
Didn't they choose this place?

886
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,820
It was quite confusing for me when we came just now.

887
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,050
The mall is too big. There's everything.

888
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:52,910
Let's go.

889
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:56,310
Oh right,

890
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,950
what movie did you say you like?

891
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,260
I saw a movie theater here.

892
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,360
I...

893
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,540
watch everything.

894
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,220
How about

895
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,100
we

896
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,570
find a restaurant

897
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,260
and wait for them while eating.

898
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:13,990
Mr. Fang, let’s not wait.

899
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,330
We've been waiting for an hour.

900
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,930
I have work to do.

901
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,270
I'll treat you next time.

902
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,990
Sorry, let's go.

903
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,060
Let me text him then.

904
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,290
What do you usually do

905
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,020
during shootings?

906
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,780
I'm an avertisement director.

907
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,250
I just shoot commercials.

908
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,560
The drums and speakers,

909
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,450
and the cables must be checked.

910
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,140
Do those celebrities put on airs a lot

911
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,530
like the rumors say they do?

912
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,250
Not all of them.

913
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,050
It depends.

914
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,740
No mistake can happen tomorrow.

915
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,950
Sir, you must be careful.

916
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,460
Don’t touch the shopfront.

917
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,940
[Boyue Tea]

918
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,260
Be careful.

919
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:09,930
Safety first.

920
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,320
You can come to me

921
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,200
if you need to look for music.

922
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,870
For real.

923
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:13,920
Okay.

924
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,110
Do you like jazz

925
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,200
or classical music?

926
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,840
Between these two, probably jazz.

927
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,990
I heard it's really tiring

928
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,420
during filming.

929
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,770
Do you eat lunch boxes all the time?

930
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:33,540
Yes.

931
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,420
Come closer. Yes.

932
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,670
Jian Bing?

933
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,190
Yes.

934
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,830
We only eat lunch boxes.

935
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,420
Sometimes we get extra food.

936
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,520
But that's still takeout.

937
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,170
When I went to your company last time,

938
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,730
I saw you were always really...

939
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,540
very busy...

940
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,350
From now on,

941
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,610
don't worry. I'll help you

942
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,790
keep an eye on Jian Shuang for you in school.

943
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,140
Just tell me if you need anything.

944
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,400
Don't stand on ceremony.

945
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,130
Thank you.

946
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:14,820
By the way,

947
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,370
there's something I want to ask.

948
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:16,790
Well,

949
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,820
you're ten years older than Jian Shuang.

950
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,040
Are you two really...

951
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,260
We are sisters.

952
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,080
It's good to have an elder sister.

953
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,010
I have a sister too.

954
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,650
We can take care of each other.

955
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,700
How are you going to go back later?

956
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,340
I drove here.

957
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,230
You drove? That's great.

958
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,050
I sent my car for maintenance.

959
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,900
Can you give me a ride?

960
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,920
No problem.

961
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,500
[Boyue Tea]

962
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,910
Tea?

963
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,390
Do you like tea?

964
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,070
No, I only drink coffee.
