00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,980
[Episode 19]

4
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,340
When were you going to tell me about your relationship?

5
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,979
I didn't plan to hide it from you.

6
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,380
We were just drunk.

7
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,780
Darn you, Liang Shanshan.

8
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,139
So you're saying it was because of biological impulses.

9
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,940
There are so many men and women in the world.

10
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,020
Why do you two have to be impulsive together?

11
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,740
You two are really something.

12
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,340
Have any of you

13
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,900
considered my feelings?

14
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,340
I just got divorced,

15
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,060
and you two already slept together.

16
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,940
You two are really speedy.

17
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,410
That day when you dragged me to go and eat,

18
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,140
to buy things at the mall,

19
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,900
and to the karaoke

20
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,060
where you introduced a bunch of boys to me,

21
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,500
you must have gotten together since then.

22
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,020
What if I didn't ask?

23
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,329
If I didn't ask,

24
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,460
were you two planning to keep it from me?

25
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,940
Do you know what, Liang Shanshan?

26
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,700
No matter how much the client disliked me,

27
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,380
and no matter how serious a problem the company faced,

28
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,140
I'd never once been afraid.

29
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,100
Because I knew that when I looked back,

30
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,300
you two would be behind me.

31
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,540
What did you say when I got divorced?

32
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,060
You said you would never let me grow old alone.

33
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,660
But then you did this behind my back.

34
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:35,980
You two are

35
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,980
the ones

36
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,220
who I trust the most.

37
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,860
Now,

38
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,860
I feel like I...

39
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,460
I've lost both of you at once.

40
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,460
I know I'm not impressive.

41
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,540
I love playing,

42
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,980
putting up a front and have no limits.

43
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,540
Even if you two got divorced,

44
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,019
I shouldn't have gotten involved with Xue.

45
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,900
Jian Bing.

46
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,380
It's all my fault.

47
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,420
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,060
You still sound like a PR professional.

49
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,980
Have you forgotten that I'm a director?

50
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,180
Don't give me that PR crap.

51
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,700
Be real with me.

52
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,060
Why did you do it?

53
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,220
As a kid,

54
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,900
my dad was an ex-convict

55
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,220
and my mom was a fishmonger.

56
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,460
None of my classmates

57
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,820
was willing to sit next to me.

58
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,250
No one cared about me.

59
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,930
They complained that I stank

60
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,220
and smelled fishy.

61
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,420
Except for Xue,

62
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,420
who was willing to be my tablemate.

63
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,260
Later I found out that he has rhinitis.

64
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,050
Since I was young, I've always thought

65
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,180
that I could tolerate

66
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,980
anything he does.

67
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,140
I could do anything for him.

68
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,540
Welcome.

69
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,490
-Thank you.
-Please.

70
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,740
Have more meat later.

71
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,660
Who wants more meat?

72
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,380
Xue.

73
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:12,700
Hello.

74
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,530
That's Liang Shanshan. Have a seat.

75
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,740
Let me introduce.

76
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,020
This is my girlfriend.

77
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:21,620
No.

78
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,620
To be exact,

79
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,620
she's my fiancee.

80
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,380
Come on. Quick.

81
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,860
Show her the ring.

82
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,480
Shiny.

83
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,060
This is my long-term work partner

84
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,020
Liang Shanshan.

85
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,700
She's like a sworn brother to me,

86
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
except she can't grow a beard.

87
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,740
Hello, my name is Jian Bing.

88
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,060
Xue always mentioned you.

89
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,060
Sir Liang.

90
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,460
Hello.

91
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,700
He mustn't have said anything good about me, right?

92
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,820
They were all compliments.

93
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,540
Why are you calling such a beautiful lady sir?

94
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,220
Look at your ears.

95
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,970
Let's dig in. The food's getting cold.

96
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,260
I thought we were having roast meat.

97
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,580
-They're all cold dishes.
-Order more dishes.

98
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,300
Okay.

99
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,780
Waiter, the menu please.

100
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,220
What would you like to eat?

101
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,380
Hello.

102
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:02,780
I want beef.

103
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,980
This is the menu. Please take a look.

104
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:04,730
Give it to me.

105
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:05,940
Order more.

106
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,420
You don't have to watch the price for my sake. It's on me.

107
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,730
Let's have everything on the menu then.

108
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,100
Have a look.

109
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,740
This beef looks good.

110
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,820
Give me one stick.

111
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,060
Order it yourself.

112
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,940
Don't smoke.

113
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,380
Didn't we agree...

114
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,740
To quit!

115
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,580
I'll quit right now.

116
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,820
You too.

117
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,860
How old are you and you're still smoking?

118
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,380
Learn from me and quit.

119
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,810
Why did you throw away her stuff?

120
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,140
We should quit together.

121
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,700
I've never seen Xue like this.

122
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,650
He's so obedient.

123
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,180
Finally, someone can control you.

124
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,900
She never tries to control me.

125
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,220
She's never jealous, causing trouble or throwing tantrums.

126
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,180
She's always just thinking about the craft of shooting advertisements.

127
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,100
Isn't she cute?

128
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,300
If I'm unhappy with you, I'll just abandon you.

129
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,620
If you dare, I'll break your leg.

130
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,060
Cute.

131
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,370
Today is such a good day.

132
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,740
I have to invite my boyfriend too.

133
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,180
Invite him.

134
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,940
Let's get more people to celebrate.

135
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,100
Which boyfriend?

136
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,660
Who cares?

137
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,700
I have many anyway.

138
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,980
Let's have the beef skewers.

139
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,660
Let's have a beef feast.

140
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,460
The prawn should be good.

141
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,380
It was also since then

142
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,650
that I began to like him.

143
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,530
Until now,

144
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,140
my feelings for him have never changed.

145
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,490
All these years,

146
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,140
you got rid of many jerks around me for me.

147
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,020
We also

148
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,780
shouldered many responsibilities together.

149
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,580
Do you remember Wensen?

150
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,660
Let me introduce.

151
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,740
This is my... boyfriend.

152
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:08,740
What's your surname?

153
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,380
Chen.

154
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,570
Chen Wensen.

155
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,500
Vincent.

156
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,540
This is my old classmate, Xue Yiming.

157
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,740
This is his...

158
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,060
fiancee, Jian Bing.

159
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,460
Hello.

160
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,060
Hello.

161
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,980
When did you become a big lion?

162
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,260
We're not from the same generation. Stop talking.

163
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,300
He's too young to understand.

164
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,100
Come on.

165
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:25,740
Cheers.

166
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,260
Come on.

167
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,260
Let's celebrate.

168
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,060
I wish that you'll

169
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,220
have a long life together.

170
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,260
Thank you.

171
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,180
Thank you.

172
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,740
Sir Liang, here's wishing that our friendship lasts forever.

173
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,420
Can we eat the meat now?

174
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,660
-Come on.
-Come on. Have some meat.

175
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,980
You even beat him up once.

176
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,530
It actually touched me a lot.

177
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,420
Since I was young,

178
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,460
I've always been the one protecting others.

179
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,180
No one has ever protected me.

180
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,260
You are the first one.

181
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,580
So,

182
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,060
you're the only female friend

183
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,620
I have in this world.

184
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,140
It sounds quite genuine.

185
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,980
You and Xue

186
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,180
are the most important people in my life.

187
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,380
I never wanted to hurt you.

188
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,580
In other words,

189
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,540
you've been waiting for Xue Yiming

190
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,180
your whole life.

191
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,380
Right?

192
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,500
I didn't expect you two to get divorced.

193
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,740
I've never planned to be with him either.

194
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,100
But I really do love him.

195
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,500
Okay.

196
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,940
Your wait is over.

197
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,260
Xue Yiming!

198
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,850
Xue Yiming!

199
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,780
Come in.

200
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,380
Be good to Liang Shanshan from now on.

201
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,540
We don't have to make any changes to our company, right?

202
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,180
No.

203
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,370
Okay.

204
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,540
Friendship lasts forever.

205
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,530
Don't be lovey-dovey in front of me.

206
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,580
Anyone

207
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,060
would need time to get used to it, right?

208
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,460
Thank you.

209
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,660
Thank you.

210
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,570
Thank you.

211
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,380
We're on a new chapter of our lives now.

212
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,660
What are you doing?

213
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,650
Why are you loafing around?

214
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,890
I asked you to practice the piano.

215
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,140
I'm practicing.

216
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,300
Get up.

217
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,380
What?

218
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,340
Don't you want to play?

219
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,260
I'll play with you.

220
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,620
I'll improvise something.

221
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,500
Listen carefully.

222
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:00,780
How was it?

223
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,380
Was it okay?

224
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,660
You wrote it?

225
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,620
Yes.

226
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,460
Just now.

227
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,620
That's why it's called improvisation.

228
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:08,620
Here.

229
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,020
-Try it.
-Okay.

230
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:02,940
Not bad.

231
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,500
The glissandos are so old-fashioned.

232
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,700
Enough with the nonsense.

233
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,220
Have you

234
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,700
played this before?

235
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,220
Take a good look.

236
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,340
Come on.

237
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,980
Don't force yourself if you can't do it.

238
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,850
Let me try.

239
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,130
Sure.

240
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,020
You've improved a lot lately.

241
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,020
I'm decent.

242
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:06,930
Don't forget

243
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,500
that although your strength is improvisation,

244
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,180
you need to practice the basics consistently too.

245
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,340
Got it.

246
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,940
Go.

247
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,220
Where to?

248
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,140
Go play ice hockey.

249
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,540
I told you

250
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,980
that as long as playing ice hockey doesn't hinder your practice

251
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,300
and your prospects of going abroad in the future,

252
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,940
I'll support you.

253
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,660
Your uncle

254
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,940
supports you.

255
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,460
Really?

256
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,620
Thank you, uncle.

257
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,660
Don't forget to do the two course assignments

258
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,540
with Jian Shuang.

259
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,420
Don't worry. I'll do it after the game.

260
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,580
Look at you.

261
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,940
You have people to accompany you when you learn and when you play.

262
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,140
By the way,

263
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,340
has her sister contacted you recently?

264
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,180
No.

265
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,300
We only agreed to have dinner another day last time.

266
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,140
I don't know when it will be.

267
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,940
Have you never been in a relationship?

268
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,940
When an adult says "another day", that means that it won't happen.

269
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,340
It means that she doesn't want to.

270
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,220
-That's enough.
-It's not an appointment.

271
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,900
Fine, I got it.

272
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,420
Do you need my help?

273
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,140
Your last idea didn't work either.

274
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:09,730
Forget it.

275
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,900
Yes, let's forget it.

276
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,740
I'm busy too anyway.

277
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,980
I have to go to the ice hockey rink now.

278
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,500
Just tell me what silly ideas you have.

279
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,940
I think

280
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,420
you should

281
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,300
cater to her liking.

282
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,130
When necessary,

283
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,180
take advantage of your identity.

284
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,380
I'm leaving.

285
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,060
Do you know

286
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,220
why Captain is so nice to Jian Shuang?

287
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,060
Why?

288
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,010
They're like this.

289
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,820
They like each other?

290
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,940
Lower your voice.

291
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,700
Isn't she wearing headphones?

292
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,460
How can she hear me?

293
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,580
Really?

294
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,740
Of course.

295
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,940
I've seen it several times.

296
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,780
After training,

297
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,060
they go to self-study classes together.

298
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,380
The captain will fetch her around with his motorcycle.

299
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,740
Think about it.

300
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,980
What kind of relationship can be like this?

301
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,900
I knew it.

302
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,010
Jian Shuang has a thick waist.

303
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,860
What's with his taste?

304
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,940
Why would he like someone like her?

305
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,740
Look.

306
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,380
There's nothing appealing about her.

307
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,940
She doesn't look like a girl.

308
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,620
Nonsense.

309
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,660
We need to call her sister-in-law in the future.

310
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,620
If Captain gets with her,

311
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,340
the three of us

312
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,940
will be sidelined in the future.

313
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,420
All his focus will be on her.

314
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,380
Whether we play well or not doesn't matter,

315
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,780
right? The three of us...

316
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,330
Is practice over?

317
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,740
Have you finished practicing for your audition?

318
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,860
I just finished.

319
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,980
Bro.

320
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,060
You didn't come for any of the previous trainings.

321
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,140
What are you busy with?

322
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,220
Why do you care so much?

323
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,220
He must be in a relationship, right?

324
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,220
Don't talk nonsense.

325
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,220
It's getting late. You guys go back first.

326
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,820
I'll practice alone for a while.

327
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,380
Let's go.

328
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:06,940
Okay.

329
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,300
Let's take a photo together.

330
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,260
-Hurry up.
-Don't forget your stuff.

331
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:12,960
It's in my bag.

332
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,610
Hold this for me.

333
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,660
-Bye.
-Bye.

334
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,420
Bye, bro.

335
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:17,980
Take care.

336
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,340
I'll accompany you.

337
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,340
No need.

338
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,780
There won't be any more hot water in the dorm if you don't go back now.

339
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,060
I'll accompany you.

340
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,380
Okay.

341
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,260
What are you waiting for?

342
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,380
Get changed.

343
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,100
Yes.

344
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,580
The group tournament is about to start.

345
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,260
I’ll train more

346
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,940
and make up for what I missed.

347
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,580
I won't hold everyone back.

348
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,090
Attend the self-study classes

349
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,340
on your own.

350
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,140
Don't delay your final exam preparation.

351
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,060
You don't have to

352
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,220
practice with me every day.

353
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,340
Okay.

354
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,340
Also,

355
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,220
don't take what they said seriously.

356
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,380
They were just joking.

357
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,780
I didn't take it to heart.

358
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,660
I wasn't planning to acknowledge them in the first place anyway.

359
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,930
Then I...

360
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:00,980
I...

361
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,020
I'll go back first.

362
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,340
Hello?

363
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,340
Hello?

364
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,260
Hello.

365
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,580
Are you Sheng Yang?

366
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,420
Yes.

367
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,180
I'm calling to inform you

368
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,300
that we've looked through your information.

369
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,180
Can you come for an interview?

370
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:00,940
Hello?

371
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,980
No problem.

372
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,050
Also, a questionnaire

373
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,500
has been sent to your email.

374
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,780
The interview should be next week.

375
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,980
Is it okay with you?

376
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:09,980
I'm fine with anything.

377
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,380
Excuse me,

378
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,130
but I have a question I want to

379
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,740
consult with you.

380
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,700
Go ahead.

381
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,460
Well,

382
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,140
about my background check...

383
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,620
Your background check?

384
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,700
We've already talked to

385
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,580
Mr. Yu from July Advertising Agency.

386
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,570
Mr. Yu

387
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,460
has nothing but praises for you,

388
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,020
saying that you are especially capable.

389
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,050
In short,

390
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,900
it was a high evaluation.

391
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,180
Then, that's all for now.

392
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,180
Okay, I got it.

393
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,330
Thank you. Bye.

394
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:39,990
Bye.

395
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:16,400
[Jian Bing]
[Sheng Yang: Are you okay?]

396
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:27,700
[Jian Bing]
[Sheng Yang: I didn’t have time to thank you for recommending me the job that day.]

397
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:41,430
[Jian Bing]
[Sheng Yang: I really don't know the woman on the phone last time.]

398
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:54,740
[Jian Bing]
[Sheng Yang: How is your injury?]

399
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,470
[Jian Bing]

400
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,760
[Jian Bing]

401
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:32,080
[Lin (Director Jian Bing's assistant)]

402
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:44,220
[Sheng Yang: Hello, sorry to bother you. Is Director Jian busy?]

403
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,060
Yuan.

404
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,060
There're water droplets on your lens. Wipe them off.

405
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,140
Okay, got it.

406
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,980
I'll handle it now.

407
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,380
The rain doesn't look good.

408
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,380
Ms. Jian.

409
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,780
Hello.

410
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,860
Why are you here?

411
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,620
Well,

412
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,530
he couldn't get through to you today.

413
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,300
He came because he heard that we needed people.

414
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,370
Sorry, I didn't check my phone.

415
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,460
The rain was too heavy in the last take.

416
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,140
Adjust it for the next take.

417
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,660
Got it.

418
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,980
It's fine.

419
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,780
I just wanted to check

420
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,340
if your injury is healing well.

421
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,650
I've recovered a long time ago.

422
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,380
You came here just for this?

423
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,580
Don't you have an interview?

424
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,820
It's Saturday today.

425
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,340
All offices are closed.

426
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,460
Are you so busy that you can't even tell

427
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,740
weekdays from weekends?

428
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,940
For our profession, work is life

429
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,140
and life is work.

430
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:48,940
If the client needs it,

431
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,060
we have to shoot even on the first day of Chinese New Year.

432
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,900
Is there anything I can help?

433
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,740
Just don't make trouble for me.

434
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,780
This shoot is already difficult enough to begin with.

435
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,580
Lin, you need to tell them again

436
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,780
to adjust it.

437
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,300
If you want to stay here,

438
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,620
find a place to sit.

439
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,500
Over there.

440
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,780
Okay, I'll sit there.

441
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,340
Call me anytime if you need anything.

442
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,290
Director.

443
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,010
I think the kids

444
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,100
can't imagine

445
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,900
the images of animals in the sky.

446
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,140
So, the performance might be...

447
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,180
So,

448
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,660
why didn't you think of a way to fix that?

449
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,780
When I say the sky has changed,

450
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,020
you could have floated some balloons or whatnot

451
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,020
for the kids.

452
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,460
Something novel.

453
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,540
But you didn't prepare anything.

454
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,740
Just make it sound more convincing.

455
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
What animals do they know?

456
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,140
Puppies, kittens, little foxes,

457
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,100
and what else?

458
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,180
Each of you can come up with an animal,

459
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,100
okay?

460
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,740
Okay.

461
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,860
Let's adjust and do another take.

462
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,820
Okay, got it.

463
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,700
Don't you know your son?

464
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,420
He wouldn't compromise his dignity and ask for help.

465
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,900
He has to rely on himself for everything.

466
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,700
Where are you going?

467
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,860
I'm getting some water.

468
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,740
He's always sitting in front of the computer and fiddling with it.

469
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,380
He keeps everything to himself.

470
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,220
Here.

471
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,580
I don't know who he takes after.

472
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,980
He doesn't say anything.

473
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,090
I don't know what he's thinking.

474
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,620
Let's talk about our finances.

475
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,420
Okay.

476
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,420
Look.

477
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,260
We have 150,000 yuan in this account.

478
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,180
I'm saving this 150,000

479
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,860
for Yang's wedding.

480
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,140
We mustn't touch this.

481
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,260
No?

482
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:48,980
Okay.

483
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,250
-Are you done?
-Be more enthusiastic.

484
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,420
Okay.

485
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,860
Ready. Rolling.

486
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,060
Start the rain.

487
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,860
Action.

488
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,580
That's a panda.

489
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,580
Is that a raccoon?

490
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,180
Crane.

491
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,740
That's a dinosaur.

492
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,300
Is that a peacock?

493
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,060
Is that a bird?

494
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,980
Okay, cut.

495
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,820
Cut.

496
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,220
Come on.

497
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,740
Don't...

498
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,180
Don't fix them up first.

499
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:25,940
This time

500
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,660
was much better than before.

501
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,900
Much better. I saw

502
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,740
that you were discussing about your favorite animals,

503
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,420
right?

504
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,060
After the discussion,

505
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,380
you must believe

506
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,980
that those animals are in the sky.

507
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,340
Really.

508
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,330
I'll draw them in the sky

509
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,100
later on, okay?

510
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,460
Okay.

511
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,420
Hang in there.

512
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,100
You're tired, right?

513
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,380
Brother.

514
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,540
Are you the director's boyfriend?

515
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,740
Let's do another take.

516
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,380
Right away. Is it okay?

517
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,620
Then...

518
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,100
Act happier when you've confirmed it.

519
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,780
Not yet.

520
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,340
It's either yes or no.

521
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,900
What do you mean by "not yet"?

522
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,660
It's like how you're shooting an advertisement.

523
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,490
For example, when you've filmed some scenes

524
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,060
but you haven't finished filming everything,

525
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,940
what is it called?

526
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,180
Are you waiting for the wrap?

527
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,260
Just like me?

528
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,860
Our situations are not quite the same.

529
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,500
I haven't wrapped it up yet.

530
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,700
Besides,

531
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,660
I don't want to wrap it up.

532
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,380
That means

533
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,060
your story is very long.

534
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,300
Is it a drama?

535
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,450
You can say that.

536
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,500
It's the kind that's especially long.

537
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,100
There are over 30,000 episodes

538
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,060
and 24 hours per episode.

539
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
That's going to take forever.

540
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,380
Brother, you're so funny.

541
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,140
My name is Xu Le. Nice to meet you.

542
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,340
My name is Sheng Yang.

543
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,180
Nice to meet you.

544
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,980
The previous interactions

545
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,340
were very good.

546
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,060
Okay?

547
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,660
Thank you for your hard work.

548
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,570
Okay.

549
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,140
Understand?

550
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,490
Put on your hat well.

551
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,330
Do another take.

552
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,780
It's up to you.

553
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,200
Are their makeup and hair ready?

554
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,630
Yes.

555
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,340
Come on.

556
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,220
We're ready, director.

557
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,140
Rolling.

558
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,220
Start the rain.

559
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,070
[Bazaar Amusement Park]

560
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,260
Action.

561
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,180
Good luck, Lele!

562
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,740
Kids, what is that?

563
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,420
Look! That's a crane!

564
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,660
There's a dinosaur!

565
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,810
Look!

566
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,860
Look! That's a dinosaur!

567
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,780
There's also a rabbit.

568
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,020
Okay. Cut.

569
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,010
No. 32!

570
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,580
Keep an eye on No. 32!

571
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,250
Team doctor!

572
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,460
I'll walk on my own.

573
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,620
-Don't move.
-I'm too heavy.

574
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,540
Don't move.

575
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,540
Does it not hurt?

576
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,740
It hurts.

577
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,010
Why haven't we arrived yet?

578
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,860
This hospital is like a maze.

579
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,860
It's hard to find.

580
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,580
I'll walk on my own

581
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,140
and you can see if I'm okay.

582
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,860
Ma'am, stop moving.

583
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,140
The more you move, the heavier it feels.

584
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,370
Here.

585
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,500
We're here.

586
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,380
No, no.

587
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:23,620
Okay?

588
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,700
It hurts.

589
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,700
Doctor, it hurts.

590
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,340
Okay.

591
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,700
How is it, doctor?

592
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,260
She has a meniscus injury on her left leg.

593
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,700
I suggest she rests in bed for a month.

594
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,820
Doctor.

595
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,660
I have a competition to be in soon.

596
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,860
Besides the calligraphy competition,

597
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,020
don't even think about other competitions.

598
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,820
No, I...

599
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,260
The strain

600
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,180
is too serious.

601
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,770
If she doesn't take more caution, it'll tear.

602
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,740
Then, it might not heal even with surgery.

603
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,260
You can go pay the bill.

604
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,500
Get the medicine on the first floor.

605
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,820
Thank you, doctor.

606
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,780
Kids, look what that is.

607
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,290
There's a penguin.

608
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,620
A lion.

609
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,380
A clownfish?

610
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,380
Okay, cut.

611
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,860
Stop the rain.

612
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,340
Lin, unify the direction

613
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,340
that they're looking at.

614
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,510
Okay, got it.

615
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,140
And they should act happier.

616
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,700
Act happier, okay?

617
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,380
Kids.

618
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,740
Let's act happier later,

619
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,380
okay?

620
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:29,700
Okay.

621
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,420
Are you ready?

622
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,340
Director, we're ready.

623
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,500
Come on. Ready.

624
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,260
Rolling.

625
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,500
Start the rain.

626
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,770
Action.

627
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,100
Look, kids. What's that?

628
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,340
There's a seagull.

629
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,140
There's a chick.

630
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,060
A clownfish?

631
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,100
And a leopard.

632
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,900
The little animals are here!

633
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,660
Chick! Chick!

634
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,100
Panda! Panda!

635
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,420
Bee! Bee!

636
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,300
Little white rabbit!

637
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,820
Crab!

638
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,020
Kitten! Puppy!

639
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,700
Puppy!

640
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,620
Polar bear!

641
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,540
Okay, cut!

642
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:05,850
Okay.

643
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,860
Yuan, how was the focus?

644
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:09,500
Director.

645
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,620
It was especially great.

646
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:11,820
Director Jian.

647
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,210
What do you think?

648
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,860
This take was perfect.

649
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,739
Let's move on.

650
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,659
Good idea.

651
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:23,179
There are so many raincoats here. Why didn't you ask for one?

652
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,060
I'm afraid you'd be angry

653
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,100
if I were late.

654
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,300
Wardrobe stylist,

655
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,940
bring me a clean towel.

656
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,090
I have one here.

657
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:34,500
Thank you.

658
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,179
Thank you for your hard work.

659
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,090
Director.

660
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,780
Get him some clean clothes.

661
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:39,500
Okay, director.

662
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:39,780
Thank you.

663
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,060
Come with me.

664
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,900
Thank you, director.

665
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:43,940
Director.

666
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,100
How was this take?

667
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,219
What do you mean?

668
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:47,940
Look at his idea.

669
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,659
You have to think of it in advance in the future.

670
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:51,340
There's one more group of shooting left, right?

671
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,739
Get ready quickly.

672
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:55,139
I have to finish it before dusk.

673
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,050
Okay.

674
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,500
Listen carefully.

675
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:05,780
For this one,

676
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,460
take one pill three times a day.

677
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,780
For this red one,

678
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,460
take it once a day.

679
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,900
They must be taken after meals.

680
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,820
They can irritate the stomach.

681
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,170
Go back and rest more.

682
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,500
Drink more water.

683
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,380
Don't move around unless necessary.

684
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,420
Do you hear me?

685
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,130
Sorry for the trouble.

686
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,300
Captain Hao.

687
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,380
Thank you.

688
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:37,940
You shouldn't participate

689
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,910
in the rest of the competition.

690
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,820
Wait.

691
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,780
Hao Junjie.

692
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,300
You can't joke with me about this.

693
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,660
Do I look like I'm joking?

694
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,980
Isn't it normal to get hurt when playing ice hockey?

695
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:53,900
Well...

696
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,220
I sprained my muscle today.

697
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,020
Tomorrow, my joints might be dislocated.

698
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,610
You have many injuries too.

699
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,860
Besides,

700
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,820
if I'm not even

701
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,420
mentally prepared for this,

702
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,780
I wouldn't have been able to play until now.

703
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,620
Or

704
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,740
do you think in the same way as those people?

705
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,780
This sport is not suitable for girls.

706
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,180
You used to get external injuries.

707
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,620
It's different this time.

708
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,980
This time, you're injured internally.

709
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,940
So what?

710
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,860
It's not that serious that I have to quit.

711
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,450
So what if you win the championship?

712
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,740
I just want to be serious about something I like.

713
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,660
What's wrong with that?

714
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,420
You can still play ice hockey

715
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,580
after you've recovered.

716
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,180
Will you still be here

717
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,340
by then?

718
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,100
I meant...

719
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,620
the others.

720
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,540
I can wait until I recover to play.

721
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,140
But the point is, by then,

722
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,340
the competition would be over

723
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,420
and everyone would have graduated

724
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,420
and gone their separate ways.

725
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,010
Who should I play with then?

726
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,620
You can still play ice hockey after graduation.

727
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,420
Aren't you going abroad after graduation?

728
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,890
Everyone would have gone their separate ways.

729
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,980
I'll have to look for a job too.

730
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,620
I've made up my mind.

731
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,940
If I participate in this competition,

732
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,940
the price that I have to pay is

733
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,500
that I might never be able to play ice hockey again.

734
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,940
It doesn't matter.

735
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,330
By then,

736
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,570
I'll still do it.

737
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,500
This is my choice.

738
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,980
If you treat me as a friend,

739
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,220
you should respect me.

740
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,300
Don't make decisions for me, okay?

741
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,260
Go home first.

742
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,460
It's a deal.

743
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,260
Who told you that?

744
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:52,900
Go home first.

745
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,570
Your crutches.

746
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,540
No need.

747
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,140
Use them.

748
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,500
Don't make a fuss.

749
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,340
Look.

750
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,420
I'm fine already.

751
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,700
Let me walk a few steps.

752
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,700
I'm completely fine.

753
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,260
I'm going to be crippled because of you.

754
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:10,790
Whose chick?

755
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,780
Did we miss any scenes?

756
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,520
Yours. Okay. Take it.

757
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,480
No.

758
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,200
It's all done.

759
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,730
Let's call it a day then.

760
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,000
Yours.

761
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,480
Thank you, director.

762
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:17,880
Thank you.

763
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,450
Take it.

764
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,480
All departments, let's call it a day. Thank you for your hard work.

765
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,120
Work's over.

766
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:22,810
Thank you, director.

767
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:23,520
Thank you, director!

768
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:23,930
Thank you.

769
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:24,970
Your little bear.

770
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:25,640
Thank you, director.

771
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,160
The little bee is yours.

772
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,690
Thank you, Brother Sheng Yang.

773
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,080
Your drawings are so beautiful.

774
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,880
Goodbye, Brother Sheng Yang.

775
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,850
Wardrobe stylist, please give me my coat.

776
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,690
Goodbye. You're welcome.

777
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:33,330
Thank you for your hard work.

778
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,170
Goodbye, Brother Sheng Yang.

779
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,210
Bye.

780
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,960
Goodbye.

781
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,880
Bye. Bye.

782
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,440
Bye.

783
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,610
-Bye, Brother Sheng Yang.
-Thank you.

784
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,320
Thank you, Director.

785
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,520
How's Brother Sheng Yang going to get home?

786
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,050
I will...

787
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,600
take the subway.

788
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,210
Let me give you a ride.

789
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,200
We can have dinner together too.

790
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,450
This way, please.

791
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,200
-Here. I'll do it myself.
-Thank you.

792
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,440
What do you want to eat?

793
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,450
You can order.

794
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:21,920
Why don't you order?

795
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,810
Why don't you order when it's my treat?

796
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,290
I'm fine with anything. It's the same if you order.

797
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,850
Is there anything you especially like

798
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,010
or don't eat?

799
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,040
There's nothing I can't eat. I eat everything.

800
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,280
Okay.

801
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,200
I'll order.

802
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,730
I'd like your signature Jellied Fish,

803
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:47,000
Grilled Angus Beef Steak Bites,

804
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:51,000
Dried Shrimp with Spring Onions, Crispy Yam,

805
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,370
and Stir-fried Vegetables. That's it.

806
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,850
Please wait a moment.

807
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,930
Thank you for today.

808
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,450
I feel like I'm at my wits' end.

809
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,160
I'm very happy

810
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,240
that I could be of help to you.

811
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:09,090
Actually, if you want to treat me to dinner,

812
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,610
we can just have Luosifen noodles.

813
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,530
But you can't just eat Luosifen noodles all the time.

814
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:17,570
The restroom is over there, right?

815
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,480
I need to use the restroom.

816
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,400
How do you know the restroom is over there?

817
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,280
You can go to the restroom,

818
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,810
but don't pay the bill.

819
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,600
You're paying out of your own pocket for this shoot,

820
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,280
and the budget is already tight.

821
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,600
I can still afford to treat you to a meal.

822
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,320
Besides,

823
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,290
how can I ask a kid to buy me dinner?

824
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:37,730
Have you seen

825
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,050
a kid who is 183.6 centimeters tall?

826
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,650
There's even a decimal point.

827
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,600
It must be accurate.

828
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,650
How's your job hunting going?

829
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,480
I'm waiting for you to introduce me to a job.

830
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,370
You didn't say that on the phone last time.

831
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,520
I changed my mind.

832
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,480
It's a waste not to use my connections when I know a big shot like you.

833
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,650
Just go and have a good interview.

834
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,400
I'm serious.

835
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,880
I used to do odd jobs on a regular basis too.

836
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,440
Really.

837
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,450
You changed your attitude so quickly.

838
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,800
Why do I recall that you were very adamant

839
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,450
when we were on the phone last time?

840
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,210
Oh, I know.

841
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,530
It's because there are no girls around me today.

842
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,480
I told you I don't recognize that lady.

843
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:19,690
Forget it.

844
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,880
If you don't believe me,

845
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,010
I can do the work first.

846
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,930
Pay me if you're satisfied with the work.

847
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:24,570
Okay?

848
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,810
I happen to be highly cost-effective.

849
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:26,920
Besides,

850
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,130
no one knows what you want

851
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,570
better than me.

852
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,560
Director Jian.

853
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,770
I'm very skilled.

854
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,920
And your special effects are not that hard to do.

855
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,840
Give me a price first.

856
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,250
8,000 per second?

857
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,240
Wouldn't that be 80,000 when you're done?

858
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,050
I meant 800 per second.

859
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:54,130
When I'm done, it'll be exactly 8,000.

860
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,090
800 per second?

861
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,720
Oh my goodness.

862
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,210
That's a bit too low.

863
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,160
Can you do it?

864
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,370
Don't say that you'll have to redo it when you're done then.

865
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,890
How about this? I'll report my progress to you at any time.

866
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,640
If you are not satisfied,

867
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,560
you can kick me out

868
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,280
and find someone else, okay?

869
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,400
Fine.

870
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,560
You saved me a lot of money.

871
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,600
Then we should order something better.

872
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,640
No, no, no.

873
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,650
It's too expensive here. It's not worth it.

874
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,200
And now is not the time to eat.

875
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,010
Tell me your requirements first.

876
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,530
When's the final deadline?

877
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,680
I'll start working on it tonight.

878
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,880
You'll start working on it tonight?

879
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,360
You sure are reliable.

880
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,240
Here.

881
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,050
I'll treat you to another meal when it's done.

882
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,920
That's a promise.

883
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,730
Yes.

884
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,240
I want to eat...

885
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:40,850
Luosifen noodles.

886
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,000
You saved me that much money but you just want Luosifen noodles?

887
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,330
Fine.

888
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:47,000
I'll treat you to Hotchpotch.

889
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,240
It's not that expensive too.

890
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,250
You can treat me for a month

891
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,050
every day.

892
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,570
I'll have different Luosifen noodles every day.

893
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,050
If I treat you to meals for a month,

894
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,800
wouldn't I have saved the tens of thousands for nothing?
