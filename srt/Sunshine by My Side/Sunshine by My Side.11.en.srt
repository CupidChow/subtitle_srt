00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,070
Dad.

3
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,750
Are you watching the fishes?

4
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,510
No.

5
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,030
I'm watching the fishes.

6
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,070
Dad.

7
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,350
You have back problems.

8
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:48,990
Don't sleep on the sofa.

9
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,750
Go sleep in my room.

10
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,390
I'll sleep on the sofa.

11
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,510
Are you kidding me?

12
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,630
You fool.

13
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,550
You have to work tomorrow.

14
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,510
You must be tired from working all day.

15
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,270
I'm not tired.

16
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,870
I can sleep here.

17
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,510
Be good. Go sleep in your room.

18
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,310
Don't mind me.

19
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,670
I'm used to it.

20
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,070
Fine. I'll clean the table.

21
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,390
You don't need to do that.

22
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,150
Just leave it be. I'll do it.

23
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,310
I'll put the dishes in the sink.

24
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,710
Gosh.

25
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,350
It's fine.

26
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,070
Just leave it be.

27
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:17,710
Put them down.

28
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,190
Put your hands down

29
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,110
or I'll put my hands on you.

30
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,910
I'll just put them in the sink.

31
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,870
Just a few dirty dishes. Not the end of the world.

32
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,510
Go to sleep.

33
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,590
Dad.

34
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,950
Are you really okay?

35
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,030
I'm fine.

36
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,910
Go to sleep.

37
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,070
If you got anything to say to me…

38
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,390
Fine. I'll go.

39
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,750
Dad.

40
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,430
If you want to talk,

41
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:54,829
come to me anytime.

42
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,110
I have nothing to talk about.

43
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,910
Go to bed.

44
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,829
Dad, I…

45
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,870
Anyway, tell your boss

46
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,990
that it was you who came to me with this project.

47
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,990
If you're replaced,

48
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,150
I'll call it quits.

49
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,110
What a beautiful day.

50
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,510
Why another day?

51
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,310
There's no time like the present.

52
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,630
Hurry up.

53
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,270
I'd like to have steamed buns for breakfast.

54
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,510
Will you be paying or shall I?

55
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,550
I'm fine either way.

56
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,750
You'll be paying.

57
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,550
Take your time.

58
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,550
Ready when you are.

59
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,350
Dad.

60
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,550
Is Mom all right?

61
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,870
You're worried about her?

62
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,870
Of course I am.

63
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:32,670
Fine.

64
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:33,950
Go express your concern.

65
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:41,790
Are you done?

66
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,550
Let's go.

67
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,550
Let's go.

68
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,550
It's been long since we went out together.

69
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,950
Before you graduated from middle school,

70
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,030
I worked the night shift every day so that I could pick you up during the day.

71
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,310
You need to be grateful.

72
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,590
Close the door.

73
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,030
Dad.

74
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,950
Yesterday, the two of them

75
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,390
just sat together and had a little chat.

76
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,950
It didn't mean anything.

77
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,830
Says someone who's never been in a relationship before.

78
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,270
Watch this.

79
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,150
Wait.

80
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,350
What are you going to do?

81
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,430
Hey, what would you like to have?

82
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,150
Are you a pervert?

83
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,710
Sorry.

84
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,710
Stop laughing.

85
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,950
Did you see it?

86
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,870
What are you doing?

87
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,830
If a girl

88
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,270
lets you hold her hand,

89
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,270
it means she has feelings for you.

90
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,030
If she hates you,

91
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,870
she'll pull her hand back immediately.

92
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,310
Yesterday,

93
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,270
for ten minutes,

94
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,830
Luo Meijuan grinned ear to ear.

95
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,390
Dad.

96
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,910
Should I move out?

97
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,030
Although my salary is not high,

98
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,750
after working for so many years,

99
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,030
I've saved some money.

100
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,790
I've worked for so long

101
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,870
and should've moved out a long time ago.

102
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,030
I've found a place.

103
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,430
It's near my working place

104
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,870
and the rent is cheap.

105
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,910
I can afford it.

106
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,110
I just think

107
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,870
maybe after I move out,

108
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,750
you two can have your own space

109
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,150
and won't fight again.

110
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,390
I know.

111
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,270
Every time Luo Meijuan gets mad,

112
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,030
she complains about

113
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,030
you living with us.

114
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,430
But if you really move out,

115
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,750
she'll definitely kick up a fuss

116
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,270
and do whatever she needs to do

117
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,110
to get you back.

118
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,950
With you living with us,

119
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,790
you can mediate between us.

120
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,430
To be honest,

121
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,950
it's not that you haven't grown up

122
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,830
and can't leave us

123
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,190
but that Luo Meijuan hasn't grown up

124
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,430
and can't do without you.

125
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,110
She can't accept the fact

126
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,270
that you can live on your own now.

127
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,550
To put it bluntly,

128
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,550
it's like you're weaned

129
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,910
but Luo Meijuan isn't yet.

130
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,390
Besides,

131
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,630
her menopause

132
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,430
is making her elated one second

133
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,510
and depressed the next.

134
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,630
When people our age

135
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,990
have a row,

136
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,270
we point at each other

137
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,950
and yell at the top of our lungs

138
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,070
the most hurtful things

139
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,510
we can think of.

140
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,030
With you around,

141
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,910
things are different.

142
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,910
We don't need to snap at each other.

143
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,670
You can snap at me, right?

144
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,870
When you're with us,

145
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,150
she can't hurt me

146
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,790
and I can't hurt her.

147
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,950
That's why you should stay with us.

148
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,830
Think about Ms. Qiao who lives next door.

149
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,630
Her children are all abroad

150
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,470
and only come back every two or three years.

151
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,470
She doesn't even have someone to quarrel with.

152
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,510
If you really want to move out,

153
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,070
there is only one way.

154
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,110
Find a girlfriend.

155
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,430
I knew you'd say that.

156
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,550
When that happens,

157
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,070
your mother

158
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,110
will surely throw you a parade

159
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,310
and see you off with a big smile.

160
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,630
Besides,

161
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,150
no matter how cheap the rent is, it's several thousand yuan per month.

162
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,910
If your mom knows you waste money like that,

163
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,710
she'll hit the ceiling immediately.

164
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,070
Stop talking about me. Her issue is with you.

165
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,390
What are you going to do

166
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,630
with this matter?

167
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,950
It depends on Luo Meijuan.

168
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,670
We can stay married if she wishes.

169
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,630
But if she doesn't,

170
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,630
I won't force her.

171
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,830
Have more buns.

172
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,470
Don't worry about that.

173
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:32,870
Hurry.

174
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,670
Eat.

175
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,070
Have you gotten the client's reply?

176
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,070
Yes.

177
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,030
He's not satisfied with the video

178
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,510
and wants us to make changes?

179
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,750
Then we have to make changes,

180
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,470
don't we?

181
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,110
You said that clients are always right

182
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,270
and we're just their humble servants.

183
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,750
What on earth is wrong with this video?

184
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,030
He says that the rhythm is fine

185
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,910
but different from what he expected.

186
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,030
Can he just tell me what he expects?

187
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,350
Why doesn't he mail his head

188
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,350
to me

189
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,550
so that I can tear it open

190
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,670
and find out what he's thinking?

191
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,350
He couldn't make himself clear

192
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,670
and just kept talking rubbish

193
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,830
and giving me attitude.

194
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,670
I'm so done with him.

195
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,110
Alright. Calm down.

196
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,830
What should we do now?

197
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,150
I don't know.

198
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,110
Show me the video.

199
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,190
Look.

200
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,310
What's wrong with it?

201
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,430
I think it's great.

202
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,190
It is great.

203
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,270
What should we do now?

204
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,550
You have to re-edit it.

205
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,630
How about

206
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,270
I make a call to Jian Bing?

207
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,390
Hold on.

208
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,350
Are you crazy?

209
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,110
Listen.

210
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,550
The best ex-husband is a "dead" one.

211
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,070
She'd rather you stay "dead".

212
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,150
I know.

213
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,950
You used to do the editing with her

214
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,350
and she'd give you advice.

215
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,670
But now you have to get used to doing it without her.

216
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,550
She's not around to help anymore.

217
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,870
Hello.

218
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,710
You look like a greeter.

219
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,070
Hello.

220
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,110
This way, please.

221
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,790
Please come in.

222
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,630
Nice to meet you, Director. This way.

223
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,550
I'm Song Chen.

224
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,390
Nice to meet you too.

225
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,030
Shut up.

226
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,190
Ignore him.

227
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:54,790
This way.

228
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,710
Yang.

229
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,430
Why don't you introduce us?

230
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,110
She's my client, not my friend!

231
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,710
Ms. Jian, I love the ads you made.

232
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,110
I've watched every one of them.

233
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,790
Really?

234
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,310
Have you watched the latest one?

235
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,790
Yes.

236
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,830
The one selling instant noodles.

237
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,870
I think it's great.

238
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,870
It works up an appetite.

239
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,670
He's so interesting.

240
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,510
It's knives.

241
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,150
The one with a big knife?

242
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,030
Go back to work.

243
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,790
Do you need this?

244
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:19,710
Yes.

245
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,550
Won't you thank me?

246
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,990
I'm really sorry.

247
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,070
Not everyone in this company is a weirdo like him.

248
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,030
This way.

249
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,550
Director, this way please.

250
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,430
Morning.

251
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,990
Hello.

252
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,510
Morning.

253
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,110
Hello, Director.

254
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,790
Morning. Have a seat.

255
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,430
Morning, Mr. Yu.

256
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,070
Hello.

257
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,470
No problem.

258
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,790
Director Jian.

259
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,910
This is the contract

260
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,670
we've mutually agreed on.

261
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,350
Take a look.

262
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,470
You can sign it if you're all right with it.

263
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,950
Okay.

264
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,270
I'll keep this one.

265
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,350
Okay.

266
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,670
It's great to work with you.

267
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,670
It's great to work with you.

268
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,150
I understand what you mean. I really do.

269
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,790
I just want to ask her what she thinks

270
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,510
about this video.

271
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,430
Maybe she can inspire me.

272
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,270
She's busy

273
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,950
with her new project now.

274
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,030
Don't disturb her.

275
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,790
What project?

276
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,550
Don't ask. It's none of your business.

277
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,950
Tell me.

278
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,430
What can I do?

279
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,350
Let me help you.

280
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,270
You?

281
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,990
What's wrong with me?

282
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,470
You're not in a place to be picky.

283
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,830
You should be grateful that I'm willing to help.

284
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,350
It's Mr. Chen.

285
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,830
Be quiet.

286
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,590
Hello, Mr. Chen.

287
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,590
Xue.

288
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,870
You're supposed to send me the video today.

289
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,590
You didn't reply to my messages.

290
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,510
I know.

291
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,470
Mr. Chen, I'm really sorry.

292
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,670
I need to go on a business trip today.

293
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,430
I'm on the plane right now.

294
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,310
Business trip?

295
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,870
Don't lie to me.

296
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,829
Why would I lie to you?

297
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,190
How about tonight?

298
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,510
I'll send you the video tonight.

299
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,910
Ladies and gentlemen,

300
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,109
our plane is about to take off.

301
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:16,869
Please make sure your seat belt is securely fastened

302
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,470
and your phone is turned off or in airplane mode.

303
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,109
Sir.

304
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:22,750
Sorry.

305
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,910
Please turn off your phone.

306
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,470
Our plane will take off soon.

307
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,310
Thank you for your cooperation.

308
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:28,830
Mr. Chen.

309
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,110
Did you hear that?

310
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,470
She asked me to turn off my phone.

311
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,150
I'll turn my phone off now

312
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,110
and call you back after the plane lands.

313
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,470
Awesome! You really sounded like a flight attendant.

314
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,750
What should we do now?

315
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,110
He's called to demand the video.

316
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,470
Can you really send him the video tonight

317
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,470
or were you just lying?

318
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,150
I said tonight.

319
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,910
It can be eight in the evening

320
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,190
or three in the morning.

321
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,390
As long as I don't sleep,

322
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,790
I can send it over tonight.

323
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,630
Sit down. Where are you going?

324
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,830
Re-edit the video.

325
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,230
I don't know how.

326
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,830
How did you and Jian Bing use to find inspiration?

327
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,790
Just by watching lots of videos.

328
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,430
Both home and abroad.

329
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,030
Movies.

330
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,230
Short videos.

331
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,670
Things like that.

332
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,190
Lights off. Drinks in our hands.

333
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,430
Sometimes she could think of something.

334
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,710
Sometimes I could.

335
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,230
Then we could resume editing.

336
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,190
I wonder

337
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,030
what kind of video she's making now.

338
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,430
I can drink with you.

339
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,230
It's just drinking.

340
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,510
We can drink as much as you want.

341
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,630
I drink like a fish.

342
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,710
Drinking is not the point, okay?

343
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,990
I just want to help you find inspiration.

344
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,230
Fine.

345
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,190
Where are you going?

346
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,590
I'm going to watch videos.

347
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,150
You'll drink with me.

348
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,430
I'll try to find inspiration.

349
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,430
Director.

350
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,270
These are the initial conceptual drawings

351
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,110
we created for the brand.

352
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,350
There are also storyboard descriptions.

353
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,910
Sheng Yang made all of them.

354
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,070
Director, do you have anything

355
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,670
you want to add?

356
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,430
It's good.

357
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,630
You did a great job.

358
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,230
But I think

359
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,390
although it's a makeup product,

360
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,950
it shouldn't be exclusively

361
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,590
targeted towards young women.

362
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,270
I saw the words on the first page

363
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,950
of the slide show.

364
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,310
Yeah.

365
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,110
The customer demand concept

366
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,670
is that beauty is a right and freedom.

367
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,910
In ads from the last century,

368
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,750
women's image

369
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,750
was often overly simplified.

370
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,190
They were either depicted

371
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,150
as wives or mothers.

372
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,830
So I think our project

373
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,630
should

374
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,470
challenge that stereotype.

375
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,830
I hope

376
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,070
we can approach it

377
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,070
by having more than one character

378
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,230
to show the beauty

379
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,310
of women of different ages

380
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,990
and from different backgrounds.

381
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,030
I see.

382
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,070
We'll make modifications

383
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,030
according to what you just said.

384
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:33,950
Director.

385
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,990
Your coffee.

386
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,830
Thank you.

387
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,630
You look very tired.

388
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,950
Did you not sleep well last night?

389
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,550
I look tired?

390
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,790
Yes.

391
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,310
Don't tell me

392
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,310
you didn't sleep well

393
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,870
because you were nervous

394
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,030
about meeting me and submitting the proposal.

395
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,870
That's not the case.

396
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,190
I doubt that.

397
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,070
Your eyes are red

398
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,230
and you're not active today.

399
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,990
I'll give you one more chance.

400
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,230
What's bothering you?

401
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,550
My parents

402
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,430
are probably splitting up.

403
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,630
They had a big fight last night.

404
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,990
Over what?

405
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,070
You don't have to answer.

406
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,710
My dad

407
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,990
thinks my mom is having an affair.

408
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,790
Really?

409
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,830
Do you think what he said is true?

410
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,470
Of course not.

411
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,390
That's enough.

412
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,430
All couples fight.

413
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,710
They'll be fine in a few days.

414
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,910
Yes.

415
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,430
I understand.

416
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,790
I just hate them

417
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,790
speaking of divorce so casually

418
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,710
as if it's a weapon

419
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,910
they can use

420
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,990
to hurt each other.

421
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,350
Since I was a kid,

422
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,310
they've talked about getting divorced.

423
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,190
I believed it when I was young.

424
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,710
I thought I'd have to

425
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,710
choose between my dad and mom.

426
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,390
I'd even braced myself for that moment.

427
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,630
I waited and waited.

428
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,550
But they didn't get divorced.

429
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,830
No.

430
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,390
They quarreled and then made up.

431
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,310
I think that they're like two kids.

432
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,630
No matter how bad their fights are,

433
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,190
they won't get divorced.

434
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,270
Having fights means they still care.

435
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,830
If they really want to split up,

436
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,190
they won't even bother to fight.

437
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,630
I just think if they

438
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,710
can communicate effectively,

439
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,790
there's no need

440
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,390
to resort to divorce.

441
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,550
Sorry.

442
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,310
It's too early. I wasn't thinking.

443
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,630
It's okay.

444
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,390
I don't think getting divorced

445
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,430
is a bad thing.

446
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,270
Getting married is for happiness.

447
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,630
So is getting divorced.

448
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,030
I see.

449
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,470
Then I'll tell my parents to get divorced.

450
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,270
Okay.

451
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,790
I know what you mean.

452
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,110
They care for each other

453
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,630
and can't live without each other.

454
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,830
But

455
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,910
if they use such a hurtful way

456
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,270
to express love,

457
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,030
no matter how deeply they love each other,

458
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,870
their marriage won't last for long.

459
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,110
Then tell them to have a heart-to-heart conversation.

460
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,750
I did.

461
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,710
I've said that countless times since I was young.

462
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,310
But my mom is so hot-tempered

463
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,430
that when she gets angry,

464
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,190
my dad can't control her.

465
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,870
Why control her?

466
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,790
Your dad should try to understand her and comfort her.

467
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,670
Yeah, when women get angry,

468
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,190
men usually think they're not being reasonable.

469
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,430
But you know what?

470
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,310
When a woman has to vent her anger,

471
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,110
she's not just being whimsical.

472
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,830
Her pent-up disappointment

473
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,190
and frustration

474
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,990
must have reached a point

475
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,630
where she has to let them out.

476
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,190
Okay.

477
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,390
I see.

478
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,870
My dad is at fault.

479
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:16,790
He obviously is.

480
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,790
But there's nothing much I can do.

481
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,030
You weren't there

482
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,710
when they fought last night. It was pretty bad.

483
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,070
It seems that they're serious this time.

484
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,270
In your opinion,

485
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,630
how old should the actor

486
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,670
in the last part

487
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,030
of your proposal be?

488
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,030
Around 50?

489
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,710
I got it.

490
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,870
Got what?

491
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,150
The solution to the problem.

492
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,430
Let's go.

493
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,550
Where?

494
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,870
Your parents' house.

495
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,030
My parents' house?

496
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,470
Hello, Yuan.

497
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,470
Hey, Director.

498
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,790
It's on short notice

499
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:11,430
so only part of my film crew managed to come.

500
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,430
Let me introduce them.

501
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,030
Yuan, the photographer who I've worked with for years.

502
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,870
Lin, the lighting guy.

503
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:17,710
The wardrobe girl.

504
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,790
Dai, the sound engineer.

505
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,270
Ma Ruyi, the focus puller.

506
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,190
And the art director.

507
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,870
Nice to meet you.

508
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,710
Hurry. Show us the way.

509
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,030
Thank you for coming.

510
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,350
This way.

511
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:24,630
It's okay.

512
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,430
This way.

513
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,230
Be careful. The floor is slippery.

514
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,590
Okay.

515
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,110
Are you sure it'll work?

516
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,550
Facing the camera

517
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,190
will definitely make my parents nervous.

518
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,470
When they're nervous,

519
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,550
it'll be harder for them to say what they think.

520
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,630
Do you know how many people I've interviewed these years?

521
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,230
From old people in their seventies

522
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,830
to children under ten.

523
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,630
I've found

524
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,230
that when people are nervous,

525
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,990
caught unawares,

526
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,670
or facing strangers,

527
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,310
it's easier for them to speak their minds.

528
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,430
This neighborhood

529
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,430
is so lively.

530
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,670
I should've worn my work clothes.

531
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,430
I thought I was just going to

532
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,030
sign the contract with your company.

533
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,430
My parents live up there.

534
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,550
The seventh floor.

535
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,030
The apartment facing the stairs.

536
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:19,670
The seventh floor?

537
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,550
The seventh floor.

538
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,630
Is there no elevator?

539
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,670
Sorry. No elevator.

540
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,070
Sorry for the inconvenience.

541
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,430
It's fine.

542
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,870
Sorry.

543
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,230
The seventh floor.

544
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,390
I'm really sorry.

545
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:29,830
Thank you.

546
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,190
I've never brought a girl home before,

547
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,910
let alone to meet my parents.

548
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,870
Really?

549
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,270
You brought several girls home this time.

550
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,630
Do you remember what my dad looks like?

551
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,670
Can you recognize him when you see him?

552
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,310
I did my homework on my way here.

553
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,590
Then why did you say

554
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,070
you don't remember what happened ten years ago?

555
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,790
I don't.

556
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,630
I checked the files in my computer.

557
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,430
Your dad was quite humorous.

558
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,670
Someone's at the door.

559
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,550
Someone's at the door!

560
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,390
Hello.

561
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,110
Coming.

562
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,350
Hello, sir.

563
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,710
Hello.

564
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,670
Can I help you?

565
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,390
Dad.

566
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:50,990
Yang.

567
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,070
Let me introduce you.

568
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,390
This is Director Jian Bing,

569
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,590
the advertisement director I've been working with recently.

570
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,350
These are her colleagues.

571
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,710
Hello, Mr. Sheng.

572
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,470
Do you remember me?

573
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,190
You were very nervous back then

574
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,990
and I told you to take the camera

575
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,990
as your son's eyes.

576
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,270
That advertisement is the highlight of my life.

577
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,750
You were the director!

578
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,590
Now you remember her.

579
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,590
Well,

580
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,190
Meijuan.

581
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,190
Come here.

582
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,310
The great director is here.

583
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,270
You flatter me.

584
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,030
Come here.

585
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,630
Who's it?

586
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,230
Who's here?

587
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:23,710
Mom.

588
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,750
They're …

589
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:25,790
Yang.

590
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,590
She's the director

591
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,310
who interviewed me

592
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,550
and shot the commercial for me.

593
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,670
Hello, Director.

594
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,190
Hello, Director.

595
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,030
Yang, what are they here for?

596
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,230
They want to shoot a commercial here.

597
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,350
Here in our house?

598
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:39,870
Mom,

599
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,870
why don't we let them in first?

600
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,310
Come on in.

601
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,030
Please come in.

602
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,670
Sorry for the disturbance.

603
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,710
Come in, please.

604
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,550
You're very welcome here.

605
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,110
Come on in.

606
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,910
Be careful with the equipment.

607
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,350
Come in.

608
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,670
Don't hit anything.

609
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,270
I'll go get you some water.

610
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,630
It must be heavy.

611
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,790
Yang, be careful.

612
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,630
Be careful with them.

613
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,470
Take a seat. Don't stand.

614
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,670
Here, Director.

615
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,470
Have some water.

616
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:02,630
Thank you.

617
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,630
Make yourselves

618
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:03,870
at home.

619
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,790
You said you want to shoot an ad here.

620
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,390
What kind of ad?

621
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,310
It's my idea

622
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,270
to come uninvited.

623
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,030
We plan to shoot

624
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,590
a realistic commercial

625
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,790
for a makeup product.

626
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,470
We won't hire any professional actors.

627
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,470
The ad will feature

628
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,190
a loving couple in real life.

629
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,670
So

630
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,990
we'll not only shoot the ad here

631
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,670
but also need you two to come in front of the camera.

632
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,310
Dad, Mom.

633
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,630
I signed up for you.

634
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,430
I showed the director your photo

635
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,190
and she thinks you look great together

636
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,190
and are very suitable for this ad.

637
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,430
She hopes

638
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,630
you can just be yourselves

639
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,070
so I didn't tell you in advance.

640
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,030
I talked with Sheng Yang later

641
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,670
and found that you were in the ad I made ten years ago.

642
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,190
So I guess it's destined.

643
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,230
You two are the most suitable actors for this ad.

644
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,630
But it's a makeup advertisement

645
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,470
and you came out of the blue.

646
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,030
We didn't even change.

647
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,630
Are you sure we'll look good on camera?

648
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,830
It doesn't matter if we look good on camera.

649
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,990
The problem is that we're not a loving couple.

650
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,630
Few couples at our age

651
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,430
are loving.

652
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,470
It's already a miracle that we haven't strangled each other.

653
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,390
Mr. Sheng, you're still so humorous.

654
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,070
Actually,

655
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:29,990
we're on a tight budget this time.

656
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,030
Could you please

657
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,710
do me and Sheng Yang a favor?

658
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:35,950
Please.

659
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,670
That's no problem.

660
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,910
You don't need to pay us.

661
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,310
I know his company.

662
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,910
A limited company where everything is limited.

663
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,870
The budget is always limited

664
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,990
and extremely limited on the payday.

665
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,870
I understand.

666
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,790
Thank you for your understanding.

667
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,950
It's a simple ad.

668
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,030
You don't even need to look at the camera.

669
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,710
Just answer a few questions

670
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,430
and sit in a relaxed manner.

671
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,430
But we're so casually dressed.

672
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,670
Do you think

673
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,230
we'll look terrible on camera?

674
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:04,990
Don't worry.

675
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,470
I've brought professional makeup artists

676
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,790
and beautiful clothes for you.

677
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,070
I assure you that you'll look great.

678
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,190
Shall I sit here?

679
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:17,670
Sit down.

680
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,790
Sit.

681
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,790
I don't think it's a good idea.

682
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,990
It's too messy here.

683
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,390
This is exactly the backdrop we want.

684
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:23,910
Look.

685
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,630
Here?

686
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:26,990
Yeah.

687
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,190
Mrs. Sheng isn't ready yet.

688
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,470
Let's talk for a while first.

689
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,190
Are you sure you need me for a makeup ad?

690
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,030
Of course.

691
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,870
You're the beneficiary.

692
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,790
With makeup on,

693
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,270
your wife will be a pleasant sight at home

694
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,550
and do you proud when you go out with her.

695
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,550
No.

696
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,670
That's so vain.

697
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,830
That's gilding the lily.

698
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,870
The camera is not on, is it?

699
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,430
No.

700
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,470
Not yet.

701
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,230
We'll start when Mrs. Sheng comes.

702
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,750
Madam, you look great in this.

703
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,270
Are you sure? I think…

704
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,030
Should I fold the sleeves this way or…

705
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,910
You look good either way.

706
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,470
Come. Sit down. Let them do your hair.

707
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,870
You look great.

708
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,750
Really?

709
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,470
You look amazing.

710
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,710
The director says you look amazing.

711
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,470
I'm not used to all this.

712
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,310
You look great.

713
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,030
Mom.

714
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,830
Look at my dad.

715
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,030
Mr. Sheng.

716
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,710
He looks good on camera.

717
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,670
Why do you think it's vain of women to wear makeup?

718
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,070
Look.

719
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,950
I know what she looks like.

720
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,030
We've been living together for so long.

721
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,070
I can point the freckles on her face

722
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,950
even with my eyes closed.

723
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:32,630
Then when do you think your wife looks the prettiest?

724
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,870
When she cooks in the kitchen.

725
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,350
Did you hear him?

726
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:37,950
He said I'm the prettiest when cooking.

727
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,070
What does that mean?

728
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,430
The kitchen is right here.

729
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,150
He's praising you.

730
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,470
One day, she saw an old woman

731
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,630
downstairs

732
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,550
who was picking up trash

733
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,270
and eating a piece of bread.

734
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,270
She stopped what she was doing

735
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,430
and brought that lady a glass of water.

736
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,990
At that moment, I thought

737
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,710
I was very lucky

738
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,710
to have married such a woman.

739
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,030
You felt grateful.

740
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:01,950
Yeah.

741
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,670
When she was young,

742
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,550
she was the prettiest girl

743
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:05,630
in her class.

744
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,470
Really?

745
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,590
Did she have a lot of suitors?

746
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:09,630
Yes.

747
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,989
They could line up from the dormitory to the canteen.

748
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,550
So many boys.

749
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,429
Imagine bees around a jam pot.

750
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,270
Then why do you think

751
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,630
Mrs. Sheng saw in you?

752
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,110
What did I see in you?

753
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,670
She was too proud.

754
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,469
She gave her every admirer the cold shoulder

755
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,670
and only I stuck it out.

756
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:29,469
I didn't throw money at her.

757
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,110
You know? That's superficial.

758
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,230
Of course, I didn't have the money.

759
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,750
You didn't.

760
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:36,389
What I could do

761
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,909
was stay by her side.

762
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,270
After staying with her for so long,

763
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,350
do you think

764
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,989
she's

765
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:51,030
happy with you?

766
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,230
I don't know if she was happy in the past.

767
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,710
But recently,

768
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:55,350
she's not happy.

769
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,630
Why?

770
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,030
I'm not

771
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,910
a materialistic person.

772
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,430
She's different.

773
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,630
She thinks it's stingy of me

774
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,030
to prevent her from shopping.

775
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,110
You are stingy.

776
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,430
Since we got married,

777
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,190
I haven't bought anything for myself.

778
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,310
My watch

779
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,190
was a gift from her

780
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,110
when we got married.

781
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,710
My phone,

782
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,070
my son bought it for me.

783
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:16,550
You see?

784
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,870
My clothes.

785
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,870
I only have two changes of clothes.

786
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,190
I keep wearing them

787
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,750
like an endless cycle.

788
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,230
Dad is funny.

789
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,270
I won't buy new ones until they're worn out.

790
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,510
You're so funny.

791
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,270
We don't have

792
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,230
much money.

793
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,190
We need to support four parents.

794
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,990
Fortunately, we only have one son.

795
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,470
My father-in-law was in the hospital a while ago.

796
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,870
The imported medicine cost hundreds of yuan per pill.

797
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:50,270
I couldn't even buy ten pills with one month's salary.

798
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,910
Luckily, we have savings, otherwise,

799
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,630
he wouldn't have made it through.

800
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,630
Anyway, I have only myself to blame.

801
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,910
If I had studied hard when I was young

802
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,310
and found a decent job,

803
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,230
I wouldn't be like this now

804
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,350
and could've provided

805
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,310
a better life for my wife and son.

806
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,790
Just for the record,

807
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,870
I'm not saying my job is not decent.

808
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,750
My job is fine.

809
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,390
Do you know why I chose this job?

810
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,470
It's related to your profession.

811
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,790
When I was young,

812
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,190
I watched a film.

813
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,070
It was so many years ago that I've forgotten

814
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,390
its name and plot.

815
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,190
But I remember a line that goes like,

816
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,430
"The little monster wants to eat rubbish!"

817
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,030
It was a cartoon

818
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,230
about a little monster

819
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,790
who got energy from eating rubbish

820
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,830
and helped many children.

821
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,190
That's why I'm doing this job.

822
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,990
It's all work.

823
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,030
It's good

824
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,470
to serve others.

825
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,030
So eloquent.

826
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,190
Very eloquent.

827
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,630
How do you like my haircut?

828
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,070
It's clean and neat.

829
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,550
Every day,

830
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,630
I make myself look clean

831
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,710
and then make the city clean.

832
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:07,950
It's good.

833
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,590
So,

834
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,870
despite

835
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,390
all that

836
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,470
you've said,

837
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,750
if you were

838
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,750
in a better financial condition,

839
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,190
if you could afford it,

840
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,550
would you buy beautiful clothes

841
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,990
and cosmetics

842
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,470
for your wife

843
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,630
to make her look good?

844
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,030
Yes.

845
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,830
Luo Meijuan

846
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,830
deserves someone better than me.

847
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,910
She's been through a lot

848
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,550
after marrying me.

849
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,670
Mom, why are you crying?

850
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,510
Now I understand.

851
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,310
For us to be a happy family,

852
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,510
we need

853
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,270
to make her happy first.

854
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,870
Stop crying.

855
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,590
When will we start shooting?

856
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,030
When will we start shooting?

857
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,630
She's almost done.

858
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,270
Let me see.

859
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,070
Let me see.

860
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:00,550
Let me fix your makeup.

861
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,070
Let me see.

862
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,870
Let me fix your makeup.

863
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,630
You've ruined your makeup.

864
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,110
Fix your makeup.

865
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,870
Okay.

866
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,230
Hurry. Find your inspiration.

867
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,790
Have you found any?

868
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,790
I want you here to help me find inspiration

869
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,470
but you keep talking to me now and then.

870
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,070
How can I focus on the film?

871
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,150
Can you be quiet?

872
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,870
Fine. I'll shut up.

873
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,710
The last time we watched a movie together,

874
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,350
we watched it in a class in high school.

875
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,910
What was the movie's name?

876
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,590
Pride and Prejudice.

877
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,750
You didn't watch it.

878
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,590
Are you sure?

879
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,550
I don't remember that.

880
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,190
You never remember anything.

881
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,670
I remember

882
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,630
you were a tough girl back then.

883
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,430
But now you're

884
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,910
much more feminine.

885
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,230
This transition is great.

886
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,150
We can use it.

887
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,710
What is a transition?

888
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,350
You don't even know that?

889
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,550
I'm ignorant. I didn't finish high school. Happy now?

890
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,590
Sorry.

891
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:24,790
Transitions

892
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,430
in films and videos

893
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,550
are the changes

894
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,310
from one space to another

895
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,030
or one scene to another.

896
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,110
Don't give me that.

897
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,190
Is that how you make girls fall for you?

898
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,230
Is that how

899
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,710
you won Jian Bing's heart?

900
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,070
Aren't you the same?

901
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,710
You're good at seducing men,

902
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,550
aren't you?

903
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,830
With high heels

904
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,230
and tights on.

905
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,470
Wearing perfume

906
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,710
and throwing yourself at them after getting drunk.

907
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,830
Let me tell you.

908
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,430
The reason why we can

909
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,710
be friends for so many years

910
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,790
is because we're birds of a feather

911
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,750
and like-minded.

912
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,110
We're peas in a pod.

913
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,550
Do you have to be so annoying?

914
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,230
We're not birds of a feather.

915
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,630
Watch it yourself.

916
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,470
I'm leaving.

917
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,550
Wait.

918
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,670
You

919
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,270
need to be taught a lesson.

920
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,630
You're drunk.

921
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:38,710
No.

922
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,150
You are drunk.

923
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,510
I'm sober.

924
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,350
Do you know…

925
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,150
I do.

926
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,710
You've had feelings for me since middle school.

927
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,590
Then do you know…

928
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,390
I do.

929
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,790
We're the same.

930
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,390
We never love anyone for too long.

931
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,310
We play the field

932
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,190
and fall in love easily.

933
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,670
Are you a dog in heat?

934
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,270
Did you think about the consequences before kissing me?

935
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,670
Are you out of your mind?

936
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,470
I'm speechless.

937
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:22,950
Listen.

938
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,790
What happened just now didn't mean anything.

939
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,830
Don't take it to heart.

940
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,470
Okay.

941
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,870
Keep it between us

942
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,830
and take it to the grave.

943
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,270
To the grave.

944
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,310
Don't you dare breathe a word.

945
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,030
I wouldn't dare.

946
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:53,950
You can't

947
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,590
blame all that on me.
