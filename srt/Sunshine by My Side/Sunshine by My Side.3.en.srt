1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,830
Are you willing to be forced by your parents

3
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,830
to have an awkward chat with a stranger for a whole night?

4
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,950
I'm not.

5
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,390
That's why I didn't go.

6
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,350
That shouldn't count as standing you up, right?

7
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,350
I don't know you,

8
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,590
and you don't know me.

9
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,990
But we'll be working together

10
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,350
for six months.

11
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,110
How many six months are there in your whole life?

12
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,150
There'll only be 160 six months

13
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,670
even if you live to 80.

14
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,550
Since time is so precious,

15
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:21,110
there's no need for us to play office politics.

16
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,829
That's the bad habit of the older generation.

17
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,230
I have a question for you.

18
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,110
Why are you so sure that

19
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,990
you'll only be here for six months?

20
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,590
When I first came here for internship,

21
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,990
I was determined to stay.

22
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,390
I worked from dawn to dusk, and I didn't dare to slack off.

23
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,070
If my guess is right,

24
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,670
you're only here to earn credits, right?

25
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,550
And you got in through connections.

26
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,550
I've never heard that

27
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,950
our company was hiring new interns

28
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,270
over the last six months.

29
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,829
Since you're only here to dawdle,

30
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,430
why should we waste our time

31
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,670
bonding with each other?

32
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,110
Also,

33
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,390
I didn't say all that

34
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,870
just to frighten you.

35
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,550
It's really hard and tiring to work in this industry.

36
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,790
So if you don't truly love it,

37
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,510
you should quit as soon as possible.

38
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,550
Excuse me.

39
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,150
So you were determined to work in this industry

40
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,270
from the beginning?

41
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,670
Haven't you ever regretted it?

42
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,710
That wasn't the case for me.

43
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,829
It was up to my college entrance exam results.

44
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,710
I could only get in the major

45
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,150
to choose that major?

46
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,270
I don't know what I want to do at all.

47
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,829
I'm at a loss right now, you know?

48
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:39,990
I'm worried all the time

49
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,430
because I don't know what I can do

50
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,670
and what I need.

51
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:46,950
Right.

52
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,550
I did get this internship through my mom,

53
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,870
and I've never studied design.

54
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,270
But I'd like to give it a try.

55
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,230
What if I could do it?

56
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,829
I promise I will study hard.

57
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:58,110
I...

58
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,150
I'll try my best not to hold you back.

59
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,350
I won't trouble you,

60
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,110
okay?

61
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,230
Come on.

62
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,470
Senior.

63
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,710
How about I treat you to dinner tonight?

64
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,350
It's not necessary.

65
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,909
We don't have to stand on ceremony.

66
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,150
Isn't that our team's rule?

67
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,830
When there's a newcomer, the team must have dinner together.

68
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,230
Team Leader said that.

69
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,670
He

70
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,150
only welcomes girls.

71
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,230
Yang, is it your phone that keeps ringing?

72
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,909
It's nothing.

73
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:52,790
I don't know that number.

74
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,030
It's either advertising or pyramid scheme.

75
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,990
What if it's a client?

76
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,350
A client?

77
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,470
Clients only reach me by WeChat.

78
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,350
No one would call me on my phone.

79
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,350
Who's that?

80
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,270
Nothing.

81
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,670
It's nothing.

82
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,030
Well,

83
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,590
have a good chat with our junior here.

84
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,350
Have a good chat.

85
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,790
A female client?

86
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,110
Don't say anything.

87
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,150
Hello?

88
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,350
Hello?

89
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,470
Say something.

90
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,350
Hello?

91
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,230
Is that Sheng Yang?

92
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,990
Yes, this is he.

93
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,270
Thank you for yesterday.

94
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,710
I'm sorry I drank too much.

95
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,470
I added you on WeChat.

96
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,790
Accept my friend request,

97
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,590
and I'll transfer the money to you.

98
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,230
No, it's okay.

99
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,030
What do you mean it's okay?

100
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,790
Add her on WeChat.

101
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,590
Are you...

102
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,990
Still, accept my friend request.

103
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,550
No, it's really...

104
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,590
Hey, you...

105
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,470
She's throwing herself at you. Are you stupid?

106
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,710
You found yourself a rich lady?

107
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,590
What's going on?

108
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,230
Shut up!

109
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,030
Don't say a word.

110
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,470
Hello?

111
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,830
Hello. Well...

112
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,590
Well, you transferred more than what I spent.

113
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:58,030
It couldn't be.

114
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,910
Money for dinner,

115
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,150
hotel,

116
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,230
and deposit.

117
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,910
As for the rest, take it as my gratitude for your courageous behavior.

118
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,470
You were drunk.

119
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,590
I didn't do anything courageous.

120
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,670
You kept me company all night,

121
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,030
and you didn't let anything happen to me.

122
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,030
That already counts as courageous behavior.

123
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,470
Well,

124
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,390
you still transferred too much.

125
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,110
I can't accept it.

126
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,150
I'll return it all to you.

127
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,590
Why are you so nagging, kid?

128
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,790
Just take it.

129
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,830
I remember

130
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,030
I threw something at you, right?

131
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,910
Are you okay?

132
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,150
No, you didn't.

133
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,030
Hello, Beauty.

134
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,910
He's not okay.

135
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,470
I'm his friend.

136
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,030
You see.

137
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,830
This morning,

138
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,710
when he came to work,

139
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,150
I saw a big gash on his head which was stitched.

140
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,350
It's still bleeding now.

141
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,590
He's been feeling dizzy.

142
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,909
He may have a concussion.

143
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:41,909
Why don't you take him to the hospital

144
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:42,790
and see a doctor?

145
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,030
What about work?

146
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,030
A beautiful lady taking you to have a check-up.

147
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,909
How great is that? How can you not go?

148
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:47,790
I'll go if you don't.

149
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,790
This is my address.

150
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,230
If you need anything,

151
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,710
you can come find me here.

152
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,030
I'll take you to the hospital.

153
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,670
You're welcome.

154
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,590
She sounded like a domineering lady.

155
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,910
So we have similar taste in women.

156
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,790
Stop making trouble.

157
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,710
Let her take you to have your heart checked too.

158
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,670
To see if you have lost your conscience.

159
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,150
Don't follow me.

160
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,990
Let me have a look.

161
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,790
Jian Bing.

162
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,110
I'm back.

163
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,510
Are you still angry?

164
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:46,870
Well,

165
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,470
who was that man last night?

166
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,870
You started having one-night stands?

167
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,750
Your vindictiveness wasn't that strong before.

168
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,230
What?

169
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,830
Packing your stuff?

170
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,990
Are you going to run away from home?

171
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,630
I'm packing things for you.

172
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,830
Let's separate for now.

173
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,590
Go live in that big house in the city.

174
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,630
I'll live here. Don't touch it.

175
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,750
I didn't agree to divorce.

176
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,950
If you don't agree,

177
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,590
let's proceed with the lawsuit.

178
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,870
No, don't pack this piece.

179
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,230
Can you throw it away for me?

180
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,590
Isn't this your favorite piece?

181
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,830
You have to take it with you.

182
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,470
Look at you, being so serious.

183
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,070
If a woman is determined to get a divorce,

184
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,430
she must be having an affair.

185
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,710
Tell me, are you seeing someone?

186
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,190
Yes.

187
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,710
The one from last night?

188
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,110
Which one?

189
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,430
There are so many of them.

190
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,750
Hey, you...

191
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,830
Stop messing with me.

192
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,710
Stop it.

193
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,590
I'm not messing with you.

194
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,750
What's his name?

195
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,230
I'll go find him.

196
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,990
I've told him you're married.

197
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,510
Isn't this destroying our family?

198
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,710
No one is destroying our family.

199
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,230
You're the one who destroyed our family.

200
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,190
Xue, you've degraded.

201
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,310
Your director's mindset has degraded too.

202
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,590
I just didn't come back home for one night.

203
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,870
Couldn't it be something else?

204
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,230
What else could it be?

205
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,710
A man and a woman, alone in a room.

206
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,990
And you drank so much.

207
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,070
This one, right?

208
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,830
Good for you.

209
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,630
You even sent him our address.

210
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,230
He's coming, right?

211
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,310
Okay, I'll wait for him here.

212
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,310
I'll see if he dares to come.

213
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,110
Xue Yiming, stop fooling around.

214
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,830
Our divorce is a done deal.

215
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,630
Where is he going?

216
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,350
No idea.

217
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,110
Did you

218
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,830
really sleep with him yesterday?

219
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,230
You even spent 5,000 yuan.

220
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,070
Isn't it fashionable?

221
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,230
Fine.

222
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,870
We got even, all right?

223
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,110
How about this?

224
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,350
Well,

225
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,230
you asked me

226
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,830
to keep those three promises.

227
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:54,830
Say it again.

228
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,750
Let me think about it, okay?

229
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,070
Let's not waste our time.

230
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,470
You can't do any of them.

231
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,350
Even if you do,

232
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,510
it's just temporary.

233
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:03,990
Right?

234
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,990
You're sitting here

235
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,630
and discussing this with me so seriously.

236
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,510
How long has it been since we sat here

237
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,230
and talked about us?

238
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,230
You're not doing this because you care about me.

239
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,470
You're only doing this because

240
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,830
you feel your dignity as a man has been violated.

241
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,750
But, Xue,

242
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,830
I can't be trapped by you

243
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,110
and be your accessory forever.

244
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,750
Jian Bing.

245
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,590
Can't you get over it?

246
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,350
Be the bigger person.

247
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,590
Just be a good wife and a good mother.

248
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,110
Why must the bigger person be a good wife and a good mother?

249
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,350
If a word

250
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,350
can only be used to describe women

251
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,750
and not men,

252
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,470
that's a guilt trip.

253
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,950
For example, the word "virtuous".

254
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,190
Maybe some women

255
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,230
like to be around their husbands and children all the time.

256
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,350
They feel happy and fulfilled that way.

257
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,470
But I'm not that kind of woman.

258
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,710
What about our company?

259
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,070
If you respect me

260
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,230
and stay out of my projects,

261
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,950
we can continue to be partners.

262
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,630
We don't have children.

263
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,470
Jian Yi is our child.

264
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,590
Jian Bing, I can't live without you.

265
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,590
I really love you.

266
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,950
I've been thinking a lot these days as well.

267
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,950
I did cross the line.

268
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,230
But I feel like

269
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,830
I have nothing to look forward to anymore.

270
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:15,990
You see,

271
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,630
I've won all the awards I want, right?

272
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,470
I've earned all the money I need,

273
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,870
and I've seen the world I should see.

274
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,070
What else can I do?

275
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,710
Every day, I either

276
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,830
take on projects,

277
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,990
shoot videos,

278
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,710
or edit videos.

279
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,710
You are also like this.

280
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,950
You either take on projects,

281
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,110
shoot videos,

282
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,710
or edit videos.

283
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,750
Work is life,

284
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,830
and life is work.

285
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,630
Well,

286
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,870
I just feel like

287
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,990
I'm a walking dead.

288
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,110
They say that there are three crises

289
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,830
in a person's life.

290
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,510
The teenage crisis is the wish to die.

291
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,350
The late-life crisis is the fear of death.

292
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,990
While the midlife crisis is having the wish to die and fear of death at the same time.

293
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,510
Xue, you won't stop messing around,

294
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,110
because you have to prove that you can still do it.

295
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,750
It's also for

296
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,710
not regretting it when you can't mess around anymore.

297
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,710
By then, you can say you've tried everything.

298
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,830
Jian Bing.

299
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,470
You know me so well.

300
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,470
I do.

301
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,470
But I can't solve your problem.

302
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,470
So you've made up your mind.

303
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,869
I'll take a walk on the beach.

304
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,750
Give me some time.

305
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,790
I'll make up my mind too.

306
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,510
The destination is on your right.

307
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,190
Walking navigation is over.

308
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,270
Let me help you with that.

309
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:16,990
You...

310
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,870
Where should I put this?

311
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,990
I was going to throw it away.

312
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,990
Let me throw it away for you.

313
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,430
Where should I throw it?

314
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,670
I'll go get my purse

315
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,270
and take you to the hospital.

316
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,870
No need.

317
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,470
I'm really fine.

318
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,470
My friend was kidding.

319
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,870
You're okay, right?

320
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,790
Well...

321
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,630
Be careful on your way back then.

322
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,470
See you.

323
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:11,990
Xue Yiming.

324
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,030
Are you going on a business trip again next Wednesday?

325
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,990
I don't want to go either.

326
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,070
Why do I feel like I'm in a long-distance relationship?

327
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,510
You are always not around.

328
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,630
This is not even a long-distance relationship.

329
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,230
It's more like we're dating online.

330
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,790
It's not funny at all.

331
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,390
Directors are so boring.

332
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,270
Are you talking about yourself as well?

333
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,710
Aren't you a director yourself?

334
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,750
I just hope that

335
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,270
when I need my husband,

336
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,870
he can be on call.

337
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,150
Call my name.

338
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,430
Xue.

339
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,630
Here!

340
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,390
You scared me.

341
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,990
Call my name again.

342
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,430
Xue.

343
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,310
Here!

344
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,510
If you miss me,

345
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,710
just...

346
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,230
Just call me

347
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:05,910
like this.

348
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,990
This is quite interesting.

349
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,750
We won the award!

350
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,030
I'm late.

351
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,230
Why haven't you ordered yet?

352
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,270
We were waiting for you.

353
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,270
Don't make it so formal.

354
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,230
It's not a meeting.

355
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,990
It's a good day today.

356
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,430
I've been wanting to treat you all to dinner.

357
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,310
We've been

358
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,990
working overtime recently.

359
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,990
Anyway,

360
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,670
we got the project successfully.

361
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,950
Everyone here

362
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:57,990
contributed a lot.

363
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,470
Pan.

364
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,550
Why are you sitting there?

365
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,390
Come, sit here.

366
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,270
You are the star today.

367
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,190
Come on, sit here.

368
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,070
Waiter.

369
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,990
Give me the menu.

370
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,710
Team Leader will be handsy

371
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,150
when he's drunk.

372
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:06,990
Be careful.

373
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,390
Hello, this is our menu.

374
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,710
Do you have any recommended dishes?

375
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,270
These are all our specialties.

376
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,150
Okay.

377
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,430
We'll have one of each.

378
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,750
Okay.

379
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,990
Bring us the wine first.

380
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,030
That's all.

381
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,710
Well,

382
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,990
let's get smashed

383
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,910
tonight.

384
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:23,910
Let's get smashed.

385
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,470
Okay.

386
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,790
Shanshan.

387
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,310
Pigs might fly.

388
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,710
Cheers.

389
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,150
Come on.

390
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,190
I've heard

391
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,190
Xue's version.

392
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,710
Tell me about yours.

393
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,310
I don't want to.

394
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,270
We broke up anyway.

395
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,510
You've thought it through?

396
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,030
How will you divide your money?

397
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,710
Half and half.

398
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,390
What about the houses and the cars?

399
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,790
One house for him and one house for me.

400
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,390
One car for him and one car for me.

401
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,710
I'll keep living here,

402
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,150
and he'll go live in the big house in the city.

403
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,630
So generous of you.

404
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,230
He's the guilty party.

405
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,470
How can you tell

406
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,310
who's the guilty party

407
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,990
and who's the victim

408
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,630
in marriage?

409
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,630
What about the company?

410
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,710
I'm like

411
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,230
a child from a divorced family.

412
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,750
I'll have to choose

413
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,990
if I want to live with my dad or my mom.

414
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,390
Who will you choose then?

415
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,430
What do you think?

416
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,910
How can I choose him?

417
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,230
Smart girl.

418
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,470
I'll take good care of you, daughter.

419
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,750
Look at you.

420
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,550
I don't care about what happened you two.

421
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,470
Xue is such a jerk.

422
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,990
He's never home.

423
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,070
If you divorce him,

424
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,150
I'm all for it.

425
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,750
But...

426
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,230
If our company

427
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,310
closes down because of this,

428
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,470
I may not be able to bear it.

429
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,270
After all, it's the result of hard work by the three of us.

430
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,950
We can't let our years of efforts go to waste

431
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,710
for what happened to your relationship.

432
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,430
Don't worry. It won't.

433
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,070
The company belongs to the three of us.

434
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,270
From now on,

435
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,390
he and I will

436
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,390
do our own work separately.

437
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,710
The company still belongs to the three of us.

438
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,390
Okay, Shanshan?

439
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,470
That's good.

440
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,190
I just feel like

441
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,230
in the past,

442
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,270
you two always faced everything together.

443
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,270
You two were like

444
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,070
the most intimate comrades with tacit understanding.

445
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,470
Although Xue is a jerk,

446
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,870
he never tried to dodge any problem.

447
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,390
What are you here for?

448
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,670
Aren't you here to celebrate my new life?

449
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:32,910
Didn't you already celebrate it yourself

450
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,470
last night?

451
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,710
Knock it off.

452
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,310
Don't talk nonsense.

453
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,470
I've never got married or divorced.

454
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,750
But I know it's hard to go through a breakup

455
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,510
even as boyfriends and girlfriends.

456
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,710
You've been together for over ten years.

457
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,470
Going through a divorce must be like breaking your limbs.

458
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,470
But as I said,

459
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,270
stay with me.

460
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,870
I won't let you die alone.

461
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,390
Thank you, Sis.

462
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,670
I'll count on it.

463
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:07,950
All right.

464
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,230
They'll be here soon.

465
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,390
Who's coming?

466
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,670
Let me make an official announcement.

467
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,470
Attention, everyone.

468
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,470
Let's welcome Pan Rou, Pan,

469
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,990
to join our big family.

470
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,070
Let's give her a round of applause.

471
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,990
Welcome!

472
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,070
Welcome, kid.

473
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,550
I've always liked

474
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,470
having dinner and chatting

475
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,630
with young people like you.

476
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,230
I was talking to Liu about

477
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,870
how we haven't had such fresh blood

478
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,230
joining our team for a long time.

479
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,790
Yes, indeed.

480
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,870
Let's eat.

481
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,230
Okay.

482
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,030
This is

483
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,790
your senior, Liu.

484
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,070
She's been working with me for the longest time.

485
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,390
She was also a little girl

486
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,550
when she first joined the company.

487
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,070
But now, she's not young anymore.

488
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,270
Now that she's more capable,

489
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,030
she's also gained a worse temper and more wrinkles.

490
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,990
What kind of nonsense is that?

491
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,470
Look at Team Leader.

492
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,270
Don't make fun of me in front of the young lady.

493
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,070
But

494
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,630
she never makes any mistake in her job.

495
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,470
She's very reliable.

496
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,550
I'm not wrong about that, am I?

497
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,870
Zhao sitting next to your senior Liu

498
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,990
was hands-on trained by Liu.

499
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,470
She doesn't talk much,

500
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,230
but

501
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,230
she's very reliable.

502
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,470
Team Leader.

503
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,990
So what's Sheng Yang's style?

504
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,990
Sheng Yang is

505
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,190
good in every aspect,

506
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,630
but he's immature.

507
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,190
I think he's quite mature.

508
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,870
Of course everyone's mature compared to you.

509
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,870
Sheng Yang is

510
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:35,990
quite opinionated.

511
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,790
He's very good at his job.

512
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,030
He's fast

513
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,190
and quick-witted.

514
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,070
But his personality is not that great.

515
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,150
Think about it.

516
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,430
How terrible the employment environment is.

517
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,710
How fierce the competition is.

518
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,190
You have to be observant at work.

519
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,270
You need to know what to say,

520
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,630
and be good at reading people.

521
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,230
Right?

522
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,230
I should praise Song Chen when it comes to this.

523
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:56,990
He's very observant.

524
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:58,790
Come on.

525
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,630
Thank you, Team Leader.

526
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,230
See?

527
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,230
This is what being observant is like.

528
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,550
Bottoms up.

529
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,470
No problem.

530
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,910
But I think

531
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,030
working capacity should come first.

532
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:11,470
Pan.

533
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,470
You're still too young.

534
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,470
You need to be observant

535
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,990
and able to adapt to different circumstances at work.

536
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,470
This is my sincere advice.

537
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,910
But don't be afraid.

538
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,710
Your older brothers and sisters here,

539
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,230
including me,

540
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,710
will give you hands-on guidance.

541
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,190
Good girl, why are you so thin?

542
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,750
No, I'm not.

543
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,910
Song Chen, put some meat on her plate.

544
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,470
You're too thin.

545
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,310
Team Leader.

546
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,750
Sorry I'm late.

547
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,510
Pan Rou.

548
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,750
Sit over there.

549
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,990
Where did you go

550
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,230
after getting off work this afternoon?

551
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,030
You were nowhere to be found.

552
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,910
Brat.

553
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,190
Pour three glasses of wine for yourself first.

554
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,710
Drink them as punishment.

555
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,470
Don't.

556
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,470
Team Leader, he hasn't eaten anything.

557
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,470
Don't let him drink on an empty stomach.

558
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,470
It's bad for his stomach.

559
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,030
Right?

560
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,870
Excuse me, waiter.

561
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,710
A bowl of noodles, please.

562
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,710
Team Leader, I'll have a drink with you for him, okay?

563
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,630
Come on, Pan.

564
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,390
Come on.

565
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,270
The beef in hot pot is delicious.

566
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:04,710
Here.

567
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,310
Come on.

568
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,390
Thank you.

569
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,910
Eat more.

570
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,310
I don't want you to be this thin.

571
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,150
Or others may say

572
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,070
I treat you badly.

573
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,550
Eat up.

574
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:13,870
Eat it while it's hot.

575
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,750
Open more.

576
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,630
Go on.

577
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,070
The first time winning an award

578
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,630
is always precious.

579
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,190
You won't care that much

580
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,670
when you win a lot more in the future.

581
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,510
So we can win a lot more?

582
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,430
Of course.

583
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,790
We are so capable.

584
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,910
This thing

585
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,030
has another function.

586
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,310
Here it goes.

587
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,510
See?

588
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,630
Are you having fun today?

589
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,470
What's wrong, Sis?

590
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,510
I need to go to the ladies' room too.

591
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,230
Forget it. Let's drink ourselves.

592
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:53,910
It's my turn again.

593
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,670
Your turn again?

594
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,230
It's my turn.

595
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:55,990
Come on.

596
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,470
Cheers.

597
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,230
Whose turn is it?

598
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,310
Where is she?

599
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,310
Where is the person I asked you to take care of?

600
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,990
She said she was going to the ladies' room.

601
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,270
No way.

602
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,790
I just came back from the ladies' room.

603
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,070
Where's her purse?

604
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,790
Okay.

605
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,790
Zhao.

606
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,670
Sit here.

607
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,270
You can get to know each other and have a chat.

608
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:26,870
Sure.

609
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:32,510
Come on.

610
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,310
Sit here.

611
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,430
Are you happy drinking?

612
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,190
A little.

613
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,270
From now on,

614
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,990
take care of Pan Rou at work.

615
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,670
She's our new girl.

616
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,870
Protect her,

617
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:42,710
and care about her.

618
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,510
Okay.

619
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,910
What's wrong? Why are you so upset?

620
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,550
I thought you wouldn’t come tonight.

621
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,470
Have another drink.

622
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:49,990
Okay.

623
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,870
Team Leader.

624
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,070
Sheng Yang.

625
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,630
So you won't drink these three glasses?

626
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,910
I'll drink for him, Team Leader.

627
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,670
I'll drink for him.

628
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,710
Why are you drinking for him?

629
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,230
Who are you to speak?

630
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,750
Well, it's getting late.

631
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,630
We should call it a day.

632
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,230
Okay.

633
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,030
But you have to

634
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,190
drink these three glasses of wine.

635
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,870
I haven't blamed him

636
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,750
for skipping work this afternoon yet.

637
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,710
I didn't skip work today.

638
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,990
I only left after quitting time.

639
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,070
Damn.

640
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,710
Sheng Yang, what do you mean?

641
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,430
Do you have a problem with me?

642
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,470
Sheng Yang respects you the most.

643
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,790
He was just kidding.

644
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,310
Right.

645
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,550
He's well acquainted with you now.

646
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,550
Don't take it to heart.

647
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,510
Right, Team Leader.

648
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,790
Now that we're well acquainted,

649
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,230
he can be disrespectful, right?

650
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,470
Listen up.

651
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,470
Don't you try to change my mind.

652
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,710
I'm curious to see

653
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,030
how my beloved disciple

654
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,710
respects me.

655
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,390
Tissues.

656
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,710
Sorry, everyone.

657
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,430
Family emergency.

658
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,270
I have to go.

659
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,670
What kind of attitude is that?

660
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,910
What did he mean?

661
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,070
What did he mean!

662
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,710
Team Leader.

663
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,710
Don't be angry.

664
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,230
He had a family emergency.

665
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,390
Maybe he was in a bad mood.

666
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,790
Please don't take it to heart, okay?

667
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:31,710
How about this?

668
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,990
Let's go to a karaoke bar

669
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,990
after dinner.

670
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,470
My treat, okay?

671
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:35,990
Make a reservation.

672
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,790
No problem.

673
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,230
Pan Rou.

674
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,150
Pan Rou.

675
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,990
I know you girls sing well.

676
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,030
Sing The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau

677
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,990
for me later, okay?

678
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:49,750
Okay.

679
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,910
Let's have a drink together.

680
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,870
Let's propose a toast to Team Leader.

681
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:54,270
Cheers.

682
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:54,910
Cheers.

683
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,950
Thank you for treating us to dinner today, Team Leader.

684
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,670
Thank you, Team Leader.

685
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,950
Why are you here?

686
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,670
I searched all around for you in the karaoke bar.

687
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,550
I won't get wet here.

688
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,390
Are you stupid?

689
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,550
Don't you see there's an umbrella here?

690
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,710
Your golden trophy.

691
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,710
I had a feeling that I could get it back.

692
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,870
Didn't I ask you to throw it away?

693
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,910
Why didn't you throw it away?

694
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,470
I didn't.

695
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,270
My mom also

696
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,110
likes to throw things away

697
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,310
after fighting with my dad.

698
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,030
But every time after the quarrel,

699
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,750
she asked me to get the things back for her.

700
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,469
So I'm used to it.

701
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,270
If you want anything else,

702
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,989
I'll send them all to you tomorrow.

703
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,270
No.

704
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,469
What do you mean?

705
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,510
Do you think I'm like your mother?

706
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,270
I...

707
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,870
I didn't say you were like my mother.

708
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:27,469
You're not old.

709
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,989
I didn't say

710
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,350
you called me old.

711
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,110
I'll call a taxi for you. Go home now.

712
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,030
Why isn't the screen lighting up?

713
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,270
Why can't I turn it on?

714
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:45,909
I'll call a taxi for you

715
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,909
and take you home.

716
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,389
Right.

717
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,030
Call a taxi for me.

718
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,350
I'll call a taxi for you.

719
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:54,989
Don't move.

720
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,270
Come on.

721
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,790
I'll take you home.

722
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,750
Hold this.

723
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,310
Can you stand up?

724
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,150
Yes.

725
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,270
Get up.

726
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,470
Be careful.

727
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,270
Be careful.

728
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:11,150
To the right.

729
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,310
Be careful.

730
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:12,990
I'll be careful.

731
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:13,990
Slowly.

732
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,870
Slowly.

733
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,350
What's your name again, Yang something?

734
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,670
Sheng Yang.

735
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,990
Why do you show up

736
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,270
every time

737
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,870
I get drunk?

738
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:37,270
Who sent you to pick me up?

739
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,310
Is this some new industry?

740
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,510
Kid.

741
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,790
Do you have any other job?

742
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,910
How old are you?

743
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,310
26.

744
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,470
So young.

745
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,550
I'm not young.

746
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,750
26.

747
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,630
You're still a kid.

748
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,630
Let me ask you.

749
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,190
Do you remember that you shot a public service commercial

750
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,990
ten years ago?

751
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,670
I've shot too many commercials.

752
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,190
It's the one that you got this trophy for.

753
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,430
The public service commercial about sanitation workers

754
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,190
that got you this award.

755
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,030
Do you remember that?

756
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,470
This?

757
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,910
Yes, this award.

758
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,590
This is our opener.

759
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,510
They get up earlier than the sun.

760
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,630
Look at this.

761
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,630
This is the commercial.

762
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,030
Do you remember it?

763
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,470
No, no.

764
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,270
I can't watch it in the car.

765
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,070
It'll make me want to vomit if I watch it in the car.

766
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,790
Gosh.

767
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,430
Do you remember

768
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,510
that we met

769
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,470
at a bus stop ten years ago?

770
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,990
You do?

771
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,670
Actually, I decided to get in this industry

772
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,470
because of you.

773
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,990
Many people still

774
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,990
don't pay much attention to sanitation workers.

775
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,190
Some people even look down on this job.

776
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,310
Do your family support you?

777
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,630
My son

778
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,910
doesn't like my outfit

779
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,630
I like this job myself.

780
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,550
When my son was little,

781
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,390
I used to lift him up with my arm

782
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,150
to exercise.

783
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,550
Now I can carry the big trash cans very easily.

784
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,430
We're talking to you.

785
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,630
Are you deaf?

786
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,350
Let's go.

787
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:22,950
Yang.

788
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,990
What's wrong, Yang?

789
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,990
Who did this to you?

790
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,670
Mom.

791
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,390
Can you not let my dad go to

792
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,150
tomorrow's parent-teacher conference?

793
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,950
I think he's embarrassing.

794
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,030
They wake up this city

795
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,990
earlier than sunlight.

796
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,270
They say goodbye to the starry night sky

797
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,990
for us every day.

798
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,470
When you go to sleep soundly together with the city,

799
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,470
it's them who knit

800
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,990
the curtain of the next day

801
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,790
for you.

802
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,790
Tiny dust also shines.

803
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,990
Our eyes

804
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,470
shouldn't only focus on the glamor.

805
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,470
Every attention from you

806
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,550
can change the whole world.

807
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,310
Order me some water.

808
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,470
There's only wine on the table.

809
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,790
Hold on a little longer. We'll be home soon.

810
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,550
Hold on a little longer.

811
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,470
Sir, please drive faster. Thank you.

812
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,270
Okay.

813
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:39,870
It's raining so heavily.

814
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,670
Who can be that stupid

815
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,470
to wander on the street?

816
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,590
You're the one who's stupid.

817
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,670
She's not a fool.

818
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,990
You're a fool! Cut the crap.

819
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,030
Just drive.

820
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,990
She's a grown woman. How can she get lost?

821
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:51,670
Let me ask you,

822
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,430
are you always so grumpy, even to clients?

823
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,910
Clients are always right, while you are always wrong.

824
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,030
How can I treat you the way I treat them?

825
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,790
Fine.

826
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,470
You win.

827
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,190
You win, all right?

828
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,830
You flirt with girls all the time.

829
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,470
Let me tell you.

830
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,150
If I were you,

831
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,310
with such a beautiful wife at home,

832
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,990
I wouldn't even take a look at another female, even a female mosquito.

833
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,550
Whatever.

834
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:14,990
I'll fly to Sanya tomorrow.

835
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,430
Are you out of your mind?

836
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,190
Your wife is going to divorce you,

837
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,670
and you're still going out for fun?

838
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,790
How can it be for fun?

839
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,190
I'm trying to avoid her, okay?

840
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,030
Every time I see her,

841
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,430
she talks to me about the divorce.

842
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,950
I want her to calm down first.

843
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,070
All you do is avoid.

844
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:27,750
Listen.

845
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,550
If you give her more time to calm down, she'll be gone for good.

846
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,070
Have you tried it, Liang Shanshan?

847
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,310
Have you tried

848
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,630
being with

849
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,830
someone

850
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,790
for ten years?

851
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,790
Can you stand it?

852
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:37,950
Right?

853
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,790
I can't stand it either.

854
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,910
We are both adults.

855
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,510
Don't think about it the childish way.

856
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,510
You see,

857
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,630
I have to work hard for the company.

858
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,670
I have to shoot commercials,

859
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,310
right?

860
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,390
I have to go out to socialize

861
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,630
when I need to.

862
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,630
Well, when you socialize,

863
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,910
there are all kinds of people,

864
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,190
male and female, young and old,

865
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,870
right?

866
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,070
Besides, I'm a man.

867
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,150
I'm not a man if I can stand the temptation.

868
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:02,870
Do you really think

869
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,270
two people

870
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,150
can focus on each other all the time

871
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,550
and not look anywhere else?

872
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,550
Do you think two people can

873
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,910
grow old together forever like that?

874
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,910
Why don't I buy it?

875
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,470
Were you just being absent?

876
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,910
Of course I was.

877
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,270
So why don't you divorce her?

878
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,870
You have the guts to cheat, but you don't have the guts to admit it.

879
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,470
I won't ever divorce her.

880
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,030
She is my wife.

881
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,910
She's the closest person to me

882
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,150
besides my parents.

883
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,910
Then why did you wrong her?

884
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,110
How can I divorce her?

885
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,550
Listen, Xue Yiming.

886
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,470
It's too late for you to say anything now.

887
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,870
Whatever.

888
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,990
I won't divorce her anyway.

889
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,990
Hopeless.

890
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,990
Where can she be?

891
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,390
It's so late and it's raining so heavily.
