00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,020
Liu.

189
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,500
Turn around.

190
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,340
Pan Rou.

191
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,100
Liu.

192
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,540
What a coincidence.

193
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,020
Liu.

194
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,340
Why... Why are you...

195
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,020
Why are you setting up a stall here?

196
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,420
Didn't you start a business with Sheng Yang?

197
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,420
We need to experience life

198
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,220
before starting a business, right?

199
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,300
Just come back.

200
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,260
After you left,

201
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,500
the boss mentioned you many times.

202
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,020
Let me go back and talk to him. What do you think?

203
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,540
No need.

204
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,380
Actually, we are good.

205
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,260
We should start a business step by step, right?

206
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,850
We can't reach the sky with just one leap, right?

207
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,580
Okay.

208
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,780
If you have any problem,

209
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,980
call me anytime.

210
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,060
-Okay.
-Or send me a message.

211
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,420
Help me say hello to Sheng Yang.

212
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,180
Okay.

213
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,540
Good luck.

214
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,340
Okay.

215
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,860
Thank you.

216
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,660
Bye.

217
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,060
It's a bit awkward.

218
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,300
A little.

219
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,620
Why is setting up a stall

220
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,860
different from what I imagined?

221
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,580
Have you ever bought anything from a stall?

222
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,820
No.

223
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,860
We are shopping online now, right?

224
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,420
To be honest, I really don't understand

225
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,300
what those who buy things from street stalls think.

226
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,300
Do you think the things we are selling

227
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,700
are not practical?

228
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,130
Actually, I also think

229
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,220
maybe it's not suitable

230
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,490
to sell these things here.

231
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,220
We have no experience.

232
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,820
But we have to experience a lot

233
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,730
in order to gain experience.

234
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,540
Right?

235
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,460
Let's do this step by step.

236
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,100
We can't use

237
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,340
our experience gained from work.

238
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,460
You are right.

239
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,140
Making money is so hard.

240
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,100
I really admire my parents now,

241
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,860
honestly.

242
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,060
How did they manage to strike a balance

243
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,140
between getting married and having a child

244
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,900
and working in their 20s?

245
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,180
Now they have a car, a house,

246
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,180
and savings.

247
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,500
And they give me living expenses every month.

248
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,780
Well.

249
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,540
My family runs a shop, right?

250
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,540
I used to be influenced by my family every day.

251
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,860
Why haven't I learned any sales techniques?

252
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,140
I'm regretful.

253
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,180
We've been here all day.

254
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,500
We haven't sold anything.

255
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,180
Should we come here again tomorrow?

256
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,740
You make the call.

257
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,140
Have you received my parcels today?

258
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,300
Yes, I've received a few.

259
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,460
I have a very important document.

260
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,300
The sender's name is Sheng Yang.

261
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,900
Tell me when you receive it.

262
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,540
Sheng Yang, right?

263
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,330
Okay.

264
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,730
Mr. Fang.

265
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,500
Morning.

266
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,300
Please come in.

267
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,660
No. Let me do it.

268
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,100
Jian Shuang.

269
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,180
What are you doing?

270
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,130
Studying.

271
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,660
Like this?

272
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,100
This is the recording from my classmate.

273
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,780
The Music Industrial Theory.

274
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:02,850
Yes.

275
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,780
I'm here to tutor her.

276
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,620
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

277
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:05,980
Not at all.

278
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,300
Tell me if you need anything.

279
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:07,660
Okay.

280
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,460
I work at home.

281
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,250
Mr. Fang.

282
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,100
Come in.

283
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,020
Close the door.

284
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,420
Mr. Fang,

285
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,780
I thought you wouldn't come today.

286
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,460
Hao Junjie told me

287
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,460
about your plan.

288
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,700
What

289
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,380
do you think?

290
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,700
Study hard and take care of yourself.

291
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,660
Your attitude is not very positive.

292
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,850
Do you like her or not?

293
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,420
If you do, you have to take action.

294
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,820
You are jittery with imaginary fear.

295
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,900
You are afraid.

296
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,170
Not exactly.

297
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,620
I'm just more convinced

298
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,780
that passionate love won't last long

299
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,860
and long-lasting love is true love.

300
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,220
I know more clearly what I want.

301
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:29,740
Come on.

302
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,140
Let's review these two lessons.

303
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,700
Mr. Fang,

304
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,380
I just want to ask you a question

305
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,980
that you've never answered directly.

306
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,660
Do you

307
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,860
really

308
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,820
like my sister or not?

309
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,000
Don't beat around the bush.

310
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,970
-Don't...
-I like her.

311
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,490
I just want to show my love in my own way.

312
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,580
I don't want others

313
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,940
to interfere.

314
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,940
Let's begin.

315
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,740
You should have told me earlier.

316
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,940
The class begins.

317
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,700
Forget about the class.

318
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,569
Take action.

319
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,300
Mr. Fang, is the class over?

320
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,180
No.

321
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,340
Well,

322
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,700
I asked her to do self-study.

323
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,900
So I'm seizing the chance

324
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,940
to fix this loudspeaker box for you.

325
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,980
You really don't need to fix it.

326
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,300
I promised you last time.

327
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,900
I've brought the tools.

328
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,900
Go on with your work.

329
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,450
I won't disturb you. Don't worry.

330
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,660
I...

331
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,580
It's just that I don't really use it now.

332
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,660
I have to keep my promise.

333
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,260
Just give me a chance

334
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,460
and let me show off.

335
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,100
Dear.

336
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,900
I miss you too.

337
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,780
I'll be back soon.

338
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,420
Where's Mom?

339
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,740
Is Mom home?

340
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,700
Give her the phone.

341
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,380
Honey.

342
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,140
I didn't drink too much.

343
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,700
Don't worry.

344
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,780
I've told Mr. Zhao.

345
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,290
He asked me to receive an interview the day after tomorrow.

346
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,620
Don't worry.

347
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,980
I'll do better than in July Advertising Agency this time.

348
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,940
How much is this?

349
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:56,980
100 yuan.

350
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,900
Right, I have something to tell you.

351
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,620
I'm buying one.

352
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,420
Okay.

353
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,700
Are you paying through WeChat or Alipay?

354
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,540
WeChat?

355
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,050
I'll

356
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,140
take her home to live with us for a few days.

357
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,820
Please understand.

358
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:08,700
Thank you.

359
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,220
Yes, I know.

360
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,660
I know. I just told you in advance.

361
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:17,970
Honey.

362
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,340
I saw someone I know.

363
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,460
Okay, I'll go back later.

364
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,060
Bye.

365
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,660
Isn't this our big boss, Song Chen?

366
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100
Team Leader.

367
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,300
You still remember that I was your team leader, huh?

368
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,580
But I'm not now.

369
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,380
It's all thanks to you two.

370
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,180
Not bad.

371
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,570
You are having a mom and pop store.

372
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:50,940
What?

373
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,580
Are you two here

374
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,180
to experience the hardship of life?

375
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,380
Let me see what good things you are selling.

376
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,780
How much

377
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:03,820
is this bag?

378
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,980
2,500 yuan.

379
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,580
The price is reasonable.

380
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,020
Is this bag

381
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,090
authentic or fake?

382
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,340
It's authentic. All of these are authentic.

383
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,180
Why are you snatching it?

384
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,500
You can't.

385
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,380
Well, what are you doing?

386
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,180
I'm buying things.

387
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,940
What did you buy?

388
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,300
If it weren't for the little girl, I...

389
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,060
Don't point your finger at her.

390
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,140
Can you talk properly?

391
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,100
I pointed my finger at her. So what?

392
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,340
Listen, I'm gonna destroy your stall.

393
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,060
How about it?

394
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,660
What are you doing?

395
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,140
He's beating me!

396
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,180
Call the police!

397
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,740
Two against one.

398
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,420
Let go!

399
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:34,980
Call the police!

400
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,740
Don't hit him.

401
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,460
Officer, hello.

402
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,660
I'm Song Chen's friend.

403
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,500
What is the situation now?

404
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,820
Here's the thing.

405
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,580
Through the surveillance video,

406
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,700
we found that your friend

407
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,460
grabbed Mr. Wang first.

408
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,460
Fortunately, this is just a small dispute.

409
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,570
I understand.

410
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,460
Officer, here's the thing.

411
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,580
Song Chen is my friend.

412
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,500
And...

413
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,940
I know

414
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,300
Mr. Wang too.

415
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,260
He's my former colleague.

416
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,380
How about this?

417
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,860
I'll persuade them to reach a settlement.

418
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,050
Okay?

419
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:21,490
Sure.

420
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,730
Okay.

421
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,860
Thank you. Thank you.

422
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,460
Thank you.

423
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,430
[Police]

424
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,740
Officer, thank you.

425
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,660
Good for you two.

426
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,010
It's been just one day since we met last time.

427
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,490
Do you want to change your career?

428
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,700
You went to set up a stall.

429
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,940
But now you are at the police station.

430
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,740
Tell me, what do you want to do?

431
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,780
Do you want to do your main business or not?

432
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,100
Don't be angry.

433
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,570
We just want to

434
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,580
make some money through a side job.

435
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,140
Don't be angry.

436
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,100
A side job?

437
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,050
Is your main business going smoothly?

438
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,140
And you are having a side job.

439
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,340
Forget about your side job.

440
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,860
Yang, don't be angry.

441
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,780
I came up with the idea.

442
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,380
We just want to help.

443
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,380
It's because

444
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,780
my mom has frozen my bank cards.

445
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,340
So our capital chain

446
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,330
is broken.

447
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,580
I instigated this.

448
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,660
We just think

449
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,090
usually, you are the one taking care of everything.

450
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,570
We haven't been of great help.

451
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,730
So we want to do our best in terms of the capital.

452
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,860
Why didn't you tell me about this?

453
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,180
We established the studio together.

454
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,140
We can think of a way to make money together.

455
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,500
Okay, I know.

456
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,900
I have some savings.

457
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,420
Just forget about your savings.

458
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,250
You saved the money from your salary.

459
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,180
It's been three years.

460
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,770
You can't even afford a workstation.

461
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,380
And you have to give money to your family.

462
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,450
Making money is really hard.

463
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,180
I used to have a job.

464
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,180
I didn't realize this because I could get paid every month.

465
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,740
Now this...

466
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,580
It's my fault.

467
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,340
I only focused on creativity.

468
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,060
Money is a big deal.

469
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,100
I just left it to you and I didn't care.

470
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,900
How much money do we still need?

471
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,900
We asked about the rent.

472
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,780
It's

473
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,660
about 10,000 or 20,000 yuan a month.

474
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,860
The equipment in the studio is not urgent.

475
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,900
But we need to shoot films and hire people.

476
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,100
We have no resources

477
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,500
or connections.

478
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,140
We need a lot of money.

479
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,940
Let me go to my mom again. What do you think?

480
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,140
Don't.

481
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,580
Don't go to your mom.

482
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,300
Alright.

483
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,050
You two go back first.

484
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,580
As for the money,

485
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:10,980
I'll think of a way.

486
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,540
Alright.

487
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,580
Let's go.

488
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,380
Take me with you.

489
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,300
Okay, I'll think about it.

490
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,500
Thank you.

491
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,260
I heard that you and your wife are not getting along well lately.

492
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,260
Who said that?

493
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,980
There was an actor party last time, right?

494
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,780
There was a young man at the party.

495
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,180
Who? Who?

496
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,580
I suddenly...

497
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,300
What's his name?

498
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,220
I drank too much that day. I don't remember.

499
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,140
Sheng Yang.

500
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,900
You really came.

501
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
I'll leave you to your thing, Director Xue.

502
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:54,980
Okay.

503
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,580
I'm going there first.

504
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,980
Okay, see you later.

505
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,500
Thank you for giving me a chance, Director Xue.

506
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,100
Okay.

507
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,380
Make yourself at home

508
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,220
here.

509
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,290
These are all seniors in the industry.

510
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,460
It's a good thing to know them.

511
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,460
Do you drink?

512
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,490
Yes.

513
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,580
Wine

514
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,260
is good for interpersonal communication.

515
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,660
When you drink with seniors later,

516
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,340
be attentive.

517
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,420
Come on.

518
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,740
Mr. Zhang.

519
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,980
Director Xue, long time no see.

520
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,980
Let me introduce.

521
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,260
This is Mr. Zhang from Dacheng Film & Television Company.

522
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,300
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

523
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,460
-I brought a young man here.
-Hello.

524
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,460
Introduce yourself.

525
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,220
This is my business card.

526
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,780
Mr. Zhang.

527
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,660
I'm from Moses Advertisement.

528
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,380
No problem.

529
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,860
Our studio provides various services,

530
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,460
including packaging, demonstration,

531
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,460
and outdoor advertising.

532
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,180
It's very cost-effective.

533
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,100
I will cooperate with you.

534
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,260
Thank you. Thank you.

535
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,660
Have a drink with Mr. Zhang.

536
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,580
Mr. Zhang.

537
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:52,860
Come on.

538
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,380
A toast to you.

539
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,140
Okay.

540
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:54,980
Come on.

541
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,380
Mr. Zhang.

542
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,020
Come on, Director Xue.

543
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:56,820
Come on, Director Xue.

544
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,820
Please take care of him.

545
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,380
Don't worry.

546
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,060
Thank you.

547
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,540
I'm going there with him.

548
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:07,940
Okay.

549
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,660
Don't drink too much.

550
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,860
These two are from Shisheng Film & Television Company.

551
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,490
This is Mr. Ji.

552
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,330
This is Mr. Yang.

553
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:14,900
Hello, Mr. Ji.

554
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,420
Hello, Mr. Yang.

555
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,460
Introduce yourself.

556
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,020
Yes.

557
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,180
I'm Sheng Yang from Moses Advertisement.

558
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,260
This is my business card.

559
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,740
Our company

560
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,380
provides services such as outdoor advertising, display design,

561
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,260
and decoration.

562
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,140
It's very cost-effective.

563
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,780
You can contact me if you need anything.

564
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,770
No problem.

565
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,700
Director Xue has given the order, right?

566
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,130
Of course we'll cooperate with you.

567
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,460
Come on.

568
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,060
Thank you.

569
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,100
Come on.

570
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,140
Come on.

571
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,460
Come on, together.

572
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,500
Please take care of him.

573
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,100
Enough.

574
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,380
This young man is impressive.

575
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,460
He's down-to-earth, right?

576
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,180
Very.

577
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,220
Remember to help him.

578
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,140
Help him.

579
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,900
-Thank you. Thank you.
-No problem.

580
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Contact us if you need anything.

581
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,700
You can

582
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,740
call me directly.

583
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,580
No problem.

584
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,450
This young man is not bad.

585
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,330
Why did you drink that much?

586
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,980
When you become a boss,

587
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,380
you have to drink frequently.

588
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,860
Besides,

589
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,180
why did you only give them your business card?

590
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,860
You should have friended them on WeChat.

591
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,220
I'm going to friend them now.

592
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,700
Next time.

593
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,700
Put the glass there.

594
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,380
I'm taking you upstairs to meet some big shots.

595
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,740
You need to be more enthusiastic.

596
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,220
Right?

597
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,500
You only gave them your phone number.

598
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,290
Well.

599
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,740
Maybe they'll just throw away your business card.

600
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,620
Understand?

601
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,780
If you friend each other on WeChat,

602
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,100
when they upload something on Moments,

603
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,620
just give them a like.

604
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,730
At festivals,

605
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,380
send them a message

606
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,250
and greet them.

607
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,100
Ask how their parents,

608
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,980
family,

609
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,500
and lover are.

610
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,140
Right?

611
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,380
Build a personal relationship first

612
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,380
and a work relationship later.

613
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:41,980
Understand?

614
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,380
Remember what I told you.

615
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,140
Director Xue.

616
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,140
Later.

617
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,140
-Director Xue.
-Director Xue.

618
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,060
Don't.

619
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,060
I'm going there first.

620
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,140
I'll come back later.

621
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,060
Don't forget. I need to talk to you later.

622
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,940
Okay.

623
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,580
Finally, it's fixed.

624
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,260
What do you think?

625
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,090
The sound.

626
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,100
What do you think of it when it's compared to the original sound?

627
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,140
Perfect. Perfect.

628
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,100
It seems you are an expert.

629
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,580
Maybe I wear earphones too frequently

630
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,500
in the machine room.

631
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,860
So my ears are picky.

632
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,050
Many people like vinyl records

633
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,900
because they want to be fashionable.

634
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,500
But you are not.

635
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,820
It's hard to maintain

636
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,380
this kind of old phonograph.

637
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,780
It's not easy

638
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,460
to find a bosom friend.

639
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,580
It's an honor

640
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,220
to meet you.

641
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,260
It's the same for people.

642
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,140
Mr. Song, don't drink too much.

643
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,860
Thank you.

644
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:34,540
It's fine.

645
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,260
Mr. Song.

646
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,300
My business card.

647
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,580
Please take care of me.

648
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,260
Please take care of him.

649
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,260
You are someone introduced by Director Xue. Of course I will.

650
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Ms. Qi, thank you.

651
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,960
Thank you, Ms. Qi.

652
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,940
You guys continue.

653
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,660
We are going in.

654
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:45,940
Okay.

655
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,460
Thank you. Thank you.

656
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,500
Ms. Qi

657
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,250
is quite famous.

658
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,340
Once you know her,

659
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,380
you'll have a lot of projects.

660
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,380
Come on.

661
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,580
Ms. Qi.

662
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,020
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

663
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,180
You're slimmer.

664
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,460
You look more and more beautiful.

665
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,660
Director Xue, you're quite smooth-tongued.

666
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,100
I know it's a lie,

667
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,620
but it makes me so comfortable.

668
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,100
Come, have a seat.

669
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,820
This is...

670
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,220
Let me introduce.

671
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,900
This is a friend of mine.

672
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,180
Sheng Yang.

673
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,060
Ms. Qi.

674
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,180
My name is Sheng Yang.

675
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,020
I'm from Moses Advertisement.

676
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,980
This is my business card.

677
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,290
You have your own company?

678
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,060
I thought you haven't graduated.

679
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,330
I graduated from university four years ago.

680
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,260
You look so young.

681
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,860
He already has his own company.

682
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,660
He's here today

683
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,740
to communicate with seniors

684
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,050
and learn from seniors.

685
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:50,940
Ms. Qi.

686
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,820
Although our studio is newly established,

687
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,460
it's very cost-effective.

688
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,450
We provide various services,

689
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,700
including graphic design,

690
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,580
booth design,

691
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,700
and outdoor advertising.

692
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,300
Not bad.

693
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,100
This is my phone number.

694
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,140
Call me anytime if you need anything.

695
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:06,580
Ms. Qi.

696
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,420
Diana just told me

697
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,380
she wants to talk to me about something.

698
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,660
I should go now.

699
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,500
Learn from Ms. Qi.

700
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,460
So?

701
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,380
What project are you busy with recently?

702
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:19,980
Director Xue.

703
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,220
Our studio

704
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,740
has been busy with a public service advertisement.

705
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,580
A public service advertisement?

706
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,860
It's not profitable, right?

707
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,260
It's not.

708
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,570
We want to use this advertisement

709
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,140
to participate in an advertising competition.

710
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,940
I brought the script.

711
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,500
If you're interested,

712
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,580
you can take a look.

713
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,450
Ms. Qi.

714
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,500
Is everything going well?

715
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,940
Actually, everything went well at the beginning.

716
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,340
The biggest problem we are facing

717
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,260
is

718
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,900
the lack of money.

719
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,220
Ms. Qi.

720
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,660
A toast to you.

721
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,500
You're my senior.

722
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,460
Please give some advice.

723
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:16,980
Okay.

724
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,940
Good luck with your project.

725
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,660
Money is not a problem.

726
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,140
131.

727
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,820
132.

728
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,580
13...

729
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,860
Mr. Fang has left?

730
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,780
You want him to live here instead of leaving?

731
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,860
He's a good college teacher.

732
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,500
Look at him now. He's been tortured by you two.

733
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,860
He's mysterious.

734
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,220
Is Mr. Fang

735
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,860
always like this?

736
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,580
Of course not.

737
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,860
He saw you.

738
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,380
It lit the flame of his love.

739
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,140
Sister.

740
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,140
You...

741
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,580
You've been divorced for months.

742
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,860
Have you never thought about

743
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,260
finding another man?

744
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,739
Finding what?

745
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,380
Trouble?

746
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,219
No. Well.

747
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,780
When you go to work,

748
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,500
you can always see Xue Yiming.

749
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,139
Don't you want an affectionate man

750
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,219
waiting for you

751
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,739
when you come home?

752
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,340
Don't scare me, okay?

753
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,260
If there's always someone affectionate looking at you,

754
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,340
aren't you afraid?

755
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,179
I'm already very busy with my work.

756
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,610
All you do is working.

757
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,860
Is it fun?

758
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:48,580
Have you learned to draw since you were a kid?

759
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,980
Yes, I've learned to draw since childhood.

760
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,900
I graduated from Department of Advertising Design

of a communication university.

762
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,460
Right.

763
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,060
No wonder you have a solid foundation.

764
00:34:59,380 --> 00:34:59,980
Yes.

765
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,340
Ms. Qi, in the advertisement,

766
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:01,980
you must

767
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,500
take a look at the special effects.

768
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:03,980
I've seen it.

769
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,020
-I've seen it.
-I drew them myself.

770
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,940
I've memorized it. Put it in your bag first.

771
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,660
Okay.

772
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:13,980
Ms. Qi.

773
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,020
Let me pour wine for you first.

774
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,420
Ms. Qi,

775
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,780
I heard that you were featured in commercials when you were young.

776
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,740
You are an actress too, right?

777
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,260
Are you

778
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,180
questioning me?

779
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,060
Why?

780
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,420
Do you think

781
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,740
I'm not pretty enough to be an actress?

782
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,340
No.

783
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,740
I'm not very good with words.

784
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,380
You have to drink as punishment.

785
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:43,900
Okay.

786
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,980
I'm gonna drink one glass.

787
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,060
Director Xue is better than you.

788
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,100
He's so smooth-tongued.

789
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,500
Your words hurt my pride.

790
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,180
I'm sorry, Ms. Qi.

791
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,580
Ms. Qi, I...

792
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,740
I said something wrong again.

[Business card design Interior decoration Freehand poster profile]

00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,780

795
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,050
No.

796
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,780
We can't sell anything.

797
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,500
And we caused him trouble.

798
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,700
Oh my god.

799
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,420
What's wrong?

800
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,780
Didn't Sheng Yang say

801
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,380
he went to solve the capital problem?

802
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,130
This is...

803
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,340
I think he just drank too much.

804
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,780
Don't think too much.

805
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,780
I'm not mistaken, right? This is Sheng Yang, right?

806

What's wrong with him?

807
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,500
I came to an ad salon event.

I saw him here.

809
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,420
I didn't even dare to say hello to him.

810
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,420
I'm gonna call him and ask him.

811
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,740

I sent you the address.

818
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,060
to go in.

819
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,380

00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,890
We can't get in.

We can't just barge in.

00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,930
It should be fine. They are just drinking.

No way.

Should we go to Director Jian now?

827
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,180
Let Director Jian go to him directly,

828
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,580
and we can create a chance for him.

829
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,340
Try it.

I'm sorry to bother you at this hour.

Something might have happened to Sheng Yang.

What happened to Sheng Yang?

00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,580
He went to an ad salon.

846
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,460
Maybe he drank too much. He sent me a message saying "Help".

847
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,380
When I called him, his phone was powered off.

848
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,100
But an invitation letter is required

to participate in the ad salon.

850
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,900
We don't have an invitation letter.

851
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,780
So I'm wondering

852
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,660
if you can go there and help check on him.

853
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,700
We're worried that he might be in danger.

854

I... I have an invitation letter.

855
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,220
I'll go check on him. Don't worry.

-they will nag.
-Please come in.

00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:53,860
They will say look at you.

865
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,940
I can believe you are 40 years old.

866
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,460
It sounds like you should have died long ago.

867
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,140
What kind of logic is that?

868
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,380
Isn't it ridiculous?

00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,180
Director Xue.

00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,060
Why are you here?

Where is Sheng Yang?

00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,660

Well, don't go upstairs.

Are you drunk?

877
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:27,780
Yes.

878
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,300
We're divorced.

879
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,900
I'm not qualified to be nice to you anymore.

00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,500
Right?

881
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,460
But

882
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,100
if someone wants to use you,

883
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,700
deceive you, and bully you,

884
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,060
I will never let him succeed.

885
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,460
Who deceived me?

886
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,940
You're the only one who lied to me.

887
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,250
Don't.

888
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,940
We had a deal when we divorced.

889
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,860
We can't be like others.

890
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,460
Once they get divorced, they start to hurt each other.

891
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,980
We are kinsfolk.

892
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,100
We know each other best.

00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,700
If I'm in the ICU,

897
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,060
you should sign the document when the tube should be removed.

898
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,860
What a joke.

899
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,860
There are a lot of people waiting to sign the document for you, right?

900
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,100
Don't. I know

901
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,060
you like this kid.

902
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,300
But as a man,

903
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,660
I know him better than you do.

904
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,100
He has no money.

905
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,340
He doesn't have power or a good family background.

906
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,260
He wants to take one step forward

907
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,740
and be with you because he's using you.

908
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,740
Do you know that?

909
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,180
He's looking for a shortcut.

910
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,700
He is not worthy of you.

911
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,340
Well.

00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,580

913
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,420
Well.

914
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,260
I helped him to help you.

915
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,780
I helped him get this invitation letter.

916
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,380
Right?

917
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,500
But I didn't expect

918
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,460
my help

919
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,980
has turned into a test.

920
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,220
I introduced him to Ms. Qi.

921
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,300
He started drinking with her

922
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,900
after entering the room.

923
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,580
I couldn't even drag him out.

924
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,420
Tell me.

925
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,660

928
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:28,900

00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,580
Ms. Qi,

931
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,660
please think about the project.

932
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,090
It's not a big deal.
