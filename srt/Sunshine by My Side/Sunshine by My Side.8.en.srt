00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,620
Director Jian, you're quite good at drinking.

5
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,900
Here, let me pour it for you.

6
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,740
Director Jian.

7
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,900
Excuse me.

8
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,900
I need to use the bathroom.

9
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,850
I'll wait for you.

10
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,539
Excuse me.

11
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,330
Mr. He, let me help you.

12
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,460
Slow down.

13
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,460
Can you handle it?

14
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,420
Are you all right?

15
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,660
I'm fine.

16
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,460
What's wrong?

17
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,259
Do you regret your divorce?

18
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,620
Nonsense.

19
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,340
Can't you see I'm happy?

20
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,620
Let's drink at home if you want.

21
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,660
Don't drink here.

22
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:05,900
Not enough.

23
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,060
What?

24
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,900
How much did you drink? Isn't that enough?

25
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,900

Why are you the only one left?

29
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,930
Tell me.

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,140
Sit.

31
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,420
Listen.

32
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,900
The other six have gone to the bathroom.

33
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,780
They'll be back soon.

34
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,060
Did the six of them go together?

35
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,460
Give me one.

36
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,780
Give me one.

Give me one.

40
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,020
What are you looking at? I didn't do it on purpose.

41
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,540
You should apologize.

42
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,020
Why should I apologize?

43
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,460
Apologize!

44
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,100

Can't you practice without me?

59
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,810
Are you playing?

60
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,180

61

Yeah.

What are your questions this time?

84
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,660
Mr. Fang, I still don’t understand this.

85
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,700
Can you explain it to me again?

86
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,340

Well,

114
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,220
who's the director he just mentioned?

115
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,340
The team leader looks different.

116
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,180
Don't we have a regular partner?

117
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,220
He won’t offend anyone, will he?

118
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,220
Even you can tell?

119
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,780
A hopeless romantic.

120
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,020
Old Hen.

121
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,620
I'm not talking about you.

122
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,700
I'm talking about him.

123
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,540
Last time we had dinner together,

124
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,140
Sheng Yang would rather offend the team leader and left first.

125
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,740
This time, too.

126
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,490
Did he recommend

127
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,340
the director

128
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,780
you two have been talking about today?

129
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,980
How should I put it?

130
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,580
How?

131
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,460
This story

132
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,300
started ten years ago.

133
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,500
First love?

134
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,500
Brother.

135
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,220
Brother, just tell me.

136
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,900
Harder.

137
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:28,770
OK.

138
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,220
Suddenly I'm a little thirsty.

139
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,100
I'll get you some water.

140
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,740
Old Hen.

141
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,410
Aren't you slow?

142
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,620
Why are you walking so fast?

143
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,580
Sit down.

144
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,290
Go on and tell me more about that sister.

145
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,170
Buy me breakfast tomorrow.

146
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,820
If your story is interesting,

147
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,100
I'll treat you to a big meal later.

148
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,460
OK.

149
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,980
Actually, that sister is very special

150
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,540
to Sheng Yang.

151
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,450
Although she's ten years older than him,

152
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,290
you know,

153
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,580
the greatest attraction between people

154
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,940
is not their appearance,

155
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,500
nor their packaged image,

156
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,740
but the warmth and kindness,

157
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,220
sincerity and reliability passed on to each other

158
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,180
at a certain moment.

159
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,700
And Sheng Yang

160
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,100
has been impacted by that sister's aura at a certain moment

161
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,700
for ten years.

162
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,180
Even now,

163
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,580
he still has a good impression of her.

164
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,100
Do you miss me?

165
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,620
I bought some vegetables.

166
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,890
And lollipops.

167
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,620
Then let's go back and eat after dinner.

168
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,420
Why do you want to see me?

169
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,100
You haven't said a word for a long time.

170
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,460
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,460
You don't have to apologize for beating people up.

172
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,100
Isn't that why your uncle

173
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,090
asked you to quit the team?

174
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,540
No.

175
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,060
Don't take everything on yourself.

176
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,380
Then why did you quit the team?

177
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,300
Is it still because of your uncle?

178
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,020
I'll talk to him.

179
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,340
It's my own idea.

180
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,460
The league game is coming up.

181
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,860
Are you kidding me?

182
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,220
We can't win anyway.

183
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,140
Of course we can't win without you.

184
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,500
Who can I work with?

185
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,660
We can't win even with me.

186
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,340
Besides,

187
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,060
I need to prepare for the written exam, interview,

188
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,020
and English exam.

189
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,500
Can I ask you a question?

190
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,180
Go ahead.

191
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,260
Why did you play back then?

192
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,860
Why did you join the team?

193
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,980
I started to practice the piano when I was six.

194
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,260
I sat on the stool all day long.

195
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,740
I used to envy most

196
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,900
those kids

197
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,580
who could run and play wildly outside.

198
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,100
But my parents wouldn't let me run around outside,

199
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,220
let alone play any dangerous sports.

200
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,580
In China,

201
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,820
it can be said that in every community,

202
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,100
there's a kid who hates learning the piano.

203
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,300
I was the one in our community.

204
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,660
Later,

205
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,730
my parents went to a foreign orchestra

206
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,050
and entrusted me to my uncle.

207
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,180
I could finally have

208
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,020
a little

209
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,340
personal space.

210
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,410
So, actually,

211
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,140
I'm not trying to win.

212
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,380
I just think playing ice hockey

213
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,340
is quite exciting.

214
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,900
What are you waiting for?

215
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,820
Let's go.

216
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,180
What are you going to do?

217
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,500
Let's compete.

218
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,380
It's been three days.

219
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,340
Can you still play?

220
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:02,980
Nice shot!

221
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,620
I can't lift my arm tomorrow.

222
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,500
Really?

223
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,460
I'll give you a massage later.

224
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,460
You even know how to joke.

225
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,100
You're really humorous.

226
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,130
The coach said

227
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,420
whoever drinks this will be the captain.

228
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,540
What are you doing?

229
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,180
You want to spit it out after drinking it?

230
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,370
My uncle will be angry if he knows.

231
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,940
Don't just think about him.

232
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,460
Don’t you have your own ideas?

233
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,180
We chose you to be the captain

234
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,060
because of your professionalism and leadership.

235
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,060
Now the game is about to start, but you're giving up.

236
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,340
For your so-called

237
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,860
bright future, right?

238
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,060
There's nothing wrong with that.

239
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,700
But if you bear to see this team

240
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,460
disband like this,

241
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,860
I have nothing to say.

242
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,980
I can only wish you

243
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,610
a bright

244
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,780
and promising future.

245
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:56,120
[Sheng Yang: I’m at your door.]

246
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,860
Director Jian.

247
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,940
Are you OK?

248
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,650
Good.

249
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,940
I'm so happy.

250
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,900
Our friendship will last forever

251
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,330
and we'll meet again.

252
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,660
You're a good friend.

253
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,140
Let me tell you.

254
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,180
I'll definitely make friends with you.

255
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,380
No problem.

256
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,740
Goodbye.

257
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,340
Take care, Mr. He.

258
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,060
You go first.

259
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,130
We'll meet again another day.

260
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,700
Can you help her?

261
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,140
Don't go home like this.

262
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,180
Go to my place today.

263
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,540
Let's go.

264
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,420
I'm not going.

265
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,260
I want to go to the forest cottage.

266
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,780
What forest cottage?

267
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,180
I'm going there to use the bathroom.

268
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:50,740
This way.

269
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:25,369
[Sheng Yang: Call me back when you're done. I'll pick you up if it's too late.]

270
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,270
♫On the tram bound for tomorrow♫

271
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,370
♫There is a special passenger♫

272
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,030
♫She's been through the four seasons♫

273
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,000
♫And had memories with me in the spring♫

274
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,060
♫I keep every flower♫

275
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,150
♫Guarding the river of missing♫

276
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,170
♫I look forward to this encounter♫

277
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,220
♫Still smiling♫

278
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,630
♫Hey you♫

279
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,930
♫Next stop I'm here♫

280
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,500
♫The streetlights are still on♫

281
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,470
♫And the warmth never fades♫

282
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,320
♫Hey you♫

283
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,950
♫Don't go further♫

284
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,650
♫I still remember your name♫

285
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,340
Shanshan, I'm leaving.

286
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,020
I saw you were still sleeping, so I didn't wake you up.

287
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,700
Hello, is this the passenger whose phone number ends in 8730?

288
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,220
Yes.

289
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,140
Please fasten your seat belt.

290
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,780
Got it?

291
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,380
Jian Bing is back.

292
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,260
Qiu, Koala.

293
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:07,780
Morning.

294
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,380
Hello, Aunt.

295
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,050
Hello.

296
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,700
Lin.

297
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,780
Send me the rough cut video.

298
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,060
I'll go to the company later.

299
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,350
[Sheng Yang: Where shall we meet tonight?
Sheng Yang: Are you in the office? Should I wait for you at your home?]

300
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:33,420
[Sheng Yang: I’m at your door. Call me back when you’re done. I’ll pick you up if it’s too late.
Sheng Yang: If you're busy, let’s meet another day.]

301
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,810
Sorry, I was with a client yesterday

302
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,940
and didn't check my phone.

303
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,820
I can come to you for it.

304
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,980
You want to return the computer, right?

305
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,980
I'll treat you to a meal.

306
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,250
No, no, no.

307
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,810
I heard everything you sent.

308
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,460
You haven't been waiting here all night,

309
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,100
have you?

310
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:51,980
I...

311
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,460
I just arrived.

312
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,940
You scared me.

313
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,110
Come in first.

314
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,420
Unlocked.

315
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,540
Have a seat.

316
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,700
Actually, I'm not just here

317
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,980
to return the computer.

318
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,900
I've got something important to tell you.

319
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,130
Something important?

320
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,500
Please sit down.

321
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,740
With your current state,

322
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,500
can you still take on work projects?

323
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,340
Why can't I?

324
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,420
Well,

325
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,100
we have a project recently.

326
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,660
I want to invite you to work with us.

327
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,700
Look.

328
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,900
I've brought the information.

329
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:36,980
This is

330
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,260
our company's profile.

331
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,860
This is the profile of the client company.

332
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,500
And this is the profile of the product

333
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,060
we're going to shoot this time.

334
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,220
Our team

335
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,140
has made two plans

336
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,620
-for this product...
-That's enough.

337
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,300
I'll read it myself.

338
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,980
You came prepared.

339
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,860
You got me a job.

340
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,330
Aren't you treating me to a meal?

341
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,220
Not tomorrow, I guess.

342
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,460
Let's do it now.

343
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,580
I'll cook for you.

344
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,620
You can cook?

345
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,140
I'm experienced in cooking.

346
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,900
When Meijuan gets angry, she'll go on strike

347
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,740
and do nothing.

348
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,370
I can cook since I was young.

349
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,700
Who is Meijuan?

350
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,180
My mom.

351
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,980
You really know how to cook, right?

352
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,660
Don't burn my kitchen.

353
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,700
Don't worry.

354
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,900
You can find the things you need by yourself.

355
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,300
I need to change the clothes that smell of tobacco and alcohol.

356
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,260
Sunshine breakfast.

357
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,660
Try my cooking.

358
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,180
Drink it while it's hot.

359
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Be careful, it's hot.

360
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,420
It's very hot.

361
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,580
It's very hot, and you still ask me to drink it?

362
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,460
How is it?

363
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,420
It's nice

364
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,780
to have a bowl of porridge

365
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,940
after a hangover.

366
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,260
You did drink.

367
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,700
No wonder your face is so swollen.

368
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,300
Get out.

369
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,340
I...

370
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,100
I'll go out after I arrange the work.

371
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,660
How dare you arrange the work for me?

372
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,060
In fact, our company has other directors

373
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,460
who have worked with us for a long time,

374
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,340
but the client

375
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,660
wants a young director.

376
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,020
So I strongly recommended you to my boss.

377
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,740
Because I'm young, right?

378
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,460
Because

379
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,660
you are not only young,

380
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,740
but also beautiful

381
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,860
and suitable.

382
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,580
Do you want me to act or direct?

383
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,460
You can do both.

384
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,380
OK.

385
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,380
It's mainly because you're suitable.

386
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,180
I've read it.

387
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,460
Make-up product, right?

388
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,620
It suits me well.

389
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,460
And I really like

390
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,500
the brand concept.

391
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,260
Not to be tied

392
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,020
by labels on the outside, right?

393
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,140
Explore more possibilities in life

394
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,660
and become better.

395
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,660
But you see,

396
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,340
about the brand value,

397
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,220
it confines itself

398
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,420
to the Generation Z.

399
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,620
Isn't that narrow?

400
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,660
I think the possibility of beauty

401
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,060
is available to everyone.

402
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,770
No problem.

403
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,420
If you have any questions,

404
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,380
we can have a meeting with the client

405
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,180
to discuss them.

406
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,060
OK.

407
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,500
Well,

408
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,900
about the price,

409
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,940
we may not be able to offer too much.

410
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,900
But don't worry.

411
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,660
I'll discuss it with my boss.

412
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,460
I'll try my best.

413
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:36,850
I won't let you lose out.

414
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,860
What benefits can you gain

415
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,460
by working so hard?

416
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,460
Can you get a bonus or a promotion?

417
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,460
Neither.

418
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,700
Neither? Then what do you want?

419
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,860
I don't want anything.

420
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,060
Think about it.

421
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,260
If you do a good job,

422
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,660
the client will be satisfied.

423
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,820
If the client is satisfied,

424
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,060
our company will be better.

425
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,380
Then my boss

426
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,500
will think the person I recommend is reliable,

427
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,500
and will be impressed by me.

428
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,740
I don't really think of

429
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,250
any other benefits.

430
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,380
Are you expecting my commission?

431
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,820
Sure.

432
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,140
How much can you give me?

433
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,420
How dare you?

434
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:14,980
I'll give it to you.

435
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,780
I'm kidding. I don't want it.

436
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,980
Our company

437
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,620
recommended many other directors.

438
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,940
But I still think

439
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,460
it must be you.

440
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,780
I see.

441
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,260
I'll reply to you after reading it.

442
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,300
Why aren't you eating?

443
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,890
I've already eaten.

444
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,180
Gosh.

445
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,460
I'll be late for work.

446
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,900
I'm leaving.

447
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,060
I'll wait for your reply.

448
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,340
You cooked the porridge well.

449
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,580
Thank you for the breakfast.

450
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,140
I'll cook for you every day if you like.

451
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:49,940
OK.

452
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,580
I'll call you after drinking.

453
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,620
I'll wait for your call.

454
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,940
I'll wait for you.

455
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,740
Bye-bye, Director Jian.

456
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,340
Bye-bye.

457
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:18,900
Well,

458
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,660
get me a base shirt,

459
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,700
so I can change if I sweat.

460
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,140
Find it yourself.

461
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,980
How can I find it?

462
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,940
Sheng Xiangqian.

463
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,700
Is this your house?

464
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,380
You don't even know where the stuff is.

465
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,530
You can't even find anything.

466
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,060
Am I your maid?

467
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,900
If I look for it, it'll be a mess.

468
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,700
You have to tidy it up later.

469
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,740
I must have owed your Sheng family

470
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,300
in my previous life.

471
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,380
What is that?

472
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,020
What?

473
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,100
The box is so beautiful.

474
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:12,900
Did you buy it?

475
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:13,940
No.

476
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,660
Someone next door bought it.

477
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,540
Come on!

478
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,900
Why is it so hard

479
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,140
to hear you say something nice?

480
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,780
Why is there no label?

481
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:27,980
How much is it?

482
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,260
I won't tell you.

483
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,250
It must be no more than 300 yuan.

484
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,780
It must be no more than 300 yuan.

485
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,580
Your son said

486
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,940
300 yuan can only afford a sleeve.

487
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,780
You do the math.

488
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,580
It's so expensive.

489
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,980
But

490
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,260
it's really silk.

491
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,770
With just this one dress,

492
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,740
that's all it takes to get you.

493
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,220
Get lost.

494
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,820
Useless.

495
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,820
Thank you.

496
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,420
Jian Bing.

497
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,380
She made a lot of films.

498
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,660
She even won an award.

499
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,900
When is she free?

500
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,620
Let's talk in the company.

501
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,380
OK, I'll tell her.

502
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,580
When are you free?

503
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,820
I remember.

504
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,980
Our boss is going on a business trip tomorrow.

505
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,660
How about next week?

506
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,820
Oh no.

507
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,210
I guess I'm only free today.

508
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,180
Is she free this afternoon?

509
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,980
I'll ask her.

510
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,900
I'll ask her now.

511
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,220
You come back to make lunch for me?

512
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,820
You didn't answer my call.

513
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,900
I thought you might be busy.

514
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,380
Do you remember

515
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,100
the lipstick project I told you this morning?

516
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,660
Don't underestimate my memory.

517
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,780
Of course I remember what you just told me this morning.

518
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,050
I strongly recommended you to my boss.

519
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,460
He said he wanted to see you,

520
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,260
but he's only free this afternoon.

521
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,260
Director Jian, can you

522
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,220
go to my company this afternoon?

523
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,620
Please, Director Jian.

524
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,820
I'm counting on you to help me.

525
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,100
It's not impossible.

526
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,220
But this is in such a hurry.

527
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,300
I need to prepare something.

528
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,420
Wait for me in your company.

529
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,820
You agreed?

530
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,980
You'd better get going or I'll be too late.

531
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,250
OK.

532
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,530
I'll wait for you in the company.

533
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,140
Remember, it's before five o'clock.

534
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,380
He's leaving at five o'clock.

535
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,090
Bye-bye.

536
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,010
Hello.

537
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,980
Are you the receptionist of your company?

538
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,180
This way, please.

539
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,140
This way, please.

540
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,100
Boss.

541
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:01,660
Team Leader.

542
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,740
This is Director Jian.

543
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,060
Hello, Director Jian.

544
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,900
Nice to meet you, Mr. Yu.

545
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,140
Have a seat.

546
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:08,820
OK.

547
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,330
Thank you.

548
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,100
Sheng Yang, have a seat. Let's listen together.

549
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,940
Sorry, Director Jian.

550
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,220
It is too hasty.

551
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,090
No.

552
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,700
It's not hasty.

553
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,780
It means your company is efficient.

554
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,740
We just hope to meet

555
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,940
more clients like you.

556
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,810
No wonder Sheng Yang highly recommended you.

557
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,500
Director Jian is not only good at filming,

558
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,940
but also pretty

559
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,220
and sweet.

560
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,700
You know all about the project, right?

561
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,420
Yes.

562
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,260
Sheng Yang sent me all the information.

563
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,020
He is very meticulous.

564
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,500
I wonder how you two met.

565
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,820
We don't really

566
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,100
know each other.

567
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,060
We've only met twice.

568
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,820
Coincidentally,

569
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,740
he helped me once.

570
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,260
Later we chatted and found out that we were in the same industry.

571
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,739
Actually, I'm busy at work today.

572
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,900
But he

573
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,340
came to my house

574
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,219
and told me that this project is suitable for me

575
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,409
and your company is very interested in it.

576
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,460
I was thinking that

577
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,420
my company

578
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,100
is in need of

579
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,420
a responsible and hardworking employee like him.

580
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,460
You can't poach him.

581
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,860
How can I poach him?

582
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,620
Sheng Yang said he's been working for you since he graduated,

583
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,739
and he's very close to you.

584
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,659
Yes.

585
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,219
Here's the thing, Director Jian.

586
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:36,300
Our partner this time

587
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,179
is a domestic make-up brand.

588
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,380
They'll launch

589
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,820
a limited edition gift box.

590
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,380
They want to shoot a one-minute short video

591
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,420
and promote it both online and offline.

592
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,139
The cooperation method is very simple.

593
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,620
We are responsible for creativity,

594
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,380
and you lead the team to execute it.

595
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,620
It takes a month

596
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:51,580
from the early preparation

597
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,820
to the later stage.

598
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,100
Got it. No problem.

599
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,980
Did Sheng Yang tell you that

600
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,940
our company

601
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,460
has regular directors?

602
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,340
But this time

603
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,620
the client wants to see

604
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,740
something new and different.

605
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,940
So I want to know if you have any good ideas.

606
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,420
Of course.

607
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,780
It's a little hasty today.

608
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,740
If you're not ready,

609
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,700
we can do it another day.

610
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,780
You still worry about our cooperation, right?

611
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,620
It's our first cooperation.

612
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,500
We need to know more about each other.

613
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,420
Director Jian,

614
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,740
here's the thing.

615
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,860
We do

616
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,260
worry about our cooperation.

617
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,380
Well, please allow me to explain.

618
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,580
First,

619
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,140
we don't know your overall strength,

620
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,940
and we're worried that

621
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,980
you'll outsource it to another team and have someone else shoot it.

622
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,620
Second,

623
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,460
we haven't worked with you before,

624
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,490
so we don't know if you're cooperative or not,

625
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,580
if you're good at communication,

626
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,820
what the price is,

627
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,900
and if you'll exceed the budget.

628
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,980
Third, as we said,

629
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:49,980
we do have a team

630
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,300
that has worked with us for a long time.

631
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,420
It's relatively easy for us to control the style.

632
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,060
Working with you

633
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,820
may add to the factors

634
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,820
beyond our control.

635
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,740
He is

636
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:01,660
too honest.

637
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,460
Don't take it personally, Director Jian.

638
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,580
Got it.

639
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,420
Making things clear in advance

640
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,260
can facilitate our cooperation later.

641
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:08,940
Yes.

642
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,380
I've used this brand before.

643
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,260
To be honest,

644
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,090
women are quite serious about becoming beautiful.

645
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,090
I made a short video sample on my way here.

646
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,010
Can I project the screen onto the TV here?

647
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,180
It can be connected directly.

648
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,940
There's no password.

649
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,100
Did you take this

650
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,610
with your cell phone?

651
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,660
Can you

652
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,580
play it again?

653
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,500
Sure.

654
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,260
It's rare to be able to shoot like this

655
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,580
with a cell phone

656
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,020
in such a short time.

657
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,580
Indeed.

658
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,940
I am flattered.

659
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,620
But I'm not satisfied with it.

660
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,020
It's just a technique,

661
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,900
and it can be replaced no matter how good it is.

662
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,340
I made this short video for you

663
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,580
to show that

664
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,100
it's not difficult to execute a technique like this.

665
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,420
What's difficult is a good advertising idea.

666
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,700
I've checked the client's needs.

667
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,140
They want to work with a team

668
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,340
that is willing to learn about the product

669
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,100
and work for the product,

670
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,940
instead of something like this.

671
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,500
You are responsible for creativity.

672
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,860
So I hope the creativity this time can reflect the relationship

673
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,780
between products and people more.

674
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,380
OK.

675
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,620
Sheng Yang, work with the creative team

676
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,460
and show your strength.

677
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,460
No problem.

Mr. Yu.

679
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,170
I've also prepared

the workflow of advertising production in our team.

681
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,420
I'll show it to you.

682
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,260
OK.

688
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,060
Thank you, Director Jian.

689
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,180
You're very sincere.

690

Boss.

691
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:45,780
Actually,

692
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,940
I've heard about Director Jian and her team before.

693
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,580
There's no problem with filming.

694
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,180
But for our budget this time,

695
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,580
Director Jian's team is too expensive for us.

696
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,580
Can I have a cup of coffee?

697
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,690
-Sheng Yang, go.
-No problem.

698
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,060
I’ll go.

699

Sheng Yang.

700
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,660
Go to the shop downstairs

701
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,780
and buy a couple cups of pour-over coffee.

702
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,140
No, no, no.

703
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,420
I brought it myself.

704
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,610
I just need a cup.

705
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,620
You're a big director. Why do you still drink instant coffee?

[Black coffee]

707
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,420
Pour-over coffee is expensive.

708
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,420
So what?

709
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,780
Pour-over coffee is not the same as instant coffee.

710
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,140
There's a reason

711
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,570
why it's expensive.

712
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,540
You're right.

713
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,540
You've hit the nail on the head.

714
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,300
There's a reason

715
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,980
why it's expensive.

716
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,980
But there's nothing good

717
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,980
about cheap stuff

718
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,900
except that it's cheap.

719
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,260

when it comes to filming,

721

If the client is not satisfied,

723
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,620
we'll have to film it again.

724
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,100
Isn't that more expensive?

726
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,020

Isn't it normal to meet clients on short notice?

741
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,740
Then why did you say

742
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,900
we don't really know each other?

743
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,210
We know each other well?

00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,170
It's strange that we know each other well.

745
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,940
That means you have a hidden agenda.

Luckily,

747
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,500
you didn't put in a good word for me at the meeting.

755
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,900
Our team leader?

756
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,740
How can you tell?

757
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,860
I'm also a boss, OK?

758
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,700
In a company,

759
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,020
who is sneaky,

760
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,100
who works hard,

761
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,380
and who's hiding something,

762
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,930
the boss actually knows that.

763
00:41:58,930 --> 00:41:59,900
We just don't want to talk about it.

764
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,580
So I have to say I don't know you well today,

765
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,700
just to prevent people like him from going around

766
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,420
and saying that you're up to something or acting improperly.

767
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,740
You don't need to see me off. I've called a cab.

768
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,260
You did a great job

769
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,380
today.

770
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,580
Thank you.

771
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,500
Mr. Sheng.

772
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,260
Bye-bye.

773
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,450
Mr. Sheng.
