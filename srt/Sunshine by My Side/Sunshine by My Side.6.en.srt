1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,270
It's up to your schedule

3
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,150
when you want to do it.

4
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,870
Any time is fine by me.

5
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,350
Then,

6
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,390
next week.

7
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,270
Some day next week.

8
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,710
Okay.

9
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,630
Call me if you need anything.

10
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,590
No. I mean,

11
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,190
you can call me anytime.

12
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,390
I'm always at your beck and call.

13
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,070
Don't cry.

14
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,070
If you cry, I'll cry too.

15
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,270
You know what? When a man cries,

16
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,590
it's scary.

17
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,110
The ground will be shaking. You won't be able to handle it.

18
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,470
Who would cry for you?

19
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,630
Scum.

20
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,310
That's a bit harsh.

21
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,470
It hurts, bro.

22
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,510
Right.

23
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,070
We'll be like brothers from now on.

24
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,990
As the saying goes, when brothers are of the same mind, their sharpness can cut through metal.

25
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,390
Do you think we should

26
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,150
become sworn brothers?

27
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,070
Maybe we should also burn incense,

28
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,750
kowtow,

29
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,990
and bow to Heaven and Earth.

30
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,630
Stop talking nonsense.

31
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,230
Go home now.

32
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,190
Go back to your home.

33
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,270
Can I take this with me?

34
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,070
No.

35
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,790
You can take anything but this.

36
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,190
This is mine.

37
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,590
Didn't you give it to me?

38
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,670
When?

39
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,350
Did you forget? You gave it to me

40
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,670
when we came back home the day we won this award.

41
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,990
Try it yourself.

42
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,830
Stick it here.

43
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,910
One, two.

44
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,430
Then turn it around.

45
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,470
One, two.

46
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,390
Here it goes.

47
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,030
So, in the end,

48
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,150
what I won is a bottle opener?

49
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,470
What did you think?

50
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,590
I want to give this award

51
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:42,670
My

52
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,950
idol.

53
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,870
My most trusted lover.

54
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,710
The Best Husband Award

55
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,590
goes to

56
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,110
Mr. Xue Yiming!

57
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,310
I'm so excited.

58
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,350
I'm so excited that I almost shed tears.

59
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,630
I hope you can keep up the good work

60
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,910
and love me dearly.

61
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,390
Don't let your fan

62
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,110
down.

63
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,670
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,710
I let you down.

65
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,430
Hurry up.

66
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,670
Director Xue will take the last box himself.

67
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,390
Okay.

68
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,790
Let's go.

69
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,550
Let's go.

70
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,550
Get in.

71
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,230
All right. Don't be so sentimental.

72
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,350
Where were you before?

73
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,790
Maybe you should have it.

74
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,350
Take it.

75
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,910
Don't you have beers to open?

76
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,870
Thank you.

77
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,590
I have a bottle opener now.

78
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:35,790
I'm leaving.

79
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,310
Right.

80
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:45,870
The door key.

81
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,550
You...

82
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,470
What are you doing?

83
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,630
Seeing you off.

84
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,750
Stop it. Go back and rest.

85
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,470
Are you sure

86
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,710
you can find a place to sleep

87
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,950
in that house today?

88
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,990
If not, will you go with me and clean up the house for me?

89
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,310
Stop messing with me.

90
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,550
Or I'll regret it.

91
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,590
Bye.

92
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:18,710
I'm leaving.

93
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,110
I came

94
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,030
at the wrong time, didn't I?

95
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,830
I'm just here to tell you that

96
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,350
my proposal was adopted by our company.

97
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,669
You were right about it

98
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,990
when you criticized me last time.

99
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,789
I...

100
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,429
I just want to give you this bowl of Luosifen noodles.

101
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,190
If I want Luosifen noodles,

102
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,070
I can order a takeout myself, okay?

103
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,710
Don't come to my house so often.

104
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,790
But the delivery won't be as fast as me.

105
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,390
It's still warm.

106
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,630
Eat it while it's still warm.

107
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,550
Leave it at the door.

108
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,470
Where are you going?

109
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,510
I...

110
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,710
I'll go with you.

111
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,350
Don't follow me.

112
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,070
I started here as well.

113
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,390
Good job.

114
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,230
Jian Bing?

115
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,310
You don't know me?

116
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,350
The digital clock says

117
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,630
20:34 p.m. It's a goof, isn't it?

118
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,710
Props.

119
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,550
Who put the digital clock there?

120
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,470
It should be morning.

121
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,390
But it shows

122
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,910
8:34 or 8:35 p.m.

123
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,590
Are you patronizing me? I'm leaving.

124
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,190
You've memorized everything?

125
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,190
Did you see

126
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:14,990
how many hairs that girl had on her face?

127
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,990
There was no hair.

128
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,790
We won an award.

129
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,710
And it's a double award, you know?

130
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,110
I haven't said yes.

131
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,390
It doesn't matter.

132
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,190
Are you happy?

133
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,590
Of course.

134
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,230
We are a team. We are one.

135
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,910
Actually,

136
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,870
it doesn't matter that

137
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,070
she's my partner

138
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,110
and my comrade.

139
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,030
The most important thing is

140
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,030
she's my wife.

141
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,150
Be careful.

142
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,230
This way.

143
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,390
Why did you bring me here?

144
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,070
There's a

145
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,270
nice view here.

146
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,190
No matter how nice the view is,

147
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,790
people will still get tired of it, won't they?

148
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,230
It's just cars,

149
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,390
bridges,

150
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,990
buildings,

151
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,470
and big screens.

152
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,830
You can see the most bustling night view

153
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,230
of this city

154
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,630
on this rooftop.

155
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,830
Look at those big screens.

156
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,430
The advertisements that can be displayed on these screens

157
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,190
are the best.

158
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,470
Actually, I have a dream.

159
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,750
I hope that one day

160
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,030
the advertisements designed by me

161
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,990
can also appear on these big screens.

162
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,510
I would

163
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,670
have no regrets in my life then.

164
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,710
Wish you realize it soon.

165
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,470
Actually, I hated advertisements when I was a kid.

166
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,670
I thought advertisements

167
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,910
were like viruses,

168
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,710
invading every corner of my life.

169
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,710
But one day,

170
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,390
when I was on my way home after school late at night,

171
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,990
I saw the bus stop sign was on.

172
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,910
I suddenly had a feeling that

173
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,590
it's actually quite good

174
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,310
to have the billboards on late at night.

175
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,990
At least the nights

176
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,190
will be less scary.

177
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,070
What people hate to see

178
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,870
are ugly and noisy advertisements.

179
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,110
Advertisements can also be beautiful, artistic,

180
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,830
and appealing.

181
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,230
It's about time.

182
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,270
Get ready.

183
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,950
Ten.

184
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,270
Nine.

185
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,310
Eight.

186
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,830
Seven.

187
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,430
Six.

188
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,030
Five.

189
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,270
Four.

190
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,670
Three.

191
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:24,790
Two.

192
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,270
One.

193
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,310
Look.

194
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,150
The director is so amazing.

195
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,790
The frames are smooth.

196
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,910
The rhythm is well set.

197
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,030
The director completely brings out

198
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,830
the high-end vibe of this product.

199
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,390
I'm impressed.

200
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,390
For real.

201
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,030
Look.

202
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,390
The composition.

203
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,750
The configuration.

204
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,190
The light and shadow.

205
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,350
The visual impact.

206
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,670
Tell me it's not good.

207
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,190
I really want to shout it out.

208
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,790
Director Jian!

209
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,710
You're the best!

210
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,630
Director Jian, you're the best!

211
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,630
Do you see that?

212
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,190
This advertisement!

213
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,990
It was shot by her!

214
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,270
Her name is

215
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,750
Jian Bing!

216
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,990
Stop shouting!

217
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,670
I'll throw up if you keep shouting.

218
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,910
How's that?

219
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,710
Are you feeling better?

220
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,710
If it's not enough for you,

221
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,670
shout it out yourself.

222
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,390
Trust me.

223
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,430
Just shout it out, and you'll feel better.

224
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,950
Jian Bing.

225
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,470
There's a long way ahead.

226
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,950
Divorce is no big deal!

227
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,470
Screw divorce!

228
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,870
Screw divorce!

229
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,710
Are you crazy?

230
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,430
Why are you so childish?

231
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,910
You're like my sister.

232
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,830
You have a sister?

233
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,310
Is she as pretty as you?

234
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,350
She's as annoying as you.

235
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,510
Jian Shuang, what are you doing?

236
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,510
Time to play.

237
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,270
Okay, I'll be right there.

238
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,830
Amazing.

239
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,870
Check it out.

240
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,230
No. 32.

241
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,270
Isn't he handsome?

242
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,830
Yes.

243
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,270
Check that one out.

244
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,630
No. 17.

245
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,670
Who is she?

246
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,310
She is the only female player of our school.

247
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,590
Since we don't have a women's team,

248
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,870
she could only join the men's team.

249
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,110
Do you know

250
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,430
what she said

251
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,470
when her roommate asked her why she chose to play ice hockey?

252
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,470
Because

253
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,270
she likes it?

254
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,030
She said it's because only few people watch ice hockey.

255
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,350
It's peaceful.

256
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,070
Nice!

257
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,390
Pretty cool.

258
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,350
Keep it slow, buddy.

259
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,270
What do you want?

260
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,030
Hello.

261
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,550
Where is the VIP ward, please?

262
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,230
Go down this corridor till the end.

263
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,670
Okay, thank you.

264
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,030
Hello.

265
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,790
Of course. We must investigate it.

266
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,790
Who's the bastard that beat him up like that?

267
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,590
Call the police right away.

268
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,350
He was beaten up in broad daylight. Is there no law or what?

269
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,430
Okay, got it.

270
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,430
Bye.

271
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,550
You're awake.

272
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,110
It's you.

273
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,230
Who else would come visit you at a time like this?

274
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,670
You've lost your wife for what you did.

275
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,150
Do you want me to tell you that

276
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,150
your mother and father who are 70 or 80 years old

277
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,870
are here in the hospital with you?

278
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,710
No.

279
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,710
Please don't.

280
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,550
Thank you, Liang.

281
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,550
Didn't the doctor say you have a mild concussion?

282
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,950
What happened to your arm?

283
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,710
I think I got it punctured when I fell down.

284
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,710
My hand was already like this when I woke up.

285
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,110
Who are you giving the thumbs up to?

286
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,190
Does it hurt?

287
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,870
How can it not hurt?

288
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,550
So who did it?

289
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,110
Did you see it clearly?

290
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,830
Do you remember what that person looked like?

291
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,270
I didn't see it.

292
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,630
I remember he was wearing a helmet.

293
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,550
A helmet...

294
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,150
I wonder if he's a pilot

295
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,430
or a tank soldier.

296
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,910
I think he might be Black Cat Detective.

297
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,630
Do you want me to hit you?

298
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,470
He was riding a motorbike, you know?

299
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,950
He was dressed in all black.

300
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,590
Did you offend anyone lately?

301
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,270
I know.

302
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,870
Did you sleep with

303
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,950
some woman you shouldn't have?

304
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,590
It couldn't be.

305
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,430
This is karma.

306
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,230
You deserve it.

307
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,030
I'm already like this.

308
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,390
Can you stop making fun of me?

309
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,710
Mr. Hu.

310
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,710
He must be calling to comfort me.

311
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,350
Mr. Hu.

312
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,230
Hello.

313
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:40,910
Director Xue.

314
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,390
How are you?

315
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,910
I heard you were hospitalized.

316
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,030
Well...

317
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,910
Rumor must have it

318
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,030
that I'm crippled, right?

319
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,190
I'm okay.

320
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,830
Don't worry. I'm okay.

321
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,590
Is it serious?

322
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,350
How many days will you be hospitalized?

323
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,390
It's not serious.

324
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,510
It's nothing.

325
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,070
They said I'd be hospitalized for three days.

326
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,590
That long?

327
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,710
It seems serious.

328
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,870
It's okay. It's nothing.

329
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,110
What's up?

330
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,510
Well.

331
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,590
About the commercial.

332
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,310
The client called me

333
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,150
and said we must deliver the video this week.

334
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:23,990
Well...

335
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:24,790
Hu.

336
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,590
I'm still lying in the hospital bed now.

337
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,350
Give me a few more days.

338
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,230
Yes.

339
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,910
I know it's not easy for you either.

340
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,470
I'm just saying.

341
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,510
Can you edit the video in the ward?

342
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,710
Mr. Hu, this is Shanshan.

343
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,030
Here's the thing.

344
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,390
Xue has

345
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,310
a plaster cast on his right arm,

346
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,710
and an IV in his left hand now.

347
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,030
Even if the video can be edited in the ward,

348
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,230
he can't edit with his feet, right?

349
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,630
What should we do about the video then?

350
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,430
Don't worry.

351
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,670
I'll keep an eye on it myself.

352
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,670
I'll make sure the result is satisfactory, okay?

353
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,070
Okay.

354
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,830
I'm relieved to hear that.

355
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,630
All right, Mr. Hu. We have guests.

356
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,590
I have to go.

357
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,790
Talk to you next time.

358
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,390
Bye.

359
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,070
These clients

360
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,190
were so nice to you, the director,

361
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,510
when everything was fine.

362
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,830
They were the sweetest.

363
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,030
But now that something happened, they don't even pretend to care.

364
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,270
What could possibly happen if we delay it for a few days?

365
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,110
From now on,

366
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,150
we won't serve such inhumane clients anymore.

367
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,830
Block them.

368
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,190
Good for them.

369
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,510
I thought he was calling to comfort me.

370
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:34,990
I...

371
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,190
I'll give you the thumbs up.

372
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:40,790
Liang.

373
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,190
You were so cool and gangster-like just now.

374
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,430
Of course.

375
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,390
I brought these clients in one by one.

376
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,070
If needed, I can bring in a few more.

377
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,150
What's the big deal?

378
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,990
You're right.

379
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,790
But what about this project?

380
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,910
We've signed a contract with them.

381
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,070
Alright.

382
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,510
Maybe you should get me discharged.

383
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,230
You...

384
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,310
Lie down.

385
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,230
Take this opportunity

386
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,390
to reflect on yourself for a few days.

387
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,470
See if

388
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,990
you're being punished

389
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,990
for all the bad things you did before.

390
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,990
You're leaving?

391
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,110
Yes.

392
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,550
I'm going to edit the video.

393
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,150
Why should you do that?

394
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,510
I'll bring it here for you to check after I'm done.

395
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,150
I'll only give it to them when you approve it, okay?

396
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,470
I can come a few more times.

397
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,190
Thank you so much.

398
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,790
Cut the crap.

399
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,350
What?

400
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,150
Well,

401
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,750
I want to go to the toilet.

402
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,870
Xue Yiming.

403
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,030
Can you call someone in for me?

404
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,230
Alright, I'll get you a nurse.

405
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,630
Get me the prettiest one.

406
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,590
No problem.

407
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,670
I'll get you the youngest and prettiest one.

408
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,470
Wait here.

409
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,190
I trust you.

410
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,350
Nurse.

411
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,510
Coming.

412
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,110
You'll do. Come here.

413
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,270
You want to go to the toilet?

414
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,830
Get up. Let's go.

415
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,310
Liang Shanshan!

416
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,590
How is he?

417
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,990
Don't worry. He's all right.

418
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,910
Still breathing.

419
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,350
I'm leaving then.

420
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,430
I'll go to the studio.

421
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,670
Okay.

422
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,670
We've called the police.

423
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,190
I'll let you know if there's any update.

424
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:32,870
I'm leaving.

425
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,110
Keep your back straight.

426
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,190
Faster.

427
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,870
Even grandpas can walk faster than you.

428
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,710
Coach Feng.

429
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,950
Faster.

430
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,830
Coach Feng.

431
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,030
They are policemen from Longzhu Police Station.

432
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,310
Hello.

433
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,190
Hello.

434
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,350
Is Hao Junjie from your team?

435
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,190
Yes.

436
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,870
We need some information from him.

437
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:12,390
Hold on.

438
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,830
Hao Junjie!

439
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,550
Come here!

440
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,270
This motorcycle

441
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,510
belongs to you, right?

442
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:36,670
Yes.

443
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,630
What happened?

444
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,190
I hope you can hand in your assignments

445
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,030
of this week by Friday.

446
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,070
Any questions?

447
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,590
No.

448
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,510
Let's call it a day.

449
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,110
Mr. Fang.

450
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,350
Can we add you on WeChat?

451
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,190
We heard you're a member of the Homeless Animal Protection Association.

452
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,230
We want to join it too.

453
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,550
Yes.

454
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,670
Okay.

455
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,270
Wait a minute, Mr. Fang.

456
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,990
This is not your WeChat account.

457
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,190
This is a group chat.

458
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,990
Yes.

459
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,590
The group chat of Homeless Animal Protection Association.

460
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,230
There are many activities in this group chat.

461
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,830
You can take active part in them.

462
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,430
Any more questions?

463
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:32,790
Would you like

464
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,550
some more assignments?

465
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,110
No, thank you, Mr. Fang.

466
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,510
Goodbye.

467
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,670
Hello?

468
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,670
Hello.

469
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,390
This is Longzhu Police Station, Chuanjiang Municipal Public Security Bureau.

470
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,150
Is that Fang Mu?

471
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,150
Police station?

472
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,950
Can you hear me?

473
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,990
What?

474
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,910
How long will we be locked up?

475
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,230
We've only been here for a short while.

476
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,230
You can't stand it anymore?

477
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,510
Don't worry.

478
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,670
You were taken away from school.

479
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,910
Your uncle will come

480
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,030
and get you soon.

481
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:20,710
Fine.

482
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,350
After my uncle gets me out of here,

483
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,910
you can try to figure out a way to get out yourself.

484
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,670
I'll go with you.

485
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,150
No way.

486
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,430
He's my uncle.

487
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,670
He'll only help me.

488
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,030
He's also my teacher.

489
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,190
So petty.

490
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,870
Well, I can't let my sister know about this.

491
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,310
My sister...

492
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,110
Your uncle won't tell my sister, will he?

493
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,910
Take your time.

494
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,230
I'll make sure you are full today.

495
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:52,630
Look at you.

496
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,270
Look at you.

497
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,230
There's more.

498
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,830
Shanshan.

499
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,390
Can you come to my place

500
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,630
if you don't have to socialize tonight?

501
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,950
Hello.

502
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:08,790
Hello.

503
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,830
You are...

504
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,190
This is a stray cat.

505
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:11,950
I'm here to feed it.

506
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,230
I can tell.

507
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,790
Are here specially for the stray cats?

508
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,910
You live here, right?

509
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:19,990
Yes.

510
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,190
Are you Xue Yiming's wife?

511
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,390
Yes.

512
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,270
Great.

513
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,030
Help yourself.

514
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,150
Let me introduce myself.

515
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,310
My name is Fang Mu.

516
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,510
I'm here to apologize to you.

517
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,390
My nephew Hao Junjie

518
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,550
beat your husband today.

519
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,830
I went to the hospital

520
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,390
and tried to apologize to your husband in person,

521
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,990
but your husband

522
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,870
refused to see me, saying he was taking a rest.

523
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,510
So I could only come to you

524
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,950
and see

525
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,110
if you can do me a favor

526
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,470
and make come compromises.

527
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,990
Your nephew beat my husband, right?

528
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,910
He's still a college student. He's immature.

529
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,990
If this leaves a criminal record for him,

530
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,390
he won't be able to go abroad in the future.

531
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,790
We're willing to compensate you.

532
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,310
For real.

533
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,550
I have a job.

534
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,270
I teach at a music academy.

535
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,990
Hao Junjie is my student.

536
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,790
No wonder his name sounds so familiar.

537
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,110
Hao Junjie...

538
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,630
Does your nephew play ice hockey?

539
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,470
Yes.

540
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,670
How do you know?

541
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,390
Did he commit the crime himself,

542
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,470
or did he have an accomplice?

543
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,390
The police said

544
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,390
there were two of them. They committed the crime together.

545
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,990
I tried to ask him,

546
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,790
but he wouldn't tell me who the other one was.

547
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,030
I know who it was.

548
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,110
I'm sorry.

549
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,190
There's no need for you to apologize to me.

550
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,550
Maybe I should apologize to you instead.

551
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,430
Let's go and take care of it.

552
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,030
Okay.

553
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,630
Shall we take your car or mine?

554
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,030
Let's take mine.

555
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:46,870
Okay.

556
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,470
I could have taken sole responsibility myself.

557
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,350
Why did you come here?

558
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,030
Do you think I'm such an irresponsible person?

559
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,150
How could I let you take the blame alone?

560
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,670
We're in the same boat.

561
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,470
How could you say that?

562
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,070
It was all your fault.

563
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,150
What do you want?

564
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,270
Why did you beat him so hard?

565
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,030
I didn't expect him to be that weak.

566
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,470
Could he be injured badly?

567
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,070
So what? You wouldn't be the one to blame.

568
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,310
If I knew it would be like this,

569
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,390
I wouldn't have brought you here.

570
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,630
It was my sister who beat him.

571
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,190
The man who was beaten is my husband.

572
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,670
Officer.

573
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,910
This really had nothing to do

574
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,110
with my nephew, Hao Junjie.

575
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,030
So Hao Junjie

576
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,910
wasn't her accomplice?

577
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,990
No.

578
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,590
No, he...

579
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,830
He's an obedient boy.

580
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,510
He meant well.

581
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,390
To be honest, he's also the victim.

582
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,190
Yes.

583
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,830
He's the scapegoat for my sister.

584
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,310
You're a good friend.

585
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,310
You didn't turn me in no matter what.

586
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,190
Humanity stood the test.

587
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,350
Get lost.

588
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,670
I don't need your compliments.

589
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,470
How about this?

590
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,990
I'll call my husband.

591
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,630
He'll definitely forgive my sister.

592
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,230
She's still a kid. She's immature.

593
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,590
Can we close the case like this?

594
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,590
After all, they are still college students.

595
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,990
Yes.

596
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:11,790
All right.

597
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,830
Since both parties

598
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,790
agree to settle,

599
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,830
sign on this mediation agreement.

600
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,230
In principle,

601
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,230
you can't sign for them.

602
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,430
Both parties have to sign it themselves.

603
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,270
Okay.

604
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,750
But he's still in the hospital.

605
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,670
Officer.

606
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,150
I have another question.

607
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,630
This won't leave a criminal record for them, right?

608
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,950
Why are they still not out?

609
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,470
They're coming out.

610
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,630
Are you two okay?

611
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,630
Yes.

612
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,070
Say thank you to her.

613
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,710
If she hadn't gone to the hospital

614
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,790
and pleaded with him to sign for you,

615
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,430
you wouldn't have been able to come out tonight.

616
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,790
Say thank you.

617
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,710
Thank you, Ms. Jian Bing.

618
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,630
There's no need

619
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,429
to thank me.

620
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,870
What's wrong with you?

621
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,790
Don't you recognize me?

622
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,630
Sister.

623
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:16,989
Apologize.

624
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,750
I'm sorry.

625
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,670
I didn't ask you to apologize to me.

626
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,389
Apologize to him.

627
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:23,750
No need.

628
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,469
It's all in the past.

629
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:27,670
Besides, they are both kids.

630
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,510
How about we take them to the hospital

631
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,030
and apologize to your husband in person?

632
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,310
You can go if you want. I won't go.

633
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,670
This is wrong, Jian Shuang.

634
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,750
Although it was nice of you to turn yourself in,

635
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,150
it's still wrong to beat people up.

636
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,429
I didn't turn myself in because I was wrong.

637
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,230
I just didn't want him to take the blame for me.

638
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,830
You must be hungry.

639
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,110
Yes.

640
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,550
I wasn't asking you.

641
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,150
Are you hungry?

642
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,429
A little.

643
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,750
Mr. Fang.

644
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,990
I'm sorry about this.

645
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,510
The kids must be hungry.

646
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,990
I'll treat you to dinner.

647
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,150
Let's talk over dinner.

648
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,510
Is it appropriate?

649
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,630
Why not?

650
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,710
I didn't turn her in when I was detained.

651
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,350
Get in the car.

652
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,950
Get in.

653
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,190
Sorry for the trouble.

654
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,150
Eat, heroine.

655
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:42,670
Come on.

656
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,590
Let's eat.

657
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,510
You haven't eaten anything for a whole day, right?

658
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,990
Mr. Fang.

659
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,350
I...

660
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,150
I want to apologize

661
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,430
to you and Junjie.

662
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,630
It was my sister's fault.

663
00:35:59,150 --> 00:35:59,910
Hao Junjie.

664
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,150
Stay away from Jian Shuang.

665
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,990
She's not easy to deal with.

666
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,630
Did you hear it?

667
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,670
She was talking to you.

668
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,470
I'm sorry that he's rude.

669
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,150
I didn't educate him well.

670
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,430
Jian Shuang.

671
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,150
I want to ask.

672
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,950
Why did you hit your brother-in-law?

673
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,110
He's not my brother-in-law anymore.

674
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,070
This is our family affair.

675
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,310
Mr. Fang, please eat.

676
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:35,710
Jian Shuang,

677
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,150
you'll pay for this meal.

678
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,190
Here.

679
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,550
Ms. Jian.

680
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,550
Are you usually very busy at work?

681
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,390
What do you do?

682
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,430
I shoot commercials.

683
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,310
The major problem is that my work time is not fixed.

684
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,510
Actually, my education for Jian Shuang is also like that.

685
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,750
She can do whatever she wants,

686
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,510
as long as she doesn't do anything illegal.

687
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,750
I didn't do anything illegal.

688
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,990
You didn't?

689
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,630
It would be a criminal case if you caused any minor injury above level 2.

690
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,950
Even settlement wouldn't work then.

691
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,110
Didn't I tell you that since you're already a college student,

692
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,270
you shouldn't count on me

693
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,790
to clean up your mess anymore.

694
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,950
Can't we just take care of ourselves?

695
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:14,670
Well, I didn't ask you

696
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,030
to get me out of the police station.

697
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,230
Go back to the police station then.

698
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,550
Guys.

699
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,350
Let's eat.

700
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,510
Let's eat.

701
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,070
I know it's wrong to beat people up,

702
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,150
but it wasn't some random person.

703
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,390
Shouldn't Xue Yiming be punished for what he did?

704
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,310
No one punished him.

705
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,350
I had to do it.

706
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,390
So why were you arrested if he was the one being punished?

707
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,750
Jian Shuang, have you forgotten

708
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,190
how hard you worked to get into the music academy?

709
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,990
You wanted to play ice hockey,

710
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,350
and I allowed it.

711
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,390
Did you learn how to solve problems by fighting

712
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,750
when you were playing ice hockey?

713
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,430
Well.

714
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,230
Jian Shuang.

715
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,630
Your sister was right.

716
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,950
Fighting can't solve the problem.

717
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,470
Listen.

718
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,630
Playing ice hockey

719
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,990
already hinders your studies.

720
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,350
If you can't graduate

721
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,470
or find a job in the future,

722
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,750
don't come to me.

723
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,390
I won't be a burden to you.

724
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,390
Good.

725
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,190
Ms. Jian Bing.

726
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,750
Actually, this incident had nothing to do with ice hockey.

727
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,510
Jian Shuang did it

728
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,790
for you.

729
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,950
Shut up.

730
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,630
Take a rest if you're tired.

731
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,350
Come on.

732
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,670
Have some.

733
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:40,990
Here.

734
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,470
You shouldn't have done that.

735
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,150
What should I do

736
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,030
if something really happened to you?

737
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,150
Don't you feel sorry for your parents?

738
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,310
Your parents

739
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,470
gave up such good jobs in China

740
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,670
and went abroad to start over back then.

741
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,910
Who did they do that for?

742
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,670
They did it for you.

743
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,630
They wanted to pave the way for you there.

744
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,310
You play ice hockey and hang out with those people all day.

745
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,790
It's no good.

746
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,310
It won't bear any fruit.

747
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,630
Can't I enjoy the process even if there won't be any fruit?

748
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,830
Why would you want to enjoy the process if there won't be any fruit?

749
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,110
Can't you spend your time

750
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,990
on something that can bear fruit?

751
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,350
What's something that can bear fruit from the beginning?

752
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,590
Don't play on words with me.

753
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,190
I just want to point one thing out.

754
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,710
Isn't it your dream

755
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,630
to be a musician?

756
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,670
Isn't your years of hard work

757
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,470
for realizing your dream?

758
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,590
This is not only about you,

759
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,550
but also our entire family.

760
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,270
The entire family

761
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,390
has done so much for you.

762
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,310
One more thing I need to remind you.

763
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,750
Jian Shuang and her sister.

764
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,030
Stay away from them.

765
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,910
They don't seem to be ordinary people.

766
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,030
It's not that they're abnormal.

767
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,670
It's just that the way they get along

768
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,310
is different from ours.

769
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,790
She didn't mean to screw me.

770
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,630
I know.

771
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,710
She doesn't seem like

772
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,710
a bad person.

773
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,830
But you should

774
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,150
think for yourself when dealing with things, right?

775
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,550
In life,

776
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,630
to achieve something,

777
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,390
you have to make sacrifices.

778
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,030
You promised me

779
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,230
you would quit the competition and the club.

780
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,510
Don't forget about that.

781
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,630
Mom.

782
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,030
I'm taking a shower.

783
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,630
You aren't naked. What are you afraid of?

784
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,390
I've seen you naked when you were a kid.

785
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,350
I'm already 26.

786
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,310
Get out.

787
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,390
I received a package.

788
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,350
A gift?

789
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,150
Is it for me?

790
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,550
Of course not.

791
00:40:59,110 --> 00:40:59,750
Come and take a look.

792
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,070
Is it pretty?

793
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,150
Just tell me

794
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:07,870
how much it is.

795
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,750
Is it over 500 yuan?

796
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,030
300?

797
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,590
3000.

798
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,870
3000?

799
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:16,510
Keep it down.

800
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,030
Don't let your dad hear you.

801
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:18,670
Mom.

802
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,390
You found my dad's little vault?

803
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,390
I know clearly where

804
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,670
he keeps his private savings.

805
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,070
Besides,

806
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,670
I won't remove the tag.

807
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,070
After the reunion,

808
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,070
I'll return it.

809
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,390
You're going to a reunion?

810
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,070
No wonder you want to dress so nicely.

811
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,470
Just tell me.

812
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,350
Does it look fancy,

813
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,910
classy,

814
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:40,550
and expensive?

815
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,470
Let me take a good look.

816
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:42,710
Give it to me.

817
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:45,790
Pretend to try it on.

818
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,230
It's quite expensive.

819
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,270
But

820
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,030
you don't look very good in it.

821
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,430
At my age,

822
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,030
I don't look good no matter what I wear.

823
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,710
A girl in her 20s

824
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,030
looks good even in a sack.

825
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:06,590
Mom.

826
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,910
I didn't mean that.

827
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,390
I was talking about the dress, not you.

828
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,190
I was also talking about the dress.

829
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,670
I got it.

830
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,910
I have to buy

831
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,350
expensive clothes at my age.

832
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,350
I have to buy branded clothes with good quality.

833
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,830
This way, people will see that

834
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,590
I live a good life

835
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,670
with high quality.

836
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:28,310
Mom.

837
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,950
Can I take my shower now?

838
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,430
Go ahead.

839
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:44,230
Spending 3000 yuan on a dress.

840
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,990
If Dad knows about it, he'll eat you alive.
