What do you think about him?

175
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,420
It's not just me.

His strengths

182
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,300
are written all over his face.

183
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,980
It's so obvious. Can't you tell?

He's the type

185
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,940
that doesn't know he's attractive.

186
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,100
He doesn't take advantage of his face

00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,220
I have to snatch him up.

193
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,570
Lin, what nonsense

194
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,250
is your mind filled with?

195
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,900
Can't you put this energy into your work?

196
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:07,980
Get back to work.

197
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,430
I...

198
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,260
Hurry up.

199
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,140
I was just kidding.

200
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,380
I love work and work loves me.

201
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,620
Get ready for the next shot.

202
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:25,860
Uncle,

203
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,020
shouldn't we

204
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,060
go to the hotel first?

205
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,900
We're going to the set first.

206
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,940
We're going to the set first.

207
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,020
Where is your sister?

208
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,780
Over there.

209
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,060
Well...

210
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,660
Hurry up.

211
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,620
How do I look?

212
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
Fine.

213
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,620
My hair?

214
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,700
Not bad. The hair gel is still there.

215
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,060
Good.

216
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,730
Mr. Fang,

217
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,060
channel your confidence when you yell at us during class.

218
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,740
Yes.

219
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,020
What are you scared of?

220
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,740
My sister isn't a demon.

221
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,220
No,

222
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,380
I'm just worried about delaying her work.

223
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,380
Right?

224
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,540
She won't get angry, right?

225
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,220
She won't.

226
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,620
She's not that bad-tempered.

227
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,740
Forget it.

228
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:10,900
Mr. Fang.

229
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,700
Did I scare you?

230
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,020
Bing.

231
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,660
Miss Jian Bing.

232
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,140
Why are you all here?

233
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,290
We're here to visit you.

234
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,180
Yes.

235
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,650
Jian Shuang wanted to give you a surprise.

236
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,500
I indeed got scared.

237
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,460
Well, I...

238
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,700
I need to work for a while longer.

239
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,220
Are you all going to play first

240
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,580
or stay on set?

241
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,500
We...

242
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,900
We'll wait for you.

243
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,460
Sure.

244
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,980
Bing, hurry up.

245
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,820
Mr. Fang traveled so far

246
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,980
and waited for a long time already.

247
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,780
He even reserved a restaurant for you.

248
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,980
We'll feast together after you're done filming.

249
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,380
Mr. Fang, have a seat.

250
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,060
I'm not interrupting your work, right?

251
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,500
Hurry up.

252
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,180
Are you sitting or not?

253
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,940
I'm going to sit over there.

254
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,580
Is this someone's seat?

255
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,660
I'll sit over there.

256
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,860
It's okay. You can sit there.

257
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,220
There's a stool here.

258
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,060
Yuan, are you ready?

259
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,380
All ready, Director.

260
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,700
Let's try it once

261
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,620
with the machines, snow, and actors.

262
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,020
Come on, let's try it.

263
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,700
Copy that.

264
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,630
Come, let's try it.

265
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,960
Actors, go over.

266
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,220
Let's try the snow.

267
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,700
Okay, Director, take a look.

268
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,620
Why is the snow floating behind the people?

269
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,860
Adjust the snow.

270
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,380
Change the direction.

271
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,820
This is quite a big scene.

272
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,860
Director, take a look.

273
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:31,980
Make it snow.

274
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,860
Okay, this is good.

275
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,020
Come on, let's do it.

276
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,860
Get ready for the real shooting.

277
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,460
Uncle.

278
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,380
-Don't stop.
-Uncle.

279
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,900
-Don't stop the snow. Keep going.
-Go.

280
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,020
Good. Cameras.

281
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,380
Rolling.

282
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,220
Action.

283
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,250
He's getting nervous.

284
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,500
Okay, cut.

285
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,980
There's no problem with actors.

286
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,100
Let's adjust it a little.

287
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,620
Yuan,

288
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,660
when you swing to each couple,

289
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,490
pause for a little longer, okay?

290
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,170
Okay, no problem.

291
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,780
That's enough.

292
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,780
Don't be such a perfectionist.

293
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,900
Why do you even have to control where the snow floats to?

294
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,100
What are you doing?

295
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,860
Please leave.

296
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,660
I'm hungry.

297
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,820
Have you never been to a film set before?

298
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,500
Stop shouting.

299
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,660
The restaurant has been reserved already.

300
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,820
What if she really does kick you out?

301
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,380
Okay, come on.

302
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:44,940
Real shot.

303
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,660
Make it snow.

304
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,300
Cameras.

305
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,060
Action.

306
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,130
Okay, cut.

307
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:10,780
Look.

308
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,260
Stop the snow.

309
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,940
This was good.

310
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,020
It passed, it passed.

311
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,940
Yuan, let's move on.

312
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,780
Do you have any problems?

313
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,890
No, everything is good.

314
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,660
Okay, have the actors take a break.

315
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,820
Who is it?

316
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,050
Hello.

317
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,900
Your sister

318
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,060
told me to come visit my aunt.

319
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,700
Are you calling me "aunt" now?

320
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,740
Didn't you tell me to call you that if I wanted to?

321
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,500
Okay.

322
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,460
Come in, dear nephew.

323
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,660
It's almost nighttime.

324
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,740
The temperature has really dropped.

325
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,300
I'm so cold that my nose is running.

326
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,980
You're a big boy who exercises all day,

327
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,700
but you're still afraid of the cold.

328
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,100
You practiced for nothing.

329
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,500
Look at Jian Shuang.

330
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,300
What is my sister doing?

331
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,100
Women are so slow.

332
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,260
It's been forever and she still hasn't come down.

333
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,540
Mr. Fang,

334
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,980
I think we should tell her to hurry.

335
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,610
No.

336
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,650
Let's wait some more.

337
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,130
It's worth it to wait

338
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,020
for someone like your sister.

339
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,340
How long has it been?

340
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,820
Young people are so impatient.

341
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,020
The slower she is,

342
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,900
the more she takes it seriously.

343
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,500
You should learn from me.

344
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,180
Mr. Fang,

345
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,340
I still have to

346
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,420
give you a solemn reminder.

347
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,100
This is a rare opportunity.

348
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,460
You have to take it seriously.

349
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,260
You have to seize every second.

350
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,220
Don't worry.

351
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,700
I...

352
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,420
I know what to do.

353
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,220
A watched pot never boils.

354
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,140
Your sister asked me to come visit my aunt.

355
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,490
She said you're working in the mountains.

356
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,620
You might get cold,

357
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,300
so she wanted to see if you brought enough clothes or not.

358
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,210
I asked your assistant Lin.

359
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,020
I begged her for a long time before she told me.

360
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,300
Okay.

361
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,220
Lin will be fired tomorrow.

362
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,740
Really? Then…

363
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,900
That's great.

364
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,619
From

365
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,380
tomorrow on,

366
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:07,900
I'll be your assistant then.

367
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,210
Let me peel an orange for you,

368
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:11,819
Director Jian.

369
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,579
Are you this bored?

370
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,740
Don't you have a job?

371
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,180
I came after I finished my work. Don’t worry.

372
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,339
Mr. Fang,

373
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,770
I can’t wait any longer.

374
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,900
Please be brave

375
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,260
and go, go!

376
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,020
Go!

377
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,220
I'll do it if you won't.

378
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,780
No, no, no.

379
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:28,900
Hold onto her.

380
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,540
I'll go.

381
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,140
Okay, hold her.

382
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,020
You go ahead.

383
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,500
Your leg hasn't recovered yet.

384
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,820
Hurry up.

385
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,660
What's wrong?

386
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,290
I'm fine.

387
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,060
Help me sit down.

388
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,940
Are you okay?

389
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,100
I drove for too long.

390
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,460
I guess it was

391
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:52,540
too much for my waist.

392
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,620
Are you serious?

393
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,490
I'm fine.

394
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,980
I'll just sit for a while.

395
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,060
Where? Here?

396
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,700
It's okay.

397
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,260
I just need a rest.

398
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,770
Does it hurt here too?

399
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,050
Take care of Jian Shuang.

400
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,420
I'm okay.

401
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,020
Bing, hurry up.

402
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,900
Mr. Fang's waist is broken from waiting.

403
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,700
Stop shouting.

404
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,460
What if your sister comes down and sees Mr. Fang like this?

405
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,740
You said my sister had you come up the mountain

406
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,980
to check if I'm cold or not.

407
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,010
Why didn't my sister

408
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,460
find a feather down jacket for you to wear?

409
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:24,780
I...

410
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,380
My mom

411
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,420
only worries about you.

412
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,500
She doesn't care about me,

413
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,100
right?

414
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,700
Why did you reply to Song Chen

415
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,010
and not reply to me?

416
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,500
Song Chen sent me work messages.

417
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,500
What did you send?

418
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,300
I...

419
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:45,860
Bing,

420
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,010
what are you doing? Hurry up.

421
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,850
Bing,

422
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,940
stop dawdling. They're waiting for you.

423
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,380
I need to go eat.

424
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,290
What do you mean?

425
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,260
Well, you...

426
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,220
Your second aunt

427
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,460
came to visit with my rumored boyfriend.

428
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,340
Your rumored boyfriend?

429
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,060
That university teacher?

430
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,820
Did you ask him to come?

431
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,660
I didn't.

432
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,940
Just like you,

433
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,340
he came out of nowhere.

434
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,580
Are you really going to eat with him?

435
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,260
Bing,

436
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,660
stop dawdling. They're waiting for you.

437
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,900
He's already here.

438
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,500
Why don't we go together?

439
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,100
Bing, I heard your voice.

440
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,300
Who are you talking to?

441
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:26,700
I...

442
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,060
I...

443
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,580
I'm not going. You're not allowed to go either.

444
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,530
I have to tell him

445
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,460
whether I go or not.

446
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,620
I'll help you tell him.

447
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,260
You can't go tell him.

448
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,820
Why can't I?

449
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,620
I can say it.

450
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,860
-I can say...
-I won't let you.

451
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,340
I...

452
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,620
Stop messing around.

453
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,700
Open the door.

454
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,660
Bing, you...

455
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,580
Bing.

456
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,380
You...

457
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,500
Did you ask him to come?

458
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,020
No.

459
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,180
I came here myself.

460
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,220
I came out of nowhere,

461
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,180
just like Mr. Fang.

462
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,910
Shuang.

463
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,540
Hello, Lin.

464
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,260
Mr. Fang,

465
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,900
Bing is about to come down.

466
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,260
Uncle.

467
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:15,900
Well...

468
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,260
Are you

469
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:20,940
all ready?

470
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,420
Well,

471
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,100
Lin Lin,

472
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,640
let me make the introductions.

473
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,660
This is

474
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,420
the youngest and promising vice professor

475
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,820
of our university's music school,

476
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,620
Fang Mu.

477
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,380
Mr. Fang.

478
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,290
Nice to meet you.

479
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:33,700
Hello, Mr. Fang.

480
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,060
My sister

481
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,100
asked him specifically to come visit her.

482
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,660
I didn't.

483
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,060
No.

484
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,780
I...

485
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,180
How come

486
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,170
everyone is suddenly all here?

487
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,140
You haven't had dinner, have you?

488
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,980
We prepared a barbecue with wine.

489
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,660
Let's go together.

490
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,300
No, we've reserved a restaurant.

491
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:49,780
Yes.

492
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,060
Yes.

493
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,740
Mr. Fang specifically reserved a restaurant

494
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,980
to treat my sister and us to a feast.

495
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,620
Since

496
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,500
the crew has already prepared dinner,

497
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,540
how about we stay and eat together?

498
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,260
The more the merrier.

499
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,580
But we've already reserved a restaurant

500
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,740
and it's not far from here,

501
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,420
right, Mr. Fang?

502
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,260
Yes.

503
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,700
The GPS says 30 minutes.

504
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:09,980
Well...

505
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,780
It's suddenly so foggy

506
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,100
and we're in the mountains.

507
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,620
It’s not safe to drive, right, Mr. Fang?

508
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,980
Bing,

509
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,220
don’t you know what kind of driver Mr. Fang is?

510
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,620
He’s fast and steady.

511
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,460
Yes, he's a driver with more than ten years of experience.

512
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,500
Don't worry.

513
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,140
Wait,

514
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,780
have we met before

515
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,140
in your company?

516
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,980
Your name is Sheng...

517
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,980
Sheng Yang.

518
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,780
The one who always cuts in line.

519
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,220
Why are you here too?

520
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:36,860
I...

521
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,050
We've been working together recently.

522
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,020
I think you have a point.

523
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,100
With all this fog,

524
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,620
it's indeed not safe to drive.

525
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,940
Why don't we stay?

526
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,540
Great!

527
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,860
Then we don't need to move.

528
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,940
With everyone eating together,

529
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,700
it'll be merrier.

530
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,530
Is that okay?

531
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,100
Welcome, Mr. Fang.

532
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,900
Well,

533
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,140
I'll get changed.

534
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,220
Then,

535
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,660
let's wait for her to change her clothes.

536
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,140
Sure.

537
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,340
Let's wait together.

538
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:32,810
Director.

539
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,860
But we can take the back door.

540
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,420
Hello. Hello.

541
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:34,900
Sit here.

542
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,260
This way.

543
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,220
What took you so long?

544
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,780
Is this my seat?

545
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,940
Thank you.

546
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,180
Sheng Yang, when did you get here?

547
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,740
Did you come to visit?

548
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,260
Yes.

549
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,220
I came to see you all.

550
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:45,940
Sheng Yang,

551
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,900
can you handle spicy food?

552
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,780
Yes, I can.

553
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,340
It's fine.

554
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,140
What do you want to drink?

555
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,500
What do you want to eat?

556
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:49,820
I'll

557
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,420
drink this.

558
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:50,900
What do you want to drink?

559
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,730
Have some lamb chop.

560
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,540
Well,

561
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,420
Mr. Fang.

562
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,340
She

563
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,090
is on a diet recently.

564
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,740
She won't eat oily food.

565
00:22:59,090 --> 00:22:59,580
What would you like to drink?

566
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,900
I'll grab one myself. Thanks.

567
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,340
Here.

568
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,740
Try this.

569
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:04,780
Thank you.

570
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,140
I'll drink this.

571
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,580
Here.

572
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,620
Use this.

573
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,180
It's hygienic.

574
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,090
How considerate.

575
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,410
Director,

576
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,980
this is our first time meeting Mr. Fang.

577
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,820
Please introduce him to us.

578
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,900
Let Jian Shuang introduce him.

579
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,740
Miss Jian Shuang.

580
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,540
Okay.

581
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,180
Let me introduce Mr. Fang. She's a bit shy.

582
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,980
Mr. Fang

583
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,620
is an Associate Professor

584
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,300
in our Music Education Department.

585
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,420
He is the youngest and highly promising.

586
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,300
He's very popular among students.

587
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,860
You'll meet each other often from now on.

588
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,420
Don't worry.

589
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,460
He's obviously very artistic.

590
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,700
Should we

591
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,980
congratulate our Director?

592
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,740
You have someone to care for you.

593
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,420
A talented young man.

594
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,740
He is very reliable.

595
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,420
See.

596
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,100
The crowd knows best.

597
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,780
We can all tell that Mr. Fang is reliable.

598
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,420
Mr. Fang is indeed reliable.

599
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,300
He is really talented.

600
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,420
And he is single.

601
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,010
Mr. Fang.

602
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,780
In our team,

603
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,780
Youyou,

604
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,700
Shanshan and Lin

605
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,660
are all single.

606
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,860
Right? Lin just broke up.

607
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,540
Right?

608
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:08,780
Yes, they...

609
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,540
They're all single.

610
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,180
Let me say something.
Single.

611
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,090
Let’s propose a toast to the
excellent Mr. Fang.

612
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,780
OK.

613
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,500
Come on.

614
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,940
Welcome Mr. Fang.

615
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,620
Come often.

616
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,340
Thank you.

617
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,940
Mr. Fang is really popular.

618
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,980
Thank you.

619
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,180
The second toast

620
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,900
is to all of you.

621
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,940
Thank you all

622
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,090
for taking care of Jian Bing.

623
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,180
Cheers.

624
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,340
It's the least we could do.

625
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,540
Come on, Mr. Fang.

626
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,380
Nice.

627
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,580
You are such a man.

628
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,490
Sister,

629
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,620
you two have to drink a toast.

630
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,940
He helped our family a lot

631
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,540
and sorted out so many problems for us.

632
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,180
You have to propose a toast

633
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:56,900
for you two.

634
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,500
Well,

635
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,250
don't drink too much.

636
00:24:59,250 --> 00:24:59,740
Thank you.

637
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,620
Just a sip.

638
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,260
Thank you.

639
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,940
Just have fun.

640
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,580
Thank you.

641
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,580
All right.

642
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,500
There'll be a day of filming tomorrow.

643
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,340
Thank you for your hard work.

644
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,140
It's cold on the mountain.

645
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:08,940
Cheers.

646
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,900
No worry.

647
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,570
Thank you, Director.

648
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,100
Cheers to our victory.

649
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,060
Let's not just drink.

650
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,780
Let's play a game.

651
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:15,340
What game?

652
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:15,700
Sure.

653
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,460
What game?

654
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:16,740
Sure.

655
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,300
Yeah, what are we playing?

656
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,940
Let me think.

657
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,900
Let's play the reverse of

658
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,460
Never Have I Ever.

659
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:20,890
Let's give it a go.

660
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,220
I'll try first.

661
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:21,860
Try it out.

662
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,460
Try it out.

663
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,410
Sheng Yang, you go first.

664
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:23,900
I'll go first.

665
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,740
You have to drink this round.

666
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,060
It's a big one.

667
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,060
I have a crush on

668
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,340
someone sitting here.

669
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,020
Who?

670
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,420
Mr. Fang.

671
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,010
Drink if you don’t have a crush on
anyone here.

672
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,420
I don't.

673
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,020
Let's drink.

674
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,420
Why are you drinking?

675
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,140
My crush is also sitting here.
Why are you drinking?

676
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,460
Aren't you going to drink?

677
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:48,780
But.

678
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,060
Well.

679
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:51,940
My turn, right?

680
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,900
I'm

681
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,940
36 years old.

682
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,460
Director.

683
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,340
That's cheating.

684
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,660
I don't need to drink.

685
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,540
You're cheating.

686
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,460
How is that cheating?

687
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,060
I've lived to 36 on my own.

688
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,730
Drink up.

689
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,700
I'm two months behind.

690
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,460
Does it count?

691
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,620
Of course not.

692
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,780
It doesn't count if you haven't had
your birthday.

693
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,820
I'm still young. Come on.

694
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,380
Cheater.

695
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:09,900
Come on. Let's eat.

696
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,580
The person you want to marry is here.

697
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,420
Hurry.

698
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:12,860
OK?

699
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,740
Mr. Fang.

700
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,020
It's your turn.

701
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,500
Well...

702
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,220
I want to say...

703
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,730
the person I want to spend my life with

704
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,060
is also here.

705
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,460
Come on. Let’s congratulate him.

706
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,780
To Mr. Fang.

707
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,380
Thank you.

708
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,140
Thank you.

709
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,380
Bottoms up.

710
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:39,860
Mr. Fang, bottoms up!

711
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,860
OK. I'll drink up.

712
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,580
Help yourself.

713
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,140
Cheers.

714
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,420
It's good.

715
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,740
Mr. Fang is a good drinker.

716
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,460
Good.

717
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,980
Mr. Fang, don’t drink too much.

718
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,300
Let's drink.

719
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,260
Who can get some food?

720
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:57,940
OK.

721
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,380
I'll get it.

722
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,180
What do you want to eat?

723
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,580
Here, Sheng Yang.

724
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,020
Vegetables.

725
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,460
Come with me. Let's get something.

726
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:02,860
Let's go.

727
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,060
Hurry up.

728
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,780
Well...

729
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,650
Jian Bing.

730
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,940
I have something

731
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,460
to tell you in private.

732
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,090
Okay.

733
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,260
Go. Go.

734
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,660
Good luck.

735
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,780
Who do you like?

736
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:33,820
Eat it.

737
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,780
Eat the croissant.

738
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,900
I didn't expect it's getting cold

739
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,060
in the mountain at night.

740
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,140
Are you cold?

741
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,020
No, I wore a lot.

742
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,180
During the day,

743
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,020
the view here must be very nice.

744
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,340
Yes, it's really nice.

745
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,020
Do you have time to see it during the day?

746
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:11,820
Yes.

747
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,220
I won't leave tomorrow.

748
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,940
Will I disturb you at work if I stay?

749
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,180
No.

750
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,740
We often have visitors.

751
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,900
Well...

752
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:34,820
Did...

753
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,900
You go first.

754
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,380
Did Jian Shuang trick you into coming here?

755
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:39,860
No.

756
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,820
I asked to come this time.

757
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,140
I didn't expect

758
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,940
to see the other side of you just now.

759
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,620
You have leadership.

760
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,100
Your team members all

761
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,500
admire you

762
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,500
for being tough.

763
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,090
No.

764
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:58,900
Look at you.

765
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,700
You get along well with

766
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,540
your team.

767
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,420
It's really good.

768
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,900
It's so cool.

769
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:07,970
Come on.

770
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,810
Cheers.

771
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,860
Here comes the meat.

772
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,420
Here comes the meat.

773
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,220
It's cooked.

774
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,180
Does it smell good?

775
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,660
Yes.

776
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,660
Lamb chop.

777
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,090
Just put it here.

778
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,100
Give it to me.

779
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:22,980
Youyou,

780
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:23,940
where is Director Jian?

781
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,020
She left with Mr. Fang just now.

782
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,260
She left with Mr. Fang?

783
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,300
So

784
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,380
Mr. Fang got something.

785
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,900
He's getting bolder.

786
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,780
He even has the nerve to ask her out alone.

787
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,380
What would they talk about?

788
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,740
Maybe

789
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,620
he's expressing his love.

790
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,140
Shall we check it out?

791
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,540
Sure.

792
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,460
Quietly.

793
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,660
Cheers.

794
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,340
Cheers.

795
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,660
Director, what's going on?

796
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,250
Cheers.

797
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,060
Let's continue the game.

798
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,210
I...

799
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,140
Mr. Fang, you wanted to talk.

800
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,300
Well,

801
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,380
I want to say

802
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,540
we

803
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,500
both actually

804
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,940
had gotten lost

805
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,260
in life.

806
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,780
At this moment in life,

807
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,700
you need someone to step up.

808
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,260
I want to be that person

809
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,500
to guide you in life

810
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,700
and bring you back

811
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,580
to your normal life.

812
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,100
Get you back on track.

813
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,460
And I want to help you

814
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,060
plan your future.

815
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,820
Mr. Fang, I think

816
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,500
I've never gotten

817
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,420
lost.

818
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,060
Because I think

819
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,580
all the roads I've taken

820
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,900
are inevitable paths,

821
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,420
and are the ones I've chosen.

822
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,060
Now,

823
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,610
I think

824
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,780
I'm getting back on track.

825
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:09,810
Yes.

826
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,460
As for my job,

827
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,140
and especially my personality,

828
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,940
I don't like to have any plans.

829
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,700
Especially at the moment.

830
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,020
I see.

831
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,620
Now you want to

832
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,980
focus on your work.

833
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,060
Don't worry.

834
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,220
I won't disturb you at work.

835
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,380
I just hope

836
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,700
I can be a part of your life.

837
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,220
Well...

838
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,460
That...

839
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:35,940
I'm sorry.

840
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,700
What’s wrong, Mr. Fang?

841
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,460
Maybe I drank too fast.

842
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,700
Well...

843
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:46,570
Yes.

844
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,740
You drank too fast.

845
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,340
If you stand in the wind after drinking,

846
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,100
you'll get drunk easily.

847
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,580
Don't stand here. Let's go back.

848
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,780
Alright.

849
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:56,500
Right?

850
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,820
Let's not stand in the wind.

851
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,940
No, it's okay.

852
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:00,900
Well...

853
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,220
I'm fine. I'm fine.

854
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,700
Okay.

855
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,730
You don't drink often, do you?

856
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,660
No, I don't.

857
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,740
At university,

858
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,380
usually there aren't many occasions.

859
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,460
Right.

860
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,090
I think all your colleagues are very nice.

861
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:18,860
Right.

862
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,420
We'll hang out together after work.

863
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,620
That's great.

864
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,660
Are you okay?

865
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,420
I'm okay.

866
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,700
Where did they go?

867
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,210
I don't know.

868
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,140
Fairy Mountain is quite big.

869
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,700
Why don't we take a rest here?

870
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,340
They are good at finding spots.

871
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,300
The night view here is nice too.

872
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,380
Look at the moon.

873
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,340
So round.

874
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,730
It's quite big.

875
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,580
We're closer to the stars.

876
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,820
Are you not able to find north?

877
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,740
So you use the north star to find directions.

878
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,060
Who said I can't find north?

879
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,820
I just don't want to find the direction.

880
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,340
Why are you in a hurry

881
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,690
to see them being close?

882
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,220
I care about my sister.

883
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,660
Your sister?

884
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,940
Is there anyone else you care about

885
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,220
besides your sister?

886
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,500
Yes.

887
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,620
You.

888
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,220
Aren't you right in front of me?

889
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,740
Yes.

890
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,540
Let's drink.

891
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,300
Come on.

892
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,420
Let me eat first.

893
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,220
Enjoy yourselves.

894
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,220
Okay.

895
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,420
Let's continue.

896
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,940
Who stopped? Go on.

897
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,100
Today we visit the Three Garden.

898
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,740
What type of garden?

899
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,699
Fruit garden.

900
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,699
Banana.

901
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:10,900
Apple.

902
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,820
Where are Jian Shuang and the other?

903
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,739
I don't know

904
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,820
where they went.

905
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:16,980
Where did they go?

906
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:18,060
I don't know.

907
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,340
Did you eat?

908
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,540
Yes, I ate a lot.

909
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,690
Mr. Fang, what else do you want to eat?

910
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,820
No, thanks.

911
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:25,940
I'm

912
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,060
a little tipsy.

913
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,580
Have some water.

914
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,219
Thank you.

915
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,460
Watermelon.

916
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,380
Gardener.

917
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,500
Air

918
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:37,739
Tree...

919
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:38,500
Tree.

920
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,100
Tree.

921
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,580
Drink.

922
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:40,219
Napkin.

923
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,380
You stopped. Come on.

924
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:41,900
Thank you.

925
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,980
I'm not the loser anymore.

926
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:43,940
It's all your fault.

927
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,699
Next. Next.

928
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:47,060
Next one.

929
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,340
Here.

930
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,130
I'll say something different.

931
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,420
We visit the Three Garden on Wednesday.

932
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,100
I'm not that hungry.

933
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,500
What are the twelve constellations?

934
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,420
Taurus.

935
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,980
We...

936
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,620
I'll be going now.

937
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,570
You...

938
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,220
Don't drink too much.

939
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:03,780
Go back early.

940
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,620
We have another day tomorrow.

941
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,300
Let's continue.

942
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,100
Let me walk you back.

943
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,700
I'll go with you.

944
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,740
Bye, Director.
Bye.

945
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,300
Bye, Director.

946
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,180
Come on, let's continue.

947
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,300
Come on.

948
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,740
I'll continue then.

949
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:16,940
Your turn next.

950
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,980
We visit the Three Garden on Sunday.

951
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,260
What are the colors of lipsticks?

952
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,220
My sister

953
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,620
has a sincere heart.

954
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:26,900
I really don't want her

955
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,300
to be disappointed by relationships.

956
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,260
So even if she hates it,

957
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,580
I hope someone can protect her.

958
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,690
At least

959
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,540
she deserves somebody who's kind.

960
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,900
Don't worry.

961
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,220
My uncle is a kind person.

962
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,820
Don't worry about your sister.

963
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,260
Have you ever thought about

964
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:48,980
yourself?

965
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,140
What's there to consider?

966
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,100
I'm about to graduate university.

967
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,810
Have you ever met someone

968
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,100
who makes your heart flutter?

969
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,180
I'm not so sure about relationships.

970
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,090
It's all about luck.

971
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,060
Love

972
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,060
is a luxury.

973
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,060
You know?

974
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,580
Who can guarantee that a relationship

975
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,780
or marriage won't break apart?

976
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,060
Besides, a person can live happily

977
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,940
without love.

978
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,500
Once you taste the sweetness of love,

979
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,420
you must suffer the pain of love.

980
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,820
Adam and Eve

981
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,380
fell into the suffering of

982
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,060
the mortal world

983
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,580
because of love.

984
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,860
So,

985
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,100
there's no need.

986
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,100
Why not stay single and be safe?

987
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,220
Are you going to be like this forever?

988
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,340
Then...

989
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,860
What else can I do?

990
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,460
You seem to have strong opinions
on the ice hockey court.

991
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,780
You even asked me to have some opinions.

992
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,060
Why are you so timid

993
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,170
when it comes to sort of thing?

994
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:13,900
I...

995
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:15,660
I...

996
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,100
I didn't expect

997
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,100
I would have a crush on someone like you.

998
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,340
What did you say?

999
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,460
I said

1000
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,620
I like you.

1001
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:38,980
Mr. Fang,

1002
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,060
Did you book a room?

1003
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,700
Yes.

1004
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,980
A1002.

1005
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,340
It's a suite.

1006
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,610
After dinner,

1007
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,260
it's quite comfortable

1008
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,100
to go for a walk.

1009
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,260
It can help digest and exercise.

1010
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,140
You are good at selecting places.

1011
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,290
This place is really nice.

1012
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,020
This place was designated by a client.

1013
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,380
Well,

1014
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,740
are you still filming tomorrow?

1015
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:12,740
Yes.

1016
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,020
Can I come to visit you?

1017
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,300
Sure.

1018
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,060
What would you like to eat?

1019
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,620
We have work meals.

1020
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,860
We're here.

1021
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,460
Let's go this way.

1022
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,940
This hotel has two zones.

1023
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,740
We live there.

1024
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,330
Mr. Fang,

1025
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,340
you're staying here.

1026
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,740
All luxury suites are in Zone A.

1027
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,180
Well,

1028
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,460
we're not going the same way.

1029
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,540
I'll walk her back. You can go now.

1030
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,260
Good night, Mr. Fang.

1031
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,540
No, I can walk you.

1032
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,340
Good night, Mr. Fang.

1033
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,500
You can go back.

1034
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,180
Good night.

1035
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,460
Zone A.

1036
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,100
[Zone B]

1037
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,580
This is Zone B.

1038
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,260
Hao Junjie,

1039
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,050
what's going on?

1040
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,740
Why are there two zones?

1041
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,060
This...

1042
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,980
She lives on the other side.

1043
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,420
We...

1044
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,210
This...

1045
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,300
Didn't I book it for nothing?

1046
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,380
What do you like about me?

1047
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,860
Let's go back.

1048
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,900
No.

1049
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,260
Let me tell you.

1050
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,900
I have thick legs,

1051
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,100
a short waist and flat chest.

1052
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,940
And my legs are twisted now.

1053
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,340
You like me? Are you crazy?

1054
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,780
I know I'm the best player.

1055
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,180
But I'm warning you.

1056
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,580
Don't mistake your admiration

1057
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,820
as love.

1058
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,420
Let me tell you in my life.

1059
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,020
I hate it when people say they like me.

1060
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:13,980
Jian Shuang,

1061
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,180
I'm telling you.

1062
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,460
I've always liked you.

1063
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,650
Did you decide not to

1064
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,580
go abroad?

1065
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,820
What does being together have to do

1066
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,500
with going abroad?

1067
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,860
Jian Shuang.

1068
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,230
[Zone A]

1069
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,210
Jian Shuang!

1070
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,020
Jian Shuang!

1071
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,020
Jian Shuang!

1072
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,540
Jian Shuang.
Jian Shuang.

1073
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,500
You...

1074
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,020
Are your legs okay now?

1075
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,780
You don't need crutches.

1076
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:38,980
Hao Junjie.

1077
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,420
What?

1078
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,010
What's going on?

1079
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,020
How did you book the room?

1080
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,540
I haven't finished yet.
Jian Shuang.

1081
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,500
Jian Shuang.

1082
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,370
Did they have an argument?

1083
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,380
Young people nowadays

1084
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,420
are so impatient.

1085
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,300
If you don't want to go to bed instantly,

1086
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,940
we can go out for a walk.

1087
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,460
I'll go upstairs to find

1088
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,500
if there are any thicker clothes.

1089
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,940
It's getting colder at night.

1090
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,700
Okay.

1091
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,300
I'll wait for you

1092
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,940
at your filming location.

1093
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,300
Wait for me at the filming location?

1094
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,860
Okay.

1095
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:38,900
See you later.

1096
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,690
See you later.
