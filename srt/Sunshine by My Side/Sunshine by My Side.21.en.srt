00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,700
No need.

188
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,620
I drove here.

189
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,860
You'd better stream the game for me.

190
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,580
Let's have dinner together later.

191
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,100
Okay.

192
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,900
You guys, go out for a meeting.

193
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,980
There's no meeting today.

194
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,930
Just go out for a meeting.

195
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,100
Go.

196
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,620
Let's go.

197
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,540
Close the door.

198
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,580
Don't come in until I say so.

199
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,860
Sheng Yang, right?

200
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,380
Let me introduce myself.

201
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,260
I'm Xue Yiming.

202
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,620
I'm one of the bosses of this company.

203
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,620
Jian Bing

204
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,660
is my partner.

205
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,100
Actually, we're more than partners.

206
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,220
We are inseparable

207
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,300
family members.

208
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,340
And, we're business partners.

209
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,930
What about you?

210
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,220
You're an outsider she invited.

211
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,060
In other words, a guest.

212
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,060
I have to welcome you.

213
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,740
Feel free to visit whenever you want.

214
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,620
How long have you been working in this industry?

215
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,060
Which company are you working for?

216
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,860
I'm not working for a company.

217
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,340
You have your own team then?

218
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,179
No team.

219
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,940
Turn around and talk.

220
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,900
Come on.

221
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:41,940
How old are you?

222
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,620
I'm 26 years old.

223
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:45,820
Only...

224
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,060
How did you know Jian Bing?

225
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,660
Why didn't she mention you to me?

226
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,300
She never told me about you either.

227
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,740
She doesn't need to tell an outsider those things.

228
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,820
Actually,

229
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,740
she entrusted you with

230
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,620
such an important job.

231
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,610
I can understand, right?

232
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,300
Back then,

233
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,220
I took care of young people like this too.

234
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,380
She takes extra care of

235
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,980
the company's employees

236
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,220
and young external talents

237
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,020
all the time.

238
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,580
So, don't take it to heart.

239
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,220
Let me ask you something.

240
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:21,970
Here.

241
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,780
Can you hear me?

242
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,660
As long as you can hear me.

243
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,420
As long as you can hear me.

244
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,140
Let's have a good chat.

245
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,260
What do your parents do?

246
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,420
My dad is a cleaner and my mom is a saleswoman.

247
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,340
I graduated from Chuanjiang Media Advertising College.

248
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,220
I majored in visual communication and design.

249
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,660
I used to work at July Advertising Agency.

250
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,740
I've worked in this industry for three to four years.

251
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,580
How's our equipment?

252
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,580
Do you like them?

253
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,820
The monitor,

254
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,900
this keyboard, this mouse,

255
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,820
and this disk array.

256
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,610
Jian Bing and I

257
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,860
bought them one by one

258
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,620
from the computer stores.

259
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,380
Look at

260
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,530
this coffee machine.

261
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,700
Back then,

262
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,660
she insisted on buying it upon release.

263
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,020
She left it at home to collect dust after she bought it.

264
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,530
Ladies

265
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,050
love to buy new things.

266
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,380
After spending the money, they leave the item aside

267
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,020
and move on to buy other new things.

268
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,820
Don't you think

269
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,500
that is a bias towards the new things?

270
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,780
Not using a product you bought

271
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,610
and not appreciating a person you married

272
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,180
are two very different matters.

273
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,340
At least in my eyes,

274
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,620
I think she is very responsible for people and things.

275
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,500
Yes.

276
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,980
Otherwise, how could she have stayed with me

277
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,300
for more than ten years?

278
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:40,780
Mr. Xue,

279
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,980
I have to submit this film this afternoon.

280
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,180
I know you have to.

281
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,460
I just want to

282
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,820
make friends with you.

283
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,940
I don't think we can be friends.

284
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,860
Young man,

285
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,580
how dare you be so straightforward?

286
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,180
Aren't you afraid of offending others?

287
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,260
You are a senior.

288
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,690
Out of respect,

289
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,340
I answered

290
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,660
every question you asked.

291
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,730
But I'm here to work,

292
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,020
not to make friends.

293
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,380
What do you mean?

294
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,220
You mean you won't be friends with me?

295
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,140
Fine.

296
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,220
Do you think that Jian Bing is easy to coax

297
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,740
and easy to fool?

298
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,300
Calm down.

299
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,620
As the boss of this company,

300
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,220
I have the right

301
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,500
to know what the expenses are like.

302
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,660
You said you are the boss of this company.

303
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,180
Then you must know very well

304
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,380
about every project in the company.

305
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,980
You must also know,

306
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,980
Director Jian Bing paid for this film.

307
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,900
So the budget is very low.

308
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
The budget for special effects is even less.

309
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,730
She has no money to hire a big company to make it for her.

310
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,340
So you mean

311
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,380
you're just helping her?

312
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,900
And you didn't take advantage of her.

313
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,530
You're even suffering a loss, right?

314
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,740
I don't care about gains and losses.

315
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,340
You mean

316
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,620
our company

317
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,020
is bullying you?

318
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,900
How much do you want?

319
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,140
I'll pay you double.

320
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,860
Let me add you

321
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:07,850
on WeChat.

322
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,940
What are you looking at?

323
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,180
I said it's none of your business.

324
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,660
Director Jian.

325
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,580
Let's add each other on WeChat.

326
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,140
Aren't you working?

327
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,580
Let's add each other on WeChat.

328
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,500
Why?

329
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,020
Add me on WeChat!

330
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,300
I don't want to add you on WeChat.

331
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,100
Can't I add you on WeChat?

332
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,740
Add me.

333
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,300
No.

334
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,420
why would I add you on WeChat?

335
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:18,770
Xue Yiming!

336
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,340
Add me.

337
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,780
A word with you, now.

338
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,140
Let's go.

339
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,900
Tell me, what is it?

340
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,900
What do you want?

341
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,660
Will you be responsible

342
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,340
if we fail to deliver the film on time?

343
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,540
Do you think he's a little white rabbit

344
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,420
and I'm the big bad wolf bullying him?

345
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,980
I'm the little rabbit, okay?

346
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,700
I don't understand.

347
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,930
We've been together for so many years.

348
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,220
We should at least show some respect for each other.

349
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,770
I don't understand why you chose him.

350
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,380
First, he has no fixed job.

351
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,100
Second, he relies on you.

352
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,540
Third, he spends your money.

353
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,020
Why did you find someone like this?

354
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,690
He earns money on his own.

355
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,220
When did he spend my money?

356
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,180
Don't you pay him

357
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,300
since he's working for me?

358
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,020
He's working for me.

359
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,940
Of course I have to pay him.

360
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,300
Isn't that your money?

361
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,700
If you two want to date,

362
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,820
you don't have to employ him

363
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,580
and do all this nonsense.

364
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,580
He doesn't have to come to our company to mess it up.

365
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,420
Just give him the money right away.

366
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,620
What makes you think we are dating?

367
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,780
I'm not blind.

368
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:54,940
Fine.

369
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,250
Fine.

370
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,100
Even if we are in a relationship,

371
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,140
it has nothing to do with you.

372
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,140
This is the company.

373
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,340
You can't date in the company.

374

00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,100
After that, you...

556
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,380
Jian Bing, she...

557
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,740
She has a house

558
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,180
and a car, right?

559
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,500
She owns such a big company.

560
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:36,980
Right?

561
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,580
Look at him.

562
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,020
He...

563
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,140
He has nothing.

564
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,820
He is so much younger too.

565
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,260
Right?

566
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,180
You...

567
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,380
You think they look

568
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,580
quite close and loving now.

569
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,980
What about two years later?

570
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,250
A couple's mindset changes with time.

571
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,020
Also,

572
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,820
she brought him to the company

573
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,050
without warning, just like that.

574
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,540
How could she do that?

575
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,420
Right?

576
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,660
The three of us...

577
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,500
Well...

578
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,020
What should we do?

579
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,380
This...

580
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,980
This is unreasonable.

581
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,140
I understand how you feel.

582
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,140
You just got divorced.

583
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,060
You're still possessive towards her.

584
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,020
But what you did today

585
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,300
makes me suspect that

586
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,820
you're treating me as a backup.

587
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,140
You have to choose

588
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,820
between Jian Bing and me.

589
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,780
Uncle.

590
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,500
What did the doctor say?

591
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,540
Her ankle is fractured.

592
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,060
Also,

593
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,500
a third-degree injury to the meniscus. The whole layer is torn apart.

594
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,460
She can't play ice hockey for now.

595
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,060
She needs a good rest.

596
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,060
Where are you going?

597
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,660
She's asleep.

598
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,500
Don't you have class tonight?

599
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,260
Go back to school.

600
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,060
Leave it to me.

601
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,580
I want to stay.

602
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,940
What can you do if you stay?

603
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,140
Can you take care of patients?

604
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,260
Even so, I want to stay.

605
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,580
Hao Junjie.

606
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,460
Don't forget

607
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,060
you're going abroad soon.

608
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,250
You can only think about one thing now,

609
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,620
and that is to study hard.

610
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,140
I know.

611
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,660
But Uncle,

612
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,260
if I go back now, I can't focus in class anyway.

613
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,460
And I want to tell her personally

614
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,420
that we won.

615
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,460
I'll apply for leave for you.

616
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,820
[Ward]

617
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,540
You're done?

618
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,540
You're awake.

619
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,140
I can't find my phone.

620
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,260
It's with me.

621
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,020
You left it in the dressing room.

622
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,620
No wonder.

623
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,460
Nevermind. Just tell me.

624
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,410
How did it go?

625
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,700
Oh, just tell me.

626
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,060
We lost, right?

627
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,820
It's okay.

628
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,900
What was the score?

629
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,620
Three to two.

630
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,260
Okay.

631
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,140
Their striker was really good.

632
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,020
Am I not good?

633
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,740
We won.

634
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,610
We three, they two.

635
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,490
Really?

636
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,530
Of course.

637
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,900
I scored two goals.

638
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,660
Good job, Hao Junjie.

639
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,250
You're really good at pretending.

640
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,140
You know how to act now?

641
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,420
Your act was so convincing.

642
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,660
Don't move. You're hurt.

643
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,060
Okay.

644
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,660
You truly deserve the Captain title.

645
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,260
What are you doing?

646
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,540
I knew you could do it.

647
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,020
What do you want?

648
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,140
Tell me. I'll help you.

649
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,460
You can't help me. I have to do it myself.

650
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,700
Why can't I help?

651
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,060
What?

652
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,260
I want to use the toilet!

653
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,260
Hold on.

654
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,660
My belt is loose.

655
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,940
Good job, Senior.

656
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,020
This is a wild way.

657
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,260
Cut the crap.

658
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,900
Did we disturb you?

659
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,260
Let's go.

660
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,740
He's just helping me to the toilet. Are you crazy?

661
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,660
Helping you to the toilet?

662
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,500
What's wrong?

663
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,730
Your minds are so dirty.

664
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,860
Come and give me a hand.

665
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,380
Okay. Come on.

666
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,740
I'll hit you.

667
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,500
Let's go.

668
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,380
Be careful.

669
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,380
You deserve a beating.

670
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,180
Slow down.

671
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,020
You hop so fast.

672
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,740
Are you going to the Olympics?

673
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,660
Be careful.

674
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,260
Not bad.

675
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,140
Happiness meets childlike innocence.

676
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,720
[Mr Whitty Bear Marshmallow]

677
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,740
Mr Whitty Bear Marshmallow.

678
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,300
It's really great.

679
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,260
This idea is much better than the previous one.

680
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:45,700
Really?

681
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,100
Who came up with this idea?

682
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,260
Here, have some water.

683
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,060
Okay, thank you.

684
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,460
Here,

685
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:51,900
Mr. Shao.

686
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,690
This is nice.

687
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,530
It's really good.

688
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,100
As long as you're satisfied.

689
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,780
You don't know.

690
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,260
This project of yours took a lot of work.

691
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:00,900
Of course,

692
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,180
what you see now

693
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,740
is still a rough edition.

694
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,940
As long as you make the decision,

695
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,530
we can make it more detailed.

696
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,140
No problem.

697
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,940
Then go ahead and refine it.

698
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,820
I’ve talked to the branding team already.

699
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,700
This one is good to go.

700
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,060
As for the spokesperson...

701
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,500
Can you take another version?

702
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,140
Another one?

703
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,300
Mr. He,

704
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,540
about the budget splitting...

705
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,940
Follow the original plan.

706
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,380
I'll pay

707
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,010
for both versions.

708
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:36,660
Thank you.

709
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,380
Alright.

710
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,940
I have to thank you.

711
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,500
Let's not sit here.

712
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,620
Let's go.

713
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,530
Let's go.

714
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:45,700
Let's go.

715
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,420
What?

716
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,540
Today,

717
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,820
it's my treat.

718
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,740
To reward Director Jian.

719
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,420
She worked hard.

720
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,260
She's carrying the project all by herself.

721
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,100
No, no. No need.

722
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,780
Well,

723
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,660
there's a new

724
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,860
Yanbang cuisine restaurant nearby.

725
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,660
Let me take you there.

726
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,060
The food is very delicious.

727
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,420
Okay.

728
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,620
Yes, I'll make reservations.

729
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,780
It's our treat tonight.

730
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,140
Don't take it from us.

731
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,260
-No, I said I'll do it.
-Hurry up.

732
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,660
You... Hurry up and make a reservation.

733
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,940
Director Jian, let's go.

734
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,980
I'm not going.

735
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,860
Mr. He, the film

736
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,180
needs some finishing touches.

737
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,860
Don't we have another film to shoot?

738
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,700
Let's celebrate after the shooting.

739
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:20,740
Director Jian,

740
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,940
are you mad at me

741
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,100
because of the termination of the contract?

742
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,780
No, no, no.

743
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,260
I really had no choice.

744
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,820
I understand.

745
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,260
I understand.

746
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,420
Mr. He, here's the thing.

747
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,820
I can't drink.

748
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,020
I'll ask Xue and Shanshan to accompany you instead.

749
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:35,570
Yes.

750
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,460
Yes.

751
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,780
She can't drink.

752
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,500
The doctor said

753
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,810
she needed more rest

754
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,780
for her mild concussion.

755
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,860
Plus, editing is tiring.

756
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,580
Let her rest well.

757
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,940
When she has fully recovered,

758
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,060
we'll have another meal, okay?

759
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,620
I understand.

760
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,420
Let's go, Mr. He.

761
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,490
Let's drink.

762
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,730
Director Jian, it's a deal.

763
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,580
You must join me for a meal next time.

764
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,820
Let's go.

765
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,700
Take care, Mr. He.

766
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,820
Thank you.

767
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,460
Shanshan, take the good wine.

768
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,300
Okay.

769
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,380
This restaurant is very good.

770
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,500
It's a Yanbang cuisine flagship shop.

771
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,380
What did the client say?

772
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,100
The client said...

773
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,220
It's very good!

774
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,010
Really?

775
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,420
Yes.

776
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,580
You scared me just now.

777
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,460
He was so happy, he wanted to buy us dinner.

778
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,700
Well,

779
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,010
aren't you going to eat with them?

780
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,660
I'm not going. If I go, what about you?

781
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,180
I...

782
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,570
Don't worry about me.

783
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,380
I have to wait for you.

784
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,460
Because today,

785
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,940
you really helped me a lot.

786
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,980
Not only did the client not cancel,

787
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,420
he even added another order with us.

788
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,530
Awesome, Director Jian.

789
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,810
Happy cooperation.

790
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,980
Happy cooperation.

791
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,380
Get to work.

792
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,010
We can't let the kid starve here alone.

793
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,180
Let's eat together later.

794
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,620
Do you need a brother?

795
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,980
I'm not your sister.

796
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,260
Aren't you my aunt?

797
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,740
Aunt, watch your status.

798
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,740
If I weren't so happy today,

799
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,140
I would have argued with you.

800
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,780
I'll transfer the deposit to you first.

801
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,260
You don't have to give me the money.

802
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,460
I'm not helping you for money.

803
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,660
You're not helping me for money.

804
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,300
Then,

805
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,500
how can I ask you for help next time?

806
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,180
Why do we always disagree

807
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,380
over money?

808
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,220
When someone transfers money to you,

809
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,620
just take it.

810
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,940
Otherwise, when you change your mind,

811
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,930
you'll regret declining it.

812
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,380
Fine.

813
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,660
I'll take it.

814
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,060
I'll take it.

815
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,100
Got it.

816
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,500
Well,

817
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,540
I'll

818
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,660
treat you to dinner.

819
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,380
Why are you buying me dinner again?

820
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,780
You paid too much.

821
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,980
Back to the money argument.

822
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,770
Fine.

823
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,780
It's a happy day. Your treat then.

824
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,940
How much longer?

825
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,860
About 20 minutes.

826
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,820
Okay.

827
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,370
[Clinic]

828
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,020
Alright, go back.

829
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,820
You'll miss the last subway train if you dwindle.

830
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,060
We'll miss the last subway train.

831
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:48,980
Subway?

832
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,020
We understand.

833
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,540
What do you understand?

834
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,940
Be sensible. Let's go.

835
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:52,860
Okay.

836
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,180
Thank you, Senior.

837
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,780
She'll be hospitalized

838
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,020
for at least a week, right?

839
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,460
Yes.

840
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,020
You'll be together day and night.

841
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,900
You have to work hard.

842
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,050
Come on. Seize the chance!

843
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:03,900
I'm sorry.

844
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,900
Be careful.

845
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,420
Just kidding.

846
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:09,739
Come in.

847
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,340
It's like you're here to annoy me.

848
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:12,860
Uncle.

849
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,020
You are all here.

850
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,300
Mr. Fang.

851
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,570
Hao Junjie.

852
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,780
Come out.

853
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,020
We'll stay here.

854
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,810
Take care of yourself.

855
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,860
What's wrong, Uncle?

856
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,179
Did you tell her sister?

857
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,659
Let me tell you.

858
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:41,460
The doctor said

859
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,179
she'll stay here for at least half a month.

860
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,580
How can she attend classes this way?

861
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,170
The counselor told me everything.

862
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,260
He wants her to take a leave of absence.

863
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,100
We can't hide this anymore.

864
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,860
Jian Shuang's sister will scold her to death.

865
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,820
That's her sister's business.

866
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,460
They are sisters.

867
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,700
It's none of your business.

868
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,100
Besides,

869
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,090
she needs her family by her side.

870
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,380
No, you don't understand.

871
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,500
Their family tradition

872
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,220
is to try not to trouble each other.

873
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,860
Jian Shuang won't go to her sister

874
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,220
unless absolutely necessary.

875
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,940
Since when did you know her so well?

876
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,180
Let me ask you.

877
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,380
Did you know about her injury?

878
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,460
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

879
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,460
-She wouldn't have been so badly hurt.
-Shush.

880
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,260
You've made a foolish decision.

881
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:31,770
Listen.

882
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,450
We must inform her sister about this.

883
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,020
No.

884
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,940
No matter what,

885
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,490
we should respect the patient's wishes.

886
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,020
Even if you want to say it,

887
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,820
wait until she gets better, okay?

888
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,660
I'm your uncle. You have to listen to me.

889
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,210
I'm her captain.

890
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,180
I'm responsible for her injury.

891
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,460
I can take care of her.

892
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,340
Have you arrived?

893
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,340
Mom, I'm here.

894
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,780
Have a good chat with him.

895
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,180
Hello, do you have a reservation?

896
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:12,780
No.

897
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,460
Help me find a table closest to the door

898
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,380
so I can slip away later.

899
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,380
What?

900
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,220
Why are you slipping away?

901
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:17,860
That one will do.

902
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,610
Hey.

903
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,220
-Are you out of your mind?
-Okay.

904
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,540
This is the son of your dad's army buddy.

905
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,450
He works in the Space Administration.

906
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,220
The menu. I'll get you some water.

907
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,100
The unit provides houses and household registers.

908
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,020
Can you keep your voice down?

909
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,140
You arranged so many blind dates for me.

910
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,300
I'm so annoyed.

911
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,020
I didn't see you when I came in.

912
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,980
Brother Kai.

913
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,740
Don't worry.

914
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,060
I'm at the door.

915
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,380
I'm at the door too.

916
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,060
I think I see you.

917
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,660
I think I see you too.

918
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,700
Let's go.

919
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,220
I specially chose a seat by the window.

920
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,660
I don't know if you like it.

921
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,420
It's here.

922
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,060
Here?

923
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,060
Okay.

924
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,810
Brother Kai.

925
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,820
You look exactly like the photo.

926
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,780
So handsome.

927
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,140
Thank you.

928
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,140
But look,

929
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,860
you are a little different from your photo,

930
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,620
right?

931
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,500
I did

932
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,460
gain a little weight recently.

933
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,860
Which girl doesn't photoshop her photos?

934
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,340
Besides,

935
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,010
I'll look like that when I slim down.

936
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,660
I think you're getting

937
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,140
a bigger version of the same model.

938
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,500
I think it's a profit on your part.

939
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,660
It's a special day today.

940
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,300
Shall we have a drink to celebrate?

941
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,980
I'm not

942
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,260
driving anyway.

943
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,700
Okay, let's take the subway together.

944
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,740
Sure.

945
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,820
You're still here.

946
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,130
Why are you back?

947
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,300
I'm here to get a bottle of wine.

948
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,380
Come here.

949
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,980
You rejected him last time.

950
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,500
But now, he's in the company doing a project for you.

951
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,980
What's going on?

952
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,740
He's here to help me.

953
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,660
Don't give me

954
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,980
those proper reasons.

955
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,220
I'm not Xue.

956
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,900
I just want to know

957
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,820
if you have feelings for him.

958
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,980
I heard it just now.

959
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,460
You said

960
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,420
you wanted to take the subway with him.

961
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,690
When have you ever taken the subway?

962
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,740
The way he looks at you...

963
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,700
I can feel the heat from three meters away.

964
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,820
I can't even resist it,

965
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,900
and I hang out with young men all day.

966
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,020
Let alone you.

967
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,900
Tell me the truth. Do you have feelings for him?

968
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,810
I just want to tell you that

969
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,900
you can fool others but not yourself.

970
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,380
Don't miss a relationship

971
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,020
because of some unimportant things.

972
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,620
Can you go back and drink?

973
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,780
I'm leaving.

974
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,700
Bye.

975
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,420
Bye.

976
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,900
Don't drink too much.

977
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,780
Okay, don't worry.

978
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,820
I'm going to the bathroom.

979
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,090
By the way,

980
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,820
don't pay the bill

981
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,420
when I'm not around.

982
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,140
After all, we agreed

983
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,140
to go Dutch.

984
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,300
Okay.

985
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,140
Why do I feel

986
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,220
she has other intentions for me?

987
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,420
Would it be inappropriate for me to leave now?

988
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,980
Why are you leaving?

989
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,700
She's so cute.

990
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,100
Aren't you worried about me?

991
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,980
I'd rather quit

992
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,860
if I have to sell my body.

993
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,900
You don't have to explain to me.

994
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,210
It's none of my business.

995
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,860
Who's explaining anything to you?

996
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,020
What are you doing here?

997
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,660
Why are you dressed up like this?

998
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,580
Are you here for a blind date?

999
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,620
Why are you here alone?

1000
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,420
Did he come to see you

1001
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,050
and escape because you're too ugly?

1002
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,340
Your Sister Yao is the prettiest.

1003
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,420
Go and see her.

1004
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,730
Look.

1005
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,020
It's a candlelight dinner and you're all dressed up.

1006
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,980
What a pity for your outfit.

1007
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,170
I'm really puzzled.

1008
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,420
The world is so big.

1009
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,420
Why can I meet you everywhere?

1010
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,580
No wonder I'm so unlucky.

1011
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,420
This is called fate.

1012
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,850
According to the plot of the drama,

1013
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,180
we should fall for each other tonight

1014
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,780
and write a devastating

1015
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,890
love story together.

1016
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,180
No need.

1017
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,020
I got the wrong person.

1018
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,050
I thought that was my colleague.

1019
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,900
Do you think

1020
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,020
she's prettier than me?

1021
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,660
No, I don't think so.

1022
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,140
I really mistook her for someone else.

1023
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,500
I think I'm a little angry.
