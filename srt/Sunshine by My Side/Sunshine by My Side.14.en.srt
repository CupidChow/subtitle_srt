[Episode 14]

4
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,860
Happy cooperation.

5
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,060
Same here.

6
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,100
What's good about this? Why did you change?

7
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,660
This silver is so beautiful.

8
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,740
Is this okay?

9
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:47,700
Not bad, right?

10
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,340
Pretty good.

11
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,020
You might...

12
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,260
want to wash your hair.

13
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,860
It's coming from you.

14
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,460
I've been busy this whole day.

15
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,940
So what if I smell a little?

16
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,860
What? Do you detest me?

17
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,900
I'll wash them at night.

18
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,180
They're arriving soon.

19
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,260
Why are they not here yet?

20
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,260
I remember when I was young,

21
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,100
the first time I went to your house to see our parents,

22
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,740
I insisted on making a few dishes.

23
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,100
You almost chopped off your hands.

24
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,180
I helped you secretly

25
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,380
so you could get past this safely.

26
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,180
That day,

27
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,300
I kissed you.

28
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,860
Was it that day?

29
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,340
Of course it was.

30
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,180
The hot oil splattered

31
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,500
on my face. You wiped it for me.

32
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,100
I was so close,

33
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,650
I couldn't help but kiss you.

34
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,940
You're annoying.

35
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,660
When I was young, I took care of the elders,

36
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,780
now that I'm old, I have to take care of my son.

37
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,860
When can we get them

38
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,500
to serve us?

39
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,260
I've been taking care of you. Is that not enough?

40
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,980
You still want your son and daughter-in-law to take care of you?

41
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,740
You don't want to?

42
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,340
I just hope that

43
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,579
we never need anyone to take care of us.

44
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,100
They're here.

45
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,060
The door.

46
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,020
Let me confirm again.

47
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,100
Do we have to be extremely polite?

48
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,860
Of course. For our son.

49
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,300
Come in.

50
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:39,740
Yang.

51
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,260
Luo.

52
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,900
Coming.

53
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,740
Mr. Sheng.

54
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,540
Hello.

55
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,420
Welcome, welcome!

56
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,180
Warm welcome!

57
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,340
Are you crazy?

58
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,380
Didn't you say we have to be extremely polite.

59
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,740
Sorry, director.

60
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,660
Well, our family has a tradition during Chinese New Year,

61
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,250
we have to welcome guests like this.

62
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,060
It's our highest etiquette.

63
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,740
Highest etiquette?

64
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,140
Yes, b-because you said we have to be...

65
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,860
-Move.
-Extremely polite with his colleagues.

66
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,540
Yang, it's just the two of you?

67
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,580
Yes, just the two of us.

68
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,380
What about other colleagues?

69
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,660
I didn't say there was aynone else.

70
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,100
You told me to prepare eight dishes.

71
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,390
I...

72
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:12,740
Mom.

73
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,700
Please come in.

74
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,500
Come in.

75
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:15,980
No need to change your shoes.

76
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,260
-Come on.
-Come on.

77
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,660
Have a seat.

78
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,339
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

79
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:23,980
Fang.

80
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,340
Why are you back?

81
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,260
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

82
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,500
Don't you have plans tonight?

83
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,820
Something came up for them

84
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,340
so they cancelled it.

85
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,409
What do you want to eat?

86
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,890
I'll order food delivery for you.

87
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,500
You buy other people western food

88
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,980
but food delivery for me.

89
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,060
Cut the crap. Do you want to eat or not?

90
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,220
Forget it.

91
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,580
You're in a bad mood.

92
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,740
There are glutinous rice balls in the fridge,

93
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,860
and buns too.

94
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,860
Help me

95
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,740
cook them.

96
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:57,980
All right.

97
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,580
You saved me a meal.

98
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,780
Did you not ask her out in advance?

99
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,420
Last minute?

100
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,900
That's rude.

101
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,580
That dude asked her out last minute too.

102
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,940
Which dude?

103
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,060
His ex-husband?

104
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,660
No.

105
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,860
Colleague?

106
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,900
Doesn't seem like it.

107
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,060
Forget it.

108
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,620
I'll go find your buns first.

109
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,460
We're out of buns.

110
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,730
We can only eat glutinous rice balls.

111
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,140
Fine.

112
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,940
Fang.

113
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:41,500
Fang!

114
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,020
Can you be more proactive

115
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,659
with girls in the future?

116
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,700
You and aunt–

117
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,140
Your ex-aunt has broken up for so long.

118
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:51,940
I've never seen you

119
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,780
care so much about any girl.

120
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,860
Listen.

121
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,140
If you are still single,

122
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,700
when I leave,

123
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,940
you'll be alone.

124
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,100
How dare you say that I will be alone!

125
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,980
Do you have a conscience?

126
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,900
These four years,

127
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,130
have I had any of my own time?

128
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:06,860
All these years,

129
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,940
when I'm giving classes, you're in school too,

130
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,940
when I'm on holiday, so are you.

131
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,260
I finally have a weekend now

132
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,140
yet I don't even have time to be alone.

133
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,620
Tell me.

134
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,500
Who tutored you during the summer and winter vacation?

135
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,740
Who brought you everywhere to play?

136
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,940
It's me, your uncle!

137
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,340
How ungrateful.

138
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,620
I'll be alone...

139
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,700
You...

140
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,460
Don't come back!

141
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,020
It's my fault that you can't date?

142
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,100
Let me say something.

143
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,460
Go ahead.

144
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:40,220
Director.

145
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,460
First of all,

146
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,340
welcome to our house.

147
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,020
Yes.

148
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,980
Ten years ago,

149
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,020
you knew the Old Sheng,

150
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,020
but not the Young Sheng.

151
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,020
She did.

152
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,020
I did a lot of research to shoot that commercial.

153
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,380
We'll count that.

154
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,020
Ten years later, you not only know Young Sheng,

155
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,820
but also made Luo Meijuan look so brilliant.

156
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,460
What's this relationship between you and our Sheng family called?

157
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,620
It's fate.

158
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,100
Yes.

159
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,340
Come on, cheers for fate.

160
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,700
Come on.

161
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,540
Welcome.

162
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,060
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

163
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,260
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

164
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,810
You didn't get to the point.

165
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,020
I'm not good at talking.

166
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,940
Let me say it.

167
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,810
Director Bing.

168
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,100
From now on,

169
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,340
can I call you Director Bing?

170
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:22,940
Yes.

171
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,620
What I want to say is,

172
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,660
we are very grateful to you.

173
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,220
When I first met you,

174
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,180
I thought you felt very approachable.

175
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,620
I didn't expect all those raw footages could be used.

176
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,460
They were all edited into the advertisement.

177
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,540
No, Luo.

178
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,140
Your part

179
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,780
is very important in the whole film.

180
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,260
It can't be absent.

181
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,020
What did you tell your parents?

182
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,700
Actually,

183
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,460
I should thank Sheng Yang.

184
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,140
I think not many boys at his age

185
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,659
care about their parents' relationship

186
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,100
like he does.

187
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,659
If he hadn't told me about you two,

188
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,460
I wouldn't have gotten such inspiration.

189
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,860
I have to thank you.

190
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,940
You did a great job.

191
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,460
No, I'm flattered.

192
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,540
You, you met your lady luck.

193
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,460
Yes.

194
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,820
Director Jian Bing

195
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,100
took good care of me.

196
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,380
You have no idea.

197
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,020
You fulfilled Luo Meijuan's dream of becoming an actress.

198
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,460
Really?

199
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,340
Now her tail has gone up to the sky.

200
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,140
She keeps asking me,

201
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,140
"Do I look like Audrey Hepburn?"

202
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,300
-Annoying.
-Yes.

203
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,810
Kinda.

204
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,860
Don't laugh at me.

205
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,660
In the past,

206
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,010
our lives never changed.

207
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,820
Of course,

208
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,660
I'm not saying

209
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,900
we didn't have a good life before.

210
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,890
I always feel

211
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,020
something is missing.

212
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:39,890
Think about it.

213
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,460
Yang has grown up

214
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,299
and is busy with work.

215
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,020
He doesn't come home often.

216
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,220
Yang's father and I

217
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,260
just stare at each other at home

218
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,100
and we feel empty.

219
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,060
It just feels like

220
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,140
there's no passion for life.

221
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,860
Am I wrong?

222
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:57,780
Well,

223
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,140
how should I describe this?

224
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,060
An empty life. Empty.

225
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,620
Empty...

226
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,020
Emptiness.

227
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,900
That's a good word.

228
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,620
Emptiness.

229
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,860
The educated is indeed different.

230
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,140
The director is talking about emptiness.

231
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,900
You're is just eh.

232
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,940
What are you talking about?

233
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,490
You think so much everyday.

234
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,780
What do you mean?

235
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,260
When we were at home,

236
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,380
the feeling I have,

237
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,220
I-I can't describe it.

238
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,460
I feel...

239
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,220
That when I'm at home with Yang's father,

240
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,820
how should I put this feeling?

241
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,300
"The Moon and Sixpence"?

242
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,500
What fence?

243
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,460
It's just a book.

244
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,610
I suddenly remembered

245
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,700
there's a sentence that suits

246
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,260
your feelings and your thoughts.

247
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,820
On top of ordinary material life,

248
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,860
there is still a charming spiritual world.

249
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,300
That means you're not overthinking.

250
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,180
But when there were sixpence everywhere,

251
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,250
only you looked up at the moon.

252
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,820
It means that you have passion.

253
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,490
It's great to have you.

254
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,020
Come, let's drink.

255
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:05,660
Come on.

256
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,740
Let's cooperate.

257
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,620
I don't understand what you're talking about,

258
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,620
but I think

259
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,140
what you said is how I feel,

260
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,210
what I want to express.

261
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,140
I'm sure do

262
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,700
want to be your friend.

263
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,300
Okay.

264
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,220
These two

265
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,060
are going to kowtow to each other

266
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,660
and become sworn sisters.

267
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,700
Mom,

268
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,820
the dishes will get cold if we keep talking.

269
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,460
Come on.

270
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,220
Let's eat.

271
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:30,860
Really?

272
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,580
You...

273
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,580
Shrimp.

274
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,300
It's okay.

275
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,780
I don't eat much at night.

276
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,460
Have a trotter.

277
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,100
Okay.

278
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,460
Chicken soup is good too.

279
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,180
Let me do it.

280
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,540
It has been simmered for over an hour.

281
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,540
Make yourself at home.

282
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,540
Of course.

283
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,580
Have some shrimp and this.

284
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,140
Come on.

285
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,820
Just leave this here.

286
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,380
You're here.

287
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,420
I haven't seen you for a day.

288
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,780
Where did you go?

289
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,220
I went to your sister's place to record.

290
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,260
My sister?

291
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,820
Didn't she tell you?

292
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,380
Even when she got a divorce,

293
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,660
it was her assistant who told me

294
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,740
when the divorce papers have already been through.

295
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,020
Let me ask you something.

296
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,820
Is your sister

297
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,380
single now?

298
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,180
Why?

299
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,060
You're interested in my sister?

300
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,980
What do you mean I'm interested in your sister?

301
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,170
My uncle

302
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,380
was stood up by your sister today.

303
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,180
So I want to know

304
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,620
if there is anyone around your sister?

305
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,770
I don't know much about her...

306
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,500
You think quite a lot.

307
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,380
What?

308
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,940
You want to get my sister and your uncle together?

309
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,900
Bing,

310
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,220
are you married?

311
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,610
I just divorced.

312
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,580
You're divorced?

313
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,410
Why?

314
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,180
What why?

315
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,740
It must be her husband's fault.

316
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,740
What does your husband do?

317
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,380
No, what does your ex-husband do?

318
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,100
Mom.

319
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,500
You're getting too gossipy.

320
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,740
It's okay.

321
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,620
My ex-husband is also a director.

322
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,940
Director?

323
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,260
He must be doing well too.

324
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,180
Why did you divorce?

325
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,780
You can't ask that.

326
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,780
You're rubbing salt on her wound.

327
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,380
-I'm just concerned.
-Thank you.

328
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,460
Don't be sad.

329
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,060
I’ll find you another one.

330
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,740
Thank you for your concern.

331
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,370
I'm not sad.

332
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,180
It's just...

333
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,540
a normal divorce.

334
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,580
It just means our speed is different.

335
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,370
What do you mean speed?

336
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:15,060
In the long run marathon of this love,

337
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,380
our speed has become different.

338
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,420
Someone might want to stop to take a break.

339
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,020
And someone might want to run a little faster.

340
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,060
He's slow?

341
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,580
Anyway, if you can run

342
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,140
more comfortably and happily alone,

343
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,220
isn't that good, too?

344
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,010
You can also enjoy the scenery along the way.

345
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,380
The scenery along the way?

346
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,130
-Anyway, thank you for your concern.
-No, no.

347
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,540
I'm very happy now.

348
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,180
I'm just an ordinary person.

349
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,300
I love myself more

350
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,380
than other people.

351
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,740
Well said.

352
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,420
Look at the scenery along the way.

353
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,260
You make me want a divorce too.

354
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,540
You just landed and you want to take off again?

355
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,620
I don't know why I just like to listen to her.

356
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,460
I love everything she says.

357
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,620
I think they makes sense.

358
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,100
I've never seen such a perfect girl.

359
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,130
You're right.

360
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,780
I'm not perfect.

361
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,300
I can't cook any of these.

362
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,780
I don't know how to cook.

363
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,220
You can't cook?

364
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:09,900
Mom.

365
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,540
Let them eat something.

366
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,020
Okay? Stop asking.

367
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,460
I think it's troublesome.

368
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,380
Buying groceries, cutting vegetables, stir-frying vegetables.

369
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,260
Eat.

370
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,220
After eating you have to wash dishes.

371
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,260
It will take so much time

372
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,820
after this whole procedure.

373
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,140
Yes, I'll cry if you ask me to do that.

374
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,620
You order takeout every day?

375
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,380
I eat the lunch boxes on the set more.

376
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,940
If my sister really gets together with your uncle,

377
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,540
I will have to call your uncle brother-in-law,

378
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,460
and you will have to call my sister aunt-in-law.

379
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,170
Then you are

380
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,940
my nephew.

381
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,140
Don't take advantage of me here.

382
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,020
I have a nephew.

383
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,100
What do you think of my uncle?

384
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,340
Your uncle?

385
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,540
It is not up to me.

386
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,780
You have to ask my sister.

387
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,540
What type does your sister like?

388
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,620
She likes...

389
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,860
Scoundrels.

390
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,220
She likes scoundrels?

391
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Take my ex-brother-in-law for example.

392
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,020
He looks

393
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,130
not quite good-looking.

394
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,940
He thinks he's famous in the advertisement industry,

395
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,180
and used all his capabilities

396
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,940
on flirting with girls.

397
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,500
But my sister just have to likes this.

398
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,130
Maybe your sister likes

399
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,220
your ex-brother-in-law's talent.

400
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,500
Do you think your sister will

401
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,740
like someone like my uncle?

402
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,980
Mr. Fang...

403
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,930
He's not bad enough.

404
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,380
My sister once said

405
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,860
love

406
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,180
is like a marathon.

407
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,850
At first, the two people will agree

408
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,180
to move towards a common goal.

409
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,260
They both run with vigor at the start.

410
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,580
But as they run,

411
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,260
one of them got tired and wants to rest.

412
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,460
Yet, the other wants to keep running.

413
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,300
As they were resting,

414
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,890
the distance becomes further.

415
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,500
And one of them will

416
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,820
meet another person who

417
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,940
matches their speed,

418
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,260
and they run away together again.

419
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,490
But no one says

420
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,370
there must be someone beside you to run a marathon.

421
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,900
So you mean

422
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,660
your sister wants to be alone now?

423
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,780
My sister means

424
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,620
the process of running and the scenery on the road

425
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,700
are far more important than who is by her side.

426
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,580
So people like my sister

427
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,140
are used to being independent.

428
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,500
She's different from others.

429
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,940
Naturally, she doesn't like

430
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,490
ordinary people.

431
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,580
I don't want to drink anymore.

432
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,380
I'm leaving.

433
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,060
Didn't my mom want to show you something?

434
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,930
She must be looking for your treasure.

435
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,660
I don't know where we kept it.

436
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,140
What is this?

437
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,500
Your son has figured it out.

438
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,900
What tickets are these?

439
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,260
David's? The magician?

440
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,660
No, it is an exhibition.

441
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,140
Luo Meijuan.

442
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,700
Magician.

443
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,250
Where did you get this?

444
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,700
I saw it in your room.

445
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,300
David Hawkney's art exhibition?

446
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,730
Not magic?

447
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,380
For us?

448
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,859
Why would it be for you?

449
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:18,500
Hey–

450
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,700
Are you going to the art exhibition

451
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,700
with Tian Limei's daughter?

452
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,500
Mom, stop talking nonsense.

453
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,130
She doesn't know how art.

454
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,500
You should take her to a movie

455
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,220
or play a round of Who Dun It,

456
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,700
or escape room.

457
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,740
Who said I'm taking her out?

458
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,500
Don't talk nonsense.

459
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,140
Who are you taking then?

460
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,260
I'm not interested in her in any way.

461
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
She's just my colleague.

462
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,500
Interests can be cultivated.

463
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,740
You didn't like drawing when you were young.

464
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,500
Didn't you suddenly become interested

465
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,940
in art when you were in second grade?

466
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,580
I just...

467
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,100
I'll go cut this.

468
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,210
-I was influenced by others.
-I'm not eating.

469
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,500
I'm not eating. I'm leaving soon.

470
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,140
I have to cut even if you're not eating.

471
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,660
Alright, I'm going to stop talking to you about this.

472
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,100
Bing.

473
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,180
You are his leader.

474
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,300
Mom, she's not my leader.

475
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,180
She's still a senior.

476
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,940
You are his leader and senior.

477
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,900
Take more care of him.

478
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,900
This kid seems to be one screw loose.

479
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,020
He's 26 years old and still isn't dating.

480
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,340
There are many people in your company.

481
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,380
Help him keep a look out

482
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,580
and introduce him to anyone you deem suitable.

483
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:17,980
Sure.

484
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,620
Luo Meijuan,

485
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,700
don't go to my room to rummage through my things again, okay?

486
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,500
I didn't.

487
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,250
I saw it when I went to get the photo album.

488
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,530
You can't wrong me.

489
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
He looked like a girl when he was young.

490
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,300
Let me show you.

491
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,940
That's enough, Mom.

492
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,020
Look.

493
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,500
Doesn't he look like a girl?

494
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,100
He's so fashionable.

495
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,500
Yes, this one.

496
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,300
It doesn't look like it, but it looks good from the side.

497
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,220
Let me show you one more.

498
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,860
The one with a red hat.

499
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,900
This was when I went on a trip with his dad.

500
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,420
We went to play.

501
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,500
Wasn't it fun?

502
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,540
Look at this white hat.

503
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,500
This is so cute.

504
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,500
Isn't it cute?

505
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,540
Look.

506
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,500
This one is so cute.

507
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,060
That's enough.

508
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,380
He's getting more and more handsome.

509
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:58,700
So handsome.

510
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,800
[The design of care]

511
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,980
[The design of care]

512
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,580
He told me two hours ago

513
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,860
that Director Jian is coming for dinner.

514
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,420
Director Jian!

515
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,780
Hello, you're off work?

516
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,780
My mom has bought the vegetables.

517
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,460
Ten years ago,

518
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,620
you didn't know Young Sheng.

519
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,700
She did.

520
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,180
I've done a lot of research for the commercial.

521
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,220
Yang, you've met your lady luck.

522
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,580
Yes, Director Jian takes good care of me.

523
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,060
She doesn't know how art.

524
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,460
You should take her to a movie.

525
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,180
I'm not interested in her.

526
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,820
You are his leader.

527
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,900
Mom, she's not my leader.

528
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,820
She's still a senior.

529
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,700
There are many people at your company.

530
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,660
Introduce him if there's someone suitable.

531
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,490
Hello?

532
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,420
Red Hat Boy.

533
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,380
What can I do for you?

534
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,860
Well...

535
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,780
It's nothing much.

536
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,540
I'll hang up if there's nothing.

537
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,420
There is!

538
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,380
I just want to ask

539
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,180
you didn't take

540
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,460
what my mom said today seriously, right?

541
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,260
Which part?

542
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,420
Well,

543
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,140
to set me up with someone.

544
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,900
Oh.

545
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,100
Also,

546
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,980
to take my colleague to the art exhibition.

547
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:42,860
Oh.

548
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,780
What does "oh" mean?

549
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,450
"Oh" means I remember it now.

550
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,540
Are you going to introduce people to me?

551
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,980
Do you need me to introduce people to you?

552
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,180
I don't want it.

553
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,850
There's no need.

554
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,730
Also,

555
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,460
that colleague and I,

556
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,300
we are really just–

557
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,220
Sheng Yang.

558
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,570
I'm watching a sample film.

559
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,500
I...

560
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,100
Am I interrupting you?

561
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,220
No, no.

562
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,420
I...

563
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,100
I have a work call to answer.

564
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,380
Go to bed early.

565
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,380
Good night.

566
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,060
Good night.

567
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,700
Good night.

568
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,060
Here are the tickets you gave me.

569
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,980
I had something to do on Saturday,

570
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,260
but I declined it.

571
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,700
Also, next time, can you...

572
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,660
Can you not ask your mom to give it to my mom?

573
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,460
We know each other well.

574
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,340
We don't need to do this.

575
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,900
My mom?

576
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,100
Your mom?

577
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,460
That ticket.

578
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,260
This is for you.

579
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,490
No...

580
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,330
My mom?

581
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,060
My mom?

582
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,250
You planned to take Ms. Jian

583
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,860
to the art exhibition, right?

584
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,340
You keep saying you have something to do on Saturday.

585
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,860
So that's what it was.

586
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,140
That's not the point, okay?

587
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,340
Why is that ticket

588
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,820
with Pan Rou now?

589
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,300

590
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:06,810
You...

591
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,460
really like Jian Bing, right?

592
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,100
The tickets for the exhibition are expensive, right?

593
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,620
I just happened to buy it.

594
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,530
I thought she would like the artist.

595
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,570
I didn't think too much.

596
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,660
I just bought them.

597
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,060
You didn't think much, so you bought two.

598
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,740
Why aren't you bringing me then?

599
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,790
I...

600
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,060
David Hawkney.

601
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,820
I like his paintings.

602
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,820
I think reading more books is helpful with design.

00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,210
Let me ask you a few questions.

607
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,220
Think about it.

608
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,500
Does your heart beat faster when you see her?

609
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,490
"I really love you."

610
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,140
Do you miss her if you don't see her?

611
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,860
Is she the first person you want to tell

612
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,300
when there's something happy?

613
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,260
When there's something upsetting,

614
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,340
would you want her to comfort you?

615
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,860
Many people think

616
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,780
I'm already 36. I shouldn't get a divorce.

617
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,900
But I got the divorce anyway.

618
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,780
What's there to be afraid of?

619
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,220
Now that you mention it,

620
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,020
it's not scary anymore.

621
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,380
Are you happy to see her smile?

622
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,570
Are you sad to see her cry?

623
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,290
Last question.

624
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,620
Are you nervous and jealous

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,620

626
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,660

00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,580
-just–
-Stop.

628
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,460
I got it.

629
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,980

00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,820
Okay. Start.

679
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
You're still not eating it?

680
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,460
It's cold.

681
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,700
I'm not hungry.

682
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,980
She is good.

683
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,460
She's more natural.

684
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,820
Are there more?

685
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,700
There's more.

Next person.

687
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,220
Hello.

688
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,820
Thank you.

689
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,660
Shen Yang has something on

690
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,260
and he can't came.

691
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,930
So he sent me to watch the art exhibition with you.

692
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,980
He also said

693
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,900
to treat you to a meal after the exhibition.

694
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,500
He has already transferred the money for dinner to me.

695
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,900
No, why?

696
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,940
It's the same if I see it with you.

697
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,900
Otherwise, your makeup will be wasted.

698
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,140
Let me give you a simple explanation.

699
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,020
David Hawkney.

700
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,020
British.

701
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,100
Born in 1937.

702
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,220
Now he's called the British art Godfather.

703
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,700
When he was 11 years old,

704
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,940
he already knew that he wanted to be an artist.

705
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,140
He was already famous at 26.

706
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,820
David Hawkney

707
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,090
is as famous as Andy Wharl.

708
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,220
He is a famous artist in the art industry.

709
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,770
I don't think we can take photos in an art exhibition.

710
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,260
What did I come for if I can't take photos here?

711
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,490
My makeup will be in vain.

712
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,460
If Sheng Yang came with you,

713
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,900
would you still take selfies here?

714
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,340
If Sheng Yang came,

715
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,340
he wouldn't be reading off the Wikipedia page.

716
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,340
Sis,

717
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,060
I didn't want you to be bored.

718
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,420
Do you think I'm willing to come?

719
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,700
Then you can leave.

720
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,020
Listen.

721
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,300
Sheng Yang begged me to come.

722
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,420
You're so interesting.

723
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,060
It's like everyone has to simp for you.

724
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,340
I started doing makeup at 7 a.m.

725
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:32,740
Foundation, blush, eye shadow,

726
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,860
highlights, contour.

727
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,140
The mascara I used is the most expensive one too.

728
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,420
I even made my hair.

729
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,260
I did my nails and sprayed perfume.

730
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,500
He didn't come just like that.

731
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,420
How could he do that to me and my makeup?

732
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,420
He has something important to do.

733
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,900
He go to check out the venue.

734
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,260
He just doesn't want to come to the exhibition with me.

735
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,420
See, you knew.

736
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,100
Why did you agree to come then?

737
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,220
I just wanted to give it a try.

738
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,810
Then you...

739
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,130
Don't look so upset.

740
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,420
If not people would think

741
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,940
I did something to you.

742
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,420
You are bullying me.

743
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,220
You two ganged up to bully me together.

744
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,140
No, why would we bully you?

745
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,740
No, no, don't go.

746
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,740
What are you doing?

747
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,380
My bag.

748
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,140
Your bag

749
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,420
is not of a very good quality...

750
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,340
I don't think I–

751
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,420
Sorry, I was wrong.

752
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,700
I...

753
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,300
I'll buy you a new one, okay?

754
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,140
No need.

755
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:02,180
Did you want to use this bag

756
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,860
to scam Sheng Yang?

757
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,460
Are you trying to blackmail?

758
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,260
I'm just kidding.

759
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,850
Don't be angry, okay?

760
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,659
By the way,

761
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,659
I also prepared milk tea for you.

762
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,699
Drink something sweet to cheer yourself up.

763
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:18,250
Here.

764
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,820
Who wants your stupid milk tea?

765
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,530
Come on.

766
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,420
It's just a bag.

767
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,659
I'll pay for it.

768
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,420
Be careful, Shan.

769
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,139
Xue, you should drink more today.

770
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:38,940
I drank a lot.

771
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,380
The atmosphere is great today.

772
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,739
You should spend more time with me.

773
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:42,659
Okay.

774
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,460
Can you go by yourself?

775
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,060
Of course.

776
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,820
Be careful.

777
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,780
Slow down.

778
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,340
Slowly, your hair.

779
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,260
Okay.

780
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,210
Are you feeling better?

781
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,020
Let's go.

782
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,660
Wait.

783
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,780
Be careful.

784
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,940
Take it easy.

785
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,250
You drank so much.

786
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,140
Be careful.

787
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,420
Here.

788
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,300
Who are you?

789
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,060
Who are you?

790
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,260
This is my wife.

791
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,020
Wife?

792
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,420
Go back first.

793
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,420
I will contact you.

794
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,220
Okay.

795
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,020
What are you doing?

796
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,940
Mr. Xue, who is this?

797
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,290
I'm his wife.

798
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,940
Scum!

799
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,700
What did you say just now?

800
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:17,660
What did you

801
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,820
say just now?

802
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,220
You are my what?

803
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,700
You are my what?

804
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,940
You go first.

805
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,700
You first.

806
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,260
I said, you first.

807
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,660
You first.

808
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,180
You first!

809
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,180
You first.

810
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,220
I'll get another room.

811
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,660
Let's talk alone.

812
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,340
Let's go.

813
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,940
No, I really don't want to go.

814
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,660
-Hurry up.
-I really don't want to go.

815
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,660
I...

816
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,060
I beg you.

817
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,940
We're already here. Hurry up.

818
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,060
Let go! Let go!

819
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,460
It's only right to pay the debt.

820
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,900
Hello, sir and miss. Please come in.

821
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,180
I broke your bag.

822
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,220
I have to buy you another one.

823
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,380
Hello, sir and miss.

824
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,020
Hello.

825
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,660
I want to buy her...

826
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:13,980
a bag.

827
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,580
You can take a look here.

828
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,010
These are all our new products for this season.

829
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,820
What skin is this?

830
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,690
Sheep skin.

831
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,530
Sheep skin.

832
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,660
How much is it?

833
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,460
11,000 yuan.

834
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,540
It's 11,000 yuan.

835
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,340
How much?

836
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,180
11,000 yuan.

837
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,580
She doesn't seem to like it.

838
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,740
Look over here then.

839
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,340
Okay.

840
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,540
Is this okay? It's similar to your size.

841
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,820
So tacky.

842
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,900
She thinks it's tacky.

843
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,220
What about this?

844
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,140
Hello, sir.

845
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,100
Have some water.

846
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,060
I don't need water. I brought my own.

847
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,900
Thank you.

848
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:58,860
Thank you.

849
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,540
Old Hen,

850
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,660
the water here is free.

851
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,820
I know.

852
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,890
Bring me that water.

853
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,540
Do you like this?

854
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,180
Will you buy me whatever I like?

855
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,180
Just buy it. It's not like I don't make money.

856
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,500
I like everything.

857
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,500
Buy them all for me.

858
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,420
Are you crazy?

859
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,140
You're not my girlfriend. Such wishful thinking.

860
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,460
How about this one? Take a look.

861
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,820
This is not bad.

862
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,020
I want this one.

863
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,780
Sir, this bag is 16,800 yuan.

864
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,690
Are you sure?

865
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,380
Yes.

866
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,740
Sure.

867
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,460
I'll get you a new one.

868
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,900
Do you like it?

869
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,540
What are you doing?

870
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,780
I don't want to take advantage of you.

871
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,100
I don't want to take advantage of you either.

872
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,300
How about these pants?

873
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,340
2,000 yuan.

874
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,020
XXL. It suits you.

875
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,860
Take it.

876
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,130
This belt suits you.

877
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,300
It suits a petty person like you.

878
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,740
This scarf is good.

879
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,780
It suits a rich and pretty girl like you.

880
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,860
These glasses

881
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,700
are suitable for blind people like you.

882
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,060
Use more perfume.

883
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,180
Otherwise, others will know you don't take a shower.

884
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:48,900
What are you saying?

885
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,620
I shower every day, okay?

886
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,140
This tiny bag

887
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,570
suits a stupid and rich girl like you.

888
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,540
How am I stupid?

889
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,650
Aren't you?

890
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,180
Sir.

891
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,980
What?

892
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,060
Do you want

893
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,010
all of these?

894
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,780
Pack them up.

895
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:04,820
Sir,

896
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,700
do you have to pay everything separately?

897
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,220
Yes.

898
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,780
Use my card.

899
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,690
Pay separately.

900
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,140
Can we split it later?

901
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,260
It's already embarrassing to come shopping with you.

902
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,660
Thank you.

903
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,940
It's 40,828 yuan in total.

904
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,700
Wait a minute.

905
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,900
What do you want?

906
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,700
Give me the receipt.

907
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,060
I'll transfer the money to you now.

908
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,140
I don't want to transfer it later.

909
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,380
Give it to me.

910
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,580
Don't blame me if I transferred less.

911
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,460
Mom?

912
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,140
Did you lose your wallet?

913
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,900
The bank just called me

914
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,740
saying there was an abnormal transaction on your credit card.

915
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,300
You spent over tens of thousands.

916
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,260
What happened?

917
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,660
I was shopping.

918
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,460
Didn't you go to the art exhibition with Sheng Yang?

919
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,900
His mother said he's home.

920
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,660
Why aren't you back yet?

921
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,020
I went shopping, so he went back first.

922
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,300
Are you out of your mind?

923
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,780
How much do you earn a month?

924
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,980
Yet you spent tens of thousands on shopping.

925
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,700
Should I cancel your credit card?

926
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,260
You didn't even tell me.

927
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,500
You're getting more and more willful.

928
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,060
Mom, can you stop talking?

929
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,050
Come home now.

930
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:28,980
I want to see

931
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,420
what you bought.

932
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,940
Are you okay?

933
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,060
I think...

934
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,380
How about

935
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,100
we return it?

936
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,820
This is done.

937
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,260
The sunglasses are refunded.

938
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:58,780
Okay.

939
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,180
The belt is returned.

940
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,140
This black bag.

941
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:04,900
Wait.

942
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,660
I won't return this.

943
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,540
The bag isn't refunded.

944
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,330
Okay.

945
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:19,700
And this.

946
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,860
Wait.

947
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,580
I'm not refunding this too.

948
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,780
The white tee is not refunded too.

949
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,900
Okay.

950
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,300
Okay.

951
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,180
Director, look.

952
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,900
This is the shooting order for tomorrow.

953
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,210
Do you need any adjustments made?

954
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,540
There's nothing to adjust.

955
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,260
You do it. I'm a little tired today.

956
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,380
OK.

957
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,130
Your student is here.

958
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,180
Okay, I'm leaving.
