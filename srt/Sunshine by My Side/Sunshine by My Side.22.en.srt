4
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,220
This way.

5
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,020
How is it?

6
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:38,979
Your seats are here.

7
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,780
We're at a high place again.

8
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,050
Isn't the view nice?

9
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,700
I knew it.

10
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,500
If you shout again, I'll pretend not to know you.

11
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,220
I can't help it.

12
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,660
Who brought this person?

13
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,020
Take him away.

14
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,940
I feel better just by standing here.

15
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:06,700
Let's eat.

16
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,250
Here.

17
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,660
Have a seat.

18
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,460
Thank you.

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,660
Wine list.

20
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,900
Such an expensive restaurant.

21
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,010
That's why I picked it.

22
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,660
Are you buying?

23
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,340
I'll order then.

24
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,900
Order whatever you want.

25
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,610
Order the most expensive one.

26
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,780
Okay.

27
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,980
Let's have a look at the wine.

28
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,540
But I don't know anything about wine.

29
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,100
How about...

30
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,860
You don't know anything about it?

31
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,460
Then pick something expensive.

32
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,860
Alright. Let's get the expensive one.

33
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,060
What’s wrong, Lin?

34
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,850
Hello, Ms. Jian.

35
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,260
Come back quickly.

36
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,740
Something happened in the studio.

37
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,220
What happened?

38
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,380
The miniature city landscape that we're shooting tomorrow collapsed.

39
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,420
It collapsed?

40
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,060
You better come back quickly.

41
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,380
Okay.

42
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,220
I...

43
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,580
I need to go back to the studio.

44
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,460
I think there was an accident

45
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,650
with the miniature city landscape I'm shooting tomorrow.

46
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,660
Let's go back then.

47
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,420
Then we'll put this dinner on hold?

48
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,100
Yes.

49
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,220
Let's go. I'll go back with you.

50
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,980
We have to go fast.

51
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,980
I have to shoot this tomorrow.

52
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,820
Don't worry. There must be a way.

53
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,890
I'm really sorry.

54
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,340
Something urgent came up at work.

55
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,700
Don't rush over.

56
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,980
I still have two kilometers to go.

57
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,620
Yes.

58
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,780
How about we meet next time?

59
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,220
I'm almost there.

60
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,540
Sorry. Let's just cancel this time.

61
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,500
Are you serious? Did something really come up?

62
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,570
I didn't mean to be late.

63
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,060
I was stuck in traffic.

64
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,340
Why don't you wait a little longer?

65
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,180
I don't think so.

66
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,780
What do you mean?

67
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,860
Don't you have any manners?

68
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,940
What do I tell my parents when I get back?

69
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,180
I drove all the way here.

70
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,460
I didn't even get to meet you.

71
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,420
Whose fault is that?

72
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,740
Couldn't you have left earlier if you knew there'd be a traffic jam?

73
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,650
Were you ever late for meetings with your boss?

74
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,460
You left her waiting for you all night.

75
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,580
Are you kidding me?

76
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,690
Who are you?

77
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,340
Who am I?

78
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,460
I'm the waiter.

79
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,250
I've been topping up her drinks all night.

80
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,620
Now the restaurant is closing soon.

81
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,860
Listen.

82
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,500
This lady has manners,

83
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,660
that's why she's not telling you this.

84
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,170
You should know who's at fault.

85
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,300
Are you crazy?

86
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,860
-Why are you meddling as a waiter? -Am I crazy?

87
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,500
Who's meddling?

88
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,020
Alright.

89
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,700
Let Pan Rou answer the phone.

90
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,290
Mr. Lu,

91
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,170
we are not suitable for each other.

92
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,820
Let's just forget it.

93
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,380
Let's not meet again.

94
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,060
I'll tell my mom that we're not compatible.

95
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,820
Please tell your parents as well.

96
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,860
Hello?

97
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,659
Feeling better?

98
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,380
Not bad.

99
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,140
He's not the weirdest one I've ever met.

100
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,020
But now that this has happened,

101
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,940
will your mom scold you

102
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,380
when you get back later?

103
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,659
Of course.

104
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,620
But I also experienced

105
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,810
how it feels to be stood up all night.

106
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,740
Lift.

107
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,300
Slow down please.

108
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,860
Be careful.

109
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,620
Look out for the buildings.

110
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:01,850
Slow down.

111
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,690
To the right.

112
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,260
Okay.

113
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,220
Go that way.

114
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,540
How did this happen?

115
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,220
The boom lift operator made a mistake

116
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,300
and smashed our model

117
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,540
while they were hanging the lights.

118
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,220
Director,

119
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,180
we have to redo it.

120
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,300
Can our shooting be postponed?

121
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,940
We can't make it in time for tomorrow.

122
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,420
Are you kidding me?

123
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,820
The contract clearly stated the time to hand in our footage.

124
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,980
But it's broken beyond repair,

125
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,140
and there's only the two of us here.

126
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,900
Let's just start repairing first, okay?

127
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,740
Okay, let's go.

128
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,420
How could there be such a mistake?

129
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,380
Qin,

130
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,980
do you have anyone that

131
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,460
can make miniature landscapes?

132
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,659
Something happened to my landscapes,

133
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,460
and we're in a hurry.

134
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,220
Director Jian,

135
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,180
I took art landscaping

136
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,420
as a subject during university too.

137
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,980
I also made similar models.

138
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,620
Can I try?

139
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,659
Really?

140
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,570
Can I?

141
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,860
Of course. That's one more person to help.

142
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,100
Okay.

143
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:58,940
Lin. Lin.

144
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,540
Come on.

145
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,780
Bring me the storyboard.

146
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,860
Let's see if there's anything we can shoot first tomorrow.

147
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,620
Coming.

148
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,700
Sir,

149
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,780
do you have glue?

150
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,460
Here.

151
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,340
And brushes?

152
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,980
Bruses.

153
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:20,900
Here.

154
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,540
Here you are.

155
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,580
Old hen.

156
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,500
Why are you always single?

157
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,020
Who says I'm always single?

158
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,780
Speak properly.

159
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,420
Although you often flirt with girls online,

160
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,100
in real life,

161
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,140
I've never really seen you have a girlfriend.

162
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,780
Because no one likes me in real life.

163
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,290
All girls in real life are realistic.

164
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,260
Say,

165
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,540
why,

166
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,300
do boys seldom chase girls nowadays?

167
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,020
Because dating is too tiring.

168
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,260
You need to spend time and effort

169
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,940
to understand a girl.

170
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,460
Buy her dinner,

171
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,370
bring her shopping.

172
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,060
Send her red envelopes and gifts any occasion, big or small.

173
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,140
You have to cheer her up when she's happy,

174
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,620
even more when she's unhappy.

175
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,580
Right?

176
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,460
I mgiht as well go play games,

177
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,860
or watch a livestream.

178
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,820
Look at me.

179
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,620
If it's me chasing you,

180
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,700
will you say yes?

181
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,060
I...

182
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,220
It depends.

183
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,660
Then both of us will stay single.

184
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,500
Why don't we form a Lone Warrior Alliance?

185
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,860
What alliance?

186
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,380
"Lonely but brave warriors aiming to live on“ Alliance.

187
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,340
Speaking of alliance,

188
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,420
I'm reminded that

189
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,340
the matter with team leader hasn't been solved yet.

190
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,050
Can you try and get his phone?

191
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,380
Maybe we can find some evidence from it.

192
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,860
I'd like to too.

193
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,900
We also still need to

194
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,340
check the mall's CCTV.

195
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,900
What if,

196
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,100
we stir the waters,

197
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,420
and let him know that someone is trying to investigate this matter?

198
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,010
You mean

199
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,980
we try and bait him?

200
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,620
Yes.

201
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,340
Ms. Jian.

202
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,460
Director Xue and Shanshan are here.

203
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,220
Jian Bing.

204
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,100
How is it? Can we still shoot?

205
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,620
I'm working on it inside.

206
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,299
I don't know if it can be fixed by tomorrow.

207
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,940
If it doesn't work, just shoot it anyway.

208
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,299
We can just use special effects during post production.

209
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,420
Do you need me to inform the brand?

210
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,100
No need.

211
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,620
Let's see what can we do tomorrow.

212
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,010
I'll go in and take a look.

213
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,180
No need.

214
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,620
You two go back.

215
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,060
I'll stay here and monitor the progress.

216
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,020
We're not leaving. We'll accompany you.

217
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,300
No.

218
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,460
What's the use of you two here?

219
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,980
You go back to sleep.

220
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,060
I'll stay here to watch.

221
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,940
How are you going to shoot tomorrow

222
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,180
if you pull an all-nighter now?

223
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:05,860
He's right.

224
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,060
It's not like I haven't pulled any all-nighters before.

225
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,500
Are you still mad at me?

226
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,140
For an outsider? Surely not?

227
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,220
Even I'm not angry anymore.

228
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,700
Go back then.

229
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,900
Didn't we agree

230
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
to manage our own projects?

231
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,420
No one will interfere with each other.

232
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,420
Shouldn't we start implementing it?

233
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
I'm not interfering.

234
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,300
Let me help you.

235
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,500
I'll go in and take a look.

236
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,460
I just want to talk to everyone,

237
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,620
then I'll be relieved.

238
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,460
Xue,

239
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,300
as Jian Bing said, it's her project.

240
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,140
Besides, this isn't her first time handling something that gone wrong.

241
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,300
She can do it herself.

242
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,820
Don't make trouble here.

243
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,380
What do you mean?

244
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,460
Every time there's a problem at the scene,

245
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,780
I'm the one handling it.

246
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,380
Don’t tell me

247
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,260
Sheng Yang is inside again.

248
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,100
He really is inside?

249
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,100
I'll wait for you in the car.

250
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,060
It's a little cold here.

251
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,660
What? You guys

252
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,620
are inseparable now?

253
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,260
You even brought him here?

254
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,060
What do you mean?

255
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,490
Are you jealous?

256
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,060
Why would I be jealous?

257
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,180
For an outsider?

258
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,660
I don't know what's wrong with me too.

259
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,100
So annoying.

260
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,500
If it's not jealousy then watch yourself.

261
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,620
I'm not the one

262
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,900
that's running along with you now.

263
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,410
It's time to change.

264
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,060
Liang Shanshan has been waiting for you for so many years.

265
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,140
Fine.

266
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,380
I understand now.

267
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,900
You've made up your mind.

268
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,340
You're just gonna

269
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,020
run with him from now on.

270
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,540
[Purification Color Board]

271
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:16,980
Do you think

272
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,420
that young man is Director Jian's younger brother?

273
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,650
What? Director Jian has a younger sister.

274
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,900
Doesn't she have a younger brother?

275
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,980
I thought it's a younger brother?

276
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,620
She has a younger sister. I've met her before.

277
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,300
I thought Director Jian stayed so long tonight

278
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,660
because of her brother.

279
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,340
She never used to stay so late with us before.

280
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,380
Yes.

281
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,980
Young man,

282
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,940
your skills are good.

283
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,060
You have to work hard.

284
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,740
Try to overtake us in the future.

285
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,010
Hurry up.

286
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,450
Okay.

287
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,100
Ms. Jian,

288
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,380
the supper you asked me to buy is here.

289
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,060
I'll put it here.

290
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,620
Okay.

291
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,340
Sheng Yang.

292
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,620
You didn't have dinner earlier

293
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,900
and you've been working for so long.

294
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,220
Aren't you hungry?

295
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,260
It's fine, I'm not hungry.

296
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,660
Then do you want coffee?

297
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,140
Just leave it there.

298
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,980
I'll drink it myself later.

299
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,420
I'll put it here. Don't forget.

300
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,980
I'll put the food over there by the monitor.

301
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,340
Come and eat if you're hungry.

302
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:33,980
Okay.

303
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,620
Lin.

304
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,420
You can leave. You don’t have to stay here.

305
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,820
I'm fine. I'm not tired.

306
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,180
Ms. Jian, I'll stay here with you.

307
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,340
You can leave now.

308
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,340
We have a shooting tomorrow.

309
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,500
We can't all stay up late.

310
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:28,940
Okay.

311
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,700
I'll leave now.

312
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
Ms. Jian, don’t work too hard.

313
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,820
Lin,

314
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,740
If we can't fix everything by tomorrow,

315
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,300
we'll film the 26th scene first.

316
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,740
Okay, I'll inform everyone

317
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,020
to get ready when they're here.

318
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,420
Okay.

319
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,780
I'll leave now.

320
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:14,980
Sir,

321
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,220
do you have any 400 grit sandpaper?

322
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:17,690
400?

323
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,420
Yes.

324
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:18,860
Let me find it for you.

325
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,220
Give me the 600 grit and the 800 grit too.

326
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,140
Okay, here's the 400 grit.

327
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,860
Thank you.

328
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,060
Director Jian.

329
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,980
I think it'll take some time to finish this.

330
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,770
Why don't you go home and rest first?

331
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,380
You still have to shoot tomorrow.

332
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,580
I can't sleep even if I go back.

333
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,130
Besides, I'm the director.

334
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,820
I have to stay  here and monitor everything.

335
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,260
I'll keep you company.

336
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,180
You're right.

337
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,850
Well,

338
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,730
take a rest on the sofa.

339
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,740
Are you tired? Take a rest.

340
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,980
Me? I'm not tired.

341
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,980
I'll go back to work then.

342
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,780
Okay.

343
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,060
Thank you.

344
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:25,820
It's okay.

345
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,420
Sir.

346
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,060
How is it?

347
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,980
I think we're almost done.

348
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,660
Yes, almost done.

349
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,540
Thank you, young man.

350
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,860
It's fine.

351
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,100
Alright.

352
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,770
I'll ask the director to come over.

353
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,220
Okay.

354
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,500
Director Jian.

355
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,420
Director Jian.

356
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,140
It's fixed.

357
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,460
Do you want to take a look?

358
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,140
Really?

359
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,180
Really?

360
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,620
How is it?

361
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,420
Is it okay?

362
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,340
Oh my god.

363
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,940
Director,

364
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,820
it's all thanks to this young man.

365
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,730
Otherwise, we wouldn't have been able to finish it.

366
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,770
No, no.

367
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,780
You flatter me.

368
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,780
Thank you.

369
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,260
-Thank you, director.-Thank you, director.

370
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,020
Thank you, director,

371
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,980
for staying up all night with us.

372
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,940
My dream came true after a nap.

373
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,420
You're so reliable.

374
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,820
Thank you.

375
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,060
I’m very glad I could help you.

376
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,500
Lin,

377
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,780
the shooting today

378
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,220
we'll proceed as planned.

379
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,420
Thank you.

380
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,020
Well,

381
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,660
go home and rest.

382
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,540
Okay.

383
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,940
I'll get going then.

384
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,420
Do you need a ride?

385
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,220
It's okay.

386
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,500
I can go back by myself.

387
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,020
Thank you.

388
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,660
I'll get going then.

389
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,580
Good luck with your shooting today, Director Jian.

390
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,620
Thank you.

391
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,260
See you.

392
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,620
Dress properly.

393
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,220
It's okay.

394
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:52,940
Bye.

395
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,700
Bye.

396
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,220
Wash your face first when you get back.

397
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,340
Our son is back.

398
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:48,820
Dad.

399
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,420
Mom.

400
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,770
I brought you breakfast.

401
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,100
My dear. Where have you been?

402
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,340
What happened to you?

403
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,060
You didn't come back all night.

404
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,180
Did you go on a date or go digging in a mine?

405
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,100
I went out to help my friend.

406
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,780
What help did you give for you to be like this?

407
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,140
Isn't this too much?

408
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,660
Mom, don't worry.

409
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,300
I'm happy I could help her.

410
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,540
Alright, let's stop here.

411
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,620
I'm going to go in and lie down.

412
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,890
Eat something before you go.

413
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:19,340
Eat something before you go.

414
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,620
Have the breakfast yourselves.

415
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,580
You...

416
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,180
You...

417
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,180
Aren't you going to wash your face?

418
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,460
I've never seen him so tired even for work.

419
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,010
Put something on him.

420
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,460
He's just going to sleep like this?

421
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,020
At least he has a heart,

422
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,820
and brought us breakfast.

423
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,260
He really fell asleep?

424
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,100
Silly boy.

425
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,820
Just leave it ajar.

426
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,570
What are you doing? Why not make more noise?

427
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,300
Steam the egg when he wakes up.

428
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,900
Take this over.

429
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,980
I want to eat the breakfast my son bought.

430
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,260
Do it yourself.

431
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,220
Bring me two pairs of chopsticks.

432
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,420
Be gentle.

433
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,500
Eat up.

434
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,900
Where did he go to?

435
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,820
Stop looking. He's asleep.

436
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,900
What's there to see?

437
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,180
None of your business.

438
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,660
I just want to watch him a little longer.

439
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,820
Lie down there and watch.

440
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,780
Watching him won't wake him up.

441
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,020
Hurry up and eat.

442
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,900
Why are you so annoying?

443
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:25,900
Delicious.

444
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,660
My son bought delicious food.

445
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,580
Then don't eat my food anymore.

446
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,700
[Jian Bing: Thank you, Sheng Yang.]

447
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,650
[Jian Bing: You're now an official member of this project. I've introduced you to the whole team. Thank you.]

448
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,860
I'll adjust it.

449
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,100
Director,

450
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,060
I just sent the photos to the art department.

451
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,060
What did Zheng say?

452
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,460
He's saying he wants to come,

453
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,460
to see the person.

454
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,820
What do you mean? Is he not satisfied?

455
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,460
No.

456
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,700
He thinks it's too good.

457
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,180
He wants to thank him in person.

458
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,180
Finish your sentences properly.

459
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,540
See him in person…

460
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,020
It's too late. He went back.

461
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,810
Next time.

462
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,340
Okay.

463
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,620
I'll go now.

464
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,460
Let's start shooting when you're ready.

465
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:14,740
Okay.

466
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,300
We're already half an hour late.

467
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,050
Are we done now?

468
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,260
-Yes. -Okay.

469
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,130
Okay.

470
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,460
Lin, what are we waiting for?

471
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,820
We're ready.

472
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,780
We can start, director.

473
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,540
Director, it's done.

474
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,900
Okay, director.

475
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,610
Okay.

476
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,020
Okay. Action.

477
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,700
Action.

478
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,420
Record.

479
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,460
Start.

480
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:52,780
Hello.

481
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,020
I'm the client manager of July Advertising.

482
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,180
Hello.

483
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,500
We held an event here two weeks ago.

484
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,820
The stage collapsed then.

485
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,980
Do you remember?

486
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,260
Yes, I do.

487
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,420
I would like to have the CCTV footage of the incident.

488
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,660
Didn't we already send you the footage?

489
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,620
We have a new intern.

490
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,660
She damaged the footage by accident.

491
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,460
We would like to trouble you to give us another copy.

492
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,100
Is that okay?

493
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,900
What date was it?

494
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,500
From the 7th to the 12th.

495
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,420
Why is it gone?

496
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,820
What's going on?

497
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,620
Why is this gone?

498
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,820
Are there any backups of the file

499
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,820
from the 7th to the 12th?

500
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,620
No.

501
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:53,980
Hello?

502
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,500
All the footage is gone.

503
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,140
The workers must have

504
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,460
did it during the construction.

505
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,980
I wasn't sure before.

506
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,980
Now it's confirmed.

507
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,660
It must have something to do with Wang Youde.

508
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,980
Otherwise, there wouldn't be such a coincidence.

509
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,700
What should we do now?

510
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,290
The evidence is gone.

511
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,500
Who was in charge of the construction?

512
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,580
Can you check it for me?

513
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,820
What are you doing?

514
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:12,980
Don't worry.

515
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,260
Aren't we on the same side?

516
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,820
Do you take me as your friend?

517
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,780
What if you lose your job?

518
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,260
Justice is more important than my job.

519
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,180
Okay, cut.

520
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:38,940
We'll use this.

521
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,980
This is very good.

522
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,700
Let's get ready for the next scene.

523
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,660
Okay.

524
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,190
Hello.

525
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,820
-Adjust it.-Shanshan.

526
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,620
Are you busy?

527
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,660
Hurry up.

528
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,260
Morning, Ms. Shan.

529
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:54,940
Here.

530
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,460
This is for you.

531
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,460
Facial cleanser.

532
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,420
Towel.

533
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,060
Foundation, lipstick.

534
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,420
Cotton swabs, comb.

535
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,780
Mouthwash, and disposable toothbrush.

536
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,220
So sweet.

537
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,780
I wanted to come early in the morning.

538
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,060
But I was afraid of being a third wheel.

539
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,780
How was last night?

540
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,420
What do you mean?

541
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,460
Nothing happened

542
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,820
between you and Shengyang?

543
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,780
Something did,

544
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,620
right here,

545
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,580
in front of the two prop masters.

546
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,460
So funny.

547
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:29,780
Fine.

548
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,420
Last night,

549
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,980
Xue kept complaining

550
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,420
once he got back.

551
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,900
He insisted that you were over your head.

552
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,340
He also said

553
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,580
this kid must be coming

554
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,420
for your reputation and status.

555
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,700
Do me a favor.

556
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,020
What is it?

557
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,900
Help me

558
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,580
send some money to Sheng Yang,

559
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,620
in the name of the company.

560
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,250
He won't accept it if I give it to him.

561
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,980
He is unemployed now.

562
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,780
He worked here all night yesterday.

563
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,580
If he didn't help,

564
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,060
we won't be shooting today.

565
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,260
What's wrong?

566
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,780
You've wasted your life.

567
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,860
You know nothing about men.

568
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,900
Men are willing to do anything

569
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,620
for the woman he loves.

570
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,460
If you give him money,

571
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,940
it's like

572
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,620
slapping him with your shoes.

573
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,020
It's better to give him a sweet date.

574
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,860
I might slap you.

575
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,180
This is my scene.

576
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,180
I have an idea.

577
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,500
Since you let him participate in the project,

578
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,420
why don't you just

579
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,860
recruit him to the company?

580
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,620
Stop it.

581
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,460
He came to help

582
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,060
and Xue complained when he went back.

583
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,780
No, no.

584
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,260
There's no need to

585
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,420
to make it so complicated.

586
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,940
Who cares?

587
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,180
Zheng has acknowledged Sheng Yang.

588
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,900
He said that he will be a potential in the future.

589
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,300
Besides, our company is recruiting.

590
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,460
Why can't we let him try?

591
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,540
Don't worry.

592
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,460
If anyone in the company

593
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,500
dares to spread any gossip,

594
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,580
I'll cut off their pay for a month.

595
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,020
He studied design.

596
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,660
How can he come work as a prop tech

597
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,980
in our company?

598
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,500
Really?

599
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,820
He majored in design?

600
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,260
Great.

601
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,700
Amazing.

602
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,610
So what?

603
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,980
Can't a designer start from the bottom?

604
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,650
You are quite protective of him.

605
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,730
When did he become so good

606
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,980
in your eyes?

607
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,300
He's already quite outstanding.

608
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,010
Indeed.

609
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,460
Yesterday,

610
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,260
I took a good look at him.

611
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,780
He is really handsome.

612
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,220
Even if he

613
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,340
stands in front of

614
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,420
our company and does nothing,

615
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,460
our company's attendance rate will double.

616
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,970
Why not?

617
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,220
Good.

618
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,260
You and Sheng Yng are a good match.

619
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,700
Liang Shanshan, you're so eloquent.

620
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,250
I'm just kidding.

621
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,100
But I mean it.

622
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,290
Actually, I have my own agenda.

623
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,180
It’s good for Sheng Yang to come to the company.

624
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,260
But if you two really get together,

625
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,420
Xue will give up on you completely.

626
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,900
I know

627
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,740
you've cut ties with Xue.

628
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,730
But he hasn't

629
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,260
cut his ties with you.

630
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,460
He still has feelings for you.

631
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,820
I didn't expect

632
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,500
that I would end up like this.

633
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,300
Do you think

634
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,100
I'm being so lowly?

635
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,260
I have no choice.

636
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,250
There's no reason

637
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,820
to speak of in a relationship.

638
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,060
So you support me to be with Shengyang.

639
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,900
I support you to be with

640
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,980
anyone who can make you happy.

641
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,100
I can see that you care about him.

642
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,820
Don't worry.

643
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,860
I will

644
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,420
send him the money.

645
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,740
As well as

646
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,060
the recruitment notice.

647
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,980
I'll arrange his interview for the day after tomorrow.

648
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,660
Whether he comes or not,

649
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,220
is up to him.

650
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,260
Okay?

651
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,130
Okay.

652
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,650
Done, right?

653
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,260
We're filming now.

654
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,860
-I'll stay with you. -We're ready, director.

655
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,460
Let's start shooting.

656
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,420
Come on. Action.

657
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,820
Action.

658
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,060
Record.

659
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,380
Action.

660
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,900
We'll send you the results through email later.

661
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,020
Check it carefully.

662
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:02,660
Okay.

663
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,460
Thank you.

664
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,250
I'll go back and wait for the notice.

665
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:05,980
Okay.

666
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,980
Bye.

667
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,240
[Jian Bing]

668
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,700
[Jian Bing: Thank you, Sheng Yang. You're now an official member of this project. I've introduced you to the whole team. Thank you.]

669
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,100
[Jian Bing -How was]

670
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,960
[Jian Bing -How was your shoot today?]

671
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,500
I don't need houses, loans, and I don't swim nor work out.

672
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,980
You're quite vigilant.

673
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,780
You are...

674
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,140
Liang Shanshan.

675
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,660
The CEO of Jian Yi Advertisement Studio.

676
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,810
We met that day.

677
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,420
Sorry, Ms. Shan.

678
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,180
Hello.

679
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,170
Thanks for your help that day.

680
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,780
How about this?

681
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,100
Add me on WeChat.

682
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,300
I'll transfer you a red envelope.

683
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,860
No need.

684
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,820
I just want to help.

685
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,580
It's okay.

686
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,020
The money has nothing to do with Bing.

687
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,820
It's paid by the project.

688
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,620
Not much.

689
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,500
Take it.

690
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,820
Actually, I came to you today

691
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,060
for something else.

692
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,580
Go ahead.

693
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,420
I heard you're looking for a job.

694
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,420
Our art team is recruiting people too.

695
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,210
If you're interested,

696
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,580
come to the company tomorrow.

697
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,420
Let's talk.

698
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,300
Don't get me wrong.

699
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,219
It's not Bing that asked for you.

700
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,250
It's Zheng, the art instructor of our company,

701
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:18,980
that asked for you.

702
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,179
He wants to have a look at your skills.

703
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,420
Morning.

704
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,340
Mr. Wang.

705
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,300
your documents.

706
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:57,940
Okay.

707
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,570
Thank you.

708
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,580
Good morning.

709
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,180
Everyone.

710
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,180
Morning.

711
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,260
Old hen,

712
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,250
old wolf is ready.

713
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,220
Roger.

714
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,100
Do it properly.

715
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,490
Hello.

716
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,300
Where is foreman Wang?

717
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,060
Be careful.

718
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,570
Over there.

719
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:19,980
Okay.

720
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,420
Thank you.

721
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,460
One more.

722
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,180
One more.

723
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:24,940
Foreman Wang,

724
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,100
do you remember me?

725
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,980
You are...

726
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,540
Two weeks ago,

727
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,220
the stage collapsed

728
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,220
at the Mid-Autumn Festival Boyue Tea Party.

729
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,170
Do you remember?

730
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,420
Why are you here?

731
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,420
Here's the thing.

732
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,940
Our headquarters

733
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,780
sent me here to investigate this.

734
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,660
Well,

735
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,420
didn't you finish the investigation?

736
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:47,940
Yes.

737
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,780
But recently we found that

738
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,580
this may not be an accident,

739
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,540
but man-made.

740
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,660
Wang Youde

741
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,420
is currently under investigation.

742
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,660
If you are willing to

743
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,180
provide relevant evidence,

744
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,580
the company may consider not suing you.

745
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,420
I don't understand what you're talking about.

746
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,970
This has nothing to do with us.

747
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,010
We did everything

748
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,540
according to the blueprints you gave us.

749
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:08,500
Really?

750
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,820
Why would I lie?

751
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,570
If you want to sue me, go ahead.

752
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,260
We did nothing wrong.

753
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,300
We have nothing to say.

754
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,420
Think about it.

755
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,820
If that's the case,

756
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,500
we'll take legal procedures.

757
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,810
See you in court.

758
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,990
[Wang Jun]

759
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:47,470
Hello?

760
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,450
What is it?

761
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,020
Hello?

762
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,620
Can you hear me?

763
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,420
You...

764
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:51,860
Hello.

765
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,700
The signal is bad.

766
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,220
Find a place with better signal.

767
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,260
Wait a minute.

768
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,980
Come in.

769
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,220
What is it?

770
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,060
Team leader.

771
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,610
Please take a look at the new project.

772
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,060
You may leave.

773
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:16,540
Tell me.

774
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
Where are you?

775
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,100
I'm at the office.

776
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,580
We're approving the contract.

777
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,420
I'll send it to you tomorrow.

778
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,980
As usual when you get the money.

779
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,890
Don't always ask me to remind you.

780
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,140
I'm not talking about this.

781
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,820
Someone from your headquarters came today.

782
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,660
They said you're under investigation.

783
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,260
Wait.

784
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,020
What are you talking about?

785
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,180
What headquarters?

786
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,980
The thing last time.

787
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,060
Did you destroy all the evidence?

788
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:47,820
Wait.

789
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,460
He...

790
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,460
Who told you what?

791
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,460
How would I know who he is?

792
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,100
Well...

793
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,060
The guy

794
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,820
who came with Sheng Yang last time.

795
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,420
He is tall.

796
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,420
With a buzz cut.

797
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,620
His name is Song Chen.

798
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,340
Yes.

799
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,420
It's him.

800
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,970
What did he say?

801
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,940
He said

802
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,500
the accident

803
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,900
was not an accident, but man-made.

804
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,260
He even asked me to cooperate with the investigation.

805
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,220
I can't say anything.

806
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:14,660
I...

807
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,180
I'm calling you

808
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,580
to ask about the situation now.

809
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,660
Okay.

810
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,580
I'm glad you didn't say anything.

811
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,180
He wouldn't know.

812
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,700
I erased all the CCTV footage that day.

813
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,540
By the way,

814
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,780
will your men leak anything out?

815
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:32,820
That day,

816
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,580
I did it myself.

817
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,340
How about

818
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,460
I return the money to you first?

819
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,220
I really can't do this.

820
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,900
What if my company

821
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,700
gets involved too?

822
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,420
Are you stupid?

823
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,580
Let me tell you.

824
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,100
we are on the same boat now.

825
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,260
If something happens to me, can you run away?

826
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,180
Why are you panicking?

827
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,300
Brother.

828
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,220
He said he's going to see me in court.

829
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,260
No way. He won't know.

830
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,780
Think about it.

831
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,860
Why did he go to you instead of me?

832
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,780
That's because there's no evidence.

833
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:12,860
By the way,

834
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,900
have you deleted our chat and transfer records?

835
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,620
Delete it.

836
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,620
Delete them all.

837
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,380
Okay.

838
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,780
What if he goes to you again?

839
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,660
Just one sentence.

840
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,620

843

If someone checks,

844
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,900
I'll call you later, okay?

845
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,500
That's all.

846
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,780
Bye.

847
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,780

849
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,300
Team leader, I'm sorry.

850
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,580
I left my contract here.

851
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,780
Yes, this is it.

852

854
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,340
I'm sorry.

855
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,500
Get out.

856
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,180
Okay.

857
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:57,740
Wait.

858
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,460
Do things steadily in the future.

859
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,420
Don't be so clumsy.

860
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,580
Go.

861
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,180
