1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,350
Yang.

3
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,910
You look so pretty today, Sis.

4
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,630
I have a reunion to attend,

5
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,190
so I'll take two hours off.

6
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,470
Please take my shift for a while.

7
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,270
Okay, no problem.

8
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:50,950
Go ahead.

9
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,030
Who is this?

10
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,229
Are you really Meijuan?

11
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,870
You look so beautiful.

12
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,630
Li, don't fool me.

13
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,910
Do I really look good?

14
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,670
It's inconvenient

15
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,670
to work in this outfit.

16
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,390
This is the first time I've seen you dress up like this.

17
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,030
You look so elegant.

18
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,790
Dress like this from now on.

19
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:08,870
See you later.

20
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,590
See you.

21
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,870
Doctor.

22
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,430
I can't work with my arm like this.

23
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,870
When can I get the plaster cast removed?

24
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,750
Your wrist joint is half dislocated.

25
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,070
You can remove it yourself in a few days.

26
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,630
That's a relief.

27
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,790
Sign here, right?

28
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,270
I suggest you stay in the hospital for a few more days.

29
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,710
No, no, no.

30
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,990
I have a lot of things to do.

31
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,190
There's no family here to pick you up?

32
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,310
No need.

33
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:41,990
Look.

34
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,790
My roommate is here to show her love.

35
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,750
Okay.

36
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,829
Thank you, doctor.

37
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:47,430
Thank you.

38
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,470
I...

39
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,670
Do you need my help to walk?

40
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,390
Of course.

41
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,990
Should I

42
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,350
apologize to you as well?

43
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,070
Of course you should.

44
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,630
You never apologized in our years of marriage.

45
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,790
Make it formal.

46
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,670
Kneel here

47
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,150
and kowtow to me.

48
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,110
But are you wronged?

49
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,030
You're not.

50
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,150
Help me.

51
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,910
Look at Jian Shuang.

52
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,590
Even if she's good at accuracy since she plays ice hockey,

53
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,230
wasn't she afraid that she might beat me too hard

54
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,510
and I might become a vegetable?

55
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,670
Besides, I always treat her well.

56
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,110
Good.

57
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,670
You're still so loquacious.

58
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,670
That means you're fine.

59
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,350
When people get sick,

60
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,270
they get to know what's most important to them.

61
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,070
What is it?

62
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,750
Family.

63
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,950
Don't tell me you changed your mind about our divorce again.

64
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:47,670
No.

65
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,510
Don't.

66
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,870
Don't make it look like

67
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,470
I'm clinging to you.

68
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,030
Of course not.

69
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,670
You are not that kind of person.

70
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,710
Even if you are crippled,

71
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,590
you can still find girls ten times younger and prettier

72
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,590
than me.

73
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,350
Alright?

74
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,350
I don't even want to talk about that.

75
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,390
You see, I've been hospitalized for so many days,

76
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,030
but none of them came to see me.

77
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,710
They've all been hanging out themselves.

78
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,950
One of them even

79
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,270
called me and asked me to go

80
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,270
pay the bill for her.

81
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,430
Aren't you angry at all?

82
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,230
Isn't it interesting to hear?

83
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,829
You've already entered the state of being divorced?

84
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,710
We've long been family, haven't we?

85
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,270
But

86
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,910
if you have a girlfriend,

87
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,310
and I have a boyfriend in the future,

88
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,710
and we still treat each other as family or friends,

89
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,710
how will they feel?

90
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,030
Who cares?

91
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,909
As long as we are happy.

92
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,350
What?

93
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,950
So you've found yourself

94
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,870
a boyfriend?

95
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,150
No.

96
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,350
That brat from last time?

97
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,270
What brat?

98
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,630
Listen to me, Jian Bing.

99
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,990
Even if we're divorced,

100
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,070
we can't rush to find someone new.

101
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:49,830
Right?

102
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,190
Look at you.

103
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,710
If...

104
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,030
If you rush into a relationship unwittingly,

105
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,470
it would be irrational,

106
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:53,990
right?

107
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,310
You have to pick carefully.

108
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,830
Don't do yourself wrong.

109
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,950
Especially when it comes to age-gap relationships.

110
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,190
It's trendy now,

111
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,230
but nothing trendy lasts long,

112
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:03,470
right?

113
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,430
If you find someone younger than you,

114
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,510
who's not mature at all,

115
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,910
he'll cause you a lot of trouble in the future.

116
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,190
You are not young,

117
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,190
but are you mature?

118
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,550
No, I'm not.

119
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,030
I'm a giant baby, right?

120
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,030
So, in fact,

121
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,270
all relationships in this world

122
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,230
are age-gap relationships.

123
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,270
When do you men ever grow up?

124
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,550
If you're truly mature,

125
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,750
sign this.

126
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,190
You're so cruel.

127
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,950
I thought you were here to pick me up.

128
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,750
Turns out you're here to give me the divorce agreement.

129
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,230
It's not like that.

130
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,710
I am here

131
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,030
to pick you up.

132
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,110
I'm just dropping it off.

133
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,230
Cut it out.

134
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,390
I couldn't give it to you when you were hospitalized.

135
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,550
Next Wednesday.

136
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,150
Don't be late.

137
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,670
No. What do you mean next Wednesday?

138
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,950
Let me check my schedule first.

139
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,230
You're free.

140
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,710
Indeed.

141
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,430
No meeting, no shooting mission.

142
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,670
You've planned it for me.

143
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,670
Before you go, dress yourself up.

144
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,830
Yes.

145
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,550
The sense of ritual, right?

146
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,750
Mature people won't miss

147
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,710
important moments in life.

148
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,230
Get it signed.

149
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,190
It's inappropriate

150
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,670
if it drags on any longer.

151
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,750
Is this pearl real?

152
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,190
Of course.

153
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,350
Meijuan is here.

154
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:24,790
Meijuan.

155
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,550
Looks like Limei is late today.

156
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,030
Meijuan.

157
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,750
Your dress

158
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,070
is so beautiful.

159
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,510
You look great in it.

160
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,190
Is it?

161
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,830
My husband bought it randomly.

162
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,950
You've already ordered?

163
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,670
It was already like this when we arrived.

164
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,909
I think

165
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,950
Limei ordered it.

166
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,310
Limei

167
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,550
is rich and generous, right?

168
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,350
Yes.

169
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,630
You're not bad either.

170
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,510
I heard that your son

171
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,670
works in a big company.

172
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,950
He must make a lot.

173
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,990
No, not like that. Just to make ends meet.

174
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,070
Make ends meet.

175
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,390
Look how competent her son is.

176
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,870
Her son is so capable.

177
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,110
Limei is here.

178
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,670
Limei.

179
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,430
What took you so long?

180
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,310
Sorry, I'm late.

181
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:02,910
It's okay.

182
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,830
You even brought us gifts.

183
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,430
You're late.

184
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,910
I'm late.

185
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,310
Sorry.

186
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,190
Sorry I'm late.

187
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,030
What gift?

188
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,350
Meijuan, I brought you a gift.

189
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,950
How could I accept it?

190
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,070
It's okay. I prepared gifts for all of our classmates.

191
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,230
Hurry up. Where's mine?

192
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,230
Don't worry. You'll get yours.

193
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,110
This is for you.

194
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,510
Look at your hands.

195
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,950
They look like they've never done any manual work.

196
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,750
Look, they're so white and tender.

197
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,430
How do you take care of them?

198
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,909
Look how sweet she is.

199
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,470
All of us

200
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,430
are pretty, right?

201
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,190
Of course.

202
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,230
The color is so beautiful.

203
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,070
Isn't it?

204
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,790
Yes.

205
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,510
Meijuan.

206
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,190
By the way,

207
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,070
I want to ask you.

208
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,270
Is Sheng Yang

209
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,310
interested in

210
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,070
my daughter or not?

211
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,510
Why didn't your daughter show up at their last date?

212
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,350
She's disobedient.

213
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,670
She regrets it now.

214
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,750
How about

215
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,430
giving her another chance?

216
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,110
What do you think?

217
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,150
Meijuan.

218
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,190
Let's set another date.

219
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,070
Okay.

220
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,990
You're so nice, Meijuan.

221
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,550
How about putting these two clips

222
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,110
back to where they were before?

223
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,990
This one?

224
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,470
Yes.

225
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,830
Shanshan, thank you so much.

226
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,310
Normally,

227
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,670
you must be drinking Long Island Iced Tea

228
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,670
in a karaoke bar, right?

229
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,590
How about I make you drink?

230
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,270
Be quick.

231
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,350
We have to deliver the video tomorrow.

232
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,230
Don't fail me.

233
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,309
I dare not.

234
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,070
If I fail,

235
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,470
Director Xue will jump down from the hospital bed and hit me.

236
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,270
Is he normally so tough?

237
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,030
Of course. He's much tougher than you.

238
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,470
I'm not tough at all, okay?

239
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,870
I'm more like a gentle elder sister.

240
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,710
I'm nice enough

241
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,470
to come here and supervise video editing for him today.

242
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,830
I turned down a lot of dates for this.

243
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,630
You two are really close.

244
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,870
You must have been friends for years.

245
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,110
We were high school classmates.

246
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,110
So you were childhood sweethearts?

247
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,870
Don't use this kind of romantic word

248
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,470
on me and him.

249
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,230
I witnessed

250
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,750
him destroy countless nice women myself.

251
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,030
Ms. Liang.

252
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,070
So you don't have any dark past

253
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,110
yourself?

254
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,350
Do you want me to share it behind your back too?

255
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,870
Is the hospital's security not working?

256
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,230
Why did they let you out?

257
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,310
I have so many things to do.

258
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,470
How is it, Master Deng?

259
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,670
It's not easy to edit videos with Ms. Liang, right?

260
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,870
She has a whole lot of ideas, right?

261
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,510
What do you mean?

262
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,270
You've had a long day.

263
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,430
I'm alright.

264
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,070
No.

265
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,030
Go back home.

266
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,150
I'll edit the video here tonight.

267
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,310
I'm really okay.

268
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,070
I can carry on.

269
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,110
If you don't go, I may change my mind.

270
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,950
You'll have to stay here with me all night.

271
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,110
Hurry up.

272
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,910
I'll leave then.

273
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,390
Go back now.

274
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,110
Bye, Director.

275
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,790
-Thank you.
-Bye, Shanshan.

276
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,630
Bye. Take care.

277
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,910
I didn't expect

278
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,630
you could really sit here and edit the video.

279
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,710
Nonsense.

280
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,230
You must think it's not easy

281
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,510
drinking and socializing out there.

282
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,070
Now you know it's no easy task editing videos too, right?

283
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,190
Not really.

284
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,430
I still like socializing more.

285
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,990
I'm leaving.

286
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,670
Don't.

287
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,030
Are you free tonight?

288
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,950
A bunch of people are waiting for me.

289
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,470
Turn them down.

290
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,030
Have a drink with me here tonight.

291
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,150
Okay?

292
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,430
Fine.

293
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,830
So annoying.

294
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,670
Check out the video we edited first.

295
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,310
Sis, you're back.

296
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:48,550
Meijuan.

297
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,350
Why are you back so early?

298
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,470
I only took two hours off.

299
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,190
What happened to your dress? You looked great in it.

300
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,150
Why did you change back?

301
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,070
Did I look good?

302
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,550
Yes. You looked so pretty.

303
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,870
That's not something I should wear.

304
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,150
Why not?

305
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,150
What's wrong? Are you in a bad mood?

306
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,870
No.

307
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,390
Saying no.

308
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,750
Look how long your face is.

309
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,030
Still denying it.

310
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,830
I should have

311
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,070
applied more hand cream.

312
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,030
Purple sweet potato.

313
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,470
2 kilograms, 3.67 yuan.

314
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,030
Why four glasses?

315
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,470
Who are the other two meant for?

316
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,270
No one.

317
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,550
They're all mine.

318
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,870
I just want it to look more lively.

319
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,430
You're indeed a Gemini with blood type AB.

320
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,110
As expected.

321
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:53,630
Well.

322
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,270
You don't eat dinner, right?

323
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,750
And you should be in a bar by now, right?

324
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,510
So I prepared more wine

325
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,710
so that you can

326
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,830
drink with me without distraction.

327
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,390
Right?

328
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,510
I should thank you.

329
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,710
This first toast

330
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,230
is to thank you

331
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,030
for taking care of me while I was hospitalized.

332
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,390
Although it wasn't long,

333
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,550
you still

334
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,350
spared time to visit me.

335
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,350
And you found an old nurse

336
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,550
to take care of me.

337
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,390
Thank you.

338
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:34,830
The second toast

339
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,950
is to thank you

340
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,910
for working hard for our company all these years.

341
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:42,430
You brought in

342
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,590
the clients for us, right?

343
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,230
Our company won't be able to survive without you.

344
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,750
The third toast

345
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,670
is to thank you.

346
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,110
Liang Shanshan.

347
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:00,990
Liang.

348
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,430
Ms. Liang.

349
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,030
You've been by my side all these years.

350
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,390
As long as you're still willing to scold me, Liang,

351
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,350
I feel relieved.

352
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,750
The fourth toast...

353
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,110
I can't make up any more lines.

354
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,590
I'll just drink it up. You can drink as you wish.

355
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,190
Enough. Stop drinking.

356
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:32,950
Come on.

357
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,710
Are you really toasting to thank me?

358
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,990
You're clearly trying

359
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,390
to drown your sorrows by drinking with me.

360
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:43,950
Here.

361
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,590
Sir, you got it wrong.

362
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,750
The fruits should be weighed over there.

363
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,590
Okay.

364
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,910
Hand cream. I bought it for you.

365
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,430
Talk later.

366
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,030
The baby cabbage is 4.60 yuan.

367
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,630
Here you are.

368
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,390
Li.

369
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,350
You...

370
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,310
Why did you buy this?

371
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,670
I bought it at a discount. It's not expensive. Take it.

372
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,110
I was just saying.

373
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,430
I'm already in my 50s.

374
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,030
No one cares about that.

375
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,990
You really took it to heart.

376
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,790
You don't need to worry about Sheng Yang anymore.

377
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,230
You should focus on making yourself look good while you are still young.

378
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,430
You should apply it. Your hands need to be taken care of.

379
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,990
It smells good.

380
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,790
Not bad.

381
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,630
I'll take it then.

382
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,350
Take it.

383
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,550
By the way, I need to get some meat weighed.

384
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,910
The weekend is coming. I'll cook something nice for

385
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,950
my husband and my son.

386
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,030
No problem.

387
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,110
I've set the date with Jian Bing.

388
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,630
Next Wednesday,

389
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,990
we'll go

390
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,310
get our divorce certificates.

391
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,150
I,

392
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,510
Xue Yiming,

393
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,750
is single again.

394
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,590
Shouldn't I celebrate?

395
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,350
I, Xue Yiming, have become

396
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,710
a bird that flies freely again.

397
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,470
Shouldn't I celebrate?

398
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,230
No wonder you've been so dramatic today.

399
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,830
Why do I feel

400
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,070
so upset?

401
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,830
Why do you feel upset?

402
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,670
Why? Tell me why.

403
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,390
How would I know why?

404
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,310
You can tell yourself why.

405
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,750
When I was discharged today,

406
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:08,910
I was thinking about

407
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,510
coming here and helping you

408
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,070
get the video editing done.

409
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,990
Jian Bing.

410
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,830
I thought she was there to pick me up.

411
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,830
10000 words

412
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,870
are omitted

413
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,270
here.

414
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,910
I also felt a little dizzy.

415
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,590
I was thinking

416
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,630
maybe I should go home and take a rest.

417
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,630
Then it occurred to me that if I go home,

418
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,790
there wouldn't be anyone in such a big house.

419
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,110
Why should I go back?

420
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,310
I'd better come and work here in the company.

421
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,190
I've never thought of going home for so many years.

422
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,870
But now,

423
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,829
I don't have a home anymore.

424
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,230
What have I been doing over the past decade?

425
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,910
Besides losing hair and gaining weight,

426
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,750
what else have I done?

427
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,510
I've become all alone.

428
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,270
Can you understand how I feel?

429
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,470
Don't you still have a bunch of girls in your phone?

430
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,510
At least, you still have your drinking buddies.

431
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,710
They are all young girls.

432
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,070
They won't be willing to listen to me talking about this.

433
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,590
I can pay their bills,

434
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,190
but I can't talk to them about this.

435
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,470
How should we get along in the future?

436
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,270
So, thank you.

437
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,950
Don't touch me.

438
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,070
Thank you, Liang.

439
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,230
It hurts.

440
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,510
It should hurt.

441
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,990
Thank you

442
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,430
for drinking with me.

443
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,310
I feel so bad.

444
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,030
Give me a hug and comfort me.

445
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,390
Go away.

446
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,070
You must look down on me, seeing me like this.

447
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,990
Don't you look down on yourself?

448
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,590
Liang indeed.

449
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,390
You put a dagger directly in my heart

450
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,030
without mercy.

451
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,030
Spot on.

452
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,590
I just can't stand you

453
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,230
pretending to be affectionate and depressed here.

454
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,790
Don't you know

455
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,350
why you feel sad yourself?

456
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,950
I don't know.

457
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,630
I really don't know.

458
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,310
I just feel very sad now.

459
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,310
Then let me tell you why you feel sad now.

460
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,710
Because the one who's always cleaning up after you

461
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,030
is gone.

462
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,830
You men just want

463
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,230
to have fun outside,

464
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,990
and keep it lively at home as well.

465
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,110
You want to have people

466
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,510
that can make you happy both at home and outside.

467
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,110
You want to look glamorous on the outside,

468
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,750
and feel comfortable on the inside.

469
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,070
Don't you just want to have a shoulder to lean on when you're back home after having fun?

470
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,150
One day

471
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,390
when you lose control,

472
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,710
break down,

473
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,190
and you can't keep sailing anymore,

474
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,950
you still want there to be someone

475
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,710
at home who can

476
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,710
take care of you,

477
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,790
and let you live the rest of your life happily at an old age.

478
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,470
Right?

479
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,110
I didn't think that much.

480
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,430
Time to eat.

481
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,430
Time to eat.

482
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,070
Coming.

483
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,190
The dumplings are good.

484
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,630
Mom, give it to me.

485
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,390
You don't have to work overtime today?

486
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,670
No, I brought the work back.

487
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,030
Your team leader makes you do all the work.

488
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,990
What kind of person is he?

489
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,910
You are the one to blame.

490
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,230
Why did you name me this?

491
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,430
Sheng Yang.

492
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,590
Of course I'm like a sheep that's ready to be killed.

493
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,390
Get lost.

494
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,110
As an upright man,

495
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,550
you should count on your own efforts.

496
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,190
The dumplings are delicious. Eat more.

497
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,510
Be upright.

498
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,510
It's so hot.

499
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,230
Slowly.

500
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,070
Blow it.

501
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,790
Haven't you noticed

502
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,310
there's something different about me today?

503
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,150
Ms. Luo.

504
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,990
Aren't you afraid your dress may get dirty, cooking in it?

505
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,270
What season is it?

506
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,190
Why are you still wearing such a thin dress with short sleeves?

507
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,310
Show off as you want.

508
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,390
You'll behave when you catch a cold.

509
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,390
Dad, you know?

510
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,190
My mom went to a reunion today.

511
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,910
A reunion?

512
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,390
Were there any men there?

513
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,430
She posted it on her WeChat Moments.

514
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,430
Didn't you see it?

515
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,030
You posted it on WeChat Moments?

516
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,990
Mom, the dumplings are delicious.

517
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:28,830
See?

518
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,230
Still flattering themselves at such an age.

519
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,630
All of them wore scarfs.

520
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,390
It was indeed a Spider Web Cave.

521
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,470
That's not right, Dad.

522
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,830
My mom was very pretty when she was young.

523
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,830
You mean

524
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,110
your mom is not pretty anymore?

525
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,870
That's not what I meant.

526
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,510
That's exactly what you meant.

527
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,030
I'm not...

528
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,870
It's so obvious.

529
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,310
That's exactly what you meant.

530
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,430
What's wrong?

531
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,830
The dumplings are delicious.

532
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,390
She's saving them for you.

533
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,430
Eat more.

534
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,750
Mom.

535
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,390
Are you not eating?

536
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,510
I'm full.

537
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,590
You must have pissed her off again.

538
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,630
Go away.

539
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,510
Your don't know how to talk.

540
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,830
What do you mean she was beautiful

541
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:23,510
when she was young?

542
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,670
Now that she's old, of course she doesn't look good.

543
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,590
I didn't mean that.

544
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,230
That's what you meant.

545
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,190
You're always like this.

546
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,470
You always make me take the blame.

547
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,710
I saw a joke on my phone a couple days ago.

548
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,230
It was so hilarious.

549
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,190
Every spring, when the weather is great,

550
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,270
the tree is full of old ladies, just like fruits.

551
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,670
Sheng Xiangqian!

552
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,670
They were standing on the tree and taking photos

553
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,390
when the tree suddenly broke.

554
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,990
Each of them was fined 200 yuan.

555
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,350
Dad.

556
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,030
My team leader

557
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,110
bullies me at work every day.

558
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,990
He gives me so much work that I can't finish.

559
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,110
You chose the job yourself.

560
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,270
Since you chose it, don't complain.

561
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,310
I'm not complaining.

562
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,670
The point is I can't finish it.

563
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,670
That's good.

564
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,710
This is like a test for you.

565
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,990
Yes, I understand how it works.

566
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,670
Don't stare at the computer screen for long.

567
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,110
You should protect your eyes.

568
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,390
Don't worry.

569
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,870
The dumplings are delicious.

570
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,830
You just don't want

571
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,510
to admit that you have nothing now.

572
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,230
You've lost everything.

573
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,270
So you become soft now.

574
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,630
You're scared.

575
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,190
Enough. Stop drinking.

576
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,630
Why are you here?

577
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,590
The video has to be done by tomorrow.

578
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,230
Let me tell you.

579
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,590
This is what's most valuable

580
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,070
about you right now.

581
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,710
It's also the only thing that's respectable about you.

582
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,270
Alright.

583
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,470
I'm sober now.

584
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,630
Since you're sober now, clean this up.

585
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,030
It stinks.

586
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,110
Why should I clean it up?

587
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,870
The cleaner will do it tomorrow.

588
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,910
How can you be so lazy?

589
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,190
Jian Bing didn't discipline you well.

590
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:22,790
She never disciplined me on these things.

591
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,910
This is also what I liked the most about her.

592
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,230
What's the point of liking her?

593
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,990
It didn't stop you from cheating on her.

594
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,710
If she

595
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,070
were you, right?

596
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,630
I could buy you a purse.

597
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,190
Right?

598
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,630
I could treat you to a big meal,

599
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,950
and transfer some money to you,

600
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,390
and it would be over, right?

601
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,630
Am I that kind of woman in your heart?

602
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,350
Besides, this kind of thing

603
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,710
would never happen to me.

604
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,470
Right, you're the one

605
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,870
who buys purses for boys, right?

606
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,110
You are the one who treats them to fancy dinners

607
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,430
and buy them limited edition sneakers,

608
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,070
right?

609
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,790
She's different from you.

610
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,470
I told you.

611
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,710
She's someone that

612
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,310
demands emotional value.

613
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,030
She must be the only one.

614
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,310
Only looking at each other,

615
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,830
and letting ten years pass like a day.

616
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,870
She wants me to treat her like when we first met.

617
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,590
Do you think it's been easy for me these years?

618
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,030
Shut up.

619
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,430
Clean this up.

620
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,070
Stop talking nonsense.

621
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,590
Hurry up.

622
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,110
You have to work tomorrow.

623
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:24,710
Don't turn the editing room

624
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,910
into a karaoke bar for real.

625
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,470
Find a recycling bin and throw these away.

626
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,710
You can also throw yourself away while you're at it.

627
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,790
Do you know which bin you belong?

628
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,550
Which one?

629
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,190
Hazardous waste.

630
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,070
Calling her melodramatic since you're cheap.

631
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,470
Typical. She's too good for you.

632
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,350
If you don't deserve her, just admit that.

633
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,230
There are so many men in the world.

634
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,670
There must be someone that deserves her.

635
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,070
Don't regret it when she finds someone great.

636
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,270
All right.

637
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,070
Get back to work.

638
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:09,910
I'll clean it up.

639
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,430
Are you eating alone?

640
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,590
Why didn't you peel one for us as well?

641
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,990
Can't you do it yourselves?

642
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,550
What's wrong with you?

643
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,710
You didn't wash the dishes either.

644
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,630
Who did you wrong?

645
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,910
Come here.

646
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,070
Even if I come here,

647
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,110
the dishes are still unwashed.

648
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,710
Is the word "nanny" written on my face?

649
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,390
Was I born to be a servant

650
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,430
for the Sheng family

651
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,990
and serve you two?

652
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:43,750
Wait.

653
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,030
Tell me if you need anything.

654
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:45,630
Go away.

655
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,590
Who offended you?

656
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,390
No one.

657
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,790
You're being ridiculous.

658
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,630
Dad, what's wrong? I'm working.

659
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,310
Something's wrong with your mom.

660
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,070
Did you offend her?

661
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:27,830
Dad.

662
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,430
You know I didn't mean that.

663
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,990
You always shirk the blame on me.

664
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,630
Forget it.

665
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,950
If my mom is really angry,

666
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:36,870
I'll apologize to her.

667
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,310
No need.

668
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,510
But what you said is true.

669
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,590
That shouldn't have done anything to your mom.

670
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,230
Maybe it's menopause.

671
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,430
She's in a bad mood and emotionally unstable.

672
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,630
Women are so hard to serve.

673
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,190
When she was young,

674
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,670
she was gentle and obedient.

675
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,270
The older she gets, the more disobedient she becomes.

676
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,030
She won't tell you what she wants.

677
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,830
She wants you to guess.

678
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,950
It's like guessing lantern puzzles.

679
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,630
I really don't know what I say may offend her.

680
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,590
I really don't know what she wants.

681
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,430
Dad.

682
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,870
Maybe I know what my mom wants.

683
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,870
What does she want?

684
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,030
Think about it.

685
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,230
She put on this show tonight

686
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,230
just to show us her dress.

687
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,390
She wants beautiful clothes.

688
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,230
What clothes?

689
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,590
Just that kind of

690
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,790
expensive and branded dresses.

691
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,430
Like the dress she wore tonight.

692
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:36,110
How old is she to buy dresses like that?

693
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,470
What's the point of that?

694
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,790
Your mom likes

695
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,990
flashy things like that.

696
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,310
They're of no use,

697
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,710
and they take so much room and money.

698
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,670
You don't understand it.

699
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,910
Perhaps for Meijuan,

700
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,910
life is not just about daily trifles,

701
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,670
but poems and dreams.

702
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,710
What are you talking about?

703
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,990
How can there only be daily trifles in the Sheng family?

704
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,110
I'll make her a cup of chrysanthemum and wolfberry tea,

705
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,590
and kick her to her dreamland.

706
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,190
Dad.

707
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,430
Happy wife,

708
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,710
happy life.

709
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,510
Okay?

710
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,430
This is bad, Mr. Sheng Xiangqian.

711
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:46,790
How much

712
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,670
is that dress you mentioned?

713
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,150
It's not cheap anyway.

714
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,950
Is 300 enough?

715
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,830
300?

716
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,070
300 for two sleeves, perhaps.

717
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,630
Yang.

718
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,550
Let's talk about it.

719
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,310
Look.

720
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,350
A young man

721
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,070
in his 20s,

722
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,830
living with his parents.

723
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,870
Doesn't this count as taking advantage of his parents?

724
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,830
Should he be like

725
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,310
other young people,

726
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,070
and offer his family some allowance?

727
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,950
Look, the food expenses.

728
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,070
The rent.

729
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,430
A mother

730
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,870
and a child.

731
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,830
It's so hard for her to bring up a child.

732
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,230
Dad, stop it.

733
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,950
I've got it.

734
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,030
Can I pay by scanning the QR code?

735
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,470
You...

736
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,510
Why are you making it about you?

737
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,430
Do you want it or not?

738
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,190
Yes.

739
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:44,670
Let me tell you.

740
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,710
To deal with Luo Meijuan,

741
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,030
we must work together.

742
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,230
Alright, take the money.

743
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:50,670
Here.

744
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,230
Here.

745
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:51,590
Here.

746
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,070
QR code.

747
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:00,910
Done.

748
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,390
I've transferred it to you.

749
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,030
You've received 1,200 yuan through WeChat payment.

750
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,150
By the way,

751
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,470
do you know which one to buy?

752
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:14,910
You do?

753
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,270
How would I know?

754
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,110
This is your fault.

755
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,150
It's my fault again?

756
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,270
This is the disadvantage of not having a girlfriend.

757
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,670
If you have a girlfriend,

758
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,550
you can ask her

759
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,110
about it now, right?

760
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,070
Well, you've been married for decades,

761
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,150
but you still don't know.

762
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,270
I'm aiming far.

763
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,110
Impressive.

764
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:36,630
Wait.

765
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,790
I haven't washed it.

766
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:40,790
Well.

767
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,230
You want to eat it?

768
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,550
Wash it yourself.

769
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,430
Off you go, dear father.

770
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,510
After a month of cooling off,

771
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,590
are you sure you still want to proceed with the divorce?

772
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:40,989
Yes.

773
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,310
Yes.

774
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,030
Okay, it's completed.

775
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,950
It's done, right?

776
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,030
Yes.

777
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,710
Okay, thank you.

778
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,430
Are you going back to the office?

779
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,910
We can take my car.

780
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,510
I'll go location scouting with Peng later.

781
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,070
Is it far? I can give you a ride.

782
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,710
No need. He'll pick me up later.

783
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,030
Okay.

784
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,510
Then...

785
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,030
See you in the office.

786
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,670
See you in the office.

787
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,830
Bye.

788
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,270
Hello, Peng.

789
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,910
Brother. Let's go?

790
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,310
Well, you can go back.

791
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,950
I want to take a day off today.

792
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,030
Okay.

793
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,590
Beauty.

794
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,830
Me?

795
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,470
Yes.

796
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,590
Look around this hall.

797
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,750
Aren't you the prettiest?

798
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,950
Thank you.

799
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,510
What kind of business are you here for?

800
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,230
I'm getting a certificate of being single.

801
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,870
Are you single?

802
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,430
Yes.

803
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,470
I'm single too.

804
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,310
Do you want to get married?

805
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,670
Let's get married in a flash.

806
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,150
Are you insane?

807
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,350
Hello, what's wrong?

808
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,270
Hello? Can you hear me?

809
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,710
I'm outside.

810
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,270
It's okay. I'll leave you to it.

811
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,870
Wait.

812
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,110
Today is Wednesday.

813
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,070
You two just finished the procedure, right?

814
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,270
How could I forget that?

815
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,510
Why don't you come find me now?

816
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:38,830
Where are you?

817
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,110
The karaoke bar. I'll get you a separate room.

818
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,030
Okay.

819
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,150
Shanshan.

820
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,030
We have to count on you

821
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,190
for the next project.

822
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,310
No problem.

823
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,670
You have to find me

824
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,550
a better director.

825
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,270
No problem.

826
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,310
I trust you.

827
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,630
You can rest assured.

828
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,030
Okay, I totally trust you.

829
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:36,550
Shanshan.

830
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,750
Hold on.

831
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,590
I'll get another room for you.

832
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,270
Shanshan.

833
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,910
This is...

834
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:47,750
Mr. He.

835
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,830
Let me introduce.

836
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:50,910
Mr. He.

837
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,750
This is one of the founders

838
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,870
of Jian Yi Advertising, my bestie,

839
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,310
Director Jian, Jian Bing.

840
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,110
So you're Director Jian.

841
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,110
I've heard a lot about you.

842
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,070
Come on. Fill the cup.

843
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,950
She's a lightweight.

844
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,110
I'll drink tea instead of wine.

845
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:03,670
A toast to you.

846
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,350
It'll be such a disappointment if you don't drink.

847
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,390
She really can't drink much. I'll drink for her.

848
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,030
I quit drinking recently. I'm sorry.

849
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,310
You quit recently? So you used to be able to drink.

850
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,470
Do me a favor.

851
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:12,990
Today,

852
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,070
drink this glass of wine.

853
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,110
You can't be too healthy.

854
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,550
It's boring. What do you think?

855
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,790
Mr. He, you're right.

856
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,190
I'll drink this as

857
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,630
a toast to you.

858
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,070
Alright.

859
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,670
Thank you for supporting our company.

860
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,310
Director Jian, please.

861
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:33,750
Mr. He.

862
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,710
We...

863
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,710
Fill the cup.

864
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,550
Just stay here.

865
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,430
Director Jian.

866
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,870
I've seen a lot of your works.

867
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,070
They're great.

868
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:43,830
I...

869
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:44,830
Really.

870
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,230
Thank you very much.

871
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,230
I think I want you on our next project

872
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,190
as well.

873
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,230
Thank you, Mr. He.

874
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,030
Let's drink. Let's not talk about this.

875
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,510
Don't drink too much.

876
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:57,990
You can really hold your liquor.

877
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,470
Pass me the wine.

878
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,110
Come on.

879
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,310
Director Jian.

880
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:03,630
Thank you.

881
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:05,350
Mr. He.

882
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:05,790
Thank you.

883
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,510
Director Jian's works are good.

884
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,990
And you're forthright.

885
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,070
Here.

886
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,310
Let me.

887
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,390
Cheers. Cheers.

888
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,310
Share your opinions.

889
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,870
Which one should we choose?

890
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,590
What works does he have?

891
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:35,630
Boss.

892
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:39,190
We've always been filming with Director Chen's team.

893
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,550
They want someone younger,

894
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,870
who's full of ideas.

895
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,230
Maybe they think Director Chen's concept

896
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,470
is a bit old.

897
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,590
These clients

898
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,070
are so spontaneous.

899
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,790
Just like my kid.

900
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,510
They always like better things.

901
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,790
But I think...

902
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,430
Boss.

903
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:58,790
You see.

904
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,870
Director Chen's team is so experienced

905
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,390
and easy to control.

906
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,710
Won't it be a pity if we don't use them?

907
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,630
These are their works.

908
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,430
How about him?

909
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,110
I heard

910
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,830
it's pretty hard to communicate with him.

911
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,310
And he's not very cooperative.

912
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,310
Who should we choose?

913
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:18,830
Boss.

914
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,270
How about

915
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,030
we have another discussion with the client?

916
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,990
Maybe we can ask Director Chen's team to shoot a sample first.

917
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:29,910
Sheng Yang.

918
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,470
You were very creative

919
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,590
last time when we were comparing notes.

920
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:33,750
Share your opinion

921
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,030
from the perspective of young people.

922
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,390
Which of these directors is better?

923
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:37,990
I think

924
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,790
none of them is suitable.

925
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:43,630
Boss.

926
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:46,030
Can I recommend someone that's not on the list?

927
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:48,990
Tell me about it.

928
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,830
I know a director.

929
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,190
She's done many advertisements.

930
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,390
She has her own style and ideas.

931
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:56,470
I think she suits our product very well.
