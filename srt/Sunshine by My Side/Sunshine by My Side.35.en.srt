195
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,060
Not many items are normal.

196
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,420
At this age, it's not normal if the items are normal.

197
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,820
It's normal that they are not normal.

198
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,340
Now my life

199
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,420
is doing the same things every day.

200
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,580
It's so boring.

201
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,380
Why do I think you just sounded like Jian Zhongde?

202
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,260
Really?

203
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,580
Get ready for filming.

204
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,540
Ready.

205
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,860
Action.

206
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,860
Director Jian

207
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,460
and Director Xue were a couple.

208
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,580
You don't know that, do you?

209
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,020
Really?

210
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,700
And

211
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,140
they are divorced now.

212
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,980
You can't see it either, can you?

213
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,220
Divorced?

214
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,820
Then why are they still working together?

215
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,340
Here, wear it.

216
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,340
There are no lines.

217
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,580
To keep you warm.

218
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,300
You are doing this on purpose, aren't you?

219
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,850
Come on.

220
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,780
Go away.

221
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,140
They are not conventional.

222
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,380
I heard Director Jian

223
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,060
is keeping a young man.

224
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,260
Good for her.

225
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,570
But

226
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,620
this woman looks...

227
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,300
How about this?

228
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,100
Tonight, I will

229
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
invite both of them to a banquet.

230
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,730
I'll let you see with your own eyes.

231
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,370
Okay.

232
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:04,820
Listen.

233
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,260
Drink more wine tonight with her.

234
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,940
Sir,

235
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,700
hello.

236
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,420
You two have been chatting.

237
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,540
You must be thirsty.

238
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,340
Come on.

239
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,900
Have some water.

240
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,220
Okay, thank you.

241
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,420
Give us two bottles of beer and some cold dishes.

242
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,500
Go.

243
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,260
I've been thinking about it these days.

244
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,940
The longer I look at her, the more uncomfortable I feel.

245
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,580
Judging from her face,

246
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,020
her figure,

247
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,730
and her personality...

248
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,500
Won't you just shut up?

249
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,580
This is the filming site.

250
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,540
Chatting is forbidden. Don't you know?

251
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,300
Are you talking about me?

252
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,460
Yes.

253
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,060
And you.

254
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,060
Well.

255
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,940
Who are you?

256
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,980
Come here.

257
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,970
Young man, come here.

258
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,340
I asked you to come here.

259
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,860
Cut. Cut. Cut.

260
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,860
You can't hear me?

261
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,100
Let go.

262
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,580
No way.

263
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,860
Do you know who I am?

264
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,340
I don't care who you are.

265
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,660
I asked you to let go!

266
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,420
Do you know who you are talking to?

267
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,460
Do you believe I'm gonna slap you in the face?

268
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,420
Don't fight.

269
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:00,890
Mr. Jia.

270
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:01,860
Let go. Let go.

271
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,420
Mr. Jia.

272
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,020
Director Xue,

273
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,300
he's from your company, right?

274
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,620
Is he crazy?

275
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,420
Are you okay?

276
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,660
I'm fine.

277
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,170
Director Jian,

278
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,420
are you okay?

279
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,420
Why are you asking him if he's okay?

280
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,460
So he's your man.

281
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,980
Is this how you discipline him?

282
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,090
Mr. Jia. Mr. Jia. Mr. Jia.

283
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,860
Mr. Jia, look at me. Look at me.

284
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,540
He's not from our company.

285
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,220
He's a friend of Director Jian.

286
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,140
Well,

287
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,900
are you hurt?

288
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
Alright.

289
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,500
How about this?

290
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,060
On behalf of him,

291
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,180
I apologize to you. I apologize.

292
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,890
Director Xue,

293
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,860
this has nothing to do with you.

294
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,420
Don't be angry.

295
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,580
Come on. Let's continue.

296
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,260
This has nothing to do with you.

297
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,700
He's Director Jian's friend, right?

298
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,060
Let him bow to us as an apology

299
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,660
in front of everyone.

300
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,460
This is not difficult, right?

301
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,220
Apologize.

302
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,820
Right now. Hurry.

303
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,620
Why?

304
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,540
Because he didn't brush his teeth this morning.

305
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,340
His mouth is dirty.

306
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,010
I...

307
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,340
Mr. Jia. Mr. Jia. Mr. Jia.

308
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,380
Who are you talking to?

309
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,370
I'm talking about you.

310
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:01,980
Don't. Don't.

311
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,020
Mr. Jia, sorry.

312
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,780
How about this?

313
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,060
Let's go back to the company now.

314
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,900
Let's go back to the company.

315
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,460
Let the director finish filming first.

316
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,300
Let's go. I'll buy you a drink.

317
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,620
No.

318
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,220
Do you think I'm still in the mood to drink?

319
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,660
You don't know how to apologize, huh?

320
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,700
Is this how

321
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,820
Jian Yi treats your clients?

322
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,860
I'm sorry. Sorry.

323
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,380
Your work is just shooting advertisements.

324
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,130
Do you really think you're artists?

325
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,850
You are just a bunch of stupid workers.

326
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,940
What's the big deal?

327
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,650
Don't you know who is Party A

328
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,860
and who is Party B?

329
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,540
Stop what you are doing.

330
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,780
Delete what you filmed just now.

331
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,660
I don't want to give you this order.

332
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,660
I was talking about you two's love life.

333
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,860
So what?

334
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,860
Who are you talking about?

335
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,010
Xue. Xue.

336
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,370
Director Xue, be careful with your back.

337
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,980
Enough. Pull him up. Hurry.

338
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,580
The brand has sent someone.

339
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,460
They want to stop filming.

340
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
I think

341
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,500
they won't renew the contract either.

342
00:15:59,260 --> 00:15:59,980
Okay.

343
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,340
I know.

344
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,460
Deal with it first.

345
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,700
Thank you.

346
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,620
Lin,

347
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,460
come out.

348
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,900
Coming.

349
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,820
Ms. Jian Bing, what's wrong?

350
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,660
Is everything prepared inside?

351
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,180
Well, you want to continue to film?

352
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,460
Yes. So many takes haven't been finished yet.

353
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,540
Let's get to work.

354
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,330
Are you okay?

355
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,850
I'm fine.

356
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,610
Thank you.

357
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:14,619
I didn't expect

358
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,500
you are quite a fighter.

359
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,500
I didn't do my best.

360
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,060
If there was nothing wrong with my back,

361
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,900
I would have knocked him down with just one punch.

362
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,460
You are childish.

363
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,050
Who are you talking about?

364
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,180
You're not young anymore.

365
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,380
Take it easy.

366
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,100
It was because you had a conflict with them first.

367
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,980
Of course, this is not your fault.

368
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,700
Considering what he said,

369
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,220
he had it coming.

370
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,660
I didn't expect

371
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,540
you said I'm childish.

372
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,340
I'm surprised.

373
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,700
Are you having a midlife crisis?

374
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,860
What are you talking about?

375
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,860
Give me some water.

376
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,660
But just now,

377
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,500
we enjoyed the fight.

378
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,220
We did.

379
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,860
But what about Jian Bing?

380
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,940
We can talk about that later.

381
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,340
Childish.

382
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,060
Why did you come back first?

383
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,340
I don't want to affect your filming.

384
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,580
What's the reason?

385
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,180
No matter what the reason is,

386
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,020
I shouldn't have hit him.

387
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,860
And I started this.

388
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,060
If only I had calmed down back then.

389
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,940
I... I don't know why I couldn't control myself.

390
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,730
Why do you always act like

391
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,620
reporting to your boss

392
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,940
every time you see me?

393
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,860
Are we really in a relationship?

394
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,940
Do you know how to comfort someone?

395
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,460
You should hug me now.

396
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,860
Hurry up.

397
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,820
I'm sorry.

398
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,340
I caused you trouble again.

399
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,740
It's okay.

400
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,060
You are not angry?

401
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,620
No. It was not you who hit him first.

402
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,500
Later,

403
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,180
you go cook a meal for Jian Zhongde.

404
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,730
And I'll just let it go.

405
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,860
No problem.

406
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,570
Let's go.

407
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,500
I'm starving.

408
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,580
Are you really not angry?

409
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,940
Are you afraid that your boss will scold you?

410
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,580
I've been in this industry for 15 years.

411
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,420
I've never seen a partner like you.

412
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,300
You hit me.

413
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,580
And you are so arrogant.

414
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,180
So far,

415
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,340
you haven't even apologized officially.

416
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,460
Let me tell you honestly.

417
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,340
The video was shot by our people.

418
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,340
If you don't show your sincerity,

419
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,700
let's just wait.

420
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,930
This is the video.

[Jian Yi's director assaulted clients for no reason.]

422
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,940
Those are who were assaulted.

423
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,660
Don't be angry.

424
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,700
Today,

425
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,340
I called you here

426
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,940
to negotiate,

427
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,660
right?

428
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,180
It's best that we can come up with a solution

429
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,380
that can satisfy both parties.

430
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,220
Gentlemen,

431
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,180
how about having some tea?

432
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,780
Please wait a minute.

433
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,060
It's not about money now.

434
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,380
They want us to give them an explanation.

435
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,010
Explain what?

436
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,580
Our regular clients know

437
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,730
what kind of person Xue is.

438
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,460
It's easy to explain.

439
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,820
The point is what they want to do.

440
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,380
Right?

441
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,060
The video has been uploaded.

442
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,180
It has caused bad influence.

443
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,540
Compensating them?

444
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,620
Terminating the contract?

445
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,940
I've finished filming anyway.

446
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,460
Mr. Jia is narrow-minded.

447
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,820
He won't be satisfied

448
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,540
with what you said.

449
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,460
Then what?

450
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,780
Should we

451
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,180
kneel

452
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,100
and apologize?

453
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,340
I should be the one kneeling.

454
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,580
How about this?

455
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,620
I'll arrange a banquet.

456
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,660
Let's...

457
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,660
No.

458
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:23,660
Xue and I

459
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,460
should drink with him someday

460
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,980
and apologize to him sincerely.

461
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,980
And let's see if this problem can be solved.

462
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:30,860
Here.

463
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,460

[Letter of Resignation]

465
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,380
What do you mean?

466
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,530
Are you crazy?

467
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,660
Use this to explain to him.

468
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,180
What are you doing?

469
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,940
Look. This problem

470
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,540
can't be solved

471
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,740
just by drinking wine and having a meal.

472
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,580
They just want us to pay the price.

473
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:52,820
Right?

474
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,580
They just want us

475
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,780
to lie on the floor

476
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,460
so that they can step on our faces.

477
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,700
If I resign,

478
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,940
the problem will be solved, right?

479
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,620
Don't try to persuade me. Don't do that.

480
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,260
Now I know

481
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,180
why you like young boys.

482
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,940
It's good to be young.

483
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,180
Young boys are passionate.

484
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,580
They can do whatever they want.

485
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,900
They're vigorous.

486
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,940
They don't yield to anyone.

487
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,010
Now I like this kind of personality too.

488
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,260
Back then,

489
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,060
when I started this company,

490
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,010
I was

491
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,580
humble

492
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,820
in front of my clients.

493
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,340
And I flattered them and knelt

494
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,180
just to earn their money.

495
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,740
I've figured it out today.

496
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,770
I won't do that again.

497
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,980
I won't yield to them anymore.

498
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,020
What can they do about it?

499
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,860
I really want to do that.

500
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,580
They are rich. So what?

501
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,460
I'll point my finger at him and curse him.

502
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,300
Now I don't want to be their Party B.

503
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,330
What are they gonna do about it?

504
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,170
But

505
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,460
I can't.

506
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:50,940
Right?

507
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,700
If I do that, I will feel comfortable.

508
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,260
But what about the company?

509
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,700
This company belongs to the three of us.

510
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,020
How can I do that?

511
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,860
But now,

512
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,660
I want to tell you this from the bottom of my heart.

I'm sorry.

518
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,660

I'm going to Tibet.

00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,180
I want to go on a trip.

524
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,740
I want to indulge myself and enjoy freedom.

Director Jian, you have won

00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,580
an international award.

545
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,300
You must have high requirements for the quality of films.

546
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,300
But our budget

547
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,900
is limited.

I mean

maybe we can cooperate next time.

Hello, we are from Jian Yi Advertisement Studio.

We're here with the director to check on the scene today.

We'll rent your place for three days.

00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,500
for us to go in to set up the scene in advance?

560
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,220

Why won't he rent it out now?

It's obvious that he doesn't want to rent it to us.

00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,220
He said they sent someone to investigate Sheng Yang's studio.

574
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,850
We are still facing challenges now.

575
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,060
Tell Sheng Yang

576
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,340
to be careful.

577
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,740
They have hired the online water army

578
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,540
to say bad things about us.

579
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,740
None of our contracts

580
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,220
went well recently.

581
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,460
Thank you.

582
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,100
I'm used to it.

583
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,180
Zheng.

584
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,900
Yes.

585
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,580
Ms. Liang is here too.

586
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,340
You have something to discuss, right?

587
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,140
I want to talk to Ms. Jian about something.

588
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,300
Okay, I'm leaving then.

589
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,220
You guys talk.

590
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:29,700
Well,

591
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,740
Ms. Jian,

592
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,500
here's the thing.

593
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,730
A friend of mine

594
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,060
runs a film and television company.

595
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,540
They're making a movie.

596
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,620
They need an art director.

597
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,060
So he asked me to help him.

598
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,500
We don't have much work recently.

599
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,060
I have a lot of time.

600
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,700
And my son

601
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,300
will go abroad to study soon.

602
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,490
My family is facing huge pressure.

603
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,730
Go.

604
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,220
Just go.

605
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,420
Don't think too much.

606
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,220
It's a good thing.

607
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:54,940
Ms. Jian,

608
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,660
I'm really thinking for the company.

609
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,220
I really...

610
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,900
Don't stand on ceremony.

611
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,300
If there is an opportunity to make money, you should seize it.

612
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:02,980
Right.

613
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,260
But

614
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,660
I would be really sorry

615
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,260
if I leave now.

616
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,010
Don't be sorry.

617
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,260
The company will always be your backup force.

618
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,780
I'll keep the position for you.

619
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,860
Come back when you are done there.

620
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,180
I'm leaving then.

621
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,050
Okay.

622
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,460
Thank you.

623
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,860
Thank you.

624
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,660
It's fast.

625
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:33,780
Boss.

626
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,020
-It's been a while.
-Boss.

627
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,220
Long time no see.

628
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,940
You look younger and more handsome.

629
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,860
Don't stand on ceremony.

630
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,220
Boss, have a seat.

631
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,460
You were my subordinates.

632
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,020
Just say what you want to say.

633
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,020
Okay, I'll get straight to the point.

634
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,140
Not long ago,

635
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,100
we established a studio.

636
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,780
Congratulations.

637
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,460
You're a boss now.

638
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,620
Come, have a seat.

639
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,100
We asked you out

640
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,740
because we want to know

641
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,980
if there are any suitable projects

642
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,700
in July Advertising Agency

643
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,940
that we can cooperate on.

644
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,860
We heard

645
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,220
you are outsourcing some projects.

646
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,140
And we are looking for partner companies.

647
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,020
Can you take us into consideration?

648
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,860
You two are very honest.

649
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,340
Yes.

650
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,380
Boss,

651
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,740
this is the introduction file of our studio.

652
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,580
You can take a look.

653
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,780
Moses Advertisement Design.

654
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,700
Recently,

655
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,860
something happened

656
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,260
to the company.

657
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,020
And there were significant personnel changes.

658
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,540
Most of the projects have been suspended.

659
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,660
I failed to fulfill my duty as the boss.

660
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,540
I'm sorry.

661
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,020
And I'm thankful

662
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,500
that you are still here

663
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,340
when the company

664
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,620
is facing

665
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,020
great challenges.

666
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,660
Next,

667
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,860
if you want to resign, you can resign.

668
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,420
The redundancy pay will be paid out.

669
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,900
When you first came to Jian Yi,

670
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,450
I told you

671
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,060
Jian Yi values skills and professionalism.

672
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,020
We don't flatter clients.

673
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,420
And we don't meet their unreasonable requirements.

674
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,420
No matter how hard we work,

675
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,980
we should have dignity.

676
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,860
I hope you can

677
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,660
find your own value and sense of belonging at Jian Yi.

678
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,340
Only those who share the same goal can go further, right?

679
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,300
As I said,

680
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,460
good content deserves respect.

681
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,900
This is what matters the most to us.

682
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,660
If you choose to stay,

683
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,980
let's continue to fight side by side.

684
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,940
If you choose to leave,

685
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,090
I can understand.

686
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,780
We may have a very hard time in the following days.

687
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,420
But I will do my best

688
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,010
to make the company get better as soon as possible.

689
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,980
Well...

690
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:02,940
Dismiss.

691
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,340
Director,

692
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,100
don't worry.

693
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,340
I won't leave.

694
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,020
Director,

695
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,260
I don't think we need to recruit people.

696
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,020
We can do it.

697
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,020
Director, don't think about anything else.

698
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,580
We all support you.

699
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,420
Right?

700
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:25,500
Thank you.

701
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,300
She is crying.

702
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:35,860
Work hard.

703
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,340
Boss,

704
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,060
we just want to strive for a chance to compete with others

705
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,740
through our works.

706
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,340
We don't mean anything else.

707
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,300
Okay, I got it.

708
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,700
Go back and wait for my reply.

709
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,860
That means we may have a chance.

710
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,020
Nonsense.

711
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,420
Have you forgotten the company's procedures?

712
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,050
Do you want to pull strings?

713
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,460
No.

714
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,020
We rely on our works and capability.

715
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,220
I'll think about it.

716
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,340
I have an appointment here.

717
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,860
Sorry that I can't walk you out.

718
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,700
Okay, we're leaving.

719
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,020
Okay.

720
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,620
Let's go.

721
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:06,700
Boss,

722
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,620
actually, I have something else

723
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,860
to tell you.

724
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,020
You've heard the rumors

725
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,540
in the industry, right?

726
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,300
The rumors about Jian Yi.

727
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,420
Actually, we cooperated with Jian Yi

728
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,860
before.

729
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,860
Do you still remember

730
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,300
Director Jian Bing?

731
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,860
Yes.

732
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,540
This is her information.

733
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,530
There's no problem with her character.

734
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,740
Is she your friend?

735
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,620
She is

736
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,050
my girlfriend.

737
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,740
The boss is back.

738
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,580
Good for you.

739
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,180
I think

740
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,660
you are more like a boss now.

741
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,020
I heard it just now.

742
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,900
What?

743
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,660
Are you here to inspect my work?

744
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,940
How dare I?

745
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,060
I'm an ex-employee of Jian Yi.

746
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,900
When it's over,

747
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,540
you must come back to Jian Yi.

748
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:10,139
The company needs you.

749
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,659
Well.

750
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,139
Why?

751
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,540
Do you want me to come back

752
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,020
to continue to work for you?

753
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,020
Can't I establish a company myself?

754
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,860
No.

755
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:19,980
Enough.

756
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,540
I didn't want to leave back then

757
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,300
because I was afraid you couldn't do it on your own.

758
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,020
But when I saw you today,

759
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:28,420
I knew you can do it.

760
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,940
Absolutely.

761
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,500
You can do it.

762
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,500
Well,

763
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,050
you have

764
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,860
your own principles.

765
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,940
And you

766
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,420
are tough.

767
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,380
And everyone in the company

768
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,940
listens to you.

769
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,420
Very good.

770
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,219
But I hope

771
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,300
you can live a good life.

772
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,340
At first,

773
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,460
I thought Sheng Yang

774
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,220
is too young and immature.

775
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,570
But

776
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,460
after everything

777
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,860
we've been through,

778
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,500
he

779
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,380
has withstood the test.

780
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,140
He's quite reliable.

781
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,540
Right.

782
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,860
I'm here today

783
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,860
to tell you that tomorrow,

784
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,850
I'll go to Tibet with a fleet.

785
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,700
The signal will be bad.

786
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,460
So I'll leave everything

787
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,340
in the company to you.

788
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,940
Well...

789
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,100
I... I have to go.

790
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,220
I have to go.

791
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,100
Right.

792
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:37,940
After the fight

793
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,220
that day,

794
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,340
Sheng Yang and I

795
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,860
chatted for quite some time at the door.

796
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,330
He told me

797
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:43,980
that he hopes

798
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,060
your family members

799
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,060
and friends

800
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,140
can talk to you

801
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,610
and ask you to relax.

802
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,420
I also like your smile.

803
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,060
Alright, I'm leaving.

804
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,900
I'm relieved to leave you to him.

805
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,020
Was I handsome when I was young?

806
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,740
Now you are handsome too.

807
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,180
Go. Just go.

808
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:28,980
Come on.

809
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,660
Sheng Yang,

810
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,650
you really impressed me.

811
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,540
As a boss,

812
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,650
you've changed a lot.

813
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,860
You've become bolder.

814
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,140
Boss,

815
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,460
I know you choose people based on their competence.

816
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,500
I don't mean anything else.

817
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,620
What I mean is

818
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,220
if the company is looking for a director,

819
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,580
can you take her

820
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,340
into consideration?

821
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,380
I can vouch for her with my personal character.

822
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,260
She really is good.

823
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,660
I dare to do this

824
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,420
because I believe

825
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,060
you are not a person who only believes rumors

826
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,500
and doesn't value competence.

827
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,860
You have your own judgment.

828
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,700
I and the people I recommend

829
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,220
will prove ourselves with our competence.

830
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,860
You don't have to worry about that.

831
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,220
How did our company

832
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,340
end up like this?

833
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,500
Eat.

834
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,100
I saw the photos of Xue riding a motorcycle

835
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,500
he uploaded on his Moments.

836
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,100
He looks quite happy.

837
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,540
It's just a superficial phenomenon.

838
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,100
He

839
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,500
is not that carefree.

840
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,740
I saw him

841
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,620
smoking on the balcony in the middle of the night

842
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,980
several times.

843
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,380
Actually he's upset too.

844
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,260
I didn't expect

845
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,180
he was the one who started the fight.

846
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,420
I thought it was Sheng Yang.

847
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,540
Don't be angry about what I said.

848
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,780
He is

849
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,940
just a kid. He's young and reckless.

850
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,980
What happened this time

851
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,580
is because

852
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,340
he didn't control himself well

853
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,610
and he insisted on taking it seriously.

854
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,540
It's meaningless for us

855
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,740
to discuss who took it seriously first.

856
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,780
I was there.

857
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,620
I saw clearly

858
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,020
what happened.

859
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,900
If Jia hadn't been so mean,

860
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,900
Xue wouldn't have lost control.

861
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,420
You're defending them.

862
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,140
In this world, 80% of the disputes

863
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,900
are started by men.

864
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,340
Because men

865
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,820
become mature later than women.

866
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,300
I said this to Xue too.

867
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,100
All romantic relationships in this world

868
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,540
are actually

869
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,540
relationships between older women and younger men.

870
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,420
That's true.

871
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,820
Being with Xue

872
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,020
is more tiring than being with those young boys.

873
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,460
You and Sheng Yang

874
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,780
are quite suitable.

875
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,900
What are your plans for the future?

876
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,540
No plans.

877
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,340
Cherish the present.

878
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,130
Let nature take its course.

879
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,620
On the right.

880
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,940
This room.

881
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,580
Come in.

882
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,900
Ms. Jian Bing,

883
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,460
this is the last art director applicant.

884
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,580
Have a seat. Please.

885
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,260
Hello, Director.

886
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,580
My name is Yang Yang.

888
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,340
Yang Yang?

[Introduction Manual Yang Yang]

891
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,820
Are these

892
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,340
all your team's works?

893
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:06,970
Yes.

894
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,620
They are all students' homework.

895
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,460
Students' homework nowadays is impressive.

896
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,220
I'm flattered.

897
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,300
So you've never been part of a project,

898
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:16,980
right?

899
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:17,620
Yes.

900
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,420
We are not very experienced.

901
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,610
But we are young.

902
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,500
We are cheap and useful.

903
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,540
And we are willing to work hard.

904
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,700
We accept a probation period of 3 months

free of charge.

906
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,060
Free of charge?

907
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,900
You don't need money for your living expenses?

908
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:30,860
I mean it.

909
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,820
As long as you agree,

910
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,060
we can start working right away.

Plus me, there are three.

914
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,660
Which university did you graduate from?

915
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,780
Chuanjiang Media Advertising College.

916
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,770
Your college has cultivated a lot of talented people,

917
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,340
especially in design.

918
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,180

I really want to work with you.

00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,740
You know which project is recruiting an art director, right?

Yes.

00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,140
Yes.

926
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,740
I did a lot of homework before I came.

927
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:03,780
Okay.

928
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,860
Since you've never been part of a project,

are you willing to submit a proposal

No.

957
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,410
I'll talk to you later.

958
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,180
Bye.

959
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:26,860
How did it go?

960
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,780
Did you let the cat out of the bag?

961
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,580
No.

962
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,580
I acted so well.

963
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,980
Are you sure?

964
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:31,780
Yes.

965
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,580
What did she say?

966
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,180
She asked us to submit a proposal first.

967
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,260
We'll sign a contract after the proposal is approved.

968
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,060
Really.

969
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:38,500
Okay.

970
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,660
Go back and make a proposal.

971
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,140
Let's go.

972
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,140
Are you sure you didn't let the cat out of the bag?

973
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,220
Yes.

974
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:44,860
I acted very well.

975
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,260
I told her everything you told me.

976
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,580
Everything?

977
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:22,790
♫The intertwined vines are filled with memories♫

978
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:28,080
♫Time deliberately leaves traces♫

979
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,010
♫Talking about the present and the past again♫

980
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,100
♫Being ordinary is not easy♫

981
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:42,140
♫I think you also agree♫

982
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:53,560
♫Everyone says that love is difficult to understand♫

983
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,790
♫Is it up to fate or your own will?♫

984
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,750
♫Don't care, pretending to detach♫

985
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:13,010
♫Not saying what's on your mind leads to bad chemistry♫

986
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,910
♫Some people leave early♫

987
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,770
♫Someone once defined it♫

988
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:27,780
♫Searching is the only way♫

989
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:32,120
♫Waiting leaves one exhausted♫

990
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:41,270
♫But after seeing you again, I never thought of giving up♫

991
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:48,690
♫I think I'm willing to give myself to you♫

992
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:55,330
♫I used to travel alone, but you've made my life meaningful♫

993
00:44:55,330 --> 00:45:02,690
♫I think I'm willing to breathe for you♫

994
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:05,810
♫Finally, I believe♫

995
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:15,230
♫Courage is the path of love♫
