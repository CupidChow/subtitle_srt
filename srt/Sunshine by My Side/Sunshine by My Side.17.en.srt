[Episode 17]

4
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,620
My friend is still inside.

5
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,930
What are you doing?

6
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:35,700
Stop filming.

7
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,580
Come on.

8
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,100
Move back.

9
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,020
Stop filming.

10
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,410
Answer it.

11
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,570
It's Song Chen.

12
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,979
I don't know what's up with him.

13
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,979
Let me call him back.

14
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,900
Hello, what's wrong?

15
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,580
Where are you?

16
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,900
Calm down. Take your time.

17
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,740
What's wrong?

18
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,140
The exhibition stage collapsed.

19
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,940
What did you say?

20
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,660
The exhibition stage collapsed.

21
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,660
Many people are injured now.

22
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,539
The spokesperson is injured

23
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,900
and the audience are injured too.

24
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,580
Please come over here, okay?

25
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,540
I don't know what to do.

26
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,340
Alright, I got it. Don't worry.

27
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,620
I'll be right back.

28
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,540
Bye.

29
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,980
What did he say?

30
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,020
He'll come back now.

31
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,740
Be careful over there.

32
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,400
Be careful.

33
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,460
Are you okay?

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,300
I'm fine.

35
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,100
Is there a work emergency?

36
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,060
Something happened with the stage.

37
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,530
I...

38
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,700
I might have to go back.

39
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,340
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,380
I might not be able to drive you home.

41
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,540
Work is important. Go ahead.

42
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:42,940
No.

43
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,220
You still feel dizzy.

44
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,090
How can you drive?

45
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,300
I can get myself back one way or another.

46
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,450
I'll call a designated driver.

47
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,740
Okay.

48
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,900
I'll go now.

49
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,380
Be careful.

50
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,180
Bye.

51
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,540
Hello, Mr. Chen.

52
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,180
Yes.

53
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,380
I don't know the details either.

54
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,820
We're checking with the construction team.

55
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,140
Don't worry about the hospital.

56
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,940
Our Client Relations team has gone over there.

57
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,220
Yes, they went there immediately.

58
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,780
I will find out what happened.

59
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,660
Don't worry.

60
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,329
Hello, Mr. Chen?

61
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:19,900
Hello?

62
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,820
What's going on?

63
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,579
What happened?

64
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,500
Where did you go?

65
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,620
Team Leader, how did the stage collapse?

66
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,980
How would I know?

67
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,140
Sheng Yang,

68
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,620
you are fully in charge of this project.

69
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,579
What am I supposed to tell the boss

70
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,940
about this kind of major mistake?

71
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:35,820
No.

72
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,220
This...

73
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,380
What do you mean by "no?"

74
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,300
Let me tell you.

75
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,780
We've never had such a major incident

76
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,700
since the company was established.

77
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,140
I just checked with the construction team.

78
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,740
They said that they underwent construction

79
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,340
according to your design.

80
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,579
They didn't cut back on materials.

81
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,940
Now, the brand is seriously suspecting

82
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,740
that there's a problem with your design.

83
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,060
We have a serious problem

84
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,380
that caused this serious accident, understand?

85
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,780
I got another call.

86
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,180
Tell me how to explain.

87
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,580
Hello, Mr. Li.

88
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,820
I'm Wang.

89
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,780
Mr. Li, go ahead.

90
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,820
Have some water.

91
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,420
Here.

92
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,940
What will we do when we get to the company tomorrow?

93
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,580
Two people with minor injuries were taken to the hospital.

94
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,220
The rest are fine.

95
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,220
Now, the critical thing is the spokesperson's leg injury.

96
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,730
Her schedule for the next three days all have to be delayed.

97
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Her agency is also very angry.

98
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,700
Many fans

99
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,860
are criticizing the event organizer online,

100
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,940
which is giving the brand a headache.

101
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,300
So,

102
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,490
they demand an explanation from us.

103
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,020
Did you find out the reason?

104
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,340
The construction team said

105
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,730
that they strictly followed

106
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,570
the construction plan and materials

107
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,820
in the plan we provided.

108
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,300
I asked the Evaluation Team to reassess the plan.

109
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,490
Our design does have problems with the weight balance.

110
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,140
There are problems with the center of gravity.

111
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,380
It's all my fault.

112
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,820
Sheng Yang

113
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,900
has never been in charge of offline activities,

114
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,220
so he may lack the experience.

115
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,940
Team Leader,

116
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,380
you personally approved

117
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,100
the design proposal before.

118
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,980
Yes, I didn't think there were problem with the proposal at the time,

119
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,100
but who knew so many fans would come?

120
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,580
Going onstage for a group photo would go over the weight capacity.

121
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,180
Haven't you thought about this?

122
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,660
Group photo with fans?

123
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,700
Did the client say

124
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,620
that there would be a group photo segment before?

125
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,780
The spokesperson arrived

126
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,860
and fans came to support her.

127
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,340
Isn't that normal?

128
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,490
Plus, it collapsed after only a dozen people went up there.

129
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,540
That can only mean

130
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,780
that the design is unreasonable.

131
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,530
Boss,

132
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,210
our design

133
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,780
strictly followed the Planners' proposal.

134
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,620
Before this, no one said

135
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,780
there would be so many people.

136
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,130
There must be something wrong with the construction plan.

137
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,980
Did anyone supervise the construction?

138
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,220
I did.

139
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,100
You didn't find anything wrong?

140
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,020
Then we only have ourselves to blame.

141
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,930
We didn't think it through.

142
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,020
The most difficult thing now is the client.

143
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,340
They keep asking me for an explanation.

144
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,340
What should I do?

145
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,340
Leave us.

146
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,540
Wang, stay here.

147
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,300
I heard that the brand has ordered

148
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,460
to fire the person in charge

149
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,730
to calm the fans down.

150
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,260
Our company has made a name for ourselves

151
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,690
in the industry this time.

152
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,820
It's not your fault.

153
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,820
There must be a reason.

154
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,180
It must be the construction.

155
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,340
Sheng Yang.

156
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,580
Sheng Yang.

157
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,580
The boss wants to see you.

158
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,900
Come, Sheng Yang.

159
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,940
Sit.

160
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,500
Sheng Yang.

161
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,780
The boss

162
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,810
told me about the client's attitude.

163
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,940
Now, they already have

164
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,220
the list of everyone who worked on this project.

165
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,820
Liu,

166
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,900
Zhao,

167
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,140
Song Chen,

168
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,020
you,

169
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,020
and Pan Rou.

170
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,220
This incident

171
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,700
is too serious.

172
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,540
The company

173
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,580
doesn't want anyone to be implicated,

174
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,420
but the client is very stubborn.

175
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,100
If we don't give them an explanation,

176
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,780
they will never forgive us.

177
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,100
Sheng Yang.

178
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,340
All these years,

179
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,140
I've seen

180
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,500
your work abilities in the company

181
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,900
and your character.

182
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,340
But this time,

183
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,700
no one can save you.

184
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
The company

185
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,140
will also have to pay

186
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,300
a high compensation fee.

187
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,300
Even if all of you

188
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,260
put in your bonuses and salaries,

189
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,420
it'll still be futile,

190
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,180
so I hope you can understand

191
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,140
the punishment we're giving you.

192
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,140
Sheng Yang,

193
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,810
as the project manager,

194
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,820
you have to take the main responsibility.

195
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,420
Besides deducting this month's salary and bonus,

196
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,220
you will also be fired.

197
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,740
The others will be criticized,

198
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,980
marked down,

199
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,300
and have this month's salary and bonus deducted.

200
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,740
Meanwhile,

201
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,620
as the supervisors of the later construction,

202
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,340
Song Chen and Pan Rou,

203
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,130
will also be fired.

204
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,380
I have no objection

205
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,500
to the company's decision.

206
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,860
I'm responsible

207
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,900
for this accident.

208
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,780
I have to take the main responsibility.

209
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,090
I participated in the entire process,

210
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,700
from the preliminary design

211
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,380
to the later construction.

212
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,130
Everyone

213
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,660
worked together

214
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,980
under my leadership.

215
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,300
So, they can't be blamed

216
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,890
for the incident.

217
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,780
Are you going to take full responsibility?

218
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,900
Liu and Zhao

219
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,860
had a lot of projects

220
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,220
that they were working on,

221
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,780
so they didn't focus much on the stage this time.

222
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:38,980
Song Chen

223
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,940
had his own project to complete too.

224
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,940
He didn't go to the venue too many times.

225
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,700
As for Pan Rou,

226
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,700
she doesn't know anything.

227
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,010
Basically, she just did

228
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,180
whatever I told her to do.

229
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,300
Boss,

230
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,100
I'm telling you this

231
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,900
just to

232
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,620
inform you about the situation.

233
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,380
I beg the company

234
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,060
not to punish the whole team

235
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,460
just because of me.

236
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,010
Besides, everyone has other projects they're working on.

237
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,780
Firing three people at once

238
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,580
will definitely affect the company's operations.

239
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,260
If the client needs an explanation,

240
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,660
just fire me.

241
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,500
I'm the one responsible.

242
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,940
This is my only request.

243
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,340
I hope you can pull yourself together.

244
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,820
Just take this as a small failure.

245
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,620
Did he really get fired?

246
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,700
I don't know.

247
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,580
Is there really no remedy?

248
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,220
Sheng Yang.

249
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,060
I’m leaving.

250
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,500
Take care.

251
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,300
Buckle down.

252
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,500
Boss.

253
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:21,740
If you're gone,

254
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,700
it's no fun to stay here

255
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,380
by myself.

256
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,300
You went to plead for me?

257
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,860
Of course.

258
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,620
Are you dumb?

259
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,020
I'm the head of the project.

260
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,060
It's natural for the company to fire me.

261
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,620
You have no idea

262
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,060
how long I begged them

263
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,220
before they agreed

264
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,300
to only fire me.

265
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:44,940
Look at you.

266
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,900
But they

267
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,050
fired you casually

268
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,180
without even investigating the cause of the accident.

269
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,500
Isn't it meaningless to stay here?

270
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,700
Let's go eat barbecue later.

271
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,250
You're still thinking of eating?

272
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,740
Look at the current employment situation.

273
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,060
At least one of us needs a job.

274
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,380
I really can't

275
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,180
watch you suffer alone.

276
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,460
I'll leave this box of stuff

277
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,780
with you for now.

278
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,700
When I find a new job,

279
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,570
I'll come take it back.

280
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,460
Okay.

281
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,820
By the way,

282
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,540
if Luo Meijuan asks,

283
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,380
you know what to say, right?

284
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,460
Don't worry.

285
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,060
Great.

286
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,540
What's wrong?

287
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,940
Why are you in such a bad condition?

288
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,620
My sister was injured on set.

289
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,860
She told me she was fine.

290
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,140
That means something must be up.

291
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,100
I wonder if I should go back and check on her.

292
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,980
Look at the time.

293
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,650
The subway is closed already

294
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,140
and we have class tomorrow morning.

295
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,540
Forget the class.

296
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,340
I'll take a taxi.

297
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,620
How about you lend me your motorcycle?

298
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,260
The taxi from school to my sister's place

299
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,180
costs more than 200 yuan.

300
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,860
Did you get the license?

301
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,620
I have good skills.

302
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,140
I don't need a license.

303
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:45,980
I...

304
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,060
The exam costs more than 1,000 yuan.

305
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,380
Are you gonna give me the money?

306
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,420
Fine.

307
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,380
I'll borrow from someone else.

308
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,580
Get changed.

309
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,980
Thank you, Captain Hao.

310
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,010
Captain, you’re so awesome.

311
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,730
You're the best captain in China.

312
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,620
Cut the crap.

313
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,460
Sit tight.

314
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,220
I know.

315
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,620
Yes.

316
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,900
It shouldn't affect things.

317
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,850
Okay, let's end it here.

318
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,260
Who is it?

319
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,180
Is anyone else there?

320
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,700
Yes,

321
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,780
there are a dozen or so people.

322
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,940
Come in and say hello.

323
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,420
Is your head okay?

324
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,460
I'm fine.

325
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,260
Why are you here so late?

326
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,420
Look at your outfit.

327
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,140
We look like a couple.

328
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,220
Who are you not a couple with?

329
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,330
Where is the pipe I put here?

330
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,450
Didn't you take it?

331
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,740
I haven't opened the box yet.

332
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,180
You cleaned up this room.

333
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,260
Not a single trace of me is left here.

334
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,980
Cut to the chase.

335
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,100
Originally,

336
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,780
I thought

337
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,060
I could just call you,

338
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,980
but this is your project.

339
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,460
I must talk to you in person.

340
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,980
I...

341
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,380
I was just with Mr. He.

342
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,020
Here.

343
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,140
What did he say?

344
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,980
I'm afraid

345
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,020
the project needs to be paused.

346
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,660
Is it just paused

347
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,940
or is it discontinued?

348
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,260
There's no way to continue.

349
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,140
They said

350
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,860
we must be replaced.

351
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,860
Otherwise, the spokesperson will stop filming.

352
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,220
They also brought up the contract.

353
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,980
We have no choice.

354
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,580
Well,

355
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,410
what about the funds we spent in the early stages?

356
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,780
They don't care.

357
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,940
They won't give us a single cent more either.

358
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,740
We have to return the deposit

359
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,060
they paid us too.

360
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,460
Return the deposit?

361
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,620
Why?

362
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,140
I know you are angry.

363
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,540
I'm angry too.

364
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,580
You just

365
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,020
got a bit better.

366
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,100
Let's not lose our temper, okay?

367
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,860
With this matter,

368
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,140
I want...

369
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,540
What do you want to do?

370
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,420
You want to fill this hole with your own money?

371
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,900
How did you know?

372
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:18,820
I...

373
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,860
I know you.

374
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,100
But this matter

375
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,530
doesn't make sense.

376
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,340
Yes.

377
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,980
There was an accident at the scene.

378
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,220
I should be responsible,

379
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,700
but

380
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,260
why should I return the deposit to him?

381
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,820
It's written clearly in the contract.

382
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,820
No matter what happens,

383
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,140
the deposit won't be returned.

384
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,660
Can't we all follow the contract?

385
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,940
Besides, I'm the only one

386
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,780
who got hurt in this accident.

387
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,220
There's an accident

388
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,050
and we take full responsibility.

389
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,420
But if the ad wins an award later,

390
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,780
they'll take all the credit.

391
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,180
Are they dreaming?

392
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,500
If that's the case,

393
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:52,860
then

394
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,980
I'll just film first.

395
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,420
They can pay us

396
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,090
when they're satisfied.

397
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:56,980
Why don't we do that?

398
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,140
What's the point of signing a contract?

399
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:58,860
No.

400
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,420
Why are you so hung up on this?

401
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,660
I'm not.

402
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,180
I'm being reasonable.

403
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,060
You don't have to tell me

404
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,980
to not offend anyone.

405
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,540
"Don't offend this, don't offend that.

406
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,420
Don't get into a big fight

407
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,940
because of a trivial matter,

408
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,780
or else no one will dare to work with us anymore."

409
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,460
Alright?

410
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,460
See, you do know this.

411
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,940
But I can't do it.

412
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,660
Xue, don't you think

413
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,380
they're being bullies?

414
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,140
Is it possible that it's because

415
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,900
we allow such bullying?

416
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,740
This is why they got used to it and became worse.

417
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,740
That's why people think

418
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,220
this is how the industry works.

419
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,220
How long have you been in this industry?

420
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,740
Why are you still acting like a little girl?

421
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,860
We need to be sensible.

422
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,620
Don't take it so seriously.

423
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,730
This isn't a trivial matter.

424
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,220
Aren't you going to

425
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,220
to fill the hole with your own money?

426
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,250
I know

427
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,090
how much money you have.

428
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,460
It's just the half of our savings that I gave you.

429
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,100
First, I don't want the company

430
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,900
to suffer losses because of me.

431
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,330
Second, I don't want

432
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,140
you and Liang Shanshan to take the blame for me.

433
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,140
Right? We're adults.

434
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,820
Let's not give up on money.

435
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,980
The deposit isn't much, but it's still money.

436
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,940
How about this?

437
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,340
I will

438
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,500
quit the company.

439
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,380
What are you talking about?

440
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,420
This happened because of me.

441
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,330
Get rid of me,

442
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,300
get rid of the source of the problem,

443
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,020
and the problem will be solved.

444
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,700
Tell Mr. He

445
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,620
I've reflected on myself.

446
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,820
To apologize,

447
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,100
I will quit the project

448
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,540
and also quit

449
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,660
from the company.

450
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,410
You'll be the new director.

451
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,930
The stage, props, and actors are all ready-made.

452
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,810
They don't need to find more people

453
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,380
or spend more money.

454
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,140
This way, the contract won't have to be voided

455
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,740
and this project won't be terminated either.

456
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,860
I'll just leave.

457
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,100
What are you doing?

458
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,020
Why do I think you're using this as an excuse

459
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,980
to leave the company

460
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,500
and leave me?

461
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,180
It's not serious to the point

462
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,340
that you have to leave the company, right?

463
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,180
Besides,

464
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,020
I'm a man.

465
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,220
If I put all the blame

466
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,220
on my ex-wife,

467
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,500
my reputation in the industry

468
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,740
will be ruined.

469
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,660
You didn't blame me.

470
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,690
I'm voluntarily resigning now.

471
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,940
Come on.

472
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,730
Those who know will understand you're compromising.

473
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,060
Those who don't know

474
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,980
will think you're the culprit, got it?

475
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,900
If you take the blame,

476
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,300
you won't be able to work

477
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,660
in this industry anymore.

478
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,220
What do you think we should do then?

479
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,900
No matter what, we can't do as you said.

480
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,220
You can't leave.

481
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,860
You don't want to leave me, right?

482
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,860
Is your brain alright?

483
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,780
Didn't you do a CT scan

484
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,980
and they said everything is alright?

485
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,700
What will happen if I leave the company?

486
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,930
Nothing much will happen,

487
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:53,980
right?

488
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,220
Anyway,

489
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,740
an ex-husband and ex-wife running a company together

490
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,380
just sounds

491
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,140
a little inappropriate.

492
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,820
Just

493
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,260
do as I say.

494
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,050
Just see this as me lending money to the company.

495
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,290
When the company gets rich in the future,

496
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,300
give me some more and that's that.

497
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,540
You...

498
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,140
You must be tired. Have a good rest.

499
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,220
I'm leaving.

500
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,130
Have a good rest.

501
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:42,940
Shuang,

502
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,300
you're here just in time.

503
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,540
Go take care of your sister.

504
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,500
Your sister

505
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:48,900
is not very calm right now.

506
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,380
Coming.

507
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,500
How come the school let you out in the middle of the night?

508
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,050
What did you do this time?

509
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,020
Where did you get hurt?

510
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,860
You and Xue Yiming went to the hospital one after another.

511
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,100
This divorce is bad luck.

512
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,220
Shut up.

513
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,220
You asked Hao Junjie

514
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,020
to give you a ride again?

515
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:33,900
Listen,

516
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,420
his uncle will come to me again.

517
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,660
You look fine.

518
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,900
Don't worry about me.

519
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,540
You won't get the inheritance even if I die.

520
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,620
No.

521
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,820
Stop pretending.

522
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,420
Do you need me to take care of you for a few days?

523
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,700
You came over here at this hour to tease me?

524
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,660
Who will take care of whom?

525
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,700
If you don't want to go to class,

526
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,860
I can help you drop out.

527
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,900
Just quit school.

528
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,860
I'm leaving.

529
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,740
Hurry back to school.

530
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,340
How long does it take

531
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,420
to do your hair in the morning?

532
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,860
We're leaving already?

533
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,380
It hasn't even been a minute.

534
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,060
She’s fine.

535
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,340
Lin.

536
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,140
So,

537
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,940
the remaining work

538
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,740
will be done in two days, right?

539
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,050
Check it for me.

540
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,820
Call Lele's mom.

541
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,660
Give her a call

542
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,020
to comfort her.

543
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,890
She's not hurt.

544
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,100
Ask her if the kid got scared.

545
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,220
Don't touch the set.

546
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,220
Keep all the sets.

547
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,020
Let me think about how to fix things.

548
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,900
You two

549
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,690
don't seem to be like

550
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,980
the sisters

551
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,460
in other families.

552
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,060
My sister has actually had a hard time.

553
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,060
She went to work in film crews as soon as she graduated.

554
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,300
She did all kinds of difficult and tiring work

555
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,780
and got bullied every day.

556
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,900
She couldn't even go home during the Spring Festival.

557
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,380
She didn't have a wedding when she got married

558
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,660
and didn't have kids either.

559
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,220
She has no concept of family either.

560
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,420
When I was little, my sister always told me

561
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,940
that no one is reliable in this world.

562
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,740
We can only rely on ourselves.

563
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,700
Don't hurt others and don't hinder yourself.

564
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,260
This is our family motto.

565
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,180
But don't you think

566
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,220
you'll feel lonely like this?

567
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,620
Everyone gets lonely.

568
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,260
Even the best relationships

569
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,620
will fall apart

570
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,380
at some point.

571
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
Take you for example.

572
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,380
Aren't you going abroad soon?

573
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,780
Anyway,

574
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,860
I’m glad to be able to meet you.

575
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,380
Captain Hao,

576
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,060
you...

577
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,660
After you leave,

578
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,340
everyone might miss you.

579
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,820
And...

580
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,780
One more thing.

581
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,380
It might be inappropriate

582
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,220
to say it now.

583
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:46,940
Say it.

584
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,380
You...

585
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,010
After you leave,

586
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,210
can you give me your motorcycle?

587
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,140
Yang is back?

588
00:34:59,260 --> 00:34:59,980
Mom, Dad.

589
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,620
Wash your hands. We're having dinner.

590
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,540
Yang, great timing.

591
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,100
You came just in time for dinner.

592
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,100
You're not working overtime today?

593
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,220
Come on. Hurry up.

594
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,980
Your mom made braised pork trotters with soybeans.

595
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,100
Hurry up.

596
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,660
You look tired.

597
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,340
Don't you get tired from work too?

598
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,850
Come on.

599
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,660
Drink with me.

600
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,180
Yang, you must be tired.

601
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,260
Your activity is finally over today, right?

602
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,180
Yes.

603
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,260
That's good.

604
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,580
Have a good rest today and sleep tight.

605
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,940
Tell me what you want to eat.

606
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,220
I'll cook for you tomorrow.

607
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,690
Mom,

608
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,650
the trotters are delicious.

609
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,220
You say it's delicious, but you haven't taken a bite yet.

610
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,540
Here.

611
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,180
It smells delicious.

612
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,180
Eat more.

613
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,980
There are more in the pot.

614
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,580
I'll get a small spoon.

615
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,140
Thank you, Mom.

616
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,900
Have some beans.

617
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,700
Take this.

618
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,660
Okay.

619
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:58,820
Eat up.

620
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,580
You too.

621
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,420
Do you want chili sauce?

622
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,650
No.

623
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,530
I want some.

624
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,700
Mom, I'm going to work.

625
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,380
Mom, Dad, I'm back.

626
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:18,940
You're back?

627
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,940
Yang is back.

628
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,380
Have you got your phone and keys?

629
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,020
Yes.

630
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,220
Mom, Dad, I'm back.

631
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,530
You're back.

632
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,860
Mom, I'm going to wash my hands.

633
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,340
Wash up.

634
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,540
Don't you think your son

635
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,650
is acting weird recently?

636
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,490
What's wrong?

637
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,170
Think about it.

638
00:37:59,010 --> 00:37:59,820
He's talking less.

639
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,100
Why isn't he working overtime anymore?

640
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,980
He didn't tell us

641
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,620
that his team leader gave him some other job either.

642
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,740
He just comes back in time for dinner every night.

643
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,090
We've used up so much of our rice.

644
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,660
Yang,

645
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,980
dinner will be ready in half an hour.

646
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,060
I need to go investigate.

647
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,380
I'm going to be late.

648
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,820
This...

649
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,460
Eat this on the go.

650
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,460
Bye-bye.

651
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:13,860
Okay.

652
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,780
Have you taken

653
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,380
your keys, phone, and wallet?

654
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,740
Yes. Don't worry.

655
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,980
Take care.

656
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:57,330
[Job hunting]

657
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,220
Come on. What are you doing?

658
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,170
Don't sell me out.

659
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,100
Bro, there's someone there.

660
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,420
Are you blind? What are you doing?

661
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,500
Wait a minute. I need to take this call.

662
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,780
Hello, Mrs. Sheng?

663
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,180
Hello, Song.

664
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,340
Are you busy?

665
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,020
Am I distburbing you?

666
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,460
No, no.

667
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,580
Let me tell you,

668
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,980
it feels really sweet to hear your voice.

669
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,420
Is something wrong?

670
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,860
Well, just now,

671
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,820
I messaged Yang.

672
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,260
He didn't reply.

673
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,260
I just wanted to ask

674
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,620
if he's in the company right now.

675
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,660
He didn't reply?

676
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,340
Yes, he's working overtime right now.

677
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,220
He's having a meeting with a colleague.

678
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,860
Let me call him for you.

679
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,820
No, no, no.

680
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,940
Don't bother him.

681
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,820
No need.

682
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,380
This isn't a bother.

683
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,460
Let me tell you.

684
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,020
You are definitely the priority

685
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,420
for him.

686
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,060
Wait a second. I’ll get him for you.

687
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,140
Yang? Sheng Yang?

688
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,460
Mrs. Sheng,

689
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,860
he might really be busy right now.

690
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,620
How about this?

691
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,900
When he's done,

692
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,460
I'll have him call you back right away, okay?

693
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,180
No, no, no.

694
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,380
Let him be busy.

695
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,060
Actually, you've all been working hard.

696
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,420
Working overtime every day

697
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,100
is not easy.

698
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,780
When can you all take a break?

699
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,100
We should be able to take a break

700
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,340
after these current projects.

701
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,900
That's good.

702
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,620
Let me tell you.

703
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,020
Yang's work

704
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,940
is always done

705
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,780
very well.

706
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,220
Our boss always praises him

707
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,660
for being hardworking.

708
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,100
Our boss is really satisfied with him.

709
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,180
He also said

710
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,940
that as long as we finish these projects,

711
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,300
he'll get a short break

712
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,780
so he can rest up,

713
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,060
so don't worry.

714
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,740
He won't get burned out.

715
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,740
Okay.

716
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,940
I understand.

717
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,610
Song,

718
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,580
come over when you have time.

719
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,970
Come visit us.

720
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,420
I'll cook you something delicious.

721
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,660
Okay, sure.

722
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,180
I'll go to your house when I'm free.

723
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,580
Okay, that's it.

724
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,940
Bye, Mrs. Sheng.

725
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,460
Okay, I'm back.

726
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,100
Bad news.

727
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,130
Your son

728
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,810
lost his job.
