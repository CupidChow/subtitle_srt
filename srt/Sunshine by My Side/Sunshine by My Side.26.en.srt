Sheng Yang.

6
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,020
Who is calling me?

7
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,170
I'm here.

8
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:45,660
You...

9
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:48,370
Jian...

10
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,860
Why did you drink so much?

11
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,740
I'm not drunk.

12
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,140
I...

13
00:01:59,259 --> 00:01:59,930
I don't need you to help me.

14
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,340
I...

15
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,060
I'm just

16
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,140
unhappy.

17
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,860
I'm sad, okay?

18
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,650
Why are you unhappy again?

19
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,300
Director Jian Bing.

20
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,260
If you are not satisfied with my creation,

21
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,260
you can just tell me, right?

22
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,380
You can just give me some suggestions, right?

23
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,180
I can revise it.

24
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,060
Right?

25
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,170
How could you give my creation

26
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,380
to your ex-husband?

27
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,970
You even asked your ex-husband to humiliate me.

28
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:26,660
I...

29
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,060
I didn't.

30
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,660
I've never seen your creation.

31
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,060
You know what?

32
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,500
For this advertisement,

33
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,380
I haven't slept well

34
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,060
for several days and nights.

35
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,500
I just want to finish it as soon as possible.

36
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,900
I just want to show it to you.

37
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,380
I just want you to know...

38
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,660
I just want you to know

39
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,700
that I can do it.

40
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,100
I can do it.

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,740
I...

42
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,180
Can you spit it out?

43
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,940
I don't need you to take care of me.

44
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,260
I'm fine.

45
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,660
I'm fine.

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,260
Yes.

47
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,260
We... We

48
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,140
made three rules.

49
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,180
We only talk about work.

50
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,900
We don't talk about love.

51
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,060
Never talk about love.

52
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,500
But I just...

53
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,740
can't help myself.

54
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,500
I just miss you.

55
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,460
I just like you.

56
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,780
You mentioned the pace.

57
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,660
You always said that.

58
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,180
You think I'm a slow runner, right?

59
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,130
Don't think I can't catch up with you.

60
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,020
I've been a fast runner since I was a kid.

61
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,700
Let me tell you.

62
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,180
Come on, let's have a competition.

63
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,340
Go up the stairs.

64
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,980
Let me show you.

65
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,100
Sheng Yang, I...

66
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,180
really...

67
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,130
Jian Bing, let me tell you.

68
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,290
I really didn't expect this.

69
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,100
I really didn't expect

70
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,500
I could meet you again after 10 years.

71
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,380
You have no idea how happy...

72
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,380
how happy... how happy I was.

73
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,540
I think luck finally came to me.

74
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,700
But then,

75
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,660
I was quite sad.

76
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,380
Because

77
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,980
you're different from what I imagined about you

78
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,060
10 years ago.

79
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,900
You've already said that.

80
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,260
You've said that.

81
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,660
I've said that?

82
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,780
Jian... Jian Bing.

83
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,100
Why are you here?

84
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,540
I'm here to save you.

85
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,659
Song Chen asked me to save you.

86
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,420
I know.

87
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,420
Did you think

88
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,300
I would run away with that woman...

89
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,659
that big shot?

90
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,180
You thought

91
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,260
I want to take a shortcut.

92
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,050
Am I that kind of person?

93
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,140
Of course not.

94
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,370
That's not what I thought.

95
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,860
I know. I know why you are here.

96
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,060
You are jealous, right?

97
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,420
What? I'm not jealous.

98
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,860
You are jealous.

99
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,740
You like me.

100
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,180
Say it.

101
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,260
Say it. You like me, right?

102
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,980
You like me. Say it.

103
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,720
You like...

104
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,540
I like you.

105
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,700
Didn't you want to have a running competition with me?

106
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,659
Come on.

107
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,300
It's true that I've been a fast runner since I was a kid.

108
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,659
-Let me tell you. Meijuan always said I run fast.
-Can...

109
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:51,140
You are...

110
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,260
Your task is to run up the stairs.

111
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,140
Okay?

112
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,300
Let's go up the stairs and see who is faster.

113
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,860
Ready, run!

114
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,220
Gosh, I...

115
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,180
How can I...

116
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,900
Get up.

117
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,500
You are not good at drinking wine and you came here to drink.

118
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,410
Let me practice drinking with you.

119
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,860
No.

120
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,660
No.

121
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,980
You can't drink.

122
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,380
If you drink too much,

123
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,100
you'll pull a long face.

124
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,620
You're the one pulling a long face.

125
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,220
I'll drink.

126
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,340
Let's drink.

127
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,060
Where are we going to have a drink?

128
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,060
Be good.

129
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,060
-Where are we going?
-One stair at a time.

131

Drink.

132
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,580
Where are we...

133
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:34,940
Walk.

134
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:35,820
Walk.

135
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:36,659
Walk.

136
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,140
Walk.

137
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,300
Okay, don't move.

138
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,540
This stair is a bit high.

139
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,659
Come on.

140
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:45,900
Go.

141
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,860
I can't take another step.

142

I can't take another step.

144
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,340
We're almost there. I can't take another step.

145
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,380
Me neither.

146
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,540
Don't throw up. Don't.

147
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,780
Hang in there.

148
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,980
Yes. Lean on my back. Move forward.

149
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,580
Move.

150
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,330
Don't get your whole body on my back.

151
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,050
Don't. Don't. Don't throw up.

152
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,180
This is not okay.

153
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:31,860
Change the posture.

154
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,580
The posture just now.

155
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,540
That one.

156
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,340
Take a step.

157
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,020
One, two, three.

158
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,860
Come on.

159
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Gosh.

160
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,380
I should have hired

161
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,100
a truck

162
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,620
to take you back.

163
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,700
Come on.

164
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,540
Bend your arms.

165
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,420
Come on.

166
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,580
Don't go.

167
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,860
Don't go.

168
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,700
Yes.

169
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,740
Be good and sleep.

170
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,540
Don't make a sound.

171
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:48,560
[Shooting script]

172
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,370
Sister.

173
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,180
I need to use the bathroom.

174
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,620
Sister.

175
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,420
I can't get up.

176
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,460
Give me a hand.

177
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,780
Sister.

178
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,940

179
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,700
Gosh.

180
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,340
Captain,

181
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,530
my sister just ignored me.

182
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,220
None of you came.

183
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,180
I have to go to the bathroom myself.

184
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,500
If I stand up on my own later,

185
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,940
I'll let you know.

186
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,220
You...

187
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,940
slept here

188
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,540
all night?

189
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,420
You occupied my bed. Where should I sleep?

190
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,740
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,660
I drank too much last night.

192
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,180
Is that all you're sorry about?

193
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,460
Did I talk nonsense?

194
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,340
You don't remember?

195
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,540
Fine.

196
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,060
Forget it.

197
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,340
I haven't forgotten all of it.

198
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,940
I still remember something.

199
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,850
Did you promise me something?

200
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,020
I've revised the plan.

201
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,620
Thank you, Director Jian.

202
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,380
Is that all?

203
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,060
Shouldn't you treat me to a meal,

204
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,300
a cup of coffee,

205
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,940
or a massage?

206
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,060
Okay.

207
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,170
You can have as much Luosifen as you want.

208
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,020
Go home now.

209
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,180
You didn't go home all night.

210
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,780
My sister and brother-in-law must be worried.

211
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,380
Do you really want to be my aunt?

212
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,380
Hurry up and move.

213
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,620
Are you two ghosts? You scared me.

214
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,660
You

215
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,940
didn't come home last night.

216
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,060
Did you

217
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:47,860
and she...

218
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,540
Tell me.

219
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,020
Did you get any investment?

220
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,580
No.

221
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,620
The salon last night

222
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,420
was different from what I thought.

223
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,060
But

224
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,780
I have good news.

225
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,810
Jian Bing promised me.

226
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,660
You mean...

227
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,660
She promised to be the director of our film.

228
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,500
Then

229
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,060
last night,

230
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,730
did you and she...

231
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,220
What are you thinking?

232
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,250
You're dirty.

233
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,060
So dirty!

234
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,940
Just kidding.

235
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:25,820
Well.

236
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,340
What's the price? Is it expensive?

237
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,660
There is a reason for being expensive.

238
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,620
Think about it.

239
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,540
You can travel even though you don't have enough money.

240
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,740
We can shoot a film even though we don't have enough money.

241
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,620
So many short video creators

242
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,740
have shot cheap films, right?

243
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,180
We can do it too.

244
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,180
You mean you want to do it in a small and beautiful way?

245
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,780
The office location is in my home for now.

246
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,180
We need to save as much as we can.

247
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,540
We can officially prepare for it

248
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,940
from today on.

249
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,180
What do you think?

250
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,180
Let's do it.

251
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,380
Cut the crap. Just do it.

252
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,540
-Just do it. Come on.
-Just do it.

253
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,790
Shush.

254
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,300
Musk. Sheng Yang.

255
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,620
You are having a meeting in the bathroom.

256
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,940
Don't you think it stinks?

257
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,180
Is it proper?

258
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,890
We'll be out soon, Dad.

259
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,940
Get to work.

260
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,100
Let's go.

261
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,180
Get to work.

262
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,660
Who is he?

263
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,010
Who do you mean? You look surprised.

264
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,060
The man who slept here last night.

265
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,810
I saw it.

266
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,660
My colleague was drunk. I helped him.

267
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,180
Did...

268
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,940
Did you

269
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,780
do anything stupid after getting drunk?

270
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,180
I didn't drink.

271
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,060
He looks younger than me.

272
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,100
Younger than you?

273
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,530
How old are you?

274
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,140
You are 20, right?

275
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,890
He is 6 or 7 years older than you.

276
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,220
How...

277
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,540
How did you know each other?

278
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,740
Through work.

279
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,500
That's why we're colleagues.

280
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,340
Is it

281
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,780
really not that kind of relationship between you two?

282
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,980
What kind of relationship? Why did you make a gesture?

283
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,380
Stop talking to me.

284
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,500
I can't focus on putting on makeup.

285
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,570
I knew it.

286
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,300
His age is not suitable.

287
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,380
Sister,

288
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,780
I have to say this.

289
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,020
What's so good about him?

290
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,330
Being young is his only advantage.

291
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,900
There are so many handsome young boys like him.

292
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,500
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

293
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,460
Mr. Fang is here.

294
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,940
Dress yourself up.

295
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,980
Coming.

296
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:10,980
Morning, Jian Bing.

297
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,460
Morning.

298
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,010
Jian Shuang.

299
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,020
You can walk with a walking stick today.

300
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,940
Yes, I was about to tell you.

301
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,700
Well,

302
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,580
from tomorrow on,

303
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,380
I'll take Jian Shuang to the college and pick her up.

304
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,460
Well,

305
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,180
I...

306
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,380
buy you some breakfast on my way here.

307
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,260
You must be hungry.

308
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,700
Mr. Fang is so sweet.

309
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,860
My sister is hungry.

310
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,260
Right?

311
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,380
Who said I'm hungry?

312
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,740
If you're not hungry, why did you take him home?

313
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,900
Well,

314
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,420
Mr. Fang,

315
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,260
please take Jian Shuang to the college today.

316
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,060
Thank you. I'm in a hurry to go to work.

317
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,780
I need to get changed now.

318
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,140
Not at all. Don't stand on ceremony.

319
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,500
Mr. Fang,

320
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,860
I have to remind you.

321
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,980
You have a competitor now.

322
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,130
What competitor?

323
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,220
Morning.

324
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,020
-Jian Bing.
-Morning, Director Jian.

325
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,700
Morning, Youyou.

326
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,020
Jian Bing.

327
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:03,820
Morning.

328
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,500
Jian Bing.

329
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,380
You didn't see anything.

330
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,580
You are here.

331
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,900
Well,

332
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,900
I have a project for you. Look.

333
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,300
I came straight to you.

334
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,500
And the offer is very satisfying.

335
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,900
Let's just...

336
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,140
take a look.

337
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,860
You don't like this?

338
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,260
It's okay.

339
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,900
I have another project.

340
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,330
I've looked through

341
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,780
this project.

342
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,380
It suits you very well.

343
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,260
It's definitely the feeling you like.

344
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,940
Take a look.

345
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,090
It's okay. I have another one if you don't like this.

346
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,780
Did you eat too much in the morning?

347
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,940
You finally talk to me.

348
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,300
I have schedules.

349
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,460
If it can wait,

350
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:31,940
just wait.

351
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,740
If it can't wait,

352
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,530
I can't accept it.

353
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,340
What project?

354
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,940
I accepted Sheng Yang's project.

355
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,050
Do you plan

356
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:40,700
to help him?

357
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,570
It's cooperation.

358
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,780
And I don't want to be distracted.

359
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,540
Well. You are still mad at me.

360
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,620
Well, about last night...

361
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,700
Well...

362
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,580
It was a misunderstanding.

363
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,700
I wronged him.

364
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,980
Ms. Qi called me later to explain it.

365
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,460
Well. We can't let go of these profitable projects, right?

366
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,340
His project

367
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,180
is small and unimportant.

368
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,980
Why did you accept it?

369
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,180
Because I'm happy.

370
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,540
I've seen his creativity.

371
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,220
I think it's good.

372
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:11,820
I want to do it.

373
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,500
That's all.

374
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,100
His studio...

375
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,500
No.

376
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,700
That's not even a studio, right?

377
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,500
It's just a small stall.

378
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,180
He doesn't have manpower,

379
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,700
equipment,

380
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,980
or an office location.

381
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,980
What were you thinking?

382
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,500
Jian Yi had nothing

383
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,860
when it was established, right?

384
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,140
It was also a stall.

385
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,820
All right, you...

386
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,860
If you're free,

387
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:41,700
take a look at the projects.

388
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,060
We'll talk about it later.

389
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,540
What do you think?

390
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,580
You played well.

391
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,460
Much better than before.

392
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,380
I haven't played the last few parts.

393
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,330
Sorry.

394
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,060
I was distracted.

395
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,380
Let me tune the piano for you.

396
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,060
I don't think I'll have a chance to come again.

397
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,820
Mr. Fang,

398
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,180
don't be upset.

399
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,900
You have to be strong.

400
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,090
When you compete with a post-95s man,

401
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,620
you shouldn't be afraid of losing face.

402
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,420
You are thinking about being civilized and polite.

403
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,060
But he occupied her bed.

404
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,140
What did you say?

405
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,490
Don't think too much.

406
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,260
Well,

407
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,460
according to my observation,

408
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,620
I think he hasn't succeeded yet.

409
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,500
The boy you mentioned

410
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,140
is tall

411
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,780
and

412
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,700
looks young, right?

413
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,980
In girls' eyes,

414
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,250
he looks quite handsome, right?

415
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,260
You've seen him before?

416
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,740
Mr. Fang,

417
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,540
I hate to say this.

418
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,260
If you keep being like this,

419
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,820
you can only find a wife through blind dates.

420
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,820
And you'll live like this

421
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,820
for the rest of your life.

422
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:31,980
Jian Shuang,

423
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,220
you missed a lot of lessons

424
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,700
recently.

425
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,060
If you have any question, come to me anytime.

426
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,780
You can also come to me

427
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,500
even if it's not related to your study.

428
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,220
Okay.

429
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,500
Later,

430
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,140
I'll send you my sister's schedule.

431
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,220
Hello, Mr. Pei.

432
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:09,980
Here's the thing.

433
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,020
We are

434
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,340
a newly established advertising company.

435
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,860
We accepted...

436
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,020
well...

437
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,540
a public service advertisement project.

438
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,860
Next week.

439
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,980
What will be the result?

440
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:20,980
He can't come.

441
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,020
He is not okay with the date.

442
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,980
Ask about these two photo studios.

443
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,580
Hello.

444
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,060
The photo studios?

445
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,660
Yes, ask them.

446
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,380
Yes, is this Juyuan Zhongxin?

447
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,140
Hello, we are

448
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,860
an advertising company.

449
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,140
We want to shoot a public service advertisement next week.

450
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,980
We are

451
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,220
from Moses Advertisement.

452
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,740
May I ask...

453
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,260
Yes.

454
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,540
We're a new company.

455
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,220
Here's the thing.

456
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,780
About garbage sorting,

457
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,060
I'm wondering if you are interested in it.

458
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,850
Is this Imagined Space?

459
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,540
Budget.

460
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,380
Design.

461
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,860
Here's the thing.

462
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,380
We want to ask about the photo studios...

463
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,220
You can ask Pan Rou about things related to the project.

464
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,420
Sorry.

465
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,380
Please wait a moment.

466
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,660
Next week. Probably we need to use it

467
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,980
for a week.

468
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,460
Four days? Four days.

469
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,380
Yes.

470
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,050
What is this?

471
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,020
Zoomer.

472
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,140
Zoomer?

473
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,460
Are you here to take a look at the equipment?

474
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,660
Yes, we're here to take a look at the equipment.

475
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,380
Help yourself.

476
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,300
Okay, thank you.

477
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,740
They are here to rent the equipment?

478
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,300
This place has all kinds of equipment.

479
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,660
Keep an eye on them.

480
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,340
18, 20, 10.

481
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,180
This place is nice.

482
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,180
How much does it cost per day?

483
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,220
Ask him.

484
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,780
I want to ask

485
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,660
how much it costs to rent this for a day.

486
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,980
Do you have a price list?

487
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,900
Show us.

488
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,540
Here.

489
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,340
Thank you.

490
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,380
So expensive.

491
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,980
It will cost tens of thousands yuan.

492
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,460
How about...

493
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,060
Yes, we'll think about it.

494
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,860
We'll think about it.

495
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,900
Yes, thank you.

496
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,860
Thank you.

497
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,100
Let's go to the next place.

498
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,420
Well. The equipment is nice.

499
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,820
I want to ask

500
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,300
how much it costs to rent this studio for a day.

501
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,740
15,000 yuan.

502
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,420
I'm allowed

503
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,180
to give you a 2% discount.

504
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,540
What do you think?

505
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,220
It's good.

506
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,020
We'll think about it.

507
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:28,700
Yes.

508
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,900
Okay, we're leaving. We won't bother you.

509
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:31,980
Okay.

510
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,460
Okay.

511
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,220
-Bye.
-Thank you.

512
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,600
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

513
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,970
Live action and animation.

514
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,020
The equipment plays a crucial role.

515
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,170
If we shoot the film too roughly,

516
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,460
post-production will be very difficult.

517
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,100
So we have to choose

518
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,620
nice equipment.

519
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,980
Lighting is also necessary

520
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,620
for shooting a film.

521
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,340
The images are the most important in terms of shooting an advertisement.

522
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,140
Right?

523
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,460
How about giving up our salary?

524
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,020
Well.

525
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,540
You still want your salary?

526
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,540
I've never counted it in.

527
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,020
Yang,

528
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,660
can you negotiate with the director

529
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,100
and let her give us a discount?

530
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,540
It's for the sake of the studio.

531
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,860
This is all we have.

532
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,140
What can we do?

533
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,260
We can give her the rest later.

534
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,340
We're friends anyway.

535
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,620
She has done me a favor by agreeing to be the director.

536
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,420
We should

537
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,780
pay the director fees as we agreed on.

538
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,620
Actually, I thought about it.

539
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,220
Look.

540
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,740
We don't

541
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,100
need to pay CG fees.

542
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,530
I can do it myself.

543
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,260
Don't worry.

544
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,540
I'll finish it

545
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,820
even if I have to stay up late.

546
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,050
That's still not enough.

547
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,860
Give it to me.

548
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,740
What?

549
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,860
Your private coffer.

550
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,820
I don't have a private coffer.

551
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,860
No?

552
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,460
Luo Meijuan, you...

553
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,620
You...

554
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,700
You...

555
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,420
Hold the flashlight.

556
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,300
Turn it on.

557
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,210
Luo Meijuan.

558
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,860
When the water is crystal clear, there is no fish in it.

559
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,220
When did you find out?

560
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,060
I didn't expose you

561
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,020
because I know

562
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,300
you won't take the money out.

563
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,500
I did the math for you.

564
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,420
You have 30,000 yuan at least.

565
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,420
You have over 20,000 yuan

566
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,260
in the money management service in your mobile phone.

567
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,380
Plus interest,

568
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,860
you should have 32,000 yuan.

569
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,020
No more than 200 yuan more or less.

570
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,220
Am I right?

571
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,340
I don't have that much.

572
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,540
Fine.

573
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,020
I'm going to the balcony now

574
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,700
to turn the soil for your plants.

575
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,780
What for?

576
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,020
It'll just make my plants dead.

577
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,180
Do you think money can be hidden there?

578
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,220
I did hide money. I hid it all here.

579
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,620
I only have more than 5,000 yuan.

580
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,180
How much more?

581
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,140
Less than 20,000 yuan.

582
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,300
Let's count it.

583
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,700
30,000 yuan. Exactly 30,000 yuan.

584
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,860
I don't have 32,000 yuan.

585
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,700
This is killing me.

586
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,500
This is an unusual period.

587
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,460
What unusual period?

588
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,940
It's sunny.

589
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,780
What's unusual?

590
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,610
Your son is starting a business.

591
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,060
He's your only son.

592
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,220
Can you bear to see him worried

593
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,020
every day?

594
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,380
My son is starting a business.

595
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,540
You can just ask me to give him money.

596
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,300
Look at what you just did.

597
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,940
Even if I don't have extra money,

598
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,700
I have to support him, right?

599
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,810
You can't just ask me to give him money.

600
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,860
That's your son too.

601
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,180
Shouldn't you support him?

602
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,740
How do you know I won't support him?

603
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,090
For my son,

604
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,540
I can donate blood.

605
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,500
Can you?

606
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,700
Donating blood is not really necessary.

607
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,420
If it's still not enough, I can think of another way.

608
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,700
You have another way?

609
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,740
No, no.

610
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,690
What else can I do? This is all I have.

611
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,700
What else can I do?

612
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,660
Do your things.

613
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,220
I'll bring it to you

614
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,580
when I sort it out.

615
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,380
Transfer the money.

616
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,740
Sure. Of course.

617
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,010
Transfer it to me on WeChat.

618
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,300
Immediately.

619
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,540
Don't rummage through my stuff.

620
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,970
I don't have privacy at all.

621
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,900
[Luo Meijuan]

622
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,760
[WeChat Transfer]

623
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,610
Go thank your dad.

624
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,860
Don't stay here. It's smoky here.

625
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,179
I thought you two didn't agree to let me start a business.

626
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,739
Does it matter if we disagree?

627
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,179
Tell me honestly.

628
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,500
Did you take money

629
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,460
from our family's savings to help me?

630
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,219
Just take it.

631
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,530
You don't spend money randomly.

632
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,660
Don't you think your mom knows that?

633
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,220
It's fine.

634
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,940
If it's not enough, we still have a loan.

635
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,500
Your dad did that

636
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,140
when he was young.

637
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,380
We only had 170,000 yuan.

638
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,460
He used it to run a restaurant.

639
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,940
But eventually,

640
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,780
he lost everything.

641
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,170
Even so, I didn't say anything.

642
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,980
Our family ran a restaurant?

643
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,780
Of course.

644
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,020
Do you think you grew up by eating swine feed?

645
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,620
I learned my cooking skills from those chefs.

646
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,060
Why have I never heard you two mention it?

647
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,460
When I was young,

648
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,380
I was much more audacious than you.

649
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,060
I did whatever was popular.

650
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,620
But I was not lucky.

651
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,260
I suffered losses no matter what I did.

652
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,530
Otherwise,

653
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,540
you would have been the son of a rich family now.

654
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,180
What's so good about being the son of a rich family?

655
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,210
Even if I want to be rich, I have to make it happen on my own.

656
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,140
Tell me the truth.

657
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,060
Why do you want to start a business?

658
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,060
Is it because of some girl?

659
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:01,620
Mom,

660
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,540
I want to start a business for myself,

661
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,380
not for others.

662
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,220
You're right.

663
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,740
You should work hard

664
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,380
for yourself,

665
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,050
not for some girl.

666
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,460
Nowadays, girls

667
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,260
don't have the obligation to grow up with you.

668
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,940
I know.

669
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,180
Actually, I just

670
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,220
want to try to reach a higher level

671
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,540
when I'm still young.

672
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,180
Mom,

673
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,940
I'm not afraid of hardships.

674
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,220
I'm not afraid of losing either.

675
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,380
But I'm afraid of staying where I am and never moving forward.

676
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,740
What makes me more afraid is

677
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,860
I have already got used to

678
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,380
staying where I am.

679
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,380
Well said.

680
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,940
This is my son.

681
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,540
That's right.

682
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,260
If you don't work hard when you are young,

683
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,260
when will you work hard?

684
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:38,940
Right?

685
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:40,940
But

686
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,060
starting a business is difficult.

687
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,460
I will be worried about you.

688
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,740
Your dad and I

689
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,100
have never thought about

690
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,860
what kind of person we want you to be.

691
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,420
I know.

692
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,180
You just want me to be safe

693
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,380
and healthy.

694
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,780
And happy.

695
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,540
Okay. And happy.

696
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,740
We have nothing to give you.

697
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,730
And we can't offer you great help.

698
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,700
Your dad and I are just ordinary people.

699
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,220
We have no right to force you to be successful.

700
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:13,980
Mom,

701
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,180
if you say that again,

702
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,260
I'll get angry.

703
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,420
You and my dad have given me enough.

704
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,300
Look.

705
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,180
The ingredients are ready.

706
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,540
It's up to me

707
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,060
whether I can make a dish.

708
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,700
From now on,

709
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,780
no matter what I do,

710
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,620
it's my own choice.

711
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,020
I won't regret it.

712
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,460
In my eyes,

713
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,210
you and my dad are the best two chefs in the world.

714
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,740
So don't worry.

715
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,660
No matter what will happen in the future,

716
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,370
I will try my best

717
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,780
and I won't let you down.

718
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,220
Since you said that,

719
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,380
I'm relieved.

720
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,380
I'll count on you from now on.

721
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,380
Of course.

722
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,460
Well,

723
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,380
let me help you.

724
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,380
What do you need me to do?

725
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,780
Aren't you going to thank him?

726
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,140
He's busy.

727
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,210
I'll go later.

728
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:07,940
Here.

729
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,140
-Wash what?
-Wash this first.

730
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:09,940
Wash these vegetables?

731
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,300
Yes.

732
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,260
Why hasn't she arrived yet?

733
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,900
Stop doing what you are doing.

734
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,700
You're the prettiest in this room.

735
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,860
Welcome.

736
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,380
Hello, Miss.

737
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,140
May I ask...

738
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,100
Hello, am I late?

739
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,580
No, we arrived early.

740
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,020
What would you like to drink?

741
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,060
Water will do.

742
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:52,460
Mr. Sheng, do you think we don't exist?

743
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,980
Let me introduce.

744
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,140
This is Song Chen.

745
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,180
You've seen him before.

746
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,980
This is Pan Rou.

747
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,300
She is also my former colleague.

748
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,100
I don't need to introduce her, right?

749
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,940
She's a famous director, Jian Bing.

750
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,780
Let's welcome her with a round of applause.

751
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,150
Shush.

752
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,100
Director Jian,

753
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,650
thank you for helping him last time.

754
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,980
Otherwise,

755
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,300
Yang would have sacrificed his body.

756
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,900
Are you that brave?

757
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,100
He's like a kitten only in front of you.

758
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,460
I think he's like a lamb.

759
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,570
What nonsense are you talking about?

760
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,260
Isn't a puppy more suitable?

761
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,780
Let's get to the point, okay?

762
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:28,780
Director Jian Bing,

763
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,140
last time,

764
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,340
you asked me to revise the script.

765
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,460
I've revised it.

766
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,100
Have you read it?

767
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,740
Yes.

768
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,540
It's good.

769
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,460
Actually, I think...

770
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,460
the problem is this.

771
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:41,970
Well,

772
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,300
live shots are not difficult.

773
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,740
But I saw your visual effect reference.

774
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,340
Are you referring to Hollywood?

775
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,260
Have you ever made a budget for visual effect?

776
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,380
Yes.

777
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,740
This time, we really want to

778
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,860
create a wonderful product.

779
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,380
But what we are most worried about

780
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,540
is not visual effect.

781
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,900
I can handle visual effect.

782
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,660
I can do it myself.

783
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,500
The biggest problem

784
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,420
we are facing

785
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,860
is in the preparation period and shooting period.

786
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,900
It costs at least 10,000 yuan a day.

787
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,580
Right?

788
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,020
We can still finish shooting even if you want to save money.

789
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:14,980
I just think

790
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,890
it will be the first film you make independently,

791
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,380
and it's a public service advertisement,

792
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:19,980
right?

793
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,580
In fact, the content is more important.

794
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,100
Besides,

795
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,260
you have me.

796
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:27,740
Yes.

797
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,180
And the scene.

798
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:29,780
As for the scene,

799
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,260
we want to create

800
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,260
a scientific garbage disposal station.

801
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,420
If you want to set up a scene in the studio,

802
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,540
it will be very expensive.

803
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,380
You have to look for a real scene,

804
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,300
like an abandoned factory.

805
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,580
Thank you, Director Jian.

806
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:42,700
Thank you, Director Jian.

807
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,820
Saying "thank you" is not enough.

808
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,540
Order something. Order some food.

809
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,410
Order something to eat.

810
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,220
What's wrong?

811
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,490
Take a look.

812
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,700
What's wrong with you?

813
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,740
Let the director order.

814
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,260
Director, what do you want to eat?

815
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,060
Let me order.

816
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,460
Is there anything that you don't eat?

817
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:03,690
No.

818
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:04,660
No.

819
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,210
Then I'm gonna order whatever I like, okay?

820
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,180
Okay.

821
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,090
Order whatever you like.

822
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,020
Order whatever you like.

823
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,460
Coming.

824
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,010
What would you like?

825
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,290
Hello, the first pasta.

826
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,020
Okay.

827
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,530
What about you?

828
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,740
I want this pasta too.

829
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,780
Me too.

830
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,700
I want the same too.

831
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,300
Four servings of pasta, right?

832
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,660
Do you need anything else?

833
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,260
A salad

834
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,300
with a lot of vegetables.

835
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:31,860
Please wait a moment.

836
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,020
Thank you.

837
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,620
Have you found an actor?

838
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,860
Just a kid, right?

839
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,620
Yes.

840
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,180
We haven't found one yet.

841
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,060
It's hard to find a child actor now.

842
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,170
I've been interviewing kids recently.

843
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,380
It's really intractable.

844
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,020
The parents of those kids

845
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,020
probably hope their kids will become actors

846
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,060
in the future

847
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,860
or

848
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,180
have this kind of experience when they are little.

849
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,820
So they have taught their kids to be very mature.

850
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,770
They are not like kids anymore.

851
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,340
I know. They are

852
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,140
no longer naive.

853
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:02,840
Yes.

854
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,380
The child in the film must be

855
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,660
plain and natural.

856
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,060
Yes.

857
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,260
The prototype of the boy

858
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,490
in my previous script

859
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:11,420
is

860
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,740
short and fat.

861
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,780
He has big eyes

862
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,300
and is innocent.

863
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:15,940
He has a sense of innocence.

864
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,300
I think it can move the audience.

865
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,060
So innocent children

866
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,060
should be short and fat.

867
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,740
No.

868
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,300
And they have big eyes.

869
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:21,610
Yes.

870
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,780
That's not what I meant.

871
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,700
I just want to hear the director's opinion.

872
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,380
My opinion?

873
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,780
You have unknowingly made it more difficult for yourself.

874
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,420
It's fine, I think.

875
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,170
Oh right.

876
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,180
You can take a look at my director's presentation.

877
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,170
I'm going to talk to her.

878
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,180
Salad.

879
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,570
Hello.

880
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:46,660
Hello.

881
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,620
I'm here

882
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,380
to pay the bill first.

883
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,060
The gentleman sitting next to you

884
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,420
came to me just now

885
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,380
and said the bill of your table can only be paid by him today.

886
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,780
The bill can't be paid by anyone else.
