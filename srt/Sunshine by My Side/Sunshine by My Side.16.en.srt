[Sunshine by My Side]

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,980
[Episode 16]

4
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,460
Look at the bad idea you came up with.

5
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,289
When we go back later,

6
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,300
we will definitely get a lashing.

7
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,180
It might be a good situation too.

8
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,060
That'd depend on your uncle.

9
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,380
My sister

10
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,380
doesn't know which floor I live in.

11
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,420
She can't do anything to me.

12
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,300
If you can improve your grades,

13
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,860
your sister will definitely spare you.

14
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,860
It's all your fault.

15
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,220
Do I have to be tutored everyday in the future?

16
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,910
Damn it.

17
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,060
Pass the ball!

18
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,100
Give it to me.

19
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,380
Hurry up!

20
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,980
What are you doing?

21
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,060
Pass it away!

22
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,100
Give it to me. I'm here.

23
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,620
Let's go.

24
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,300
Let's go back.

25
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,500
Where did you pass it to?

26
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,740
What are you doing?

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,220
It didn't go in again.

28
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,180
Let's go.

29
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,860
What are they even doing?

30
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,930
They're just kids.

31
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,300
They're just having fun.

32
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,100
So what if they are kids?

33
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,300
How embarrassing.

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,740
Look at that fall.

35
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,940
Then what?

36
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,460
Are you going to break in and bully the kids?

37
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,020
I'm not.

38
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,100
Kids, come after me.

39
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,660
Hurry up, kid.

40
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:40,780
Kids, chase me!

41
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,290
Go up.

42
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,540
Yes!

43
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,500
Hurry up.

44
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,450
Speed up.

45
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,420
Speed up.

46
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,100
Speed up.

47
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,380
Hurry up, kid.

48
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,540
Hurry up.

49
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,820
Over there.

50
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,560
Good! Come on!

51
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,750
Come on!

52
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,870
Go over there!

53
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:55,940
Attention!

54
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,860
Speed up!

55
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,570
Hurry up, kid.

56
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,850
Come on, snatch it.

57
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,380
Kid, this way.

58
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:02,980
Here, catch the ball.

59
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,740
Come on!

60
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,540
Go up.

61
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:05,890
Speed up!

62
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,540
Nice!

63
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,260
Steal it!

64
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,140
Kid!

65
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,860
Go after him!

66
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,580
This way.

67
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,740
Go forward!

68
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,900
Happy?

69
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,020
Come back with me to study.

70
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,660
What's the rush?

71
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,740
Let's play a little longer.

72
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,500
You go return the equipment.

73
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,860
The kids are still here. We can't leave.

74
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,300
Old Hen.

75
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,620
Did Sheng Yang quarrel with Director Jian?

76
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,500
Why has he been in such a bad mood recently?

77
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,500
Kinda...

78
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,140
But the projects we collaborated on previously

79
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,540
has already ended.

80
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,660
Why are they still quarreling?

81
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,220
It's not about work.

82
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,060
Then what is it?

83
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,460
Stop asking.

84
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,900
Does he like her?

85
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,140
What do you think?

86
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,890
Did he get rejected?

87
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,540
Tell me!

88
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,500
If she agreed,

89
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,700
would Sheng Yang

90
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,620
work this hard everyday?

91
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,980
It's like he's on steroids.

92
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,459
He didn't even slip a wink.

93
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,260
Say,

94
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,140
isn't the world just a circle?

95
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,860
We all fall in love with people who don't like us.

96
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,780
No matter how good you are,

97
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,900
they won't see your strengths.

98
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,740
Old Hen,

99
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,860
Why haven't you worn

100
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,340
the clothes I bought for you?

101
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,740
I even brought the bag you bought for me today.

102
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,100
Do you think I have a bad taste?

103
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,860
No.

104
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,300
I'm not–

105
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,540
If you don't like it, return it early.

106
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,380
Don't regret it after a week.

107
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,100
S-stand there.

108
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,900
Give me a chance to talk.

109
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,620
Who says I'm not wearing it?

110
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,620
Two caramel macchiato, please.

111
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,100
Okay, just a moment.

112
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:54,520
[Jian Bing: I saw you at the venue today. You got a new project?]

113
00:05:56,409 --> 00:06:00,190
[Sheng Yang: How are you today?]

114
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:08,630
[Typing...]

115
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:18,340
[Jian Bing: I wanted to say hello. But you disappeared. Are you hiding from me?]

116
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,390
[Typing...]

117
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:30,560
[Sheng Yang: Have you eaten?]

118
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,940
Test, test,

119
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,900
one, two.

120
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,180
One, two, three. One, two, three.

121
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,860
Does it sound fine?

122
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,060
Why does it sound so muffled?

123
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,060
It's not.

124
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,940
Are you too tired?

125
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,580
Let's go back and rest.

126
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,420
Come back tomorrow.

127
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,700
I'm fine.

128
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,740
You two go back first.

129
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,020
Let me adjust it a little more.

130
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,020
You've been staying up for days.

131
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,780
Your body won't be able to take it if you go on like this.

132
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,740
Yes.

133
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,940
Why don't we have supper?

134
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,780
You two go ahead.

135
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,340
Remember to get the receipt. The company will reimburse it.

136
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,380
He just got his confession rejected.

137
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,060
He left me alone in front of the exhibition

138
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,660
but I still went to work.

139
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,420
The whole world knows that I like him.

140
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,620
But I'm not as grumpy all day long like he is.

141
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,740
Some people cry when they are heartbroken.

142
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,660
Some people eat when they are heartbroken.

143
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,900
And some get themselves drunk when they are heartbroken.

144
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,460
Now I know what kind of person Sheng Yang is.

145
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,100
Which kind?

146
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,420
Workaholic

147
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,060
who'd work himself to death.

148
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,980
I see it too.

149
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,140
Let's go.

150
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,620
Thank you.

151
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,300
We're leaving.

152
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,980
We're going. Go home early.

153
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,020
Do you hear me?

154
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:49,780
Bye bye.

155
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,460
Bye bye.

156
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,340
Test.

157
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,140
Test.

158
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,180
One, two, three.

159
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,860
One, two, three. One, two.

160
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,780
Director.

161
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,580
He was Mr. Huang mentor.

162
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,610
Be careful.

163
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,980
Director Jian.

164
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,380
Didn't you check the weather forecast today?

165
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,700
It's been a whole day.

166
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,100
It rains for a while and stops for a while.

167
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,059
Can we do the filming?

168
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,659
Look at that kid.

169
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,250
One, two, three.

170
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,580
The third one, you see her?

171
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,419
She cries one second, and smiles the other.

172
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,179
Her emotions' unstable too.

173
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,410
Who chose the actors?

174
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,940
How did you choose the actors?

175
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,540
It got me anxious just watching.

176
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,580
If you're anxious, why don't you find a place to rest?

177
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,700
How's that?

178
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,010
What?

179
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,020
Find a place to rest.

180
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,740
Leave the scene.

181
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,140
What do you mean?

182
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,140
I don't mean anything.

183
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,260
It's my job to complete the filming and do a good job.

184
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,500
Aren't you anxious at the scene?

185
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,340
Find a place to rest.

186
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,460
Just wait for me to submit the film to you.

187
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:08,740
You–

188
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,180
You're disturbing my work.

189
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,740
Mr. Jia...

190
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,380
What kind of attitude is that?

191
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,380
I want to help you.

192
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,460

Did I disturb you?

194
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,380
Have some water.

195

Let's take a rest in the car and wait a little.

196

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,220
Who will pay for the loss?

205
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,500

What?

340
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,580
Nothing.

341
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,740
Don't think too much.

342
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,540
Maybe she's just meeting a client

343
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,980
and talked about work.

344
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,820

345
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,180
has nothing to do with me.

346
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,820
Yeah, right.

347
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,220
Hello, three cups of coffee.

348
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,020
Okay, one moment.

349
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,700
Does team leader want something hot or cold?

350
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,540
He didn't say.

351
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,300
Three cups of hot coffee then?

352
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:18,980
Okay.

353
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,340
Two for here, and one to go.

354
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,700
You've stayed up so many nights.

355
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,340
You're going to die after the event ends.

356
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,860
You haven't smiled for a week.

357
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,180
Do you have to be so hung up over

358
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,130
one woman?

359
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,300
Is she that good?

360
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,140
If you're really upset,

361
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,100
go find her.

362
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,180
I don't want to think about it.

363
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,530
So you're numbing myself with work.

364
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,900
If I don't think,

365
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,140
then I won't be sad.

366
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,220
If I think about it,

367
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,300
I can't focus on work.

368
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,570
If you're a man you'd go look for her.

369
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,020
Don't just look at their social media account

370
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,060
secretly all day long.

371
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,340
You look at her WeChat Moments one second,

372
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,010
Weibo the other,

373
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,060
and then Qzone,

374
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,420
then her video account.

375
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,850
How did you know?

376
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,530
I saw it when you were using your phone.

377
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,740
You peeped at my phone!

378
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,140

My friend is still inside.

954
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,410

Calm down.

959
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,010
Slowly. What's wrong?

960
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,560
The stage collapsed.

961
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,210
What did you say?

962
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,890
The stage collapsed.

00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,400
