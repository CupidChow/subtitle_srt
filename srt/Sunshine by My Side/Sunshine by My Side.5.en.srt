1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,990
Must you be that rigid?

3
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,829
Let me tell you.

4
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,950
I'm in a bad mood today, so don't mess with me.

5
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,550
What's wrong?

6
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,270
Why are you in a bad mood?

7
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,790
You made me mad.

8
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,350
Just take it.

9
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,470
Take the extra money as a meal I bought you.

10
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,350
Why don't you buy some snacks for yourself

11
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,230
or treat your colleagues to milk tea?

12
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:14,830
Okay?

13
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,670
Sheng Yang, listen.

14
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,790
I don't have the patience to coax kids.

15
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,230
I don't want to owe others anything either.

16
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,470
You're so funny.

17
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,110
Fine.

18
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,150
What now?

19
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,790
What should I do with

20
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,790
your box of things?

21
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,910
Which box?

22
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,910
I told you to throw it away.

23
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,550
Why don't you sell the junk?

24
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,230
Okay?

25
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,790
Don't tell me you're going to split

26
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,790
the earnings from selling the junk in half with me.

27
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,910
You were planning to, right?

28
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,230
Let me tell you. You're really an odd kid.

29
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,590
What if...

30
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,230
What if you want the things in the future?

31
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,790
That won't happen.

32
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,909
Let me tell you again.

33
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:43,110
Throw it away! Throw it away! Throw it away!

34
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,030
If you think you got too much money from selling the junk,

35
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,030
just keep it for the time being.

36
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,909
If we run into each other again,

37
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,790
treat me to dinner, okay?

38
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:53,990
Okay.

39
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,470
What do you want to eat?

40
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,110
I didn't say you have to treat me today.

41
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,110
You're here anyway.

42
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,110
Boss.

43
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,710
It's you.

44
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,710
It's been a long time.

45
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,670
I'll have my usual three.

46
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,030
Pickled bamboo shoots, beef and a fried egg?

47
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,590
Yes.

48
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,990
Are you sure you want to eat this today?

49
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,030
Yes.

50
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,390
Boss, make it extra spicy,

51
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,470
with two spoons of vinegar and extra tofu skin.

52
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,670
Okay, no problem.

53
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,270
What about you?

54
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,350
Boss, I want the same ingredients, and extra spicy with two spoons of vinegar like hers.

55
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,030
Okay.

56
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,350
36 yuan in total.

57
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,150
Find a place to sit first.

58
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,470
Okay, I'll pay first.

59
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,110
Boss, I've paid.

60
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,030
Okay.

61
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,110
Have a seat.

62
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,230
It'll just take a moment.

63
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,670
Give me a minute.

64
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,230
I need to buy something.

65
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,270
I'll be right back.

66
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,470
This is for you.

67
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,390
Not bad.

68
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,910
You're quite knowledgeable.

69
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,230
The noodles are ready.

70
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,909
Sorry to keep you waiting.

71
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,670
Thank you, boss.

72
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,110
Thank you.

73
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,550
Take your time.

74
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,470
Call me if you need anything.

75
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:36,990
Okay.

76
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,150
It smells good. Thank you.

77
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,790
This is quite stinky.

78
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,110
Try it and you'll know that it's good.

79
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,710
It smells stinky but it tastes good.

80
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,390
Why do you like this?

81
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,710
Aren't you afraid of diarrhea?

82
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,990
We're eating. Is it appropriate to talk about this?

83
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,790
Also, eating spicy food at night

84
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,790
may give you pimples.

85
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,790
At my age,

86
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,030
not only do I get pimples easily but my body also gets inflamed easily.

87
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,350
But when I'm rushing a deadline

88
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,470
or

89
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,910
staying up all night to shoot,

90
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,110
I really can't take it.

91
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,190
I don't smoke

92
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,830
because I'm afraid of harming myself and others.

93
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,590
So I have to find a replacement

94
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,110
to refresh my mind.

95
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,350
The stronger the flavor, the better.

96
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,830
The spicier, the better.

97
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,870
Once I finish a bowl of this, I'm awakened from head to toe,

98
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,470
and I feel like I can even stay up for another night.

99
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,470
Director Jian.

100
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,830
It must be tough.

101
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,350
It's not tough at all.

102
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,470
I have to work hard.

103
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,230
People

104
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,830
should always strive upwards.

105
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,190
Otherwise,

106
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,830
you'll be looked down upon by kids.

107
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,110
Two days ago, I drank too much.

108
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,230
When I was half awake,

109
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,310
a kid kept whispering in my ear,

110
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,070
telling me

111
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,110
that I shouldn't live like this

112
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,750
and whatnot,

113
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,830
and kept going on and on.

114
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,310
So I have to work hard.

115
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,470
Did you hear everything I said that night?

116
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,190
I thought you were drunk.

117
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,510
I wasn't entirely drunk.

118
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,590
Hurry and eat the noodles.

119
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,590
You can really take spicy food.

120
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,110
Director Jian.

121
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,230
Here.

122
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,110
You also have one on your mouth.

123
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:42,990
Is it still there?

124
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,070
Is this a mole?

125
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:45,830
Yes.

126
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,630
Really?

127
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,190
Are you full?

128
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,470
How about

129
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,950
we go for a second round after this?

130
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,630
A second round?

131
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,430
I'm too old for second rounds.

132
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,830
I'm going home straight after.

133
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,990
Then

134
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,510
I'll send you back.

135
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:20,830
Don't move.

136
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,230
A cockroach.

137
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,110
My laptop...

138
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,710
My laptop is still inside!

139
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,590
I'm sorry.

140
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,230
Come in.

141
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,190
Have a seat.

142
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,470
I'll get it for you.

143
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,230
I think this

144
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,070
has all the software that you need.

145
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,110
You have been backing up your data, right?

146
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,190
It's here.

147
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,030
Great.

148
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,470
Let me see.

149
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,830
Then

150
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,350
give me your laptop.

151
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,630
I'll get it fixed for you.

152
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,590
It's okay. I can do that myself.

153
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,870
Okay.

154
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,230
Tell me how much it cost after you get it fixed.

155
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,190
Why are we always entangled because of money?

156
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,510
I haven't finished exporting my stuff from this laptop.

157
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,710
Don't delete the documents on the desktop.

158
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,710
Don't worry. I won't touch them.

159
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,990
It's fine.

160
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,350
As long as this document is still here.

161
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,230
You have it, right?

162
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,750
Yes.

163
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,830
Did you design this?

164
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,590
How is it?

165
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,350
Not bad, right?

166
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,470
Can I have a look at the other two?

167
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,110
It must be your first draft.

168
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,110
Do you want something to drink? I'll get it for you.

169
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,590
No.

170
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,110
Continue with the export. I need to take a call. Sorry.

171
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,470
Hello?

172
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,510
Jian Bing. What's your intention?

173
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,710
What do you mean?

174
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,630
You're forcing me, aren't you?

175
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,230
If you're bothered that I edited your videos,

176
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,430
just tell me directly.

177
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,350
Whatever it is,

178
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,110
we are still in the same company,

179
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,830
right?

180
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,830
Don't they say not to wash your dirty linen in public?

181
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,110
Is divorce

182
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,710
something to be proud of?

183
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,110
You've made it such that everyone in the company

184
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,110
knows about it.

185
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,710
Besides, did I agree to the divorce?

186
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,990
If you don't agree, I'll give you more time

187
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,190
to take it slowly.

188
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,590
Why should I?

189
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,190
Let me tell you. I'm editing your videos

190
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,350
for your own good.

191
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,830
I don't want you to have too much work.

192
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,590
You have to edit two versions at once.

193
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,070
What if you can't finish it?

194
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,230
How could you spit in the face

195
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,590
of someone helping you?

196
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,950
Can you talk nicely?

197
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:02,590
No, I...

198
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,470
It's not that I want to argue with you.

199
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,630
I want to talk to you nicely...

200
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,350
Director.

201
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,510
Is this edit okay?

202
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,350
Wait a minute.

203
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,110
It was roughly done.

204
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,110
I don't mean to argue with you.

205
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,590
Whatever it is,

206
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,590
the divorce is between us,

207
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,230
right?

208
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,470
You don't have to tell the whole world about it.

209
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,350
How can I stay in this company from now on?

210
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,710
How can I be the boss?

211
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,110
Who's telling it to the whole world?

212
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,190
Are you saying you haven't told the whole world about it?

213
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,710
Even the door guards are asking me

214
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,590
how

215
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,710
I'm feeling.

216
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,710
How should I respond to that?

217
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,510
Boss.

218
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,110
The finance department wants you to sign this.

219
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:58,990
Thank you, boss.

220
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,110
I don't care what you think.

221
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,430
I don't care if you're trying to create such an atmosphere

222
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,710
to force me to agree to the divorce,

223
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,110
or you just want to tell everyone

224
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,830
that I'm a scumbag,

225
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,430
but there's something wrong with what you're doing.

226
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,870
Whatever it is,

227
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,110
we've been married for so many years,

228
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:15,710
right?

229
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,950
Even if there's no love, there's still affection.

230
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,590
If there's no affection, there's still familial love.

231
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,990
If there's no familial love, there should still be some gratitude.

232
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,470
Now you want to divorce me.

233
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,390
When have I ever went around telling people

234
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,990
about your faults?

235
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,430
We've been a married couple for over ten years.

236
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,950
We've slept in the same bed for over ten years.

237
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,430
Right?

238
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,230
You've made such a scene

239
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,110
and caused chaos in the company.

240
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,350
What's going to happen to Lin?

241
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:37,990
Xue.

242
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,070
I have something to do.

243
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,590
My signal is bad.

244
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,070
I'll call you back.

245
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,590
Hello?

246
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,590
Don't use the excuse of having no signal...

247
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,830
You're a designer. It doesn't matter what I think.

248
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,110
Of course what you think is important.

249
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,070
You are a consumer

250
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,190
and a professional.

251
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,110
The product I'm in charge of this time

252
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,430
is the Mid-Autumn Festival gift box.

253
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,510
The theme is the endless reflection of everything.

254
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,350
How should I put it? I just feel like

255
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,710
your design

256
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,070
seems familiar.

257
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,750
It's just ordinary.

258
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,470
To be more frank, it's boring.

259
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,990
Boring?

260
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,590
That brat.

261
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,750
Can you stop wandering around in front of me?

262
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,310
You're making me dizzy.

263
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,590
Sit down now.

264
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,110
Is your son really a pervert?

265
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,990
What do you mean?

266
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,710
At this moment, he's my son

267
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,630
and not yours?

268
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,230
The white trees at the courtyard are inhabited by magpies and crows.

269
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,630
Autumn dew silently moisten the osmanthus flowers in the courtyard.

270
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,590
Look.

271
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,110
The design's inspiration comes from

272
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,590
a poem by Wang Jian of the Tang Dynasty.

273
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:07,830
Look.

274
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,110
The bright moon and cool breeze.

275
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,230
Deciduous branches.

276
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,230
Kid.

277
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,990
Have you forgotten what I do?

278
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,630
Come on.

279
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,990
Let me show you something.

280
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,950
See if there's anything in this room

281
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,830
that is familiar like I mentioned just now.

282
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,830
I receive various gift boxes

283
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,830
from dozens of brands every year.

284
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,830
During New Year's Day,

285
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,470
Christmas,

286
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,230
Mid-Autumn's day, and Valentine's Day.

287
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,830
I have all kinds of styles.

288
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,510
Look and tell me if your design would stand out

289
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,630
when placed there with them.

290
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,590
Consumers don't care

291
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,230
how much time

292
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,230
and effort you put

293
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,710
into designing this.

294
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,230
They will decide

295
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,990
not to buy it just because it's ugly.

296
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,230
Come on.

297
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,990
I'll give you some inspiration.

298
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,470
Take these four books.

299
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,230
David Hockney.

300
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,990
I like his paintings.

301
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,990
I think browsing art books help with design.

302
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,150
Is there a last bus at this hour?

303
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,230
Let me send you home.

304
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,750
No need.

305
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,630
I can go back by myself.

306
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,230
It's too late.

307
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,150
It's not safe for a lady to go out.

308
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,790
If I can't control my anger

309
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,990
and hit him later, don't stop me.

310
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,270
Why are you so annoying?

311
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,310
Can you calm down?

312
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,070
Did he not see us or what?

313
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,230
Do you think our house is a hotel?

314
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,870
What's with this box?

315
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,190
I didn't come in.

316
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,990
I was outside the window

317
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,990
and saw that there was something shiny inside.

318
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,790
Explain yourself.

319
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,230
You can't sleep if you don't!

320
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,230
W-What...

321
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,910
Dad. Mom.

322
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,790
Do you think

323
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,470
I'm talented?

324
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,430
Look at my design.

325
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,710
Is it really that bad?

326
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,630
I think it's good.

327
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,790
She is a professional.

328
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,070
If she says it's bad,

329
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,510
then it's really bad.

330
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,310
I picked up that box from outside.

331
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,390
It was thrown away by someone.

332
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,630
Look at this. You're just like me.

333
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,070
Y-You pick up everything and bring them home.

334
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,790
Genes never lie.

335
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,190
He's your son.

336
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,190
Just wait.

337
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:47,990
Sooner or later,

338
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,750
I'll prove it to you.

339
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,710
Who is it?

340
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,550
No one.

341
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,710
Rest early.

342
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,670
I have to do my work.

343
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,990
Just give me that box.

344
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,230
Go.

345
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,630
Get out. I have to do my work.

346
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,550
Go.

347
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:02,950
Go.

348
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,630
You are really...

349
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,430
The cover.

350
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,390
Okay.

351
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,710
Go to bed early.

352
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,630
To be honest,

353
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,990
I think your son

354
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,710
is abnormal.

355
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,950
I think

356
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,230
that maybe he's

357
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,030
in a relationship?

358
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,070
Maybe the things in the box

359
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,510
belong to his girlfriend.

360
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,550
Impossible.

361
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,710
If he's capable of being in a relationship

362
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,150
and brings someone home,

363
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,910
regardless if she's tall or short, fat or thin,

364
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,790
old or young, good-looking or ugly,

365
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,910
I'll be a vegetarian for a month.

366
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,270
You're right.

367
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,190
If he is capable,

368
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,510
I'd even be a vegetarian for a year.

369
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,550
Why did you delete them all?

370
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,030
Nothing's good?

371
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,710
They are too ordinary.

372
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,390
Yang.

373
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,430
We can't sacrifice our health.

374
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,670
No matter how hard we work, we are still just employees.

375
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,230
You said you want to embarrass Wang.

376
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,310
You can't collapse

377
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,630
before he gets embarrassed.

378
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,310
Haven't you heard that saying?

379
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,430
Life springs from sorrow and calamity; death comes from ease and pleasure.

380
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,470
Isn't it quite nice to be indifferent

381
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,630
like me?

382
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,790
Yang, don't argue with him.

383
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,910
Let's just apologize.

384
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,270
Let me tell you the truth.

385
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,910
She said Wang contacted her in private.

386
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,710
She said if your plan doesn't work,

387
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,710
she'll create one as a replacement.

388
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,510
I didn't want to tell you.

389
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,710
I was afraid it'd dampen your motivation.

390
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,710
But look at you now.

391
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,230
You're acting crazy.

392
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,510
Wang is just playing with you.

393
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,310
He didn't really want to use your plan.

394
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,190
Listen to me. Let's stop, okay?

395
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:35,910
What?

396
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,470
Let me ask you a question.

397
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,030
What's your Chinese zodiac sign?

398
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,430
Why do you want to know?

399
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,510
Are you born in the year of the rooster?

400
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,310
No.

401
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,710
Then why are you so gossipy like an old hen?

402
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,790
Whenever someone approaches Sheng Yang,

403
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,630
you just wave your wings.

404
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,070
You go on and on and never stop.

405
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,910
Will I eat him or what?

406
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,630
Are you his guardian?

407
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,710
Does he need your protection?

408
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,550
I'm his father.

409
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,190
What are you going to do about it?

410
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,710
I'll call you Old Hen from now on. Happy?

411
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,990
Don't disturb him.

412
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,630
If you have time,

413
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,990
you might as well think of ideas for his plan.

414
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,230
Did I disturb him?

415
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:03,790
Oh my goodness.

416
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,870
You are so loud now...

417
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,230
Do you think you're soft...

418
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,990
Are you two done?

419
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,870
Jian Bing.

420
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,870
Why are you here?

421
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,630
I have to create two versions of the video.

422
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,710
If I don't edit them now, when will I do it?

423
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,870
The materials just came out last night.

424
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,230
It hasn't been color corrected yet.

425
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:54,990
You can't edit it now.

426
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,910
So what?

427
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,990
I can edit it even if it hasn't been color corrected.

428
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:58,870
Jian Bing.

429
00:23:58,990 --> 00:23:59,470
Well...

430
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,990
Director Xue...

431
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,230
Director Xue is inside.

432
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,950
Well,

433
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,550
the client wants the first version.

434
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,710
I've finished the editing for you.

435
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,670
I think the rough cut is decent.

436
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,870
It should be approved soon.

437
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,750
That other version of yours

438
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,230
is almost done.

439
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,670
Do you want to take a look?

440
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,190
Yu, play it for her.

441
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:19,950
Take a look.

442
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,390
Yu.

443
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,310
Liu.

444
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,230
Step out for a while.

445
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,790
Liu.

446
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,750
Yu.

447
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:29,670
Come.

448
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,390
Sit here.

449
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,430
Sit here and I'll play it for you.

450
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:32,990
Sit here.

451
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:33,630
Here.

452
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,950
How can I pay you for this?

453
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,550
What do you mean?

454
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,990
You can't work for me for nothing.

455
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,550
What do you mean?

456
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,390
I'm sincerely helping you.

457
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:52,950
Okay?

458
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,230
What do you mean?

459
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,710
I don't understand what you're doing.

460
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,070
Do you not want a divorce

461
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,150
or do you not want me to take over the project entirely?

462
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,630
Why are you yelling?

463
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,150
What do you mean by that?

464
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,070
When we established this company,

465
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,670
we named it Jian Yi

466
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,990
using "Jian" from your name

467
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,270
and "Yi" from my name.

468
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:24,990
Why?

469
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,070
Wasn't it because we hoped the company

470
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,990
would be run simply,

471
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,430
stably,

472
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,670
and happily?

473
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,230
Right?

474
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,950
Why are you acting like that? Do you want to split up our company now?

475
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,190
If you split it up now,

476
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,430
what will happen

477
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,390
to all our employees?

478
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,470
They're not the basis of the problem.

479
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,990
Then what is?

480
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,230
Aren't you trying to

481
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,190
split up the company?

482
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,790
I didn't say that.

483
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,630
I meant I want to split up with you.

484
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,510
It's impossible for us to be split up.

485
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,230
All our resources

486
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,030
and connections

487
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,150
aren't mutually exclusive.

488
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:56,310
Right?

489
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,270
How can we split them up?

490
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,510
So are you saying

491
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,510
that we have to

492
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,950
be associated with each other for the rest of our lives?

493
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,990
Then what do you think we should do?

494
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,910
Our employees

495
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,190
have been with us since the establishment of the company.

496
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,750
Now you suddenly want to split them up.

497
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,990
Who will follow you

498
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:13,870
and who will follow me?

499
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,910
How will they choose?

500
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,470
You're so funny.

501
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,750
You're being unreasonable.

502
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,870
I've said it twice.

503
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,670
What do you mean who follows who?

504
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,790
Our employees are adults,

505
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,950
not kids.

506
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,750
Xue, it's not my fault

507
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,150
that we've come to this stage.

508
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,510
You were the one

509
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,990
who betrayed the affection and trust we have over and over again.

510
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,790
I've really heard enough.

511
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,150
You used to always say

512
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,430
we're a matchmade in heaven

513
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,710
and a perfect pair.

514
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,310
You must admit

515
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,470
that

516
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,670
you'd be fine without me.

517
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,190
The same applies to me.

518
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,710
Then what do you want to do?

519
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,230
Be a man.

520
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,230
Just face everything.

521
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,870
Go.

522
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:19,630
Thank you.

523
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,230
Thank you so much for giving me this award.

524
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,990
I'd like to say that actually,

525
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,190
the early-stage preparations

526
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,390
and the overall idea

527
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,510
were all thought up by Director Xue and me.

528
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,070
We're a team and a whole.

529
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,990
I also want to thank

530
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,870
everyone from every department

531
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,990
in our team for their help.

532
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,310
Thank you, everyone.

533
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:54,750
Director Xue.

534
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,670
Between the two of you,

535
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,430
who is the team leader?

536
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,030
Can't you tell?

537
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,270
In work,

538
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,230
I give her a little guidance.

539
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,990
But in life,

540
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,150
I'm totally led by her.

541
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,430
Both of us are leaders.

542
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,990
Director Xue did help me a lot.

543
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,910
In the early stage, he helped me a lot

544
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,670
with interviews and research.

545
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,750
Don't say that.

546
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,310
The whole shooting process

547
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,950
was handled by her alone.

548
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,430
All I did was sign my name.

549
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,710
You two

550
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,510
are partners and a married couple.

551
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,190
You're even good comrades who support each other in life.

552
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,070
Such a relationship

553
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,990
is really enviable.

554
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,470
We're not some

555
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,550
partners or comrades.

556
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,710
Those are not important.

557
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,750
They don't matter.

558
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,270
Most importantly,

559
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,470
she's my wife.

560
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,070
How are you going to celebrate tonight?

561
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,750
Let me interview Director Jian.

562
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,670
How do you plan to celebrate tonight?

563
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,710
I'll listen to Director Xue.

564
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,430
Actually,

565
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,710
the celebration

566
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,470
doesn't matter either.

567
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,910
The point is that she's so beautiful today.

568
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,230
We need to find a place

569
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,510
where we can celebrate alone.

570
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,270
Well,

571
00:29:59,270 --> 00:29:59,710
let's...

572
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,070
We have an announcement

573
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,750
to make.

574
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,430
Go ahead.

575
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,750
You do it.

576
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,750
You do it.

577
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,630
You do it.

578
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,990
Fine, I'll do it.

579
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,470
You may have heard about it.

580
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,470
The two of us

581
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,550
are getting a divorce.

582
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:57,750
In the future,

583
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,030
the company might be split up.

584
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,750
We'll each be responsible for

585
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,150
our projects respectively.

586
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,070
But don't worry.

587
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,030
We won't ask everyone to choose sides.

588
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,990
That's too agonizing for everyone.

589
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,750
That won't happen.

590
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,750
In the future, our company

591
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,550
will still be

592
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,510
receiving external projects

593
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,190
in the name of the company as a whole.

594
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:17,990
Okay?

595
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,950
That's all for me.

596
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,670
We're telling you in advance because mainly,

597
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,750
we don't want you

598
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,470
to hear some rumors

599
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,990
in the industry

600
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,150
and let that affect your mood and work.

601
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,230
So we're here to inform you.

602
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:37,710
That's all.

603
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,870
Nothing else has changed.

604
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,670
Just work as usual.

605
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,950
In other words,

606
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,710
even though the two of us

607
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,510
have...

608
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,230
We're no longer husband and wife,

609
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,670
but we're still friends,

610
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,510
comrades,

611
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,870
and...

612
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,550
partners, right?

613
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,230
We're still family.

614
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,510
We'll keep going together.

615
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,150
Let's keep going together.

616
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,230
Yes, family.

617
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,870
That is, if Director Xue

618
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,150
is seen with someone new in the future,

619
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,390
you shouldn't be surprised.

620
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,630
I'll sincerely give him my blessing.

621
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,190
And if Director Jian has a romantic partner

622
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,150
in the future,

623
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,070
I'll also...

624
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,230
wish her happiness.

625
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:24,910
That's all.

626
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,630
That is,

627
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,470
everyone,

628
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,310
please don't panic.

629
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,870
Everything is fine.

630
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:33,710
Well,

631
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,630
let's dismiss if there's no questions.

632
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:36,790
What questions could there be?

633
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:37,470
Dismiss. Get to work.

634
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,270
Come on, get to work.

635
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:38,990
Get to work. Thank you, everyone.

636
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,390
Work hard.

637
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,230
Work hard.

638
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,910
I'll take you out for a drink tonight

639
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,910
to relax.

640
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,310
Now,

641
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,910
I'm not in the mood.

642
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,790
This industry requires a lot of hard work

643
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,150
and effort.

644
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,310
But I always believe

645
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,510
that creative and conscientious advertising

646
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,429
can affect

647
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,870
and even change people's behaviors and ideals

648
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,989
and make the world better.

649
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,870
I think good advertising

650
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,429
can touch your heart.

651
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,350
Previously, you mentioned

652
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,510
about the art of light and shadows.

653
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,150
Can you explain it to us in detail?

654
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:28,350
This is a weighty question.

655
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,469
I'll just

656
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:30,429
share

657
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:33,070
a little about how I feel when I work.

658
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,989
It turns out that when discussing light and shadows,

659
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,870
people always talk about the changes in brightness.

660
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,070
Bro.

661
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,469
I know your lady, Jian Bing, is pretty.

662
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,350
But do you have to watch it again and again?

663
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,190
Actually, light and shadows are great at creating the atmosphere

664
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,510
and playing up the emotions.

665
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,429
For example, if you make the light and shadows move...

666
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,190
Changes in brightness...

667
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,030
Song Chen.

668
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,310
Actually, light and shadows are great at creating the atmosphere...

669
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,510
I have a good idea.

670
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,790
And playing up the emotions.

671
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,750
For example, if you make the light and shadows move...

672
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,110
Come in.

673
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,750
Have you thought about when you're signing the divorce paperwork?

674
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,510
Next Monday.

675
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,830
I thought about it and I think

676
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,350
you were right that day.

677
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,830
Why should a person's success

678
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,950
be defined by marriage?

679
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,670
Does one have no friends

680
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,790
or a job?

681
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,510
Other than one's man, is there no other way

682
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,950
to prove your charm?

683
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,870
Actually, in many people's eyes,

684
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,190
you are glowing all over.

685
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,110
You have nothing but strengths.

686
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,550
Those who don't know how to cherish you

687
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,670
should be let go and kept as far away as possible.

688
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,430
What do you want to say?

689
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,430
I just want to tell you

690
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,430
that no matter what decision you make,

691
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,590
I will always support you.

692
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,430
Got it.

693
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,670
Young people

694
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,630
always drop the ball at the critical moment.

695
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,310
If it doesn't work,

696
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,630
I'll use your plan.

697
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,470
What time is it already?

698
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,630
When will your idea presentation start?

699
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,950
Well, boss.

700
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,830
Sheng Yang

701
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,390
might have run into a minor hiccup.

702
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,430
But it's okay.

703
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,750
Liu has another backup plan.

704
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,390
You can take a look.

705
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,590
Then let's begin.

706
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,430
Please take a look at my backup plan.

707
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,070
Sure.

708
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,030
This time,

709
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,310
the schedule was a little tight...

710
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:29,790
I'm coming.

711
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:30,470
I'm coming.

712
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,470
Sorry, we're late.

713
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,310
I'm sorry.

714
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,790
I'm late.

715
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,830
I'm really sorry.

716
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:35,950
Boss.

717
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,270
Team Leader.

718
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,070
Liu.

719
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,030
I'm really sorry for being late.

720
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,070
Because the gift box we made this time

721
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,750
is too complicated.

722
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,390
Sheng Yang.

723
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,190
Let's begin.

724
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,750
Before we officially start,

725
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,870
I want to say something out of topic.

726
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,870
I have a friend in the industry.

727
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,870
Every Mid-Autumn Festival,

728
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,470
she receives

729
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,670
Mid-Autumn Festival gift boxes from dozens of brands.

730
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,590
But she threw them all

731
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,470
into her storeroom and they've become dusty.

732
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,990
And she also asked me a question.

733
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,110
She said

734
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,950
that if she threw the gift box I designed

735
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,590
in with those boxes,

736
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,270
would it stand out?

737
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,550
I thought about it for a long time

738
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,070
because it was quite a hard question.

739
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,510
So I thought

740
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,990
what if I turn our Mid-Autumn Festival gift box

741
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,270
into an exquisite handicraft,

742
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,390
then won't my friend

743
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,350
not put my box with those other boxes

744
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,630
to accumulate dust?

745
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:32,870
Sheng Yang.

746
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,510
Get to the point.

747
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,590
Got it.

748
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,310
Next,

749
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,870
I'll get to the main point.

750
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,390
This

751
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,030
is the Moonlight Treasure Box made by our team.

752
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,750
Giving tradition a new meaning

753
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,750
by blending the classic and the modern

754
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,350
and where time and space overlap.

755
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,270
Using light and shadows

756
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,350
to turn an ordinary paper box

757
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,470
into a lunar platform.

758
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,790
Please look here.

759
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,470
There's another little trick.

760
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,350
The stars can change their positions.

761
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,510
The stars and the moon are in the palm of your hands.

762
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,870
A small place

763
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,870
can be turned into an endless scene in the universe.

764
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:52,790
This

765
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,910
is the charm of light and shadows.

766
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,070
Good idea.

767
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,550
Your team

768
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,670
really has a lot of hidden talent.

769
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,670
I'm flattered, boss.

770
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,350
In fact, it was under my guiding ideology

771
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,550
and completed step by step.

772
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:27,470
But

773
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:28,590
the budget is a bit high.

774
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,670
It's a good idea.

775
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,670
This is good.

776
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,470
It’s quite creative.

777
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,150
Sheng Yang! Sheng Yang! Sheng Yang!

778
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,390
I'll remember him.

779
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,070
I believe

780
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,430
customers

781
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,750
will like this idea.

782
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:40,990
Thank you, boss.

783
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,830
All eyes are on you, Sheng Yang.

784
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,310
Good luck.

785
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,150
It's really creative.

786
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,310
Thank you, Liu.

787
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,110
Good luck.

788
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,830
That kid Sheng Yang is quite brilliant.

789
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,470
He’s creative and innovative.

790
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:51,630
Yes.

791
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,470
Make sure you focus on training him.

792
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:52,990
Don't worry.

793
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,670
He's the result of my meticulous training.

794
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:55,990
Are you stealing his thunder?

795
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,590
No.

796
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,630
The point is

797
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,630
he has a good leader,

798
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,150
just as I have a good leader like you.

799
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,310
I give him freedom

800
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,630
to express his thoughts.

801
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,670
Do you think Wang will dare to say anything from now on?

802
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,310
Can you be more discreet?

803
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,070
Why should I?

804
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,430
We have to celebrate.

805
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,750
Let's go clubbing.

806
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:11,750
Let's have skewers before that.

807
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:11,990
How's that?

808
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,150
I haven't drunk in a long time.

809
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,470
Are you going or not?

810
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,190
Don't be a wet blanket.

811
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,030
Don't be a wet blanket.

812
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,190
I really can't take it anymore.

813
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,510
I need to go home and sleep.

814
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,470
Here, yours is done.

815
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,910
Take care.

816
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:36,990
Boss.

817
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:37,870
Give me a bowl of Luosifen noodles.

818
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,470
I want to add pickled bamboo shoots,

819
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,310
beef and a fried egg.

820
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,990
Extra spicy and two spoons of vinegar.

821
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:43,990
Can you add more

822
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:44,910
pickled green beans?

823
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:45,470
Okay.

824
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:46,910
Is this for here, or to go?

825
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:47,790
To go.

826
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,430
I've paid.

827
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,430
Okay.

828
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:52,990
Yes.

829
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,110
Add more chili.

830
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:54,950
Okay.
