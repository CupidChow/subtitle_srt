00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,030
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:39,759
What are you doing?

4
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,200
Come here.

5
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,160
You're so nosy.

6
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,200
Wider.

7
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,350
Do you see that?

8
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,750
He seems to have found a job.

9
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,790
I haven't seen him so busy in a long time.

10
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,880
His mood

11
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,320
has improved a lot.

12
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,710
He also looks energized.

13
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,270
Do you know what that means?

14
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,110
What?

15
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,030
One has to work.

16
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,520
Idleness is depressing.

17
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:26,670
Let's go.

18
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,950
Let's go.

19
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,870
That's good.

20
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,120
The steamed eggs will be served in three minutes.

21
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,120
Lunch is ready.

22
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,710
Mom.

23
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,680
Here's this month's money.

24
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,470
I can't take this money.

25
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,630
It's not easy for you to make money.

26
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,720
Your money is hard-earned.

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,910
I'm not that short of money.

28
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,270
The food doesn't cost much.

29
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:00,840
Mom,

30
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,320
I told you.

31
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,120
I'll keep paying you my share of living expenses every month.

32
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,160
Not a penny less.

33
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,030
You don't need to tighten your belt.

34
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,270
Don't stress about money.

35
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,910
Here, take it.

36
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,270
I'm not stressed.

37
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,360
Take it, Mom.

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
No. I can't take your money.

39
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,270
Mom, you have to take it.

40
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,280
Your mom has grabbed it.

41
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,280
How much is this?

42
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,320
Count it.

43
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,880
Then I'll keep it for now

44
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,120
and give it back to you when you get married.

45
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,950
Okay. As you wish.

46
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,560
Let's eat.

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,040
Are the steamed eggs ready?

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,400
The steamed eggs will be served in one minute.

49
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,840
Hurry. Yang is waiting.

50
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,829
That can't make the eggs cook faster.

51
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,100
The last minute is crucial.

52
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,140
You ruined that dish.

53
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:58,050
Well done.

54
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,370
You've made progress.

55
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,530
The rhythm

56
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,530
is clean and smooth.

57
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,920
Pauses at the right places.

58
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,640
Much less messy.

59
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,850
However, you should infuse more emotion into it.

60
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,040
And the dynamics aren't clear enough.

61
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,610
Got it.

62
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,210
I'll practice harder.

63
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,089
When will your ice hockey game

64
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,410
begin?

65
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,329
Next Friday.

66
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:22,930
Well,

67
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,050
how much is the ticket?

68
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,050
It's free.

69
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,770
You just need to apply online.

70
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,690
Really?

71
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,690
Why didn't you say that?

72
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,050
But I think the deadline has passed.

73
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:38,850
How many tickets do you want?

74
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,930
I knew you could help me.

75
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,290
Two?

76
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,210
I can't guarantee that.

77
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,200
I can get you one ticket without any doubt,

78
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,850
but two… I'm not sure.

79
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,409
It's your game. You can surely find a way.

80
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,200
It is my game

81
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,409
but you're really

82
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,720
asking too much.

83
00:04:59,450 --> 00:04:59,930
Alright.

84
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,850
For the next week,

85
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,810
I'll wash all the dishes.

86
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,800
Plus a fancy dinner. What do you say?

87
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,050
Great. Deal.

88
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,290
But I won't have the fancy dinner with you.

89
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,610
Just transfer the money to me.

90
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,810
Okay.

91
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,530
I've transferred it to you.

92
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,050
Accept it.

93
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,410
So little.

94
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,850
You won't eat with me.

95
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,280
So I guess you'll eat alone.

96
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,850
Good.

97
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,050
Then you shall watch the game alone as well.

98
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,890
Fine.

99
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,770
I must have owed you in my last life.

100
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,409
Done.

101
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,930
Hold on.

102
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,560
Let me check.

103
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,040
Did you receive it?

104
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,650
Yes.

105
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,800
Then keep practicing the piano.

106
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,570
Falling in love

107
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,360
has made you swallow your pride.

108
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,770
Cut the crap. I'm recording this for your mom.

109
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,370
Sis,

110
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,810
Junjie's piano skills have improved a lot.

111
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,610
He wants to play for you. Come on.

112
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,650
You're doing this on purpose.

113
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,810
I'm recording.

114
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,610
Mom, your brother is bullying me.

115
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,370
Hurry.

116
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,480
Start.

117
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,600
You aren't recording?

118
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,930
I am. Keep playing.

119
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,050
Are you kidding me?

120
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,450
Forget about the tickets.

121
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,610
How dare you!

122
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,210
You brat.

123
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,610
-I've got the money anyway.
-You've taken my money.

124
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,130
Give it back.

125
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,640
Then it's a deal.

126
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,650
Sure.

127
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,290
Hello, Director Jian.

128
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,409
Why didn't you come up?

129
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,250
I came to give you the hard drive.

130
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,810
The project file is in it.

131
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,680
I made a rough cut.

132
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,520
See if you can use it.

133
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,050
Thank you.

134
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,090
You can

135
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,050
run it on your computer?

136
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,810
For now, yes.

137
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,050
But if the file gets too big…

138
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,450
Don't worry. I can find an internet cafe.

139
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,730
Why go to an internet cafe

140
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,480
-when you can use the computers here?
-Thanks.

141
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,930
Why don't you finish it here?

142
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,050
Let's go upstairs.

143
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,050
What?

144
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,250
Do I need to carry you up?

145
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,530
Is Xue Yiming

146
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,810
upstairs too?

147
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,050
Yeah. So what?

148
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,890
Are you afraid of him?

149
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,210
No.

150
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,970
I just think

151
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,410
if he's there too,

152
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,610
it'll be awkward.

153
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,890
Why?

154
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,530
Let's go.

155
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:48,050
Come here.

156
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,810
Well…

157
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,130
The other day,

158
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,050
you went to the studio to meet me.

159
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:00,650
You,

160
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,650
blah, blah, blah,

161
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,490
said a lot.

162
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,850
That matter…

163
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,730
Can we get over it?

164
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,930
Look. We're friends

165
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,810
and work in the same field.

166
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,610
Now we've got a chance to work together.

167
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,570
Isn't it amazing?

168
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,600
So we should cherish what we've got

169
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,610
and keep our relationship pure.

170
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:23,850
In the future,

171
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,210
whether we're friends

172
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,290
or work partners,

173
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,690
we must not let anything affect our work.

174
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:31,930
I know.

175
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,610
I'll keep things professional.

176
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,400
Good. Then stop overthinking.

177
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,890
My ex-husband is also the boss of this company.

178
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,730
So,

179
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,610
if you come here,

180
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,290
you may run into him.

181
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,050
Say hello if you want.

182
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,330
Ignoring him is also fine.

183
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,490
Okay?

184
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,210
Okay.

185
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,210
Let's go.

186
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,890
You're so efficient.

187
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,050
Let me check your masterpiece.

188
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,890
From this line to this line.

189
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,250
Just write down whatever the team leader

190
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,290
says later.

191
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,770
Let me emphasize it again.

192
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,210
You all know what happened

193
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,970
in the company a while ago.

194
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,800
There is no more room for mistakes.

195
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,370
You all should've learned the lesson.

196
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,370
So exercise discretion

197
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,410
and don't cause me any more trouble.

198
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:33,960
Understand?

199
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,450
Don't worry.

200
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,530
I'll go over all the details

201
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,840
and arrange for several rounds of tests

202
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,890
before the event.

203
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,570
Okay.

204
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,410
Anything else?

205
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,210
Team Leader.

206
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,770
Will we keep using the previous construction crew?

207
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,800
I'll talk to the client about that.

208
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,370
Any other questions?

209
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,530
No conclusion has been drawn

210
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,050
on that terrible accident yet.

211
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,370
Sheng Yang and Song Chen left because of it.

212
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,250
It can't be left unsolved

213
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,850
even after they were fired.

214
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,050
If something similar happens again,

215
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,130
we can't explain it to our clients.

216
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,570
I'm not defending them.

217
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,410
I don't care if they got fired or not.

218
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,530
It's just

219
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,800
that the cause of the accident

220
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,650
hasn't been found yet.

221
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,250
Firing them is not a big deal

222
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,170
but our project is.

223
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,130
If that happens again,

224
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,370
we won't be able to explain ourselves.

225
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,610
Do you agree?

226
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,440
You're young.

227
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,170
It's good to be critical.

228
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,370
Her concern is reasonable.

229
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,170
We

230
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,530
have worked with them many times.

231
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,570
Why did that accident happen

232
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,570
exactly during that project?

233
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,520
I'll continue the investigation.

234
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,130
You guys just focus on

235
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,410
proposals and creative ideas.

236
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,570
After all, this is an advertising agency,

237
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,920
not a detective agency.

238
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,610
Solving cases

239
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,970
is not our job.

240
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,640
Besides, this time, I'll personally

241
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,720
supervise the whole construction process.

242
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,440
Any more questions?

243
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,480
Okay.

244
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:25,970
Meeting over.

245
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,770
Go back to work.

246
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,120
Pan, I'll leave first.

247
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,690
Okay.

248
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,570
Someone in the construction crew is a relative of the team leader.

249
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,600
So just let it be.

250
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,740
[Sheng Yang]
[Pan Rou: Yang, are you free today? I need to meet you.]

251
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,770
Here, Yang.

252
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,610
It feels like I haven't seen you for ten years.

253
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,250
Go ahead. What's it?

254
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,090
I'm very busy.

255
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,290
Song Chen told me

256
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,010
that you two have been looking for a job

257
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,210
but haven't found one.

258
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,560
That accident had a big impact

259
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,960
and the team leader has said mean things behind your backs.

260
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,970
So I think there must be something wrong with him.

261
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,170
What do you think is wrong?

262
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,720
You were fired without a good reason

263
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,200
and they didn't give you any explanation.

264
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,130
I brought this matter up yesterday,

265
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,690
but he beat around the bush

266
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,410
as if he was hiding something.

267
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,210
Most importantly, Liu told me

268
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,160
that he has a relative in the construction crew.

269
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,200
I think

270
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,090
maybe he has found out

271
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,570
the cause of the accident,

272
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,410
but to cover up for the construction crew,

273
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,050
he made you the scapegoat.

274
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,970
But I was there during the whole construction process

275
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,730
and I checked all the building materials

276
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,010
sent by the suppliers.

277
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,810
Nothing wrong with them.

278
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,130
But the problem couldn't be with your design.

279
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,650
Besides, during construction,

280
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,930
you couldn't have watched them

281
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,850
every second without blinking.

282
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,770
Even if Wang had attempted to play tricks,

283
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,010
the boss

284
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,730
wouldn't have let him.

285
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:24,890
My goodness.

286
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,720
The boss is so busy

287
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,810
and barely makes appearances.

288
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,210
He's got more important matters to attend to.

289
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,410
Moreover,

290
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,760
this accident

291
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,010
didn't make any sense at all.

292
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,010
They made you the scapegoat for no reason.

293
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,810
How could they do that?

294
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:36,850
I mean it.

295
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,090
I can't stand staying in this company anymore.

296
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,650
I don't see the point of working there.

297
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,410
What?

298
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,560
Do you want to join me?

299
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,810
I'll get a bowl and you'll get a can.

300
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,160
We'll knock on them

301
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,290
while we walk through the city,

302
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,610
begging for scraps

303
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,570
and picking up water bottles?

304
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,650
That's not what I mean.

305
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,690
I understand, Pan Rou.

306
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,880
I know,

307
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,290
you think I was treated unfairly.

308
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,210
You care about me.

309
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,210
To tell you the truth,

310
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,330
I'm doing quite well now.

311
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,810
Although I don't have a stable job,

312
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,650
I

313
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,640
take jobs here and there

314
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,970
and can still feed myself.

315
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,250
Besides,

316
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,010
I have a much more flexible schedule now.

317
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,050
I don't have to

318
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,610
get up early

319
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,210
to commute anymore.

320
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,450
Most importantly,

321
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,170
I don't have to deal with difficult clients

322
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,680
or stay up late for work anymore.

323
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,090
Isn't it great?

324
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,370
Wang is not a good man,

325
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,690
but July Advertising Agency is a big company.

326
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,690
You can get lots of work opportunities there

327
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,050
that can help you tremendously.

328
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,200
You just bought me coffee?

329
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,680
I'd also like something to eat.

330
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,370
Am I asking too much?

331
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,250
No. I'll buy you the most expensive cake here.

332
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,410
Great. The most expensive one.

333
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,450
Excuse me. I'd like to have this and this.

334
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:02,920
Okay.

335
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,310
Hello.

336
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,420
Do you need a refill?

337
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,630
Yeah.

338
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,220
Okay.

339
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,490
This dish is too spicy.

340
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,940
Is it?

341
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,680
Here, your water.

342
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,370
Song Chen.

343
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:32,730
My goodness.

344
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:33,930
Can't you

345
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,210
find a normal place to eat?

346
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,330
Do you know how hard it is to find this place?

347
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,810
How is this place not normal?

348
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,690
You said you've had dinner.

349
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,440
Go ahead. What's it?

350
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,210
You know what?

351
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,520
You reached me at a good time.

352
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,530
You know why?

353
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,920
I happen to be available these days.

354
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,200
You're available?

355
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,080
All these days,

356
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,120
have you ever been unavailable?

357
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,050
Have I ever been unavailable?

358
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,090
Listen.

359
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,290
To meet you tonight,

360
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,330
I put aside a ton of work.

361
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,090
You should be grateful.

362
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,050
This is delicious.

363
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,200
Get one bowl of it for me.

364
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,250
I'd also like some drinks.

365
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,490
Didn't you say you've had dinner?

366
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,530
None of your business.

367
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,050
Fine. I'll go get them for you.

368
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,890
My phone. My phone.

369
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,010
Wait. Wait.

370
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,320
Get up.

371
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,650
Where is my phone?

372
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,090
Get up.

373
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,650
Wait.

374
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:58,610
My…

375
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,050
My phone.

376
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,810
-Hey, baby.
-Give it back.

377
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,730
-Give it back.
-Where are you?

378
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,599
Give it back to me.

379
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,410
Wrong number.

380
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,170
What's going on?

381
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,010
Who was that?

382
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,170
Look.

383
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:15,720
Look at this number.

384
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,730
This number.

385
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,890
I…

386
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,329
It's not even in my contacts.

387
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,400
You deleted it so quickly.

388
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,130
Liang.

389
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,970
We've just started this relationship.

390
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,130
Don't be so serious.

391
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,290
Director Xue.

392
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,570
What?

393
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,490
Are you scared?

394
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,130
Fine. Check it all you want.

395
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,160
But there's one condition.

396
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,650
To be fair, I need to check your phone as well.

397
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,890
Sure.

398
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,280
Here.

399
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,250
Take it.

400
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,880
Not this phone.

401
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,890
This is your work phone.

402
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,890
I want to check your personal phone.

403
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,960
The one with two SIM cards.

404
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,010
What do you mean?

405
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,640
Is this phone ringing?

406
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,250
I don't think so.

407
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,170
Answer it. I won't be jealous.

408
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,890
Do you mean it?

409
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:30,850
Answer it.

410
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,730
It's him.

411
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,090
Hello?

412
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,530
Hello, Shanshan.

413
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,120
Where are you?

414
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,680
I haven't seen you in days.

415
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,090
I miss you.

416
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,240
I'm at home.

417
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,050
Why haven't you come out lately?

418
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,050
Have you got a boyfriend?

419
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,610
Are you kidding me?

420
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,250
Of course not.

421
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,010
Have you had dinner?

422
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,250
No.

423
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,200
What about you?

424
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,210
Me neither.

425
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,090
I miss the taste of you.

426
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,850
Go to hell!

427
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,490
You deserve to starve to death!

428
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,370
If you call her again, I'll beat you to a pulp!

429
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,850
That phone is too old.

430
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,690
I'll get you a new one.

431
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,760
Song Chen.

432
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,440
I think there's something wrong with the team leader.

433
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,530
What's wrong?

434
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,170
My intuition tells me

435
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,360
that there's definitely something wrong with him.

436
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,090
But intuition is not evidence.

437
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,450
Yes. We need evidence.

438
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,250
I think we should make a plan.

439
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,770
We can't let it slide just like this.

440
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,120
Of course not.

441
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,370
Besides, I'm not doing this for Sheng Yang.

442
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,850
I just want to find out the truth.

443
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,570
Oh, come on. You are doing it for Sheng Yang.

444
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,290
Tell me. Did you go to see him first?

445
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,970
He ignored you so you came to me.

446
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:23,970
Right?

447
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,170
So I'm just the backup plan?

448
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:28,810
Wait.

449
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,320
Aren't the two of you best friends?

450
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,970
Let's not talk about that.

451
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,010
Anyway,

452
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,850
we have the same goal and the same enemy.

453
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,080
We're allies now.

454
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,530
Allying with you is…

455
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,370
Demeaning for you.

456
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,690
Then go find someone else.

457
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,320
Don't be so petty.

458
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,040
I bought you that shirt.

459
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,570
When did it get stained?

460
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,000
It's fine.

461
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,850
Smear some detergent on it after you go home

462
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,130
and put it in the washing machine. It'll come off.

463
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,370
Give it to me.

464
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,410
Really?

465
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,130
Give it to me.

466
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,700
Waiter, check, please.

467
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,360
Coming.

468
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:32,800
Never mind.

469
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,970
I'll come to pay the bill later.

470
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,490
Okay.

471
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,560
What do you mean?

472
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,730
This is on me, okay?

473
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:38,850
Listen.

474
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,850
I'm out of work now,

475
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,170
but

476
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,250
I still have no problem

477
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,840
paying for two bowls of noodles.

478
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,050
Okay?

479
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,890
I asked you out for dinner.

480
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,610
I should pay the bill.

481
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,730
And you spent so much money

482
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,080
on the bag you bought me.

483
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,290
I bet you haven't paid off your credit card yet.

484
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,130
I've long paid it off.

485
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,490
My dad gave me some money.

486
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,890
I thought about it later.

487
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,930
I shouldn't have accepted

488
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,520
something so expensive from you.

489
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,050
My bag is broken,

490
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,130
but it doesn't cost much to repair it.

491
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,210
How about I put the bag you gave me

492
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,210
in an online secondhand store?

493
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,490
After it's sold,

494
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,930
I'll give the money back to you.

495
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,850
Out of the question!

496
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,770
Just keep it.

497
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,850
As a reminder of me.

498
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,930
It's not like you're dying.

499
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,840
Why do I need a reminder of you?

500
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,570
Take it back.

501
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,880
Take it back.

502
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,290
Fine. I take that back.

503
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,450
In a while,

504
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,730
if I still can't find a job,

505
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,120
I won't be able to afford the rent

506
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,240
and will have to go back to my hometown.

507
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,000
We haven't figured out what the team leader did.

508
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,250
Don't worry.

509
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,010
Before I leave,

510
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,650
I'll help you prove Sheng Yang innocent.

511
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,600
It's not helping me.

512
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,890
You'll be proved innocent too if we can reveal the truth.

513
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,600
Once we clear your name,

514
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,120
it'll be easy for you to find a job.

515
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,610
So you won't have to leave.

516
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,730
Even if we can find out the truth,

517
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,890
what's done is done.

518
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,490
No one will listen to my explanations.

519
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,290
Listen.

520
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,010
Finding a job is harder than you think.

521
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,090
Can you stop being so negative?

522
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,450
Song, pull yourself together!

523
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,520
You're competent. You're just not trying hard enough.

524
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,690
I've read your proposals and ideas.

525
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,530
They're brilliant.

526
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,530
You can go back to your hometown.

527
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,730
But it's a big decision that'll change your life.

528
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:22,210
Have you thought it through?

529
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,450
In this city,

530
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,920
is there really nothing that you want to stay for?

531
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,000
There is.

532
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,010
You don't want me to leave, do you?

533
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,200
No.

534
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,000
If you leave,

535
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,400
who can I take it out on when I'm unhappy?

536
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,610
You're bad at cooking.

537
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,080
You won't eat it?

538
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,010
Then just starve yourself.

539
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,050
Were you

540
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,440
really jealous just now?

541
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,450
No.

542
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:31,880
You liar.

543
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,400
Be honest with me.

544
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,610
I just found what he said too gross.

545
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,050
That's already unbearable to you?

546
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,890
He's said more gross things before.

547
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,210
Tell me.

548
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,730
If you hear a woman talking to me like that,

549
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,850
can you bear it?

550
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,920
Xue Yiming.

551
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,490
You know me.

552
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,880
I can be very serious when I want to.

553
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,930
Do you dare be serious with me?

554
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,610
Why wouldn't I dare?

555
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,290
I'm very serious.

556
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,540
Fine.

557
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,850
Then update a phone of us on your social media later.

558
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,730
Okay.

559
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,130
Make it visible to all. Do you dare?

560
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,520
Then do you dare delete

561
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,050
all the guys' numbers

562
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,410
in your phone?

563
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,930
Sure. That's no big deal.

564
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,170
Don't try to fool me

565
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,650
by changing a guy's name

566
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,320
and profile photo

567
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,400
into those of a girl's.

568
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,610
Then

569
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,850
do you dare make our photo

570
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,930
your WeChat profile photo?

571
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,840
Do you dare add my face ID

572
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,490
to your phone?

573
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,890
Do you dare put all your calls on the speaker

574
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,850
in the future?

575
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,410
Do you dare promise to come home before twelve

576
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,930
when you go out drinking in the future?

577
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,250
Then you have to take me with you

578
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,690
when you dine with clients

579
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,010
and can't ask for the numbers of actresses and motels.

580
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,000
Do you dare?

581
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,370
Then when you dine with clients,

582
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,450
you have to tell me

583
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,770
where you are and who you're with

584
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,290
and send me a photo as evidence. Do you dare?

585
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:08,730
Answer it.

586
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,050
Put it on the speaker.

587
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,090
You answer it.

588
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,290
Hello, who's it?

589
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,050
Hello.

590
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,850
This is Director Xue's number, right?

591
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,210
He.

592
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,930
Hello, Mr. He.

593
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,010
I'm having a meeting with Xue.

594
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,050
Are you Shanshan?

595
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,280
Talking to you is the same.

596
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,250
I hear

597
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,690
that Director Jian paid out of her own pocket

598
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,050
to finish shooting the video.

599
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:52,840
Yes.

600
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,650
I was so surprised when I heard about it.

601
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,250
So,

602
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,210
how's the project going now?

603
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,290
We want to take a look at it

604
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,080
and meet Director Jian.

605
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,330
The shooting is done.

606
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,850
We're doing post-production now.

607
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,930
Tell me in advance when you want to come.

608
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:10,530
I'll arrange it.

609
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:11,850
That's great.

610
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,640
How about tomorrow?

611
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,410
We'll go check the video

612
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,530
and have a meal together

613
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,210
to comfort Director Jian.

614
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,640
Let me thank you on her behalf.

615
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,410
Okay. I'll ask her if she's free tomorrow.

616
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,640
Great, Shanshan.

617
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,090
I'll wait for you to call back.

618
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,040
Okay.

619
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,920
I'll reply to you tomorrow.

620
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,560
Okay.

621
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,330
Bye.

622
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,490
Bah!

623
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,130
Where was he when she was injured?

624
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,410
Now he shows up and pretends to care.

625
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,290
Don't mind him.

626
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:49,610
Well,

627
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,410
how should we make it work between us?

628
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:57,760
Now,

629
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,170
I only have this one phone.

630
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,250
It's at your disposal.

631
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:03,770
What do you say?

632
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,320
No need for that.

633
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,600
Do with it what you see fit.

634
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,320
I completely trust you.

635
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,170
How about this?

636
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,730
Girls I sometimes chat with are in the first group.

637
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,370
Delete.

638
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,050
In the second group

639
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,210
are those I sometimes eat with.

640
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,610
Delete.

641
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,650
There are only several girls in the third group.

642
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,650
I'll…

643
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,650
Delete.

644
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:43,610
Happy now?

645
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:46,850
Will you regret it?

646
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,730
Never.

647
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:58,730
Fine.

648
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:00,490
How about this?

649
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,570
Let's forget about

650
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,650
changing profile photos.

651
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,290
We're too old

652
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,770
for that.

653
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,200
That's childish.

654
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:10,840
I agree.

655
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,490
You look dashing.

656
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,650
Are you going to meet that Pan girl?

657
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,290
Don't mention that girl.

658
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:35,730
Why?

659
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,930
After Yang lost his job,

660
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:38,850
Tian Limei

661
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,650
never called me again.

662
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,090
Really?

663
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,560
I think that girl

664
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,690
doesn't like him anymore.

665
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,370
Nowadays,

666
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,200
everyone is realistic.

667
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,970
They decide how they feel for someone

668
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,000
based on material things.

669
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,600
Yes.

670
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,290
Mom.

671
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,160
Pan Rou is not that kind of girl.

672
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,770
I've told you

673
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,920
that she was just my colleague.

674
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,890
You look so handsome today.

675
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,330
Where are you going?

676
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,530
Work.

677
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,530
Work?

678
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,290
Why didn't I see you

679
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,410
dress like that when you went to work before?

680
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,120
It's great.

681
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,930
You look dapper.

682
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,480
It's better than being disheveled.

683
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,490
Yes.

684
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:18,850
Yang.

685
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,770
I'm sticking my nose where it doesn't belong

686
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,410
but I think you should put relationship issues aside for now.

687
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,330
You haven't found a job yet.

688
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,090
There's no hurry to find a girlfriend.

689
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,130
As a man, your priority

690
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:29,970
is to build a career.

691
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:30,610
Dad.

692
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,650
I'm really going to work.

693
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,450
I'm talking about work.

694
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,210
Your dad is right.

695
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,010
Pan thinks you're not good enough for her.

696
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,010
But it's okay.

697
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,200
-Yes.
-Don't be downhearted.

698
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,450
You'll meet someone better.

699
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,930
Mom, I'm not downhearted.

700
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,010
Yang.

701
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,610
I have to say this.

702
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,650
You're very young. Don't stress yourself out.

703
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,130
Look at your dad. He's never achieved anything.

704
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,850
Wait. What does it have to do with me?

705
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,890
You're the bad example in this family.

706
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,690
Your father has never achieved anything

707
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,210
but married a woman like me.

708
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:06,000
A person's value can't solely be decided by how much money they have.

709
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,530
Right?

710
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,850
Look at you.

711
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,720
You're hard-working

712
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,010
and responsible.

713
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,080
That's what matters.

714
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,010
And the most important thing

715
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,690
is

716
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,610
that you're lucky.

717
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,890
You look like me.

718
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,450
You're handsome.

719
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,130
If you looked like him,

720
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,210
it'd be hard for you to find a girlfriend.

721
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,010
Really.

722
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,690
You're so right.

723
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,290
I'm going to be late for work.

724
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,050
Dad, Mom.

725
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,290
I'm leaving. Bye.

726
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,450
Your wallet, key, and phone.

727
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,930
Have you got all of them?

728
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,290
Yes.

729
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:39,890
Take care.

730
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:40,840
I'm leaving.

731
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,490
He didn't even have enough breakfast.

732
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,000
What?

733
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,450
Are we just one fried dough stick away from bankruptcy?

734
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,210
Shut up.

735
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,090
I'll buy more tomorrow.

736
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,970
Hold on. What did you mean just now?

737
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,610
A man looking like me can't find a girlfriend?

738
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,320
Come on. Tell me.

739
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,690
How come a pretty girl named Luo Meijuan

740
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,650
got married to Sheng Xiangqian?

741
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,920
Because she was blind.

742
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,450
There he is.

743
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,290
Sheng Yang.

744
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:56,810
Morning.

745
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,410
The director got plans today.

746
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,490
She asked me to tell you

747
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,410
that she wouldn't be here today.

748
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,970
She's watched the part you made yesterday.

749
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,130
She found it great in general.

750
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,290
and has some advice for you.

751
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,210
She left you a note on the computer.

752
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,080
Check it and you'll know.

753
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:09,770
Okay.

754
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,050
The forty-fifth frame.

755
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,760
The special effect of rain falling

756
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,370
is not at the same speed as the rain we filmed.

757
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:32,730
Everything else is great.

758
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,050
-There you are.
-Mr. Fang.

759
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:36,489
Come.

760
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,370
I brought you some water.

761
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,010
Thank you.

762
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:39,530
Well,

763
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:40,600
I want to know

764
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,170
how long this game is.

765
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,210
There are three rounds in total.

766
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,610
Each round takes 20 minutes.

767
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:46,969
Between every two rounds,

768
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:48,489
there are 15 minutes of break.

769
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,610
So the game takes 90 minutes in total.

770
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,170
One and a half hours?

771
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:51,520
Yes.

772
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,090
So it starts at nine

773
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,449
and ends at 10:30, right?

774
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:55,170
Yes.

775
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:55,719
Great.

776
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:56,810

Okay. Please come in.

780

781
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,930
It's the captain's jersey.

782

I return it to you.

783

We all count on you today.

785
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,250
Can you handle it?

786
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,810
I've got a regional nerve block.

787
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,370
I'm fine. Don't worry.

788
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,450
After the game starts,

789
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,570
if you feel any pain,

790
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,810
get off the rink immediately.

791

You'll break my leg.

796
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,410
Tie your shoelaces tightly.

797
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,850
Okay.

798
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,250

799

Yes!

800
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,920
You've all learned how well the Joint University plays

801
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,130
through the videos of their matches.

802
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,280
You'll compete against them today.

we'll find out soon.

805
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,850

Yes.

819
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,330

-Mr. He will come this afternoon.
-Okay.

823

-How's the editing going?
-Okay.

824
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,370
Director Jian said she'd be late

825
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,730
and asked me to wait for her to watch the video together.

826
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,210
Why do you have to wait for her?

827
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,490
Let me take a look first.

828
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,370
If there's anything wrong,

829
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,490
I can help her make modifications.

830
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,570
The special effects need to be changed.

831
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,120
Director Jian wants to explain it to the client.

832
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,330
No need to explain. I can understand it.

833
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,080

947
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,570
Who is he?

948
00:40:59,210 --> 00:40:59,810
Shanshan.

949
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,130
Director Jian invited him to do the special effects.

950
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,690
The HR department

951
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,170
should've informed me of it.

952
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,650
What's your name?

953
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:07,930
My name is Sheng Yang.

954
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,010
You are Sheng Yang?

955
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,400
Yes.

956
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,290
What would you like to drink? I'll buy something for you too.

957
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:19,050
No, thanks.

958
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,090
Don't be shy.

959
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,050
How about a latte?

960
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,650
Okay.

961
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,280
Thank you.

962
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,810
What's going on?

963
00:41:58,650 --> 00:41:59,890
You almost bumped into the door.

964
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,210
Who is he?

965
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,330
You heard it.

966
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,770
Jian Bing invited him here to do special effects.

967
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,360
That doesn't mean you have to

968
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,240
be so nice to him.

969
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,010
He's good-looking.

970
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,250
We agreed on this last night.

971
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,930
No more flirting.

972
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,490
It's not even 24 hours

973
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,650
yet you're doing it again.

974
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,010
Stop being jealous.

975
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,210
I don't dare

976
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,370
flirt with that guy.

977
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,200
What do you mean?

978
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,730
He's the guy who sent Jian Bing

979
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,210
to the hotel the other day.

980
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,720
You've talked on the phone with him.

981
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:37,450
I…

982
59:59:54,000 --> 00:00:04,000
