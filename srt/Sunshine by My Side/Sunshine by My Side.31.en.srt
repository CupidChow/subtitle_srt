Sleep.

192
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,220
Okay.

193
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,180
Girlfriend.

194
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,300
Now!

195
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,500
Come.

196
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,180
Come down.

197
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,580
-Come down.
-Won't you…

198
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,500
Won't you come up?

199
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,780
You can't sleep there.

200
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,420
Come down and sleep on the sofa.

201
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,780
Hand me that sketchbook.

202
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,700
Thank you.

203
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,420
Are you going to sleep on your feet?

204
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,420
Don't look at me.

205
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,780
How can I sleep with you staring at me?

206
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,500
Go over there.

207
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,180
Okay.

208
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,420
Don't turn off the light.

209
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,020
Okay. I'll turn off the light.

210
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,900
Don't turn off the light.

211
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:01,980
Okay.

212
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,700
Will your parents suddenly come in?

213
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,100
Don't worry.

214
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,060
I'll watch the door for you.

215
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,650
Sheng Yang.

216
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,500
Have you really never

217
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,460
been in a relationship before?

218
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,210
I swear to God, no.

219
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,460
Turn off the light. I can't sleep.

220
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,500
Okay.

221
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,780
Good night.

222
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,300
Girlfriend.

223
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,060
Good night.

224
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,460
Hao Junjie.

225
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,260
Why don't we

226
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,290
give it a try?

227
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,420
What are you doing?

228
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,860
Giving it a try.

229
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,420
You got me wrong.

230
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,820
I mean,

231
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,580
try starting a relationship.

232
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,100
We don't need to try that.

233
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,700
Your sister has approved it.

234
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,260
Hao Junjie.

235
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,770
The night is still young.

236
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,460
How

237
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,460
should we

238
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,420
pass the time?

239
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,140
How to pass the time?

240
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,500
What can we do?

241
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,020
You tell me.

242
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,580
You boys are good at it.

243
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,340
You have lots of that kind of stuff on your phone.

244
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,260
You reminded me.

245
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,460
Yeah.

246
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,020
Recently,

247
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,420
I've found an amazing game.

248
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,220
This one.

249
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,980
Get it on your phone. I'll help you level up.

250
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,300
What?

251
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,620
I'm good at it.

252
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,250
You don't know how to play?

253
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,980
I can teach you.

254
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:43,500
[Unknown Caller]

255
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,090
Sheng Yang.

256
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,900
Sheng Yang.

257
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,420
Sheng Yang.

258
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,340
I haven't gone to the company after coming back from the business trip.

259
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,060
I have to go this morning.

260
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,050
Okay. I…

261
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,340
Put on your coat first.

262
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,300
I…

263
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,580
Wait a second.

264
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,140
Let me see what my parents are doing.

265
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,380
Good morning, Yang.

266
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,500
Morning, Dad.

267
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,500
Morning.

268
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,620
Let's have eggs for breakfast.

269
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,540
How would you like them, fried or steamed?

270
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:00,980
Steam them.

271
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,130
Nice choice. Steamed eggs are nutritious.

272
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,780
Thank you, Dad.

273
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,740
Are my shoes at the door?

274
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,300
Shoes?

275
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,540
I forgot.

276
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,380
My mom took them out.

277
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,220
Is it clear?

278
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,090
Come out.

279
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,010
Yang.

280
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,860
Mom.

281
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,140
The mask Bing gave me is great.

282
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,050
It's cool and moisturizing.

283
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,100
Is it? That's great.

284
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,210
Close your eyes tight. Don't open them.

285
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,250
You don't want it in your eyes.

286
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,460
Mom, I'll take the trash downstairs.

287
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,380
Okay.

288
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,900
So comfortable.

289
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,660
He said he'd take the trash out.

290
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,860
Why is it still here?

291
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,940
Where is he?

292
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,490
Go back now.

293
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,380
You said you'd take the trash out

294
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,700
but came down with nothing.

295
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,180
You're leaving already?

296
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,140
Won't you say goodbye to your boyfriend?

297
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,860
Fine.

298
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,900
How do you want me to say goodbye?

299
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,290
At least, you should

300
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,260
give me a hug.

301
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,500
Plus a…

302
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,940
A what?

303
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,300
We agreed on this last night.

304
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,340
You'll do whatever I say.

305
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,420
This is your neighborhood.

306
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,260
If your neighbors see us…

307
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,260
No one will see us.

308
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,660
They'll tell your mother.

309
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,900
I don't care.

310
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,900
Your mother.

311
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,420
Your mother!

312
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,300
Where?

313
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,380
She's gone back.

314
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,220
Hell.

315
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,220
Your mother saw me.

316
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,140
It's okay

317
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,020
that she saw you. She likes you very much.

318
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,770
Ms. Jian, are you shy?

319
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,460
No.

320
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,100
I'm embarrassed. Your mother likes me

321
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,500
because I'm your aunt.

322
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,420
[Jian Shuang: Where are you? Jian Zhongde is in hospital.]

323
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,300
What's wrong? Something's happened at work?

324
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,940
Yes. There's something

325
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,420
I need to deal with now.

326
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,050
Listen.

327
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,290
Go upstairs now.

328
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,860
Your mother and I looked at each other

329
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,940
for like three seconds.

330
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,740
Go up and check on her.

331
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,620
It's really okay.

332
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,500
-Let me…
-No.

333
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,540
The mission I give you now

334
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,380
is to go upstairs and check on her.

335
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:53,900
Okay.

336
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,970
Okay. I'll do it.

337
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,300
Girlfriend, goodbye.

338
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,500
Boyfriend, goodbye.

339
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,660
Go, go.

340
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,660
Remember to call me.

341
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,500
Don't worry. I can handle it.

342
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,140
Go.

343
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,900
Bye.

344
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,340
Bye.

345
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,010
She really saw me.

346
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,570
Call me.

347
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,900
Bye.

348
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,780
Girlfriend.

349
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:31,790
[Jian Shuang: Where are you? Jian Zhongde is in hospital.]
[Jian Bing: Send me the hospital's address.]

350
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,380
Mom.

351
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:49,940
Wait.

352
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,940
Yang just called you.

353
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,620
What's going on?

354
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,090
Mom.

355
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,660
Dad.

356
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,780
Why is she so angry?

357
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,180
What did she tell you?

358
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,340
Are you and Jian Bing an item now?

359
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,540
She's against it?

360
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,980
No explanation!

361
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,010
I don't need you to explain.

362
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,140
I'm a bit confused now.

363
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,420
Your mom said she saw you

364
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,420
with Jian Bing.

365
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,500
You can't deny it.

366
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,300
Anyway,

367
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,340
Luo Meijuan has the final say in this family.

368
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,700
Her attitude is my attitude.

369
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,180
Her attitude is this family's attitude.

370
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,740
I'll just do

371
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,940
whatever she says.

372
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,290
Are you together?

373
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,180
Shut up.

374
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,340
Don't give me that! I'm not listening.

375
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,380
Say nothing more.

376
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,700
Are you kidding me?

377
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,140
No.

378
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,980
You've been strong-minded since young.

379
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,620
I want no part of this.

380
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,570
Your mom has high blood pressure and I have heart problems.

381
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,940
We'd love to live for a few more years.

382
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,140
I'll explain to her.

383
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,700
She's taken a stand just now.

384
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,140
If you're serious with Jian Bing,

385
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,340
take it slow.

386
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,740
In a few days,

387
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,140
threaten your mom with moving out.

388
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
Is that necessary?

389
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,420
Just play it by ear.

390
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,180
You've gone too far!

391
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,730
She looked terrified when she came in.

392
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,860
Reflect on yourself.

393
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,340
Have your breakfast.

394
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,700
Why are you crying?

395
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,700
I've scolded him.

396
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,900
Don't cry.

397
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,300
Bing.

398
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,620
Doctor.

399
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,460
Are you his family?

400
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,020
Yes.

401
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,020
I've told

402
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,740
the patient's condition to this girl.

403
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,490
He had a heart attack.

404
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,140
We dissolved the clot last night.

405
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,580
For now,

406
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,860
he's in the clear.

407
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,500
I suggest a bypass surgery.

408
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,650
No surgery.

409
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,140
Sorry, Doctor.

410
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,580
Please continue.

411
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,700
He can have the surgery next week at the earliest.

412
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,940
If you decide to have it,

413
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,140
make an appointment immediately.

414
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,180
I'll leave you to discuss it.

415
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,340
Okay.

416
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,330
I know my body.

417
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,100
I'm tired of living.

418
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,100
Pull out the needle.

419
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,180
Pull it out!

420
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,780
Don't move.

421
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,100
Doctor, don't mind us.

422
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,220
We'll talk about it.

423
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,500
-Jian Shuang, see the doctor out.
-Okay.

424
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,300
Keep an eye on him.

425
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:12,980
Watch over him.

426
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,330
Thanks a lot.

427
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:14,980
Thank you.

428
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,740
Thank you.

429
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,660
So you don't want me to die.

430
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,740
I thought you were looking forward to it.

431
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,820
You know what?

432
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,020
You're more and more like your mother.

433
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,100
Not only your face

434
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,100
but also the way you talk.

435
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,260
They both remind me of her.

436
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,380
Your personalities are even more similar.

437
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,380
Go get me my son-in-law.

438
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,220
I want to drink with him.

439
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,980
I love

440
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,220
drinking with him.

441
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,180
He can understand me.

442
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,180
Stop daydreaming.

443
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,060
Listen.

444
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,380
You have no right to mention my mom.

445
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,100
Don't talk about her ever again.

446
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,380
I'm dying.

447
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,980
I'll just say whatever I want.

448
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,660
All I want to do now is be happy.

449
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,820
I want to live happily.

450
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,340
Get me a single room.

451
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,980
I want a single room! Do you hear me?

452
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,330
The kind with a bathroom.

453
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,100
I want to watch TV alone.

454
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,580
The food here sucks.

455
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,180
I want food from big restaurants.

456
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,700
Do you hear me? I want food from big restaurants!

457
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,580
Stop yelling.

458
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,290
This is the hospital.

459
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,020
Dad, Mom.

460
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,420
I've prepared lunch for you.

461
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,460
It's on the table.

462
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,620
Come out and eat.

463
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
If you don't want to see me,

464
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,060
I'll go out

465
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,260
and come back when you're not angry anymore, okay?

466
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,590
[Inbox]

467
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,690
I've turned on email notifications.

468
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,810
I'll get a notification

469
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,130
when the result of the interview is out.

470
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,100
You don't have to stare at it.

471
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:57,940
Are you feeling better?

472
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,300
Yeah. I feel much better after taking the medicine.

473
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,820
Don't worry about me. Go back to school.

474
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,820
Ride safe.

475
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,340
Text me when you arrive.

476
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,100
Something's up.

477
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,660
I don't know if I should tell you.

478
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,900
What's wrong? Are you in trouble again?

479
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,620
Not me.

480
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,100
It's Ms. Jian Bing.

481
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,060
What's wrong with her?

482
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:28,940
Her father had a heart attack.

483
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,300
Stop.

484
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,740
I don't want to know anything about her.

485
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,290
That day,

486
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,820
when I visited her,

487
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,810
she made it very clear.

488
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,220
She rejected me.

489
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:42,020
So I can't meddle in her business again.

490
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,330
I have no right to do that.

491
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,500
I can't

492
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,820
disrupt her life anymore.

493
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,180
Jian Shuang told me her father is a douchebag.

494
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,820
Shut up.

495
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,740
I'm not interested.

496
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,460
You…

497
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,420
Ms. Jian Bing's father made her cry today.

498
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,900
What does that have to do with me?

499
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,220
Someone else will take care of her. She doesn't need me.

500
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,860
Who am I to show concern?

501
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,820
Why are you still here?

502
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,540
Leave now.

503
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,660
Are you leaving or not?

504
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,660
I'm warning you.

505
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,700
When you're with Jian Shuang,

506
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,260
don't cross any lines.

507
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,580
Otherwise, I'll tell your mother.

508
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,740
Her father is in the People's Hospital.

509
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,180
Her father is in the People's Hospital.

510
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,980
You can use a doctor too.

511
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,420
Ms. Jian Bing is so poor.

512
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,860
She has to

513
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,300
look after her father who has heart disease

514
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,700
and is a scumbag.

515
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,740
Don't you think she's very pitiful?

516
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,220
She's so strong but cried today.

517
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,460
I wonder if she needs help.

518
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,020
I'm leaving.

519
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,220
It's none of my business.

520
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,500
I won't go.

521
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,540
What is

522
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,460
the aesthetics of music?

523
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,460
It seems a simple question.

524
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,740
Naturally, it's about studying music.

525
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,180
Hey.

526
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,380
Hey.

527
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,420
How are things with you?

528
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,180
Good.

529
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,620
How about you?

530
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,410
Your mother…

531
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,740
She's fine.

532
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,740
She didn't say anything?

533
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,860
No.

534
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,060
Why would I lie to you?

535
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,020
They've taken a stand.

536
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,940
They said

537
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,500
that my attitude

538
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,820
is their attitude.

539
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,860
My decision

540
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,340
is their decision.

541
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,500
What's wrong?

542
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,380
Is something bothering you?

543
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,140
No.

544
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,060
Just to let you know, I'm going

545
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,420
to be busy with shooting.

546
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,700
So I'll see you in a couple of days, okay?

547
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,260
Are you

548
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,300
breaking up with me?

549
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,660
Why did you say that?

550
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,260
I don't know.

551
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,940
It's just a feeling.

552
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,740
You're so insecure.

553
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,100
I am.

554
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,460
You're too good for me.

555
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:39,860
I'm afraid

556
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,140
you'll abandon me for someone else.

557
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,340
What if I do?

558
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,740
You…

559
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,980
What do you mean?

560
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,420
Well,

561
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,420
if you abandon me for someone else,

562
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,860
I'll work very hard,

563
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,740
make a lot of money,

564
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,780
and fool around with girls

565
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,020
to make you mad as hell.

566
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,060
Nice plan.

567
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,180
Jian Bing, listen.

568
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,300
I'm a diamond in the rough.

569
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,100
If you don't hold on to me now,

570
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,020
you'll regret it in the future.

571
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,179
You make it sound like I'm with you

572
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,460
because I believe you'll be successful in the future.

573
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,620
Are you saying

574
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,340
that you're only drawn to my appearance?

575
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:23,860
Yang.

576
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,860
Yang, come out.

577
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:31,739
Madam Luo

578
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:32,820
just came out.

579
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:33,940
Perhaps,

580
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,460
she wants to show me her new dress.

581
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,500
I guess

582
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,659
she bought it to see you.

583
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,500
Then go to her now.

584
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:43,940
Okay.

585
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:44,739
I'll go

586
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,449
and praise her.

587
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:50,980
Jian Bing.

588
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,139
Bye.

589
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,140
Girlfriend.

590
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,140
Bye.

591
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,020
Nowadays, when I'm thirsty,

592
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,340
I don't go for black tea, green tea, chamomile tea,

593
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,180
or goji berry tea.

594
00:35:59,340 --> 00:35:59,900
Plain water is good enough.

595
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,140
Have some water.

596
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:06,580
Yang.

597
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,260
Here.

598
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,380
Yang.

599
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,340
I've thought about it for a long time.

600
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,980
You should move out.

601
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,300
What did you say?

602
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,300
You've grown up.

603
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,340
It's time for you to move out.

604
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,770
Mom.

605
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,100
I can move out.

606
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,260
But I have a question.

607
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,260
Didn't you like Jian Bing very much?

608
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,500
Why are you so angry

609
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,090
about her being my girlfriend?

610
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,820
You even want to kick me out for it.

611
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,100
She's not right for you.

612
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,620
How?

613
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,540
Age?

614
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,890
She's too good.

615
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,900
Life will be hard for you.

616
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,060
That's not a reason.

617
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,540
You don't understand

618
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,610
because you haven't experienced it.

619
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,900
As time goes by,

620
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,500
problems

621
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,540
will pop out one after another.

622
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,220
Then I'll solve them one by one.

623
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,050
Do you think you can solve them all?

624
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,580
Let me ask you.

625
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,420
How much does she earn every year?

626
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,580
How much do you earn?

627
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,540
When you two go on a trip,

628
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,980
she flies first class

629
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,740
and stays in a five-star hotel. How about you?

630
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,140
Economy class

631
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,650
and a budget hotel?

632
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,300
She's used to

633
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,900
dining at fancy Michelin-starred restaurants.

634
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,650
How about you?

635
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,020
Are you going to take her

636
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,850
to eat at roadside stalls every day?

637
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,580
On festivals,

638
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,660
birthdays,

639
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,860
and anniversaries,

640
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,220
she'll give you designer things as gifts.

641
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,820
What can you give her?

642
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,780
Trinkets?

643
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,300
Yang.

644
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,340
Your mom means

645
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,820
that Jian Bing is a big boss

646
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,500
and a great director.

647
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,050
So many people work under her.

648
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,700
She's very busy and under great pressure.

649
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,700
What can you help her with?

650
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,380
Look at yourself in the mirror.

651
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,130
Either in terms of financial condition

652
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,620
or life experience,

653
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,540
are you a good match for her?

654
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,900
Am I that bad

655
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,340
in your eyes?

656
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,140
You're not bad.

657
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,530
There's just a huge gap

658
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,580
between your age and experience.

659
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,940
When you reach her age,

660
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,500
maybe

661
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,980
you'll have everything as well.

662
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,340
But now,

663
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,820
she's seen the world,

664
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,020
so when she's with you,

665
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,660
she's patronizing you.

666
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,940
Where did you learn that word?

667
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,580
Yang.

668
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,500
Your mom is saying

669
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,100
that a good match

670
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,500
is very important.

671
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,540
It's wisdom passed down from one generation to another.

672
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,460
On the surface, we're against it

673
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,180
just because she's older than you.

674
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,940
In fact…

675
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,460
In fact, we aren't that conservative.

676
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,380
The age gap is not a serious matter anymore.

677
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,060
Nowadays,

678
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,460
some women are more than

679
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,620
twenty years older than their spouses.

680
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,980
And cosmetic surgeries

681
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,420
can do wonders now, can't they?

682
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,220
Yeah.

683
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,860
A woman in her thirties can look like a twenty-something.

684
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,090
A woman in her thirties can look like a thirty-something.

685
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,540
Vera Wang, the wedding dress designer,

686
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,020
she's over 70 years old

687
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,100
but her boyfriend is around your age.

688
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,180
Women nowadays

689
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,340
are competent,

690
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,420
rich,

691
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,700
and smart.

692
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,220
They can date men younger than them.

693
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,740
If I'm that competent,

694
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,980
I'll date a young man too.

695
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,180
If I'm that competent,

696
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,220
I'll date a young woman too.

697
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,180
Are you competent?

698
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:50,740
No.

699
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,660
So I'll stick with you.

700
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,460
Is that what you mean?

701
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,500
Yes.

702
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,860
I'm just worried about you.

703
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,820
You're too deep in love

704
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,060
to see the problems in reality.

705
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,180
Do you have money?

706
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,860
Do you have a car or a house?

707
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,500
Do you have a stable job?

708
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,050
Have you ever

709
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,700
carefully planned your future with her?

710
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,540
Are you going to show your love

711
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,420
just by saying "I love you"?

712
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,420
Sweet moments don't last.

713
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,980
Small details in life are the beginning of the challenge.

714
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,260
If you're determined to be a kept man,

715
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:31,900
I…

716
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,260
I won't say anything.

717
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,900
But I know my son is proud.

718
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,900
Being with Jian Bing,

719
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,740
you'll feel inferior

720
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,340
and try to make yourself better.

721
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,740
You'll work very hard without giving yourself a break

722
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,300
and exhaust yourself.

723
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,340
Son, I don't want that for you.

724
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,580
Dad.

725
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:09,860
Mom.

726
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,930
It's my decision.

727
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:14,740
My choice.

728
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,340
You know

729
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,860
how tough your son is.

730
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,740
If I wanted an easy life,

731
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,260
I wouldn't have started my own business.

732
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,100
I don't care

733
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,300
how many difficulties I'll meet

734
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,340
when I'm with her.

735
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,980
Whether you like it or not,

736
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,980
I love her.

737
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,460
No matter what happens in the future,

738
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,540
I'll accept it.

739
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,740
Deep down,

740
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,900
I know it's useless to worry.

741
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,420
So,

742
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,180
I want you to move out.

743
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,940
After you move out,

744
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,460
you'll be out of our sight and minds.

745
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,580
How you live your life

746
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,130
will be your own business.

747
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,420
Your dad and I

748
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,140
can't go any further with you.

749
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,100
From now on,

750
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,620
you're on your own.

751
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,890
No one can be on their own.

752
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,570
He needed us when he was young.

753
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,460
We'll need him when we're old.

754
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,980
I can't live on my own.

755
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,020
I'm not asking.

756
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,380
It's decided.

757
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,460
I know.
