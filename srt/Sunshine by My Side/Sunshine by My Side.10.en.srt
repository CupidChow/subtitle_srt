[Episode 10]

4
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,289
-Okay.
-There were people who thought

5
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,720
that I shouldn't get a divorce at 36,

6
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,320
but I did.

7
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,170
What's there to be afraid of?

8
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,729
Bing.

9
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,930
I'm here to fix your pipe.

10
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,920
Your ex-husband?

11
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,600
It sounds like him.

12
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,840
Don't make a sound.

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,759
Sit here and don't move.

14
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,120
I...

15
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,090
Coming.

16
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,210
I'm here to fix the pipe.

17
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,770
Did Liang Shanshan tell you?

18
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,960
It's telepathy.

19
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,930
I knew it that our...

20
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:28,370
No.

21
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,320
Your water pipe must be broken.

22
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,800
Your telepathy has a delay.

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,520
It's already fixed. Go back.

24
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,200
No, no, no.

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,040
Well...

26
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,800
The pendant light in the kitchen

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,450
keeps swaying.

28
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,050
Did you know that?

29
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
I'm afraid that some day

30
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,630
it might...

31
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,329
No.

32
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,120
It might fall and hit you.

33
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,280
What are you doing?

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,010
You're not letting me in.

35
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,930
Is someone home?

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,010
It's none of your business

37
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,400
even if there are 100 people in my home.

38
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,680
The tap in the bathroom is a bit...

39
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,050
It's fixed.

40
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,360
There's a light here.

41
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,880
Don't forget our current relationship.

42
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,000
Let me see the pipe.

43
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,120
Not bad.

44
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,770
You even learned how to fix this?

45
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,690
Didn't you want to fix the light?

46
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,210
What's wrong with it?

47
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:37,850
It sways.

48
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,410
It's fixed by itself.

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,770
Not bad.

50
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,000
You started cooking by yourself.

51
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,360
You even made three dishes and a porridge.

52
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,370
I even learned how to fix pipes.

53
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,360
Cooking is nothing compared to that.

54
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,570
I'm independent.

55
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,570
Gotta be strong.

56
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,600
When you're alone at home,

57
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,730
you must close the windows, doors,

58
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,010
and everything well.

59
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,850
You're living alone now.

60
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,600
I'll ask my friend

61
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,920
to set up

62
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,490
a smart security system for you.

63
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,810
This way, everything can be seen.

64
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,250
Everyone can see it?

65
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,400
Don't worry. I won't look.

66
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,450
Well,

67
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,360
if you need any help,

68
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,650
just call me, alright?

69
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,080
Why did you ask Liang Shanshan

70
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,840
to call me?

71
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,800
Won't that bother you?

72
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,240
No, nothing about you

73
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,760
is a bother for me.

74
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,650
Are you done?

75
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,440
Is there anything else you need to repair?

76
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,130
If not,

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,170
just go home.

78
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,040
Okay.

79
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm leaving then.

80
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,880
I'm really leaving.

81
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,650
Go.

82
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,730
Bye.

83
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,850
I'm seriously leaving.

84
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,330
I'm leaving now.

85
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,890
You don't know how to walk anymore?

86
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,840
-Let me teach you.
-Don't...

87
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,450
Please don't get physical.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,850
If you feel scared alone,

89
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,080
you...

90
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,440
If you're scared, I can stay with you for a while.

91
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,760
Sheng Yang.

92
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,680
Sheng Yang.

93
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,480
Sheng Yang, come out.

94
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,560
I’m here.

95
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,960
Why are you so childish?

96
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,400
He left.

97
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,360
I told you to sit here.

98
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,490
Why did you hide?

99
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,120
Didn't you just get divorced?

100
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,160
I was afraid he'd misunderstand you

101
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,490
if he saw me.

102
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,160
You're quite considerate.

103
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,280
There's nothing to misunderstand.

104
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,760
Can't I have a friend

105
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,800
to help me fix the pipe?

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,920
Sure.

107
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,320
Then,

108
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,730
I'll ask him to eat dinner with us.

109
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,480
Go ahead.

110
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,800
Ex-husband,

111
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,520
Director Jian asked you to come back for dinner.

112
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,560
Just kidding.

113
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,480
Why would I embarrass my friend,

114
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,080
right?

115
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,409
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

116
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,890
We're divorced already.

117
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,360
It's me.

118
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm the one who's afraid.

119
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,210
Look, I even hid.

120
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,000
It's not cold yet.

121
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:06,960
It's still hot.

122
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,240
I can sleep here. It's good.

123
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,409
I feel free.

124
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,410
Would it kill you to speak first?

125
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,840
You fixed the pipe,

126
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,370
cooked the meal,

127
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,560
washed the dishes,

128
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,120
and even cleaned the kitchen.

129
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm sitting here like a couch potato.

130
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,410
I love it.

131
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:07,530
Let me tell you.

132
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,480
I really need a friend like you.

133
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,520
How about

134
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,000
I mop the floor for you?

135
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,530
I have a cleaner.

136
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,370
But thanks.

137
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
So,

138
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,370
it's getting late.

139
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,880
Yes.

140
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,280
I'll get going.

141
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,200
You should go home and rest.

142
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,210
You have a storm to face tomorrow.

143
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,290
Cheer up.

144
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,050
Cheer up.

145
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:43,960
Actually,

146
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,360
if possible...

147
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,000
Of course,

148
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,520
if it's not a disturbance for you,

149
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,210
can I stay a little longer at your house?

150
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,320
Can I leave a little later?

151
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,050
You don't want to go home?

152
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,360
No.

153
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,200
I...

154
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,490
It's mainly the injury on my face.

155
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,440
I'm afraid my parents will see it when I go home.

156
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,290
They will definitely ask me all sorts of things.

157
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,240
What if I accidentally reveal

158
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,810
that I beat someone up in the company

159
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,250
and I might even lose my job?

160
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:10,600
Then,

161
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,960
I'll really be dead meat.

162
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,410
So,

163
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,600
I want to sneak back

164
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,440
after they fall asleep.

165
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,810
You'll help a friend out,

166
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,160
right?

167
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,160
Don't you have any other friends?

168
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,290
Aren't you my friend?

169
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,560
Yes.

170
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:49,680
Director Jian,

171
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,520
don't worry.

172
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,050
I...

173
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,610
I'll just stay

174
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,410
in this area.

175
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,840
I promise I won't bother you.

176
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,640
I...

177
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,280
I'll be like your statue

178
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,000
and not move at all.

179
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,730
I swear

180
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,250
you won't notice my existence.

181
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,160
Okay?

182
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,920
You're a living person.

183
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,440
If I couldn't notice your existence,

184
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,810
it would turn into a horror movie.

185
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,600
Look at the place you're sitting in.

186
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,120
Every day at this time,

187
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,320
I always sit somewhere to space out

188
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,410
or work.

189
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,280
That spot is right across from you.

190
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,880
Alright, I'll let you have this place today,

191
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,480
my friend.

192
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,200
I need to work.

193
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,080
Don't just sit there.

194
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,600
You

195
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,160
can have this area.

196
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,200
I...

197
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,440
I promise I won't make a sound.

198
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,680
Go ahead.

199
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,200
Lin,

200
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,210
for the reference of the makeup…

201
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,040
It's what we said in the meeting.

202
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,960
Organize the brand concepts

203
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,800
mentioned by the brand

204
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,640
and the problems

205
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,850
that I pointed out.

206
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,410
I'll add more in,

207
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,010
okay?

208
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,200
How would I know?

209
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,720
You'd have to ask them.

210
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,050

211
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,890
Why aren't you all sleeping?

212
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,280
I've never seen you all sleep before.

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,380
The Portuguese team continues to attack.

214
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,760
Thank you for taking me in last night.

215
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,839
Sorry for disturbing you.

216
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,640
Thank you,

Sheng Yang.

218
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,840
Our son didn't come back all night.

219
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,240
Did he text you?

220
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,530
Who knows where he went.

221
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,410
He didn't even call.

222
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:39,760
Luo Meijuan,

223
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,130
I'm talking to you.

224
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,360
Enough.

225
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,000
Stop it.

226
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,120
We're too old to be childish now.

227
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,120
Are you done with the tantrum?

228
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,800
Here's your card.

229
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,090
Gifts blind the eyes of the wise

230
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,090
and stop their mouths.

231
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,360
From now on,

232
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,560
we'll spend our own money.

233
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,480
I don't want to live according to your mood anymore.

234
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,600
What are you doing?

235
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,050
No.

236
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,730
We just had a small fight yesterday.

237
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,160
Right?

238
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,210
We had a cold war all night.

239
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,120
What's wrong with our relationship now?

240
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,440
You're really acting up now.

241
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,210
Don't you think I'm annoying?

242
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,200
I'm always being unreasonable

and fight with you about money.

244
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,650
Exactly.

245
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,640
You think I'm stingy.

246
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,170
Tell me,

247
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,210
why am I frugal with food and items?

248
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,440
Other than food and items,

249
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,850
is there nothing else in your life?

250
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,440
I walk back and forth in front of you every day.

251
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,800
Why can't you see me?

252
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,600
I'm not blind. Of course I see you.

253
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,610
You see my body,

254
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,040
but not my heart.

255
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,130
You thought all night

256
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,640

Your heart...

258
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,400
Isn't your heart a big, wide river?

259
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,440
There are steaks floating in the water,

260
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,560
and candlelit dinners,

261
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,160

00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,800
And dresses.

265

I'm not scolding you,

266
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,520
but regular people like us should just live normally.

267
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,570
We can live without being particular.

268
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,440
Have you taken your keys, phone,

269
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,450

270
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,370
Boss,

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,840
I understand

00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,450
the company's arrangement.

273
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,610
I thought about it all night.

274
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,640
I couldn't think of any good reason

275
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,920
to stop us from getting fired.

276
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,610
But if possible,

277
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,600
could you give me two more minutes?

278
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,920

are the three projects I'm currently in charge of.

have been accepted by the client.

284
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,000
The next step is to submit the samples

285

to the marketing department for evaluation

286
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,000

to give me another chance

as closure for myself and the company.

I can't think of a better way.

I can only use the most direct way

318

325
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,810
he did it because of me.

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,010
can you fire me first

finish his work at hand.

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,720
Then after he gets fired,

00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,240

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,720
my husband and son first.

385
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,050
Yes.

386
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,440
I only buy and cook the food they like.

387
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,290
Has anyone ever asked me what I like to eat?

388
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,080
In our family,

389
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,120
Sheng Yang ranks first.

390
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,490
His father ranks second.

391
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,640
I'm always ranked last.

392
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,000
I just follow behind them

393
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,330
and act as their nanny.

394
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,160
It's all the same for us women.

395
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,280
They say, "You're in charge of the money."

396
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,360
They make it sound nice.

397
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,970
"Money management."

398
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,920
You have to have money before you can manage it, right?

399
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,120
It's only 5,000 yuan a month.

400
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,720
It's not enough to spend

401
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,930
even if you scrimp and save.

402
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,370
But it's better now.

403
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,080
I returned his card.

404
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,290
I'll spend my own money now.

405
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,370
I don't have to worry anymore.

406
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,330
I'll buy whatever I want.

407
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,040
You'll only feel dignified

408
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,850
by spending your own money,

409
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,600
right?

410
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,090
We didn't fight for such a long time before.

411
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,880
She even gave me my card this morning.

412
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,720
What is this?

413
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Does she want a divorce?

414
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,690
Our son is already an adult

415
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,690
and she's doing this now.

416
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,920
Isn't this upsetting?

417
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,410
My son has grown up.

418
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,930
He can live on his own.

419
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,680
If I don't treat myself better,

420
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,690
at this time,

421
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,280
I won't be able to enjoy myself when I'm older

422
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,650
even if I want to.

423
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,090
Yes.

424
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:22,840
Shop.

425
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,050
Today, we're going to do revenge spending.

426
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,090
Of course.

427
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,520
I work in the supermarket every day.

428
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,240
I only dare to look at the discounted products.

429
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,440
I don't even dare to think about

430
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,090
the slightly more expensive things.

431
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,600
[Glamorous Skincare Gift Box]

432
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,090
Let's go check over there.

433
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,960
Has she changed recently?

434
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,240
Is something bothering her?

435
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,920
Of course not.

436
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,530
She attended a classmate reunion.

437
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,570
After that, she started flattering herself,

438
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,360
dressing up more,

439
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,040
and even saying pretentious things,

440
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,880
like wanting to pursue her inner world.

441
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,690
It looks more like she wants to jump over the moon.

442
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,570
Could it be

443
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,090
that she met someone

444
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,050
at the reunion?

445
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,290
Xiangqian,

446
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,240
don't think too much.

447
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:13,880
Don't take it to heart.

448
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,920
I was talking nonsense.

449
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,160
You know her well.

450
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,280
She just wanted to buy a dress.

451
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,450
It means she wanted to buy it long ago.

452
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,320
She wanted to buy it long ago.

453
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,730
That means the problem existed for a long time.

454
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:23,760
Xiangqian,

455
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,530
Listen to me. Don't think too much.

456
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:25,770
Xiangqian,

457
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,920
don't take it to heart.

458
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,880
I'm sure there's no problem.

459
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,690
Xiangqian.

460
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,080
What is this?

461
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,770
Seriously…

462
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,640
Look at the durian.

463
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,410
I've always wanted to taste them,

464
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,850
but I couldn't bear to.

465
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,490
Meijuan,

466
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,720
durian is very expensive in this season.

467
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:49,850
Expensive?

468
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,840
I'll buy two.

469
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,050
I want to taste it

470
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,040
and see if it's smelly or fragrant.

471
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,930
Let's go.

472
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,290
Pick a big one.

473
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:00,970
Here's one.

474
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,680
This is so expensive.

475
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,480
I won't buy it if it's not expensive.

476
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,320
I'll put the cart back.

477
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,160
Thank you.

478
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,920
You're welcome.

479
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:14,490
Luo,

480
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,090
these are all yours?

481
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,280
What's wrong?

482
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,530
You don't want to live anymore?

483
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,730
What are you talking about?

484
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,680
I want to live a good life.

485
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:23,690
Yes.

486
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,000
Here.

487
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,730
Swipe my card.

488
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,130
Luo,

489
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,400
the card's balance is insufficient.

490
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,650
Insufficient balance?

491
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,490
Why don't you check

492
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,040
if you have other cards?

493
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,390
Let me see.

494
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:39,890
Okay.

495
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,520
Use mine.

496
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:46,410
Use mine.

497
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,600
Sorry, Li.

498
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,730
I embarrassed myself in front of you.

499
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,250
You didn't.

500
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Is anything wrong today?

501
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,250
Are you in a bad mood?

502
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,600
If you're in a bad mood,

503
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,640
shopping can cheer yourself up.

504
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,160
Look how good at shopping you are.

505
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,130
The lobsters just arrived this morning.

506
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,410
They're very fresh.

507
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:25,690
Do you know how to cook lobsters?

508
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,730
I'll tell it how to cook them.

509
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,680
You need a chopstick

510
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:29,890
and stab it

511
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,760
from the tail

512
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,080
all the way to the head.

513
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:32,810
Then take it out

514
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:33,850
to release the urine.

515
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,360
This way, it won't smell bad.

516
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,410
Then take the back of a knife

517
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:37,960
and hit the head.

518
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,530
Knock the lobster out

519
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,760
and then cut its head off.

520
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,480
Li, that's enough.

521
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,840
Indeed, this job isn't for you.

522
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,080
It's bloody

523
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:49,920
and you have to kill.

524
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
Ask your husband to do it.

525
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,080
Have him put on a glove

526
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,690
and cushion himself with a rag.

527
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,880
Otherwise, it'll hurt his hand.

528
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,090
Put it in the pot after it's done.

529
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,880
It's so delicious.

530
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,530
It's too expensive to eat.

531
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,680
I'd rather it eat me.

532
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,200
Look at you.

533
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,410
Just eat it. One meal doesn't matter.

534
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,570
I don't know what's wrong.

535
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,840
I bought so many useless things.

536
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,290
I thought I would be happy after buying them,

537
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,970
but now, I feel worse.

538
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,080
These things

539
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,960
cost me two months

540
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,080
of our living expenses.

541
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,680
I can imagine

542
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,880
what they'll say after I go home.

543
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,130
I don't understand.

544
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,330
What's wrong with improving your life occasionally?

545
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,370
Do you, Luo Meijuan,

546
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,360
not deserve to eat well and dress well?

547
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,840
You've lived frugally all your life.

548
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,960
Can't you

549
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,800
splurge a little

550
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,760
and be willful for once?

551
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,200
You earned this money yourself.

552
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,720
You didn't steal or rob anyone.

553
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,810
You got it fair and square.

554
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,160
What's wrong with that?

555
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,120
Thank you, Li.

556
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,530
Actually,

557
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,800
I don't have to eat or use expensive things,

558
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,960
but can't I look at them?

559
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,360
Can't I, at least, think about them?

560
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,400
I just want someone to tell me,

561
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,960
"Luo Meijuan, you deserve to live a good life.

562
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,440
You deserve new clothes

563
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,760
and good things.

564
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,050
You don't have to

565
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,000
keep looking at the discounted items."

566
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,360
That's okay.

567
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:09,770
I know.

568
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,720
I should be satisfied

569
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,400
that I have food and a roof over my head.

570
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,360
Then go shopping.

571
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,130
To buy what?

572
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,360
Sheng Yang is not married yet

573
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,530
and we have four seniors to take care of.

574
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,250
Yes, they are fine now.

575
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,600
But if they fall sick,

576
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,320
how many days in the ICU

577
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,930
can we afford with our salary?

578
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,840
Do you really think I'm that ignorant

579
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,000
or that I like wasting money?

580
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,440
I'm just tired.

581
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,640
I wanted to vent

582
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,440
and take a breather.

583
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,130
I understand you.

584
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,280
Li,

585
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,520
I rambled to you for so long.

586
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,570
Don’t take it to heart.

587
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,450
Just treat me as a trash can.

588
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,440
Throw away all the bad things here.

589
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,480
Forget it.

590
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,640
It gets annoying after a while.

591
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:08,810
What's annoying about it?

592
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,050
We are colleagues.

593
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,400
We meet every day.

594
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,280
If you're happy,

595
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,960
I also feel relieved.

596
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,010
Why don't we return

597
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,160
these useless things?

598
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,650
I'll ask Zheng for help.

599
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,040
Okay, we'll return them.

600
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:24,600
Okay.

601
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:24,930
Let's return them.

602
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,570
Let me help you.

603
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,130
What was I thinking?

604
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,560
I bought so many

605
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,040
useless things.

606
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,470
[July Advertising Agency Notice of Criticism]

607
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,840
[1. Deduct Sheng Yang and Song Chen's bonuses for this season
2. Compensate all medical fees of Wang Youde, leader of Creative Dept. Team 2
3. Sheng Yang and Song Chen will be publicly criticized in the company]

608
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:18,889
Look.

609
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,210
What did I say?

610
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,560
Boss won't fire the two of us.

611
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,920
Get to work.

612
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,690
Mom, Dad, I'm back.

613
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,970
I worked overtime last night.

614
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,240
It was too late,

615
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,690
so I just slept at the company.

616
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,010
Recently, the company made budget cuts

617
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,450
and won't even reimburse the taxi fees now,

618
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,160
so I didn't come back.

619
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,610
I didn't want to wake you two up either.

620
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,650
When do you come back early?

621
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,130
When do you not work overtime?

622
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,170
Stop chattering.

623
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,090
Wait,

624
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,770
what's wrong with you two?

625
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,000
Madam Luo?

626
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,280
Sheng?

627
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,320
Ask your mother.

628
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,880
Look at what she's done.

629
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,600
What have I done?

630
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,200
Don't you know what you've done?

631
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,570
What is there to know?

632
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,010
Come.

633
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:29,970
Tell me.

634
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,360
Let your son be the judge too.

635
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,640
What disgraceful thing have I done?

636
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,040
Come on.

637
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,170
The photo is right here.

638
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,480
I caught you red-handed.

639
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,490
Dad,

640
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:49,880
I think you misunderstood.

641
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
What did I misunderstand?

642
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,010
I saw it with my own eyes.

643
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,080
They were holding hands.

644
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,290
What did I misunderstand?

645
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,570
Luckily I went.

646
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,200
If I didn't go,

647
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,170
who knows what they'd do after that?

648
00:36:59,170 --> 00:36:59,720
Dad,

649
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,000
what are you talking about?

650
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,280
My mom is not that kind of person.

651
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,560
I don't know if she's that kind of person or not,

652
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
but she did that kind of thing.

653
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,170
You must be mistaken.

654
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,370
No.

655
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,370
Son, listen.

656
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,810
I'm going to divorce him.

657
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,090
After the divorce,

658
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,210
whether you want to stay at home or move out

659
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,450
is up to you.

660
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:22,570
No, no, no.

661
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:22,970
Mom.

662
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,360
Let's sit down and talk.

663
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,160
Well done, Luo Meijuan.

664
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,440
I get it now.

665
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,810
You've found a new love.

666
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,720
Sheng Yang, listen.

667
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,680
Don't stop her from pursuing happiness.

668
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,650
Dad, don't be angry.

669
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,440
Sit down.

670
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,570
Let's all have a nice chat,

671
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,440
okay?

672
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,480
I'm not angry.

673
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,610
No.

674
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,480
I'm going to find a new lover.

675
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,800
I'm going to enter a whole new world.

676
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,560
No one can stop me.

677
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,720
Brave.

678
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,890
It's good that you admit it.

679
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,240
I've told you 10,000 times, Sheng.

680
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,960
I'm vain.

681
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,640
I love to buy dresses.

682
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,210
I love to dress up.

683
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,040
I do all this for myself,

684
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,250
not for men like you.

685
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,600
Is it that hard to understand?

686
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,170
Son, can you believe it?

687
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,970
She spent so much effort in dressing up

688
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,170
for herself,

689
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,360
not for others.

690
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,440
How is that possible?

691
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,410
Dad, why not?

692
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,290
Don't be so old-fashioned.

693
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,210
Look at your son.

694
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,410
He called me old-fashioned.

695
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,840
So what?

696
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,770
Do you know how ridiculous he was?

697
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:27,680
He stalked me.

698
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,240
He followed me to work.

699
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,160
I've never been so humiliated at work before.

700
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,440
I wouldn't have seen if I didn't go.

701
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,970
Do you believe him or me?

702
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:35,410
Okay, okay.

703
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,160
Stop.

704
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,570
You two sit down first.

705
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,600
Sit down. Listen to me.

706
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,360
Listen to me. Sit down.

707
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:42,800
Dad,

708
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,320
I think you must have misunderstood.

709
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:46,530
Mom,

710
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,010
please explain.

711
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,250
Think about it.

712
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,240
We've known Uncle Li for so many years.

713
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,320
Dad, one more thing.

714
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,890
If Mom wanted to do that kind of thing,

715
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:54,970
would she have done it in broad daylight

716
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,480
in front of all those people?

717
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,000
How many years have you two been married for?

718
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,280
Don't be like this, okay?

719
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,250
Enough. Stop it.

720
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,090
I get it now.

721
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,440
You're just a pot-stirrer.

722
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,280
Don't say that.

723
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,640
If I'm the pot-stirrer, then you…

724
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,490
I'm the crap in the pot, okay?

725
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,370
I'm crap.

726
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,410
Stop acting sweet with your mom.

727
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,370
The whole world knows you two are family.

728
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,640
I'm just the extra one here.

729
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:17,120
This...

730
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,000
Here's the photo.

731
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,570
She bought a dress worth 3,000 yuan.

732
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,720
It's all your fault.

733
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,760
You kept pushing me to buy her a dress.

734
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,410
She's being blatant now,

735
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,760
showing off like a peacock spreading its feathers.

736
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,040
Who are you talking about?

737
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,000
If you have to

738
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,810
blame this on me,

739
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:30,650
I'll take it.

740
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,370
I've endured you for a long time.

741
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,640
You don't have to.

742
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,600
What are you enduring for?

743
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,970
You're not a punching bag.

744
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,640
From now on,

745
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,360
do your own laundry,

746
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,770
cook your own food,

747
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,210
and do your own cleaning.

748
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,840
If you need anything,

749
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,680
or if you can't find anything, don't ask me.

750
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:49,080
Let's pick an auspicious day and get divorced.

751
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,650
Mom, stop it.

752
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:51,890
You're talking about divorce again?

753
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,800
You've said it my entire life

754
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,280
and I'm sick of hearing it.

755
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,000
Move out if you're sick of it.

756
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,650
You're a young man in your 20s, almost 30,

757
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,640
and you stay at home every day.

758
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,960
The other kids are all independent now. What about you?

759
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:04,690
Yes,

760
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,170
you do pay me,

761
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,720
but are your pennies and nickels

762
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,960
enough?

763
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,130
You are

764
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,560
exactly the same as him.

765
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,690
Not a single bit different.

766
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:13,800
Like father, like son.

767
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,920
Luo Meijuan, you're amazing.

768
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,320
Fine.

769
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,960
He was your son when he bought you things.

770
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,080
Now, he spoke up for me,

771
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,170
and you tell my son to get out.

772
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:19,760
Amazing.

773
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,290
Yes, he's your son.

774
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,040
He inherited

775
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,240
all your genes.

776
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,160
All the bad things were inherited from you.

777
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,080
Yes, all bad things were inherited from me.

778
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,280
Mom.

779
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,850
Sheng Yang must be horrible.

780
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:29,250
Mom!

781
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,080
Because there's nothing good about you.

782
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:32,410
He took after me entirely.

783
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,650
Fine, I'll listen to you.

784
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,600
Let's divorce!

785
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,210
Let's see who he takes after.

786
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:36,410
Dad!

787
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,960
Take after whoever you want.

788
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,130
Listen,

789
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,120
I don't care.

790
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,560
Dad!

791
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,690
It's up to you all!

792
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,640
Really?

793
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,080
He interviewed you?

794
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,330
Why?

795
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,080
Your husband is eloquent.

796
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:12,920
See,

797
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,730
you should read more books and newspapers.

798
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,640
Right?

799
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,120
You're amazing.

800
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,210
You're going to be on TV.

801
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,720
Are you jealous?

802
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,080
I'm making your dream of becoming an actress

803
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,800
come true.

804
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,520
You're a superstar.

805
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:36,880
Actually,

806
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,850
compared to being on TV,

807
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,410
having Yang

808
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,290
and our family

809
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,760
makes me

810
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,090
much happier.
