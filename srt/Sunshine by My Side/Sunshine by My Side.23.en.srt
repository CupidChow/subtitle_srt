1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,740
Wang,

3
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,700
I have been working for you

4
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,020
for three years.

5
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,860
If you hadn't gone too far this time,

6
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,340
I wouldn't have done this too.

7
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,340
Wang.

8
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,830
Take care.

9
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,300
Cheers.

10
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,900
Actually, we have something else to tell you today.

11
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,620
Yes.

12
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,510
Actually, we haven't decided yet.

13
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,950
It's still a thought of the moment.

14
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:15,830
Yes.

15
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,110
Let's put it this way.

16
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,670
Although the truth

17
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,990
has now been revealed,

18
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,550
But it doesn't seem appropriate

19
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,900
for us to go back to July Advertising Agency.

20
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,300
And you know

21
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,270
how hard it is

22
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,300
in the working world now.

23
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,350
It's almost impossible to find a good

24
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,579
job in such a short time.

25
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,950
And I think we should work with

26
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,550
someone with the right aura.

27
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,740
If the environment isn't right,

28
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,579
the people isn't right,

29
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,140
I don’t feel motivated to work.

30
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,670
So I plan to resign from the agency.

31
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,670
Yes, just like that.

32
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,300
I think it makes sense.

33
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,950
Art is that even if you devote yourself,

34
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,700
it may even smile at you.

35
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,740
I think not only art,

36
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,350
but many things in life are like this.

37
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,140
Since we're going to be smashed into pieces,

38
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,550
why don't we just break completely,

39
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,950
and start a new furnace?

40
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,830
What are you two trying to say?

41
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,510
You can't find a job anyway.

42
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,620
So,

43
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,860
we want to build a studio

44
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,740
where the three of us do our own jobs

45
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,510
and create our own designer brand.

46
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,579
Yes.

47
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,620
Okay, I got it.

48
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,620
Say no more.

49
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,740
I agree.

50
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,620
You agree?

51
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,860
That's great.

52
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,829
You two did this

53
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,579
because of me.

54
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,990
I really can't think of any reason

55
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,350
to reject you two.

56
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,230
I believe

57
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,180
as long as we unite,

58
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,550
we can overcome all difficulties.

59
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,860
Yes.

60
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,670
Then we'll chip in what we have,

61
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,700
money, manpower,

62
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,990
skills,

63
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,110
or creativity.

64
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,620
What do you think?

65
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,710
I'll contribute design and creativity.

66
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,990
I'll contribute manpower,

67
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,590
I'll contribute money.

68
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,420
Cheers.

69
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,350
Come on.

70
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,350
You're all bullying me.

71
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,820
Salute! Salute!

72
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,380
Cheers!

73
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,110
Cheers!

74
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,710
Cheers.

75
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,150
Great shot.

76
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,990
It's beyond my expectations.

77
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,790
I heard that something went wrong with the props.

78
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,670
I couldn't sleep well for days.

79
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,670
I didn't expect that there was no delay at all.

80
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,060
No, no.

81
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,060
Ms. Qiao, it's all thanks to

82
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,230
your trust and support.

83
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,180
That's why we can make it so quickly.

84
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,790
Have some water.

85
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,710
To be honest,

86
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,670
I envy you two.

87
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,300
You take care of each other

88
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,230
and support each other in work.

89
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,300
Such a perfect couple.

90
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,909
Who listens to who

91
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,550
when

92
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,550
you're working?

93
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,150
We actually

94
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,110
have our own projects,

95
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,110
We manage our own projects independently.

96
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,550
We shoot our own projects.

97
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,380
You mange your projects separately?

98
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,550
That's right.

99
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:07,940
But

100
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,820
you still manage your company together?

101
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,380
That's right.

102
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,150
Here, have some water.

103
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,350
Here, have some water. Okay.

104
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,300
Ms. Liang.

105
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:26,990
Morning.

106
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,380
How many people did you interview today?

107
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,620
Five.

108
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,380
Is there a man named Sheng Yang?

109
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,670
No.

110
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,470
If he comes,

111
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,350
let me know.

112
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,110
Okay.

113
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,060
I want to discuss the milk powder project with you.

114
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,620
What's there to discuss?

115
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,620
From creativity to execution,

116
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,110
it's all the hard work of everyone.

117
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,380
Now the client is making things difficult for us.

118
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,990
Are we going to just

119
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,230
keep on compromising?

120
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,790
So what?

121
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,500
What else can we do?

122
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,420
The accident caused by the

123
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,470
actor for the previous advertisment

124
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,470
made such a big hole in our account.

125
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,030
We haven't made up for it yet.

126
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,620
They are a milk business group.

127
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,260
They're here to give us money.

128
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,620
They're the boss.

129
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,590
Whatever they want to change

130
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,590
we'll just change it accordingly.

131
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,710
The client is the boss.

132
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,470
Then what are we?

133
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,060
Their slaves?

134
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,740
Do you know the phrase

135
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,740
I hate the most now?

136
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,590
God Clients.

137
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,740
I remember when we first started,

138
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,260
we called ourselves advertising gurus,

139
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,380
we didn't call our clients gods.

140
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,790
When did this happen?

141
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,420
Now it's taken for granted.

142
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,910
When we first started Jian Yi,

143
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,110
we made a pact didn’t we?

144
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,470
Giving good service doesn't mean compromising endlessly.

145
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,070
Shouldn't everyone have some spirit of contract?

146
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,990
Can you sit up?

147
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,710
What can spirit of contract do?

148
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,780
Do you dare discuss it with our clients?

149
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,539
You need to understand social customs.

150
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,309
Right?

151
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,710
We don't we all fight for it.

152
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,380
You fight for it. So will I.

153
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,990
Everyone in the company fights for it with others.

154
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,830
After fighting what will we do? Live on our fighting spirit?

155
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,310
Now you're aruging just for the sake of it.

156
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,230
Xue, do you remember

157
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,430
what you said?

158
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,710
Working like this,

159
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,620
we give not only our time,

160
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,620
but also every drop of wine,

161
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,380
every cup of coffee,

162
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,620
every meal we ate,

163
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,230
every plave we went,

164
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,380
every book we read,

165
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,710
and every relationship we've been in.

166
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,620
Alright, Jian Bing.

167
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,070
I've said too much.

168
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,470
Do you remember them all?

169
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,620
Yes.

170
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,500
I said that

171
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,470
I'm one of the bosses in this company too, didn't I?

172
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,620
You are.

173
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,780
We also said to discuss everything together, didn't we?

174
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,620
I have discussed everything with you.

175
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,620
Look.

176
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,230
What Yang?

177
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,830
Isn't he coming in for an interview today?

178
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,900
Did you discuss this with me?

179
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,350
It's just an interview.

180
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,020
Is it necessary?

181
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,260
Is this why

182
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,430
you're fighting everything I say?

183
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,350
Just an interview?

184
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,900
It's an interview.

185
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,140
Then what if I say we can't hire him?

186
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,230
Mr. Zheng.

187
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,990
Hello.

188
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,950
Sheng Yang?

189
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,590
Yes, it's me.

190
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,620
You're finally here.

191
00:09:59,310 --> 00:09:59,860
Sorry.

192
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,710
I'm late.

193
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,950
But I have to thank you

194
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,230
for helping us repair the landscape last time.

195
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,140
It's just some help. It's nothing.

196
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,780
Sit down.

197
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,590
I've read your resume.

198
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,830
You came from an advertising company.

199
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,500
You used to do graphic design and posters

200
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,070
primarily, right?

201
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,140
Yes.

202
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,660
Are you good at video?

203
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,620
I haven't done many videos.

204
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,070
Have you been on a team before?

205
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,190
Shanshan.

206
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,020
Mr. Zheng,

207
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:35,860
Shanshan,

208
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,620
I'm actually not here for an interview.

209
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,540
I opened a studio with two friends.

210
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,260
If you need help

211
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,540
in the future,

212
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,190
or if you have any suitable projects,

213
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,990
you can contact me anytime.

214
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,620
Moses Advertising.

215
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,780
Why can't we hire him?

216
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,190
Why?

217
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,780
If you just bring anyone you like into the company,

218
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,540
anyone you like into the company.

219
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,190
Then...

220
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,710
What will happen to the company?

221
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,310
Everyone in the company,

222
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,860
what would they think about this?

223
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,780
Right?

224
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,260
Let me tell you.

225
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,110
We have broken up.

226
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,830
But if you want to be lovey-dovey,

227
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,860
go do it outside.

228
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,190
Don't bring it to the company.

229
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,260
Xue Yiming.

230
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,660
Don't speak if you can't talk properly.

231
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,430
What do you mean by me bringing

232
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,860
anyone I like into the company?

233
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,590
What's the standard of recruitment for the company?

234
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,710
Virtue and talent.

235
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,020
You need to be capable

236
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,310
have work experience,

237
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,310
and be responsible.

238
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,740
They have to have good character.

239
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,110
Does Sheng Yang lack integrity?

240
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,230
He graduated from a proper institution and worked for three years.

241
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,110
This counts as working experience.

242
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,110
Last time when the props were damaged,

243
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,020
he didn't sleep all night

244
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,430
and fixed it with two prop masters.

245
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,860
Even Zheng who is so picky

246
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,230
couldn't say a bad thing about his work.

247
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,590
Isn't that working capability?

248
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,990
What else do you think he's lacking?

249
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,110
Give me a reason.

250
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,350
None?

251
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,380
If none then will Mr. Xue please

252
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,020
treat everyone equally

253
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,110
when recruiting.

254
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,260
Kids nowadays are quite funny.

255
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,860
They become their own bosses

256
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,540
then come and tell you about it.

257
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:58,660
Director.

258
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,950
Did Sheng Yang come?

259
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:02,780
Yes.

260
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,540
But

261
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,020
he started his own business

262
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,140
and opened a studio with two friends.

263
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,190
Where is he?

264
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,310
He just left.

265
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:20,990
Let's continue.

266
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,230
And these. Look.

267
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,350
Hello, director.

268
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,710
Hello, director.

269
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,660
Director Jian.

270
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:58,950
Pear juice.

271
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,380
No sugar, no ice.

272
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,140
It can cool you down.

273
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,470
You said so much just now.

274
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,310
Your throat must hurt.

275
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,310
Come with me.

276
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:07,830
Hello, director Jian.

277
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:13,740
Hello, Shanshan.

278
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,260
I'm leaving if you're ignoring me.

279
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,470
Wait.

280
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,190
Did you know

281
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,260
that Sheng Yang was coming for an interview?

282
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,190
You didn't tell me.

283
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,470
Are you just waiting for everything to be in chaos?

284
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,740
It's just Sheng Yang.

285
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,140
Is that necessary?

286
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,020
Look at you so anxious.

287
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,590
You two are really something.

288
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,470
Someone is going to be by her side someday.

289
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,140
Whether it be Sheng Yang,

290
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,260
or Sheng Yue, Sheng Hai, Sheng Senlin even.

291
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,900
Well, in any case,

292
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,950
can't they have their fun outside?

293
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:20,900
At least

294
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,110
not where I can see and get annoyed.

295
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,140
Why did she

296
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,070
have to bring him into the company?

297
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,380
Congratulations, Mr. Sheng.

298
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,990
You found out?

299
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,780
If I knew you had such ambition,

300
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,310
I wouldn't have invited you to the interview.

301
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,190
Why didn't you tell me you're starting a business?

302
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,710
Is it so hard to send me a message on your phone?

303
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,900
I wanted to tell you face to face.

304
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,900
Do you know what you are doing?

305
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,230
Xue and I had the confidence

306
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,470
that we could hold our ground

307
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,020
in this industry before we

308
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,710
made the decision to start our business.

309
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,350
What are you relying on now?

310
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,260
Your passion to fuel your company?

311
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,470
I know

312
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,830
it will be hard in the beginning.

313
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,110
The high cost in the beginning,

314
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,350
the lack of trust from our clients,

315
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,590
the lack of competitive ability.

316
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,740
You know, but you're still so willful.

317
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,780
But I have to take this step.

318
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,500
I also have my career aspirations.

319
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,990
I also want to own

320
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,350
an independent design studio.

321
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,990
Actually, when Song Chen came to me,

322
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,260
I also thought it was ridiculous.

323
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,740
The path of starting a business

324
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,020
is definitely

325
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,350
the hardest in life.

326
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,660
But I've taken on part time projects before.

327
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,310
The main core issues, like

328
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,470
how to package ourselves,

329
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,540
how to position ourselves,

330
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,380
how to give good service,

331
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,660
what are our strengths and competitions,

332
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,470
all these I've thought about thoroughly before.

333
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,470
So I think that participating in competitions

334
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,310
is the best way

335
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
to let everyone notice us and open up the situation.

336
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,190
What competitions?

337
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,060
This one.

338
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,060
You want to make a TV commercial?

339
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:08,869
What?

340
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,819
You can't find a path for you in graphic designing anymore?

341
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:11,869
You want to move?

342
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,230
No.

343
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,300
This is the era of short videos.

344
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,300
If we still make signs and posters,

345
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
or just simple graphic designs,

346
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,780
our audience won't be touched.

347
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,540
We need to create creativity

348
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,869
and make visuals move

349
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,339
to stand out.

350
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:28,950
So?

351
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,190
So,

352
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,190
I want to invite you to be

353
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,540
the director of our entry video,

354
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,060
and help us take the first step.

355
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,710
Will you?

356
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,780
So you're not here to join the interview

357
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,910
but here to interview me?

358
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,100
I don't mind

359
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,950
if you want to think so.

360
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,580
You haven't started walking yet and now you want to run?

361
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,910
Why don't you just shoot for the sky?

362
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,950
We worked well together before.

363
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,300
Besides, during this time in the studio

364
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,990
I've learned a lot from you

365
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,540
and learned a lot of filming skills

366
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,430
and knowledge.

367
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,020
I'm not completely an amateur now.

368
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,020
Okay.

369
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,190
Then you should know

370
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,740
that ads usually don't exceed a minute,

371
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,500
right?

372
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,670
Being able to

373
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,260
touch the audience

374
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,300
within the shortest time

375
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,390
is the key to success.

376
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,740
I know.

377
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,540
What about it?

378
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,670
I'll give you just one minute

379
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,190
to tell me your creativity.

380
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,540
If you succeed in making me touched,

381
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,780
I'll agree.

382
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,260
Okay.

383
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:26,710
Start.

384
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:27,910
Now?

385
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,260
I'm not ready.

386
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,910
If you're not ready, why did you come invite me?

387
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,190
Why should I say yes?

388
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,870
Start.

389
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,390
We want to make a

390
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,340
public service advertisement.

391
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,190
Our inspiration came from the

392
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,950
public service advertisement that you filmed

393
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,300
of the environmental workers. Do you remember?

394
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,430
40 seconds.

395
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,470
It's basically

396
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,710
about recycling,

397
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,820
but from the perspective of trash.

398
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,740
Personification, get it?

399
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,630
Means that the trash has life,

400
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,710
and it can see it's surroundings and everything around it.

401
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,780
25 seconds.

402
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,910
Normally public service advertisements

403
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,470
use data, or reasoning

404
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,870
to tell facts and truth.

405
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,670
It's boring.

406
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,780
I can't move the audience.

407
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,630
So I...

408
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,100
I

409
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,430
I haven't thought it through yet as well.

410
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,990
But I plan to use

411
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Unreal Engine 4

412
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,540
for the concept making,

413
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,630
As well as the combination of special effects and actual objects

414
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,500
to make all the trash in the world

415
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,470
to come together

416
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,340
and form a monster using

417
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,190
special effects. Time's up.

418
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,060
I don't understand.

419
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,670
You've lost

420
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,780
your first audience.

421
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,190
Director Jian, I...

422
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,710
It's too sudden. I didn't prepare anything.

423
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,820
That's why,

424
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,060
it's good to be young and passionate.

425
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,540
But if you don't think it through,

426
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,670
You will fall.

427
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,580
I really wanted to invite you to Jian Yi

428
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,500
to get familiar with this field.

429
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,260
But now you have another plan.

430
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,540
So good luck.

431
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,340
Don't go.

432
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,740
Don't go.

433
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,710
I'll admit it.

434
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,390
I was unprepared.

435
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,260
And I know you're doing this for my own good.

436
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,780
I overheard

437
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,300
your conversation with Xue Yiming.

438
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,300
He's no longer your partner.

439
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,950
Consider me.

440
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,670
Can't we try working side by side?

441
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,060
This has

442
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,630
nothing to do with

443
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,820
whether I want her to be happy or not.

444
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,580
All these years,

445
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,430
Jian Bing has been living under you,

446
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,910
being careful.

447
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,540
Even her brightest moments

448
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,580
are only occasionally when she shines in the studio.

449
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,300
You treat her as your child.

450
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,340
Do you think she's not?

451
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,670
If you really care about her,

452
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,470
just be a deaf and blind ex-husband.

453
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,670
I believe

454
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,710
Jian Bing will make the best decision

455
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,340
for the company.

456
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,230
But what if the kid lies to her?

457
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,260
What if he wants to use Jian Bing

458
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,260
to climb up?

459
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,430
Kids nowadays

460
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,260
none of them are simple.

461
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,230
If he is a liar,

462
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,470
I will deal with him.

463
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,230
What do you mean?

464
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,820
I won't let him off too.

465
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,670
But,

466
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,820
Jian Bing is an adult.

467
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,190
At this age,

468
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:10,780
right?

469
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:11,990
Well.

470
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,870
Look at her.

471
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,780
Choosing someone so

472
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,820
so unrealiable.

473
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,950
If word spreads out in the circle,

474
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,580
she'll be made fun of.

475
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,260
What's there to make fun of?

476
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,990
What's wrong with this age?

477
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,300
In your eyes,

478
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,190
women in their 30s

479
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,060
can't be with a man in his 20s?

480
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,780
No, no, no.

481
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,540
So we don't deserve to be loved, do we?

482
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,670
No, I didn't mean that.

483
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,500
I'm afraid she'll get hurt.

484
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,060
Haven't you hurt her enough?

485
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,060
Being with you,

486
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,740
what is there that she hasn't seen before?

487
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,740
She fell in love with you blindly

488
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,300
because she had too little experience.

489
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,190
This is her chance

490
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,190
to practice.

491
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,260
Fine.

492
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,990
I'm just worried about nothing.

493
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,740
I shouldn't have done that.

494
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,340
It’s unnecessary.

495
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,390
Sheng Yang won’t come to the company.

496
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,060
Why are you still so angry?

497
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,390
What do you mean?

498
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,780
He started his own business.

499
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,950
So after this whole discussion with Jian Bing,

500
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,710
he's not coming?

501
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,710
Jian Bing said so many good things about him.

502
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,990
Everyone has their own ambition. We can't force him.

503
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,230
Isn't Jian Bing

504
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,390
rushing up to his cold shoulder?

505
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,710
Who does he think he is?

506
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,910
Jian Yi Advertisement Studio.

507
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,990
This is Jian Yi.

508
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,190
Does he think he can come and go as he pleases?

509
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,190
What?

510
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
Shall I call him back?

511
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,870
No, why would you?

512
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,340
What does it have to do with me?

513
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,910
He's too bold.

514
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,950
Isn't he bullying Jian Bing?

515
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,430
Is he?

516
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,500
Wait.

517
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,390
I don't care.

518
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,910
It's up to the two of you.

519
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,580
I don't care.

520
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,670
Go on.

521
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,390
I don't care. It has nothing to do with me.

522
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,300
It has nothing to do with me.

523
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,100
I'll go where it's peaceful.

524
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,670
Who told you to eavesdrop on us?

525
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,580
Well,

526
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,710
that's because

527
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,710
you rarely praise me.

528
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,100
So...

529
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,100
When you did praise me,

530
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,190
I had to listen carefully.

531
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,710
But Xue Yiming was too harsh.

532
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,540
I want to beat him up.

533
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,430
Can you stop acting like Jian Shuang?

534
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,710
You keep talking about beating someone up.

535
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,870
Can you learn from someone else?

536
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,230
Yes, of course.

537
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,500
I'll learn from Director Jian instead.

538
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,580
Since Xue Yiming

539
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,300
is not at the same pace as you,

540
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,580
you have to find

541
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,340
someone with the same pace and goal as you

542
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,300
to run with you,

543
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,060
right?

544
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,260
Yes.

545
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,990
Thank you. I'll look for one.

546
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,820
You're at a different pace too.

547
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,670
I...

548
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,950
I can learn.

549
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,300
I know I have nothing now.

550
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,390
Besides,

551
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,340
you have a vehicle.

552
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,300
You run fast.

553
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,300
My legs can't possibly run faster than your rocket.

554
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,300
So, I opened a studio

555
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,470
to give myself an accelerator.

556
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,950
I have to try.

557
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,260
If I don't take this step,

558
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,710
I can never catch up with you.

559
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,260
Of course, I know.

560
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,540
To convince you,

561
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,710
I must come up with solid ideas.

562
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,190
I can't just make empty claims.

563
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,300
Give me a few days.

564
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,060
After I finish the creative script

565
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,870
and budget plan,

566
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,950
I'll show them to you.

567
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,020
I won't waste your time.

568
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,260
Okay?

569
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,300
If you want to try, go ahead.

570
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,060
I can't stop you.

571
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,190
But in this industry,

572
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,540
fewer and fewer customers

573
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,100
pay attention to quality and creativity.

574
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,870
The commercial that you

575
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,190
pour your time and energy into making

576
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,740
may not compare to how easily and directly

577
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,540
internet celebrities can promote the products

578
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,500
on their livestreams.

579
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:42,430
Even so,

580
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,060
aren't you persisting too?

581
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,060
Let's persist together, then.

582
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,020
Do your best.

583
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,190
I'll be waiting for your masterpiece.

584
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:54,870
Give me the drink.

585
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,300
Bye.

586
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,060
Bye.

587
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:04,780
Wait for me.

588
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,470
It won't take long.

589
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,670
I'll give you the proposal soon.

590
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,710
All the best.

591
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,990
You're still thinking?

592
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,340
"Get well soon."

593
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,300
So lame.

594
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,670
"Friends forever."

595
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,390
Too old-fashioned.

596
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,950
"Handle with care."

597
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,230
It's a bit tacky.

598
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:52,910
Yes.

599
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,060
What is this?

600
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,340
A hockey stick?

601
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,100
You played so much hockey that you forgot about your music theory.

602
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,990
Look carefully.

603
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
A rest note?

604
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:11,990
It means,

605
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,100
take a good rest now.

606
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,100
But soon,

607
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,340
the next chapter will begin.

608
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,190
Are you okay?

609
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,990
Why are you suddenly so poetic?

610
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,910
Jian Shuang.

611
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,020
Uncle.

612
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:31,910
Mr. Fang.

613
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,190
What did the doctor say?

614
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,060
The doctor said she can go back today.

615
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,260
I know you can't walk like this.

616
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,340
So I rented a wheelchair for you.

617
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,870
Don't worry. It's disinfected.

618
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,150
Also,

619
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,870
Junjie said you like wearing trousers.

620
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,190
It's inconvenient to wear those with the cast.

621
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,950
So I bought you two dresses.

622
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,190
Don't mind the style.

623
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,500
You hurt your bones and nerves,

624
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,300
so you need to pay more attention to your nutrition intake.

625
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,300
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

626
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,670
The highlight is this.

627
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,230
What is this?

628
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:58,820
Take it.

629
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,470
Stick this in and scratch your leg.

630
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,470
It won't itch anymore.

631
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,190
Uncle.

632
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,910
The patient's medicine.

633
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,470
Thank you.

634
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,430
Eat according to the doctor's order.

635
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,500
Come back for a checkup in a week.

636
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,060
Okay.

637
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:09,820
Thank you.

638
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,150
Why don't we

639
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,500
add each other on WeChat?

640
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,340
If you have any questions,

641
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,500
you can ask me anytime.

642
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,300
I left my phone in the car. He's so popular.

643
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,060
Eat your food.

644
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:21,580
Here.

645
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,390
Junjie.

646
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:23,950
Take it.

647
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,390
Remember to add her on WeChat later.

648
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,020
Ask her if you need anything.

649
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,430
Thank you.

650
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,260
Have you contacted your sister?

651
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,540
No.

652
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,540
It's such a big deal.

653
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,300
You should at least tell her.

654
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,580
Hurry up and pack up.

655
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,630
I'll get the car.

656
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,820
See you downstairs later.

657
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,630
Okay.

658
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,780
See you downstairs.

659
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:56,990
Hey.

660
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,340
Has your uncle ever been in a relationship?

661
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,740
With his looks, personality,

662
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,990
salary, income, and meticulousness,

663
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,300
I don't think he lacks options.

664
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,060
But he's always single.

665
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,470
Is there a unspeakable reason?

666
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,540
Don't talk nonsense.

667
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,500
He's healthy in every aspect.

668
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,260
His body looks fine.

669
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,500
How do you know if he's mentally healthy?

670
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,430
Of course I know. He is my uncle.

671
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,740
But he's not dating you.

672
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,540
Why did they break up back then?

673
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,580
The same reason your sister divorced.

674
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,910
He was also cheated on?

675
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,190
Can you lower your voice?

676
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,260
It's not something to brag about.

677
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,340
He has remained single ever since.

678
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,260
Is he traumatized?

679
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,430
It is said that every man

680
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,300
has an ex-girlfriend he can't forget.

681
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,060
It'd have been fine if he were the one who dumped her,

682
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,340
but it was her who dumped him.

683
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,060
It would cause mental trauma to him.

684
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,470
He just didn't find someone suitable.

685
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,230
How do you know my sister is suitable then?

686
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,300
Is he mentally twisted?

687
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,630
Is he seeking revenge?

688
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,500
And think my sister is a pushover?

689
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,430
Sister,

690
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,540
your leg is crippled.

691
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,670
Can you take care of yourself?

692
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,390
Gossip when you've recovered.

693
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,820
Men...

694
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:17,910
Come on.

695
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:18,910
Use your brain.

696
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,430
Just say what you want.

697
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,540
It's too hard.

698
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,190
I hate brainstorming.

699
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,190
Think of trash as the main character,

700
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,870
and start off from their perspective.

701
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,190
What kind of story can we tell?

702
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,230
How about this? Let me go first.

703
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,990
Trash sorting

704
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,230
is to find the position

705
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,500
every trash belongs to.

706
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,060
Humans are the proctors.

707
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,230
When they throw trash,

708
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,430
they manipulate the fate of each trash.

709
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,710
A little careless could cause a butterfly effect.

710
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,820
One day,

711
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,710
all the trash

712
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,870
gathered together

713
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,230
and flipped the city around.

714
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,670
The humans were extremely scared.

715
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:04,990
Dark.

716
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,580
I like it.

717
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,780
That's a disaster movie.

718
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,990
How do we film it?

719
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,950
As to how we present it,

720
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,500
I'll have to think about it.

721
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,990
Who will play that trash?

722
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,300
Honey! Come and help me!

723
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,020
Coming.

724
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,020
Okay.

725
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,430
Coming.

726
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,300
Xu Xian with Bai Suzhen

727
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,670
just like this claypot with coaster.

728
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,780
Hurry up. It's a bit hot.

729
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,470
Kids, time to eat.

730
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,060
Time to eat.

731
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,020
Coming.

732
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,990
You're going to meet your in-laws?

733
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,780
You're so annoying.

734
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,230
Handsome,

735
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:15,870
give me a hand.

736
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,300
Okay.

737
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,910
It smells so good.

738
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,780
Of course.

739
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,870
The dumplings are here.

740
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,020
Come, have a seat.

741
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,390
Okay.

742
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,580
What are the filling of the dumplings?

743
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:24,990
Shrimp.

744
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,230
But it must be delicious because you made it.

745
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,340
This is

746
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,910
his dad's favorite shrimp filling.

747
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:31,230
I didn't make it. I bought it at the supermarket.

748
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,260
I don't think

749
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,060
Ms. Pan has seen things like this before.

750
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,390
All you eat is delicacies made by your nanny

751
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,540
back home, right?

752
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,670
What delicacies?

753
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,580
Everything is a delicacy when you're hungry.

754
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,150
That's right.

755
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:42,870
Let's eat.

756
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,230
Okay.

757
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,430
Said too much flattery?

758
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:46,990
Come on, let's eat.

759
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:47,470
Eat.

760
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,190
Where is Yang?

761
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,580
Yang isn't eating?

762
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,540
Yang!

763
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,580
Forget about him. I called him just now.

764
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,580
It's good for young people to be busy.

765
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,060
What if the dishes get cold?

766
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:58,630
Oh right.

767
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,020
The conditions we have here are not too bad.

768
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,990
We have pots, stoves,

769
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,150
and a microwave.

770
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,580
I'll make some dipping sauce first.

771
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,340
Okay.

772
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,670
Mr. Sheng, let me help you.

773
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,470
It's okay.

774
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,870
It's okay.

775
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:16,740
Don't stand on ceremony.

776
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
Let's eat.

777
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:20,630
Okay.

778
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,950
Be careful.

779
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,340
Eat more if you like it.

780
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,100
Son?

781
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,300
Yang.

782
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,540
You know it's hot. Eat slowly.

783
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:29,950
Yang.

784
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:30,950
I'll put it here.

785
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,340
Son.

786
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,340
Eat it while it's hot.

787
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,740
How is it?

788
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,910
How is my cooking?

789
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,630
Let me tell you.

790
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,470
I haven't eaten this yet.

791
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,500
This.

792
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,190
This.

793
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,870
And this, I made all these.

794
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:46,630
These three.

795
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,500
And this soup.

796
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:47,870
Try it.

797
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,230
It's delicious.

798
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,340
Delicious.

799
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,020
Delicious.

800
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,580
-So good I can't help but shake my head.
-Eat more if it's good.

801
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,020
Be careful.

802
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,950
This way.

803
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,260
I can walk on my own.

804
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,630
It's okay.

805
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,230
You're not heavy.

806
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:10,820
Yes.

807
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,300
You're not heavy.

808
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,910
Pear juice.

809
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,230
No sugar, no ice.

810
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,150
It can cool you down.

811
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,230
You spoke so much just now,

812
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,190
your throat must hurt.

813
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,820
Take a break.

814
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,630
Are you nervous?

815
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,020
Why would I be?

816
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,780
You should be the one who's nervous.

817
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,230
But if my sister scolds me later,

818
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,820
and brings you into it,

819
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,910
what should we do?

820
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,100
Everyone would be angry

821
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,060
when something like this happens.

822
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,150
But if your sister

823
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,060
can vent this anger

824
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,820
with this,

825
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,670
that's fine too.

826
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,390
Come on.

827
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,270
Fine.

828
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,430
Don't judge a book by its cover.

829
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,580
You're manly.

830
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,350
I'll count on you later.

831
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,139
Wait.

832
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,429
Are you sure your sister is at home?

833
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,909
Why don't you call her?

834
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,100
And confirm with her?

835
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,429
I'm back.

836
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,429
No need to call me.

837
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,060
Sister.

838
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,270
You're back.

839
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,790
S-sister.

840
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:44,620
She's fine.

841
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,580
She had a minor accident.

842
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,469
And had a minor surgery...

843
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,310
I'll lie down for a while first.

844
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,140
Water.

845
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,390
I know you must be angry now.

846
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,540
She didn't want to tell you

847
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,580
because she was afraid you would scold her.

848
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,660
When she recovers,

849
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,270
you can scold her whenever you want.

850
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,660
The doctor said

851
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,470
the plaster can be removed in around ten days.

852
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,950
The problem now is

853
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,500
her meniscus.

854
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,470
The doctor said she suffered a third degree damage.

855
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,990
But she's lucky.

856
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,500
The part that she got injured in doesn't have to be removed.

857
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,620
As long as she takes her medicine and rest on time,

858
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,950
and do a rehabilitation training,

859
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,910
she can walk, run, and jump no problem in the future.

860
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,140
That's great.

861
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,990
She doesn't need to play ice hockey anymore.

862
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,470
When did this happen?

863
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,060
Last week.

864
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,020
Well...

865
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,270
After the game.

866
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,750
It's been more than a week now.

867
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,700
That's right.

868
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,270
This is Jian Shuang's style.

869
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,100
Act first and report later.

870
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,270
She keeps everything from me.

871
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,470
Only when she can't keep it anymore, does she remember that there's me.

872
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,990
It's my fault. I didn't let her tell you.

873
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,990
Think about it, you're so busy,

874
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,910
even if you knew,

875
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,870
besides worrying,

876
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,180
you can do nothing.

877
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:07,950
She will still be in pain

878
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,950
and still needs to do the surgery.

879
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,140
She's an adult now.

880
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,660
She should be responsible for her actions.

881
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,180
She's going to have to lay down and...

882
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,180
It's going to be a long time. This won't work.

883
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,500
Her study will be delayed.

884
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,910
I have to go to school to get her books.

885
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,390
No need. I brought them back for you.

886
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,750
They are all here.

887
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,100
The clothes are here too.

888
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,910
I asked her roommate to help with it.

889
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,790
I've talked to her major courses' teachers.

890
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,830
There are seven courses in total.

891
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,790
Here's the timetable.

892
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,020
Take a look.

893
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,660
I'll send the lecture notes to her email later on.

894
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,310
She can just self-study at home.

895
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,870
The paper for "The Introduction to Music Industry"

896
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,470
has to be submitted next Friday.

897
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,580
The exam for "The Introduction to Ethnic Music"

898
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,990
will be in two weeks.

899
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,540
The paper has to be submitted on time.

900
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,580
If she is

901
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,180
unable to make it for the exam,

902
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,950
I'll help her apply for the make-up exam next semester.

903
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,020
I think this will only make her absent from class once or twice.

904
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,390
It wouldn't affect her final result.

905
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,500
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

906
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,310
It's what I should do.

907
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:03,750
Also,

908
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,470
this is oral medication.

909
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,990
This is the medication for changing the dressing.

910
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,540
I have written the things to take note of

911
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,310
on the last page

912
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,830
of this medical record book.

913
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,750
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

914
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,310
We caused you so much trouble.

915
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,620
No.

916
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,910
It's my duty.

917
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,270
I'm her teacher after all.

918
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,990
You paid for her hospitalization

919
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,950
and surgery, right?

920
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,430
I'll transfer it to you.

921
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,100
No need.

922
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:32,790
The school can reimburse these.

923
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,470
It's not a work injury.

924
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,910
Why would the school reimburse her?

925
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,140
University students nowadays

926
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,540
have student insurance.

927
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,870
Are all college professors as meticulous as you?

928
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,830
That's good.

929
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,390
Have a seat.

930
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,180
Didn't I say you don't have to transfer the money to me?

931
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:16,750
Why did you...

932
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,430
There are still the expenses for food, travel and whatnot.

933
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,060
Just accept it, Mr. Fang.

934
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,950
Otherwise, I won't feel at ease.

935
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,750
Is it because

936
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,430
you don't want to owe me anything?

937
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,350
I...

938
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:31,950
I've never

939
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,540
liked to owe anyone anything.

940
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,950
Besides,

941
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,390
you've been so busy for over a week.

942
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,500
Looks like you're used to

943
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,180
repaying kindness with money.

944
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,540
Wait, I didn't mean that.

945
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,390
Well...

946
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,660
Actually, I find that sometimes

947
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,990
you really don't say what you mean.

948
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,060
You always say

949
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,140
you don't care about your sister.

950
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,950
But since she came in,

951
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,430
your eyes have never left her.

952
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,060
Are you worried

953
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,660
that you didn't take good enough care of her

954
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,020
and feel guilty?

955
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,990
I think

956
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,060
I might have treated her too well

957
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,950
that I've spoiled her.

958
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,180
Every time she causes trouble,

959
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,580
I always said I'd teach her a lesson,

960
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,990
but I've never put it into practice.

961
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,950
If I knew she loves ice hockey so much,

962
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,180
I would have sent her to sports school.

963
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,540
Why is she studying music?

964
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,580
For a few years,

965
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,540
the equipment cost few hundreds of thousands.

966
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,620
Isn't that even more expensive?

967
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,620
Don't you regret it?

968
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,750
No.

969
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,350
Isn't this good?

970
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,390
She can't play anymore.

971
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,660
I'll put up all her equipment for sale

972
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,870
on a second-hand website.

973
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,140
If you really think so,

974
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,100
during the competition last time,

975
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,270
you wouldn't have told me

976
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,990
that you hoped your sister can do what she likes

977
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,470
at her age.

978
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,180
I think her willfullness

979
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,180
is partially due to your tacit consent.

980
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,990
You drew the path for her.

981
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,140
As long as she is happy and healthy,

982
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,220
you will respect

983
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,580
any decision she makes.

984
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,140
I brought Jian Shuang up.

985
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:12,060
I hope she can grow up

986
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,390
happily and freely,

987
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,020
but I also hope I can educate her well enough

988
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,620
such that she can live independently.

989
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,950
I've been trying to learn how to strike a balance.

990
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,140
All these years,

991
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:25,950
my face

992
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,580
has switched back and forth between being the devil and the angel so much

993
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,950
that my face hurts.

994
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,270
That's better than me.

995
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,470
Do you know why my nephew's mother

996
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,540
was willing to hand him over to me?

997
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,500
It's because back then,

998
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,540
his mother asked me to send him to the college entrance exam.

999
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,060
But I forgot to fill up the gas in my car the day before.

1000
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,270
We were delayed by ten minutes

1001
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,580
and he almost couldn't even make it into the exam hall.

1002
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,430
He didn't do well because he was nervous.

1003
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,950
His mother had no choice but to send him to my school.

1004
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,910
She said she would give me four years

1005
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,950
to cultivate my nephew into a talent.

1006
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,870
In this way,

1007
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,540
he can go study abroad.

1008
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,220
You're so meticulous in handling Jian Shuang's case.

1009
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,060
You don't look like someone who would make such a mistake.

1010
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,580
Since then,

1011
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,790
how could I not be careful?

1012
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,270
I've learned a lesson.

1013
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,580
Besides,

1014
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,870
I'm not Hao Junjie's uncle now.

1015
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,620
He's my uncle.

1016
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,750
I have to put him on a pedestal.

1017
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:25,790
To be honest,

1018
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,220
I think

1019
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,910
you

1020
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,790
appear cold on the outside but are actually warm on the inside.

1021
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,140
I can see that from your works.

1022
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:33,500
What...

1023
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,180
What works do I have?

1024
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,020
Your advertisements.

1025
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,430
Your advertisements are especially good.

1026
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,620
I've watched every one of them

1027
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,870
and I've watched them countless times.

1028
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,750
You can even watch advertisements countless times?

1029
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,540
Of course.

1030
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,220
I've even specially studied them.

1031
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,540
I watched them frame by frame.

1032
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,870
Every frame is perfect.

1033
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,620
You are an artist.

1034
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,950
You have a childlike heart

1035
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,220
and you're full of imagination.

1036
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:56,950
You didn't shoot them

1037
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,580
to promote these products.

1038
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,060
You want to convey your thoughts

1039
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,140
to the whole world.

1040
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,470
You wield a long sword alone

1041
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,750
and fight the world silently.

1042
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,790
You never compromise for this world.

1043
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,660
That's who you are.

1044
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,020
Jian Bing.

1045
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,580
You look mature,

1046
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,390
but in your heart,

1047
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,270
you've always been harboring a spirit of dissatisfaction and resentment.

1048
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,580
This quality...

1049
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,430
is rare.

1050
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,870
You're indeed a college professor.

1051
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,060
You speak really fluently and logically.

1052
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,140
You flatter me.

1053
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,020
Actually, I think you're using your works...

1054
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,540
to find a soulmate.
