00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,420
I don't have other clothes.

5
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,820
Only this one is larger than the others.

6
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,700
Are you going to wear it or not?

7
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:03,940
Yes.

8
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,699
Take out the hat.

9
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,140
-What do you think?
-Do you want to wear it?

10
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,340
Am I handsome?

11
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,700
Are you serious?

12
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,940
And a hat.

13
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,340
I haven't worn this before.

14
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,380
-You look good.
-I feel warmer.

15
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,620
Wait.

16
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,260
I prepared a surprise.

17
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,660

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:30,860
One.

21
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:34,620
Aren't these

22
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,780
the lights of our crew?

23
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,570
Good for you.

24
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,140
You've infiltrated into our crew, huh?

25
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,940
I begged them for quite some time to lend these to me.

26
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,020
Come here.

27
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,060
There's something more interesting.

28
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,780
This

29
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,579
is a lie detection bear.

30
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,010
No matter what you ask it,

31
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,340
it will answer you.

32
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,780
Well, let me show you.

33
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,980
Bear, Bear,

34
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,460
Is Jian Bing

35
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,050
the most beautiful woman

36
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,820
in the world?

37
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,380
Bear, you haven't seen any other woman, have you?

38
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,780
Impossible.

39
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,170
Bear, Bear,

40
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,140
haven't you seen any other woman?

41
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,700
Really?

42
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,050
Bear, Bear,

43
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,620
you haven't seen such a beautiful woman

44
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,940
like Jian Bing, right?

45
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,180
What an honest bear.

46
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,380
Is technology so advanced nowadays?

47
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,260
Is there

48
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,329
really

49
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,010
no trick?

50
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,340
Ask it if you have any questions.

51
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,020
I...

52
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,730
Let me think.

53
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,579
Let me ask it another question.

54
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,420
Okay.

55
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,940
Bear, Bear,

56
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,860
did Jian Bing

57
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,780
dream of me last night?

58
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:07,940
You're lying.

59
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,260
You dreamed of me last night?

60
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,260
What's in your hand?

61
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,900
Nothing.

62
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,730
The remote control unit, right?

63
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,140
-It's your illusion.
-It's remote-controlled!

64
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,660
-Is there a remote control unit? Take it out.
-It's your illusion.

65
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:18,260
Hurry.

66
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:18,820
Stop.

67
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,490
I really prepared something very interesting for you.

68
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,700
Fireworks.

69
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,340
Let me set off fireworks for you.

70
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,820
Stay away. Don't get hurt.

71
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,700
Why don't you sit here?

72
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,220
Are you ready?

73
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,780
Show time.

74
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,220
It seems no one has set off fireworks with me

75
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,380
since I was 10.

76
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,580
It's okay.

77
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,540
Chinese New Year is just around the corner.

78
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,460
I'll set off fireworks with you.

79
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:03,930
Okay.

80
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,650
Sheng Yang,

81
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,700
why are you so persistent?

82
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,300
What did I do again?

83
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,290
Ten years ago,

84
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,540
at the bus stop,

85
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,850
I saw the public service advertisement you filmed

86
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,820
for the first time.

87
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,220
It was really the happiest moment

88
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,659
in my life.

89
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,060
I remember back then,

90
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,340
you kept smiling at me.

91
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,060
You were smiling very happily and beautifully.

92
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,820
But now,

93
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,810
you don't like smiling.

94
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,060
I think you are very tense every day.

95
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,940
You are like...

96
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,820
You are like an invulnerable tough girl

97
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,700
in armour.

98
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,460
What do you mean?

99
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,500
You like tough girls, right?

100
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,210
I...

101
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,020
No.

102
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,260
No.

103
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,700
I...

104
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,660
I just want to see you smile like before.

105
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,659
Kids pick fireworks during Chinese New Year.

106
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,060
Which one do you choose? I'll set it off for you.

107
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,140
The red one.

108
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,020
The highest one.

109
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,820
No problem.

110
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,220
Run!

111
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,580
Beautiful.

112
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,020
Jian Bing,

113
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,020
we've gotten along for quite some time.

114
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,020
What kind of person do you think

115
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,780
I am?

116
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:50,860
What kind of person are you?

117
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,580
You are

118
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,180
a kid

119
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,570
who is a little mature.

120
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,100
Why am I still a kid?

121
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,780
It's good to be a kid.

122
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,820
I wish someone could call me a kid.

123
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,940
Okay, tell me.

124
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,380
What's so good about being a kid?

125
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,500
A kid

126
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,140
has a sunny personality.

127
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,700
A kid is pure,

128
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,300
ambitious,

129
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,140
and bold.

130
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,180
You always show up in front of me.

131
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,500
Sometimes when I see you,

132
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,620
I think of myself

133
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,860
when I was in my 20s.

134
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,380
I hope you don't come to

135
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,220
the complicated and boring adult world so soon.

136
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,659
It means I hope you grow up slowly.

137
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,620
Kid.

138
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,260
It's snowing.

139
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,220
It's snowing.

140
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:31,900
Kid,

141
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,900
Choose one again, and I'll set it off for you.

142
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,500
Let me set it off.

143
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,580
No.

144
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,500
Children can't set off fireworks during Chinese New Year.

145
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,010
Sit there. I'll set it off for you.

146
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,290
Which one do you choose?

147
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,540
Just choose what you haven't set off yet.

148
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,060
I want to see something different.

149
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,170
Okay, I'm gonna choose one.

150
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,580
So beautiful.

151
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,010
You are finally smiling.

152
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,210
Jian Bing is finally smiling.

153
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,700
So beautiful.

154
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,060
Just let me set off fireworks.

155
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,740
I'm gonna do it.

156
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,100
Be careful.

157
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,020
Run! Run!

158
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,340
It's not lit.

159
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,340
Make it snow with the snowflake machine.

160
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,100
Annoying.

161
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,540
It's good.

162
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,340
A little more inside.

163
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,060
Okay.

165
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,940
Come on. Live shot.

166
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,540
Ready for a live shot.

167
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,140
Action.

168
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,300
UV rays are too strong. Refine the make-up for the actors.

169
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:11,980
Okay.

170
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,420
Sunscreen.

171
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,300
I've applied it.

172
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,460
I'm putting it here. Apply it if you want.

173
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,740
Hurry up.

174

[Temperature/Exposure]

175
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,740
Cut.

176
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,300
Stop snowing.

177
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,700
Did both of you laugh?

178
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,100
Did you break into laughter

179
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,940
or was it a smile from the heart?

180
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,880
-A smile from the heart.
-A smile from the heart.

181
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,540
Let's do it again.

182
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,020
Be affectionate.

Make it snow with the snowflake machine.

184
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,180

188
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,540
Okay. Cut.

189
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,420
Lin, go ask them

190
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,820
if it was a real smile.

191
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,540
Were they really smiling just now?

192
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,580
Okay, Director.

193
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,020
Okay, adjust yourselves.

194
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,770
Don't laugh.

195
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,380
Be more affectionate later.

196
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,580
Action.

197
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,650
Cut. Cut.

198
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,580
That's good.

199
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,700
Thank you, everyone.

200
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,820
This film is finished.

201
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,460
Thank you.

202
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,180
Thank you, Director.

203
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,780
Thank you, Director.

204
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,580
The work is finished.

205
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,980
The work is finished.

206
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,380
Mr. Fang, what's wrong?

207
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,100
What's wrong, Mr. Fang?

208
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,020
Nothing. My old problem.

209
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,740
I have a kidney stone. It's been many years.

210
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,420
You're sweating.

211
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,740
Ask Junjie and the others to take you to the hospital now.

212
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,540
I've been calling them the whole morning.

213
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,370
They have checked out.

214
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,340
No one answered my calls.

215
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,740
I don't know where they are.

216
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,900
Okay, I'm gonna ask someone here to send you to the hospital.

217
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,500
Don't.

218
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,540
Well...

219
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,460
Jian Bing,

220
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,540
can you

221
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,540
drive my car

222
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,020
and take me to the hospital?

223
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,820
I can drive.

224
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,100
Mr. Fang, let me take you to the hospital.

225
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,980
If you drive my car,

226
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,060
I'll be worried.

227
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,940
Why?

228
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,620
Sheng Yang.

229
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,940
Go back to the city.

230
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,900
Aren't we going to submit the film?

231
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,140
Song Chen and Pan Rou have checked it, but I'm still worried.

232
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,340
Go back and check it again.

233
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:26,860
Okay?

234
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,860
Mr. Fang,

235
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,090
I'm going to get another pair of trousers convenient for driving.

236
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,540
Help me get Mr. Fang in the car.

237
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,740
I... I can…

238
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,620
Enough, Mr. Fang. Stop acting.

239
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,940
Although you are a music teacher,

240
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,300
you're good at acting.

241
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,460
Let's go.

242
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,380
The car key.

243
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,380
I don't need your help.

244
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,970
I can walk by myself.

245
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:28,060
[Physical examination methods]

246
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,820
Mr. Fang,

247
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,460
the doctor said you have an acute kidney stone.

248
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,180
You should drink more water.

249
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,060
A lot of water.

250
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,540
My job is special.

251
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,140
I talk a lot but don't drink much water.

252
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,180
Maybe because I'm alone

253
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,900
and I have no one to remind me.

254
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,780
It's good.

255
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,060
I mean

256
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,660
when someone is sick,

257
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,060
it's good to have someone

258
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:03,940
by his side.

259
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,340
Thank you so much for today.

260
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,220
I asked you to take me to the hospital.

261
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,820
Not at all.

262
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,580
It's normal

263
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,220
to take a friend who is sick to the hospital.

264
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,340
Actually, I'm just like you.

265
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,460
I had

266
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,220
an unsuccessful marriage.

267
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,580
So I'm very cautious

268
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,660
when I get along with women.

269
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,980
I thought

270
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,820
at my age,

271
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,380
I've experienced everything I should.

272
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,100
So I wouldn't think about

273
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,540
passionate love.

274
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,580
I just want to find a suitable person

275
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,900
to live a stable life.

276
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,610
But now I think

277
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,260
I deserve to be single.

278
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,340
I used to think

279
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,900
a mature person

280
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,180
is someone who doesn't need to please others anymore.

281
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,700
But now it seems

282
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,340
I was wrong.

283
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,220
A mature person is someone who has love in his heart.

284
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,089
He shouldn't be lifeless.

285
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,619
As long as he loves someone,

286
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:14,660
he will try to please her without hesitation.

287
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,260
When taking a walk,

288
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,089
he'll take the initiative to stand on the side near the edge of the road.

289
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:22,859
When it's cold and windy,

290
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,819
he'll take off his coat

291
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,260
and put it on her.

292
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,660
When eating,

293
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,500
he'll prepare hot water for her.

294
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,220
When driving,

295
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,780
he'll adjust the seat for her in advance.

296
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,220
Doing these things for the girl he loves

297
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,900
must make him very happy.

298
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,900
Jian Bing,

299
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,060
I want to be the one

300
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,820
who makes you happy.

301
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,100
I want to officially date you.

302
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,660
Mr. Fang,

303
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,570
I...

304
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,460
am willing to be friends with you.

305
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Just friends?

306
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,620
I think you're very nice.

307
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,620
So I'm willing to be friends with you.

308
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,660
Didn't you say you want to be my GPS yesterday?

309
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,380
When I take a wrong path,

310
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,180
you'll help me reschedule a route.

311
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,780
But in my opinion,

312
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,730
a GPS

313
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,540
allows people

314
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,980
to take the best route

315
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,900
and arrive at the destination

316
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,820
in the shortest time.

317
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,290
Right?

318
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,380
But I think

319
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,900
even if we take a wrong path or make a detour...

320
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,100
Choosing the most difficult path

321
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,100
in life

322
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,300
is quite interesting, right?

323
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,380
Because if we walk fast,

324
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,050
we'll miss the scenery along the way.

325
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,100
Do you think

326
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,260
being interesting

327
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,180
is more important than being right?

328
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,220
To me, what's interesting

329
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,660
is right.

330
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,540
Well...

331
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,900
The IV is almost done.

332
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,380
I...

333
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,060
am going to see when the nurse will come to withdraw the needle.

334
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,570
What are you doing?

335
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,540
Pouring water.

336
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,180
We only work overtime once a month.

337
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,780
Stop procrastinating.

338
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,980
Son, you are back.

339
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,460
Dad, Mom.

340
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,980
Yang, you are back.

341
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,780
I have to work overtime tonight to make an inventory in the supermarket.

342
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,100
I'm going to work later.

343
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,260
The food is ready in the kitchen.

344
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,220
Don't forget to eat, okay?

345
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,780
Hurry up. It'll get cold later.

346
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,900
You should hurry up too.

347
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,050
Let's go now.

348
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,900
I'm an old driver.

349
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,780
There is really something wrong with my waist.

350
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,460
Well, don't go today. I mean it.

351
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,580
Say it again.

352
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,420
Why are you so slow? Go now!

353
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,220
Well, I...

354
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,100
can't work overtime for free.

355
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,260
Are you going or not?

356
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,020
Give me 300 yuan.

357
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,220
Give you 300 yuan? How about giving you 500 yuan?

358
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,100
Dad, Mom,

359
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,980
I'm going out.

360
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,540
Okay.

361
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,860
Didn't you just come back, Yang?

362
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,020
Why are you going out again?

363
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,100
He can't go out?

364
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,340
You can install a surveillance camera

365
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,340
on your son's bed.

366
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,100
So you can see everything he does clearly.

367
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,420
You're so annoying.

368
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,580
Are you going or not?

369
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,500
200 yuan.

370
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,220
Aren't you...

371
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,300
going to check on your uncle?

372
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,220
No hurry.

373
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,500
Jian Shuang,

374
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,460
I didn't plan to tell you.

375
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,620
But then I thought

376
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,020
I should let you know

377
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,620
that I like you,

378
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,540
out of respect.

379
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,460
Thank you.

380
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,460
Actually, I think we are quite alike.

381
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,340
Our parents are not around.

382
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,660
You have a sister, and I have an uncle.

383
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,580
My uncle is the one who went to the parents' meetings.

384
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,780
Me too.

385
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,700
Until I joined the ice hockey club,

386
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,540
I realized

387
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,740
I have a bunch of friends who I can talk to.

388
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,820
Of course,

389
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,580
I have you who don't treat yourself as a girl.

390
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,940
Who are you talking about?

391
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,820
Is there a girl as fierce as you?

392
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,500
You are so serious when you play ice hockey.

393
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,050
I remember I only saw you cry once.

394
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,420
It was on your mother's birthday, right?

395
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:05,860
Jian Shuang,

396
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,980
actually, I understand you.

397
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,700
You can't act coquettishly

398
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,900
or be wilful.

399
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,340
Sometimes you caused trouble

400
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,900
just to gain a sense of presence

401
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,740
and let your sister pay attention to you.

402
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,420
But she has her own life.

403
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,700
You don't dare to disturb her too often.

404
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,580
People who are used to hardships

405
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,820
will doubt if they are worthy

406
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,620
when they are given happiness.

407
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,340
Because

408
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,620
you're afraid that this happiness

409
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,620
will disappear one day.

410
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,300
In the group you established,

411
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,420
someone said something.

412
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,060
How do you know it was me?

413
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,060
Of course I know it was you.

414
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,220
There was a time when I read the messages every day.

415
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,380
Someone wrote something.

416
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,300
He said

417
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,580
he always fell in love with a scumbag

418
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,380
because his parents didn't get along well.

419
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,300
But then I figured it out.

420
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,300
Our life

421
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,940
before we are 18 years old

422
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,100
belongs to our parents

423
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,620
and our family.

424
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,980
Our life after we are 18 years old

425
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,940
belongs to ourselves.

426
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,860
As long as you're an adult,

427
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,180
no one can restrict you.

428
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,180
And no one can control you.

429
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,100
Jian Shuang.

430
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,130
I know

431
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,300
confessing my love for you now

432
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,660
is selfish and irresponsible.

433
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,300
So,

434
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,460
no matter what

435
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:41,980
your answer is,

436
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,570
I'll accept it.

437
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,140
You can accept my love.

438
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,580
You can refuse my love.

439
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,300
And you can ignore my love.

440
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,060
Or

441
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,500
we can continue to be ordinary friends

442
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,220
like before.

443
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:56,860
It's okay.

444
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,660
You have the final say.

445
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,460
You are selfish.

446
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,420
You've figured it out.

447
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,260
But what about me?

448
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,860
Everything was fine.

449
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,860
But look at what you did yesterday.

450
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,020
Now you want me to make the decision.

451
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,420
What should I do?

452
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,020
What should I do?

453
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,140
Why don't you just stay?

454
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,380
If you don't accept it,

455
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,180
let's continue to be ordinary friends

456
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,900
like before.

457
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,140
Okay.

458
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,500
Okay?

459
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,060
Okay.

460
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,220
I should go home to check on my uncle.

461
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,380
I won't disturb you.

462
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:03,900
Wait.

463
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,220
Let's make a deal.

464
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,020
From now on, we are just ordinary friends.

465
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,260
Let's pretend

466
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,940
nothing happened yesterday.

467
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,060
Do you like me or not?

468
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,530
I didn't say I don't like you.

469
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,500
You'll leave soon.

470
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,580
Can I ask you to stay?

471
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,370
Then I...

472
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,420
So this is how it feels

473
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,140
to kiss you.

474
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,900
Have you forgotten what happened yesterday?

475
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,100
Hello.

476
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,100
Hello.

477
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,460
Where are you?

478
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,780
I just arrived at my front door.

479
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
What did the doctor say?

480
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,460
Is Mr. Fang's problem

481
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,780
serious?

482
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,290
No.

483
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,340
He received treatment and has been taken home.

484
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,340
I know Fang Mu

485
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,940
has been pursuing you.

486
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,580
But you can't say yes.

487
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,140
Why?

488
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,900
Turn around.

489
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,060
Because of me.

490
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,140
I like you, Jian Bing.

491
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,180
And I know

492
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,020
you like me too.

493
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,340
Sister, what are you doing?

494
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,020
What are you two doing?

495
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,540
It's all your fault.

496
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,140
She saw us.

497
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,940
You did something big quietly.

498
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,620
-What's your story?
-Tell me the truth.

499
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,180
What do you mean?

500
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,180
How dare you ask me?

501
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,020
What's your story?

502
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,780
Uncle,

503
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,380
how are you feeling?

504
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,900
Leave me alone.

505
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,260
What?

506
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,900
Why are you talking about me again?

507
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,700
Let's talk about you.

508
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,730
You...

509
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,010
You two were standing by the window.

510
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:03,980
What were you doing?

511
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,220
We...

512
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,660
We...

513
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,700
At least,

514
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,700
we were at home.

515
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,580
Do ice hockey players

516
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,180
watch basketball games?

517
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,100
I like basketball a lot.

518
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,620
Did you watch the game yesterday?

519
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,730
James scored 28 points by himself.

520
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,290
Yes.

521
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,540
He's in a good state in this season.

522
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,660
Yes.

523
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,180
His average score in this season

524
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,290
will definitely be higher than that in the last season.

525
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,540
I think Hao Junjie is reliable.

526
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,580
Even if you are in a relationship with him,

527
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,100
I won't have any objections.

528
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,580
We can talk about whether he is reliable or not later.

529
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,380
Who does Sheng Yang think he is?

530
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,540
Where are your manners?

531
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,660
Tell me. What's so good about him?

532
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,820
You are so obsessed with him.

533
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,980
Have you ever seen me obsessed?

534
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,300
Do you know him?

535
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,580
He has many advantages.

536
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,740
Young, optimistic, handsome,

537
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,540
diligent, and smart.

538
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,220
And he has a nice figure.

539
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,730
Enough.

540
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,340
And he has a good personality.

541
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,900
He has no shortcomings, right?

542
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,740
If you keep praising him, I'm gonna vomit out what I ate last night.

543
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,420
Didn't you ask me to praise him?

544
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,780
Will Hao Junjie go abroad?

545
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,620
He'll leave in 6 months.

546
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,580
What's your plan?

547
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,020
Do you plan to have a long-distance relationship?

548
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,300
No.

549
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,460
Just forget it.

550
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,940
Thank you.

551
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,980
Sheng Yang.

552
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,420
Hao Junjie.

553
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,540
My uncle...

554
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,580
Don't worry.

555
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,820
Your uncle is fine.

556
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,260
The doctor has taken care of him.

557
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,660
And he's home now.

558
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,450
It's good that he's fine.

559
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,820
Actually, your uncle

560
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,250
is quite nice.

561
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,660
Really?

562
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,300
No.

563
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,020
He's very annoying.

564
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,530
Well,

565
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,060
everything was fine.

566
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,340
He will leave soon, but he still told me this.

567
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,180
Why does he

568
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,020
have to ruin such a stable relationship?

569
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,420
Isn't it good to be friends forever?

570
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,660
Do you like him or not?

571
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,340
Even if I like him, it's useless.

572
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,500
Xue Yiming...

573
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,420
liked you back then, right?

574
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,380
When Jian Zhongde pursued our mom,

575
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,940
he was so passionate, right?

576
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,650
But what happened in the end?

577
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,660
People change.

578
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,820
What's wrong with you?

579
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,300
Are you going to see through the vanity of the world?

580
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,660
Of course people change.

581
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,660
Everyone will change, including you.

582
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,700
You can't ask anyone

583
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,660
to be with you forever.

584
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,540
Understand?

585
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,420
Sister,

586
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,940
can you stop asking me to follow your theory?

587
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,540
I'm not as strong as you.

588
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,020
I don't want to face changes.

589
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,730
I don't want to face parting.

590
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,660
I hope

591
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,020
the relationships in my life are fixed.

592
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,660
Just like you and me.

593
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,300
No matter what happens

594
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,140
and whether we are old or sick,

595
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,420
we won't abandon each other.

596
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,260
If it's not like that,

597
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,699
what's the point?

598
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:18,540
Who told you that our relationship is fixed?

599
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,420
Not necessarily.

600
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,260
I didn't say I can be with you forever.

601
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:29,139
Have you and Ms. Jian Bing...

602
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,260
Congratulations.

603
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,659
Congratulations.

604
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,860
Actually, I know

605
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:45,020
Ms. Jian Bing

606
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,820
doesn't like my uncle.

607
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,699
Love can't be forced.

608
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,900
Considering what you just said,

609
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,300
I've decided to make friends with you.

610
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,820
Don't be happy too soon.

611
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,220
My uncle may still have a chance in the future.

612
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,260
Wait until I'm dead.

613
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,450
Listen, Jian Shuang,

614
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,380
you shouldn't be afraid

615
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,020
to build an intimate relationship with others.

616
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,900
Besides me,

617
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,780
there must be someone else in this world

618
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,300
who can give you a sense of security.

619
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,700
You need to grow up and experience it yourself.

620
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,540
If you like him, just date him.

621
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,340
Don't care about if it's a long-distance relationship or not.

622
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,060
Before he leaves,

623
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,420
you should go watch movies or walk around

624
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,020
and get to know each other better.

625
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,940
Even if you are separated,

626
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,060
those will be your wonderful memories.

627
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:41,700
Listen.

628
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,180
Before you told me this,

629
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,140
I thought you are already in a relationship with him.

630
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,940
You are good at persuading others.

631
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,460
You're good at helping with my relationship, right?

632
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,300
Why are you...

633
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,940
Why are you afraid?

634
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,700
Let me ask you.

635
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,250
If Hao Junjie won't go abroad,

636
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,660
will you date him?

637
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,580
I don't know.

638
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,860
You don't know?

639
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,380
Then go out later

640
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,420
and tell him you've decided to refuse him.

641
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,460
Maybe he'll come back

642
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,330
with a foreign girlfriend

643
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,340
after he finishes his three-year studies abroad.

644
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,460
And when you meet, he'll introduce her to you like this.

645
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,420
Hi, Jian Shuang, this is my girlfriend.

646
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,460
Are you happy?

647
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,540
How dare he do that?

648
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,740
Will everything be fine?

649
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,860
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

650
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,500
Ms. Jian Bing

651
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,140
won't do anything to Jian Shuang, right?

652
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,180
Of course she won't.

653
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,460
They are sisters.

654
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,260
It's hard to say.

655
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,460
Ms. Jian Bing is usually fierce.

656
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,980
Who are you talking about?

657
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,500
When...

658
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,540
When was she fierce?

659
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:40,890
Come out.

660
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,020
Sister, don't you care about me?

661
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,740
Come out.

662
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,140
Hao Junjie.

663
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,460
Come here.

664
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,220
Jian Shuang.

665
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,900
Sister, what?

666
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,650
Both of you are adults.

667
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,420
You can be responsible for your feelings and doings, right?

668
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:22,690
Yes.

669
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,540
Yes.

670
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,900
Don't bully Jian Shuang.

671
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,260
Don't let her cry.

672
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,580
Be nice to her.

673
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,660
Otherwise, I'll teach you a lesson.

674
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,380
Well, I...

675
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,530
won't come back tonight.

676
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,010
You two, enjoy your date.

677
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,700
Sister.

678
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,380
You...

679
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,370
Where...

680
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,580
should we go?

681
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,820
What are you talking about?

682
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,900
Go back to your home now.

683
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,380
What about you?

684
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,940
I have a lot of places to go.

685
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,490
You were really cool just now.

686
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,500
You're really a good sister.

687
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,660
I just want my sister

688
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,420
to be in a relationship happily.

689
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,740
Actually, I knew she likes Hao Junjie long ago.

690
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,980
Otherwise, she wouldn't have become an ice hockey player.

691
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,500
You were chatting with him. What do you think of him?

692
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,300
He's good.

693
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,100
He didn't talk much.

694
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,180
He's quite calm.

695
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,820
Judging from what he said,

696
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,060
I can tell he cares about Jian Shuang.

697
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,980
He's a good young man. He'll have a bright future.

698
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,210
That's good.

699
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,740
I found

700
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,220
you're quite open-minded when it comes to your sister.

701
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,980
Why are you so conservative when it comes to yourself?

702
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:07,900
Am I conservative?

703
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,860
If you're not conservative,

704
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,100
go to my house.

705
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,220
Why?

706
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,180
I have a gift for you.

707
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,100
Give it to me in the daytime.

708
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,860
If I go and meet your parents,

709
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,940
what should I tell them?

710
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,180
My mom's supermarket is making an inventory.

711
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,180
My dad went with her.

712
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,300
No one is home.

713
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,180
We'll leave as soon as I give you the gift.

714
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,260
And then let's go eat Luosifen.

715
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,420
Come on.

716
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,900
Please behave yourself.

717
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,980
Luosifen sounds good.

718
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,620
What would you like to add?

719
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,500
Two eggs?

720
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,380
Sour bamboo shoots?

721
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,420
Didn't I tell you that when we ate it before?

722
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,420
Think harder.

723
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,460
Think harder.

724
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,210
Vegetables.

725
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,180
Listen.

726
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,260
I'm jealous at home every day.

727
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,380
I can't stand it.

728
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,180
Why?

729
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,260
It's all your fault.

730
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:06,940
My fault?

731
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,260
Yes. My parents are together every day.

732
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,780
They are always together no matter what they do.

733
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,820
My dad calls her Meijuan every day.

734
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,380
My mom calls him Sheng.

735
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,060
I really can't stand it.

736
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,460
They always show their love in front of me.

737
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,730
You can't stand it.

738
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,410
Have you forgotten how you begged me?

739
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,820
I can never forget that.

740
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,060
Come in.

741
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,300
Which is your room?

742
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,020
Welcome to Sheng Yang's dream room.

743
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,460
What do you think?

744
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,460
Yes. Ms. Jian,

745
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,580
tell me about your opinions on these paintings.

746
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,060
Good job, Mr. Sheng.

747
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,860
I drew this painting

748
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,780
when I went to paint from life in high school.

749
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,580
You drew so well in high school?

750
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,900
I also drew this when I was in high school.

751
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,060
It helped me win an award.

752
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,980
Not bad.

753
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:15,820
Besides,

754
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,900
the bed, the cabinets, and the sofa

755
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,780
were made by me and my dad.

756
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:21,940
Really?

757
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,210
Awesome, right?

758
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,580
I like your dad.

759
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,820
What about me?

760
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,060
Why didn't you

761
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,060
inherit your dad's sense of humor?

762
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,380
He's not as handsome as me.

763
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,580
I can't deny that.

764
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,140
Where's my gift?

765
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,100
What gift?

766
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,660
Didn't you say you have a gift for me?

767
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,140
You want to see it now?

768
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:51,820
Okay.

769
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,930
-What do you think?
-It's really tacky.

770
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,260
Isn't my gift good?

771
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,220
Your gift?

772
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:08,900
Me.

773
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,940
You've changed a lot, Sheng Yang.

774
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,860
I learned it from my dad.

775
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,740
Don't you like my dad?

776
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,980
I'll learn from whoever you like.

777
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,220
Can I step on your carpet?

778
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:22,940
Yes.

779
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,140
I'll get you a pair of slippers to make you more comfortable.

780
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,420
Okay. I don't need to step on it then.

781
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:36,660
Thank you.

782
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,940
I'm going to get you some water.

783
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,660
Feel it

784
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,740
in my dream room.

785
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,940
You could have asked your male colleagues for help.

786
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,980
Do I have the guts to do that?
