[Episode 13]

4
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,620
Hello.

5
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,500
Good morning.

6
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,300
Morning.

7
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,539
I want to go to the film site with you

8
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,860
to learn from you.

9
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,460
Is that okay?

10
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,539
Did your company

11
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,050
not assign you any other work?

12
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,420
This is my work. Have you forgotten?

13
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,979
Right.

14
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,300
You personally settled this project.

15
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,180
You're keeping an eye on me as the client rep, right?

16
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,420
I wouldn't dare.

17
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,860
I don't worry about Director Jian's filming.

18
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,020
I just want to learn.

19
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,620
It's good to like learning.

20
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,500
Come on.

21
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,580
Director Jian is my chauffeur?

22
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,940
It's my duty

23
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,660
to serve the client well.

24
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,740
The director is here.

25
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,460
Lin.

26
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,150
Lin.

27
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,790
Director.

28
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,070
This is my assistant, Lin.

29
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,329
This is our client, Sheng Yang.

30
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,630
Hello, Mr. Sheng.

31
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,310
Hello. Hello.

32
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,070
Take care of him.

33
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,140
Okay.

34
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,460
Here, Mr. Sheng.

35
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,340
It's okay. Don't worry about me.

36
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,660
You can sit with Lin.

37
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,700
Come, sit here.

38
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,540
Lin, tell him

39
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,060
the basic film set knowledge.

40
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,220
Okay.

41
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,900
Please sit here.

42
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,310
Yuan.

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,980
Copy that.

44
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,270
If you're done adjusting, leave now.

45
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,620
Here.

46
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,100
Are you done, Yuan?

47
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,660
Yes.

48
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,700
Let's give it a try.

49
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,220
Come on.

50
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,020
Try it out.

51
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,220
Okay.

52
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,460
Ready?

53
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,060
Action.

54
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,060
It starts directly?

55
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,260
Come on. Push harder.

56
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,460
Commercial filming precautions?

57
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,340
You're quite detailed.

58
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,220
Okay, cut.

59
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,310
Mei, you don't have to retouch your makeup,

60
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,579
because right now,

61
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,460
you're about to give birth.

62
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,940
A woman trying her best

63
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,140
to bring a new life to this world

64
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,300
is the most beautiful.

65
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,140
Okay?

66
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,740
Your expression just now

67
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,060
only had pain and no strength.

68
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,630
You have to work hard when giving birth.

69
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,220
Use all your strength.

70
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,510
Raise the light a little more.

71
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,590
Okay.

72
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,460
Rolling.

73
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,580
Action.

74
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,100
Have you heard

75
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,339
that you can't sit on the lens box on set?

76
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,180
Yes, I have. I've done research.

77
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,420
You came prepared.

78
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,580
What else do you know?

79
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,020
I also know that the actor's watch

80
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,580
counts as makeup when filming,

81
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,180
but it's a prop when you stop filming.

82
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:35,900
What else?

83
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,180
And...

84
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,100
Take motorcycle helmets for example.

85
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,620
It's a prop when you hold it,

86
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,590
but it's part of your costume when you wear it.

87
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,860
Not bad.

88
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,220
Let me ask you something harder.

89
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,590
Did you see the trash over there?

90
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,860
Who is in charge of that?

91
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,700
The custodian.

92
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,310
They're called production assistants.

93
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,190
PA bros.

94
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,660
How did you meet our director?

95
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,390
I haven't seen you on set before.

96
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,060
I'm the client for this film.

97
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,390
See this script?

98
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,540
I made it.

99
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,700
July Advertisement.

100
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,740
Sorry, sorry.

101
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,340
Our director is super talented.

102
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,510
Just now, you saw

103
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,770
her control

104
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,900
of the set

105
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,300
and the actors' emotions.

106
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,820
All the actors are in the correct state in a few takes.

107
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,260
They understand what they have to show.

108
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:37,980
She's a very professional director.

109
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,740
But it hasn't been easy these few years.

110
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,980
She may be the director

111
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,830
and bossing people around on set,

112
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,420
but when the brand and clients come,

113
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,900
they keep yelling at her.

114
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,700
It's rare to see a client like you.

115
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,380
It's my first time here.

116
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,220
Lower your voice.

117
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,340
Okay.

118
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,060
Okay, cut.

119
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,580
This is good.

120
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,140
This is good.

121
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,860
Director, do you want to do a safety take?

122
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,180
Of course,

123
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,820
but

124
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,700
please increase it by 50.

125
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,220
Adjust it quickly.

126
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,300
And make her expression bigger.

127
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,100
You see, they usually need a safety take.

128
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:15,630
Got it.

129
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,300
No problem.

130
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,820
Hurry up.

131
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,540
Are you done?

132
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,300
A safety take means to do another take, right?

133
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,420
Yes.

134
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,100
Director, the camera is ready.

135
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,020
Okay.

136
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Ready.

137
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,660
Cameras,

138
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,620
action.

139
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,900
Good. Good.

140
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,220
Take a deep breath.

141
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,260
Good. Good.

142
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,300
Okay, cut.

143
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,020
Pass.

144
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,230
Okay, come on.

145
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,340
That take passed?

146
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:42,860
Yes.

147
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,340
Yes.

148
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,220
Yuan, change the camera position.

149
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,430
Okay, got it.

150
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,580
Which studio are we at tomorrow?

151
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,460
Can I see it now?

152
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,060
Director,

153
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,540
I got a message from the visuals team.

154
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,620
They said the studio is set up.

155
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,060
It's nearby. We can go look.

156
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,100
Let's go.

157
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,380
Both are needed.

158
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,820
You two having a nice chat?

159
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,380
Director.

160
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,830
We're talking about work.

161
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,420
I've written it all down.

162
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,420
All teams, hurry up.

163
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:06,820
Okay.

164
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,220
Okay.

165
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,780
Let's continue when the director is back.

166
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,780
Earlier, you said

167
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,820
that even Director Jian gets scolded?

168
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,180
Of course.

169
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,060
She may be a director,

170
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,540
but she's still a girl.

171
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,860
She doesn't have thick skin,

172
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,620
but she has no choice.

173
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,580
In this line of work,

174
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,020
you have to suffer.

175
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,900
Right?

176
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,100
She didn't tell you, right?

177
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,420
She has bad stomach problems.

178
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,140
Look at my bag.

179
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,020
I always prepare stomach medicine for her.

180
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,780
Do you usually

181
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,100
eat boxed meals?

182
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,630
Yes.

183
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,820
The food must be all cold, right?

184
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,830
Her health problems are due to filming.

185
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,590
She can't eat at set times,

186
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,030
the food is all cold,

187
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,820
and it has heavy grease and salt.

188
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,630
There's no way her stomach can take it.

189
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,140
Lin.

190
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,460
Ms. Shan.

191
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,020
I passed by the studio today

192
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,630
and I saw a boy.

193
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,700
He's tall and handsome, but I've never seen him before.

194
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,460
Who is it?

195
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,980
You mean Sheng Yang, right?

196
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,299
I heard he came here to learn from the director.

197
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,510
He's the client of that film.

198
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,860
And he's very modest.

199
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,700
A modest client?

200
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,100
It must be an act.

201
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,230
It's true.

202
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,900
He wrote the script of the film.

203
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,820
He's that talented?

204
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,380
Wait, the director is calling.

205
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,100
Okay.

206
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,700
Hello?

207
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,420
Hello, Lin. Where are you?

208
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,500
I came back to report the expenses for everyone.

209
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,820
Where's Sheng Yang?

210
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,780
He said he went out for something.

211
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,900
Is he not back yet?

212
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,140
Let me talk to her.

213
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,700
Okay, you don't have to come back. We're done.

214
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,220
Ms. Jian, wait a moment.

215
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,460
Ms. Shan wants to speak with you.

216
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,420
Hello, are you still busy?

217
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,270
Hello, Shan.

218
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,140
You've worked hard.

219
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,420
I'll go visit you.

220
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,780
No need.

221
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,510
I'm done already.

222
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,100
You're done? That's great.

223
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,460
I'll take you out for a girl's night.

224
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,260
How about shopping, dinner, and a spa?

225
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:32,820
Sure.

226
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,420
Okay.

227
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,860
See you in the parking lot.

228
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:35,860
Bye.

229
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,300
Okay, bye.

230
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,740
Ms. Shan, the studio just finished up.

231
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,660
I have to go there now.

232
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,180
Go ahead.

233
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:43,860
Okay, bye.

234
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,630
Bye.

235
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,620
Lin,

236
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,540
they're done?

237
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,820
What took you so long?

238
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,590
The director just asked you where you were.

239
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,700
Where is she?

240
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,780
She went to dinner with another boss.

241
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,860
Miss, your dishes are all served.

242
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,940
All served?

243
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,620
This is it?

244
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,700
It's nowhere enough.

245
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,780
Show me the menu.

246
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,340
No, no.

247
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,150
Thank you.

248
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,990
Okay.

249
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,180
We can't finish this?

250
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,060
This isn't enough.

251
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,180
I know your appetite.

252
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,540
You're trying to save money for me?

253
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,700
How long has it been since you had dinner with me?

254
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,060
I don't eat at night now.

255
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,980
You have to take care of yourself.

256
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,470
Here.

257
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,460
Have some soup.

258
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,820
Why do I feel like you're absent-minded today?

259
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,020
Are you in a bad mood?

260
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,260
No.

261
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,460
You're absent-minded when talking to me.

262
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,990
You have a problem with me?

263
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,420
Since when were you so sensitive?

264
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,980
What's wrong with you?

265
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,060
I thought I offended you

266
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,500
and you don't want to eat with me anymore.

267
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,460
The soup is good. I want some too.

268
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,420
I forgot to tell you something.

269
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,830
What is it?

270
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,700
I'm lending the company's recording studio

271
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,020
for a day.

272
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,420
Jian Shuang has a classmate coming to record tomorrow.

273
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,540
I'll send you their name

274
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,020
and contact information later.

275
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,100
Is that it?

276
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,660
I thought it was something serious.

277
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,700
What did you think it was?

278
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,020
Nothing.

279
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,660
How is Jian Shuang lately?

280
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,900
Has she caused you any trouble?

281
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,060
Of course.

282
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,060
I get a headache

283
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,260
whenever I see her call.

284
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,980
You two sisters can't talk properly.

285
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,500
You're like two firecrackers.

286
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,100
Let me tell you.

287
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,940
Jian Shuang

288
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,350
has the same temper as me.

289
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,820
She doesn't take harsh words.

290
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,110
Don't always be so strict on her.

291
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,420
Liang Shanshan, I think

292
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,260
you're the one acting weird today.

293
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,220
You're all suspicious..

294
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,030
Have you been

295
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,300
flirting with some handsome guy recently

296
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,620
and fell in love?

297
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,420
Be honest.

298
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,460
How is that possible?

299
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,580
How could I give up a forest

300
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,180
for a tree?

301
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,540
Right.

302
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,980
Who are you, Liang Shanshan?

303
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,580
A female player.

304
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,100
You're the female player!

305
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,190
Eat your food.

306
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,820
Are you off work?

307
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,380
Let's go.

308
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:49,980
See you tomorrow.

309
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,460
Let's go.

310
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,340
Go.

311
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,260
Sheng Yang.

312
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,700
The filming wrapped?

313
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,460
Come and have dinner with us later.

314
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,260
I haven't finished my work yet. You two go ahead.

315
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,820
You haven't even treated us to a meal

316
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,220
after becoming the chief designer.

317
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,030
Let him finish his work first.

318
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,300
He can treat us to dinner whenever he wants.

319
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,420
How about this?

320
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,540
I'll transfer the money to you.

321
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,700
You treat everyone to dinner.

322
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,580
Sure.

323
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,980
That makes me feel bad.

324
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,300
Alright, we've got the money.

325
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,940
Let's not hold back with Designer Sheng's money,

326
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,470
okay?

327
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,620
Pick a restaurant first.

328
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,180
Let's go.

329
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,980
Let's go.

330
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,660
Let’s eat.

331
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,860
Isn’t Sheng Yang coming?

332
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,670
He...

333
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,900
Your meal

334
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,100
completely stuffed me.

335
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,830
I'm definitely going to gain weight.

336
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,140
Good.

337
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,740
We'll shop to exercise.

338
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,740
Let's go to that store.

339
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,180
Let's not.

340
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,140
Look how many things you're carrying already.

341
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,180
No offense,

342
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,820
but you're always either editing

343
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,100
or filming.

344
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,660
You never have time to accompany me.

345
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,020
What's wrong with hanging out with me more today?

346
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,430
Anyway, there's something wrong with you today.

347
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,980
You treated me to dinner

348
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,860
and bought me things.

349
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,900
If you're being nice to me for no reason,

350
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,220
you must have something up your sleeve.

351
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,620
No, I didn't treat you to dinner.

352
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,660
I wanted to eat

353
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,670
and I asked you to accompany me.

354
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,710
Besides,

355
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,740
you've shopped with me for so long.

356
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,860
What's wrong with buying you something?

357
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,980
This one looks nice. Let's go in.

358
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,620
Look up.

359
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,860
What are you doing?

360
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,580
You want to marry me?

361
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,980
Can I?

362
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,150
You won't marry me?

363
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,780
You're my only girlfriend in my life.

364
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,580
What's wrong with spending some money on you?

365
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,500
This isn't even expensive. Let's go.

366
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,820
Anyway,

367
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,180
I think

368
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,900
you must have done something bad behind my back.

369
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,870
Think about it.

370
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,860
You...

371
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,420
Did I make a mistake by buying things for you?

372
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,220
You like this store. Let's go.

373
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,260
Fine.

374
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,660
[Jian Bing
Sheng Yang: Director Jian, you have a stomach problems. Don’t drink too much.]

375
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,880
[Jian Bing
Sheng Yang: If you drank alcohol, call me. I'll pick you up]

376
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,100
Drinking red wine

377
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,060
is good for your skin.

378
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,900
I don't drink anymore.

379
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,940
My skin will sag if I drink at my age.

380
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:09,010
[Jian Bing
Sheng Yang: Don’t go home too late. Be careful. Text me when you get home]

381
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,260
Your skin is good.

382
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,100
Come on.

383
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:16,900
Where's the wine?

384
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,570
[Sheng Yang
Jian Bing: Did you go back to the office or home?]

385
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,520
Hello, the bill for that table please.

386
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,060
This is your receipt. Please check it.

387
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,060
This much?

388
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,579
Did we order the duck head?

389
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:10,540
I ordered it.

390
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,910
No, I wanted to scold you earlier.

391
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,020
It's not you treating everyone.

392
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,430
Why are you so stingy?

393
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,140
Princess,

394
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,140
a few hundred or thousand for a meal

395
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,220
might not mean anything to you,

396
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,030
but Sheng Yang earned every single penny and dime

397
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,380
by staying up late to draw and write.

398
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,420
How about you pay for him?

399
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,740
Fine, I'll pay.

400
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,860
Enough.

401
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,780
I was just saying.

402
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,100
He won't allow it if he finds out.

403
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,470
No.

404
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,580
Can we use that coupon?

405
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,550
Yes.

406
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,700
I'm willing to spend money for the guy I like.

407
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,220
I'm happy to.

408
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,940
Does his promotion have anything to do with you?

409
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,900
He'll owe me a favor if I pay him.

410
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,100
Then it'll have something to do with me.

411
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,700
I won't give you the chance.

412
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,580
Here comes the noodles.

413
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,500
Your favorite fried egg with pickled bamboo shoots.

414
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,180
Okay.

415
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,620
Take your time. Call me if you need anything.

416
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,500
Thank you, boss.

417
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,340
It's okay.

418
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,190
[Typing...
Sheng Yang]

419
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,340

"Jian Bing" recalled a message
Jian Bing: I was dragged here by my friend. Wanna come?]

426
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:02,890
[Jian Bing: I was dragged here by my friend. Wanna come?
Sheng Yang: Where are you?]

427
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:12,340
[Sheng Yang: I'll pass, still have to work tomorrow. You have fun]

428
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,020
[Jian Bing: How did you feel after hanging out at the set today?]

429

[Jian Bing: Give me some feedback. The sincere kind]

433

[Jian Bing: The plot needed to be highlighted with a panoramic shot at the time]

443
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,820
Ming's mom,

444
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,510
what's the date today?

445
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,340
Today seems to be the 15th of the first lunar month.

446
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,900
Let me see.

447
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,110
It's really is the 15th.

448
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,140
What's wrong?

449
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,940
Look how happy you are.

450
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,060
The weather is really nice today.

451
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,100
Let's sail together.

452
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,270
Sure.

453
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,700
I thought we could celebrate tonight

454
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,460
and go back to how things were.

455
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,140
My life has turned into the 15th of the lunar first year.

456
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,070
It's full of riddles, just like during the Lantern Festival.

457
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,180
Here you are.

458
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,060
Thank you.

459
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,740
Weigh it for me.

460
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,900
Get in line.

461
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,580
I'm in a hurry. Just weigh it for me.

462
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,180
The people behind me didn't complain.

463
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,460
You're just a vegetable seller. Why are you so uppity?

464
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,020
Watch your language.

465
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,860
You're young. Where are your manners?

466
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,500
All the seniors have been in line for a long time.

467
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,380
What right do you have

468
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,940
to push everyone back?

469
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,860
That's right.

470
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,740
Just say if you'll weigh it or not.

471
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,220
I won't.

472
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,820
Is this how you treat customers?

473
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,220
I'm going to report you.

474
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,380
Lousy vegetable seller.

475
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,180
How much can you earn per month?

476
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,220
I'm going to talk to the manager.

477
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,580
Is that how you talk to your mom too?

478
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,140
So what if she sells vegetables?

479
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,300
If you go up a few generations,

480
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,380
we're all farmers.

481
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,260
Even kids know not to cut in line.

482
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,580
You're a tall and grown man.

483
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,460
What are you thinking?

484
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,060
Is there a pumpkin over your head?

485
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,470
Buy the vegetable if you want.

486
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,900
You can have hot pot tonight

487
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,700
and throw your head in for a swirl too.

488
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,300
Who are you?

489
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,060
How rude.

490
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,140
Apologize.

491
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,420
Say sorry.

492
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,100
You...

493
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,020
Leave if you don't want to buy it.

494
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,340
Don't disturb the public order here.

495
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,190
Go away.

496
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:00,940
Go away.

497
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,980
You're so rude.

498
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,910
Go, go.

499
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,830
You old man,

500
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,460
wait and see.

501
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,460
I'll wait for you.

502
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,380
You're breaking the law under broad daylight.

503
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,100
Come on.

504
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,380
If I don't sort you as harmful garbage,

505
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,900
I'll have done my job in vain.

506
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,700
Come on.

507
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,710
Just you wait.

508
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,350
I'll wait.

509
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,390
Wait.

510
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,140
Don't hit yourself.

511
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,740
What a horrible person.

512
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,380
Horrible.

513
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,620
Ginger discounted at 2.66 yuan.

514
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,420
Why are you here?

515
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:39,820
I...

516
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,940
I just passed by.

517
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,060
Grade 2 purple core sweet potato, 3.05 yuan.

518
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,740
Why didn't you pass by before?

519
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,700
I saw a beauty online.

520
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,740
When you're done with work,

521
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,020
come

522
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,620
and we can look together.

523
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,990
Go away.

524
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,620
Super large cup.

525
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,700
Where's the beauty?

526
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,580
You came all the way here for her.

527
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,500
Take a look.

528
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,260
She is so outstanding.

529
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,140
She's not only someone's mother,

530
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,580
someone's wife,

531
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,260
or someone's daughter.

532
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,990
She doesn't owe anyone a marriage

533
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,060
nor owe anyone a child.

534
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,100
She

535
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,420
only owes herself a happy look.

536
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,470
Because every one of her

537
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,630
is unique.

538
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,060
It's written so well.

539
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,500
You are not only Sheng Yang’s mom.

540
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,220
You're also Sheng Xiangqian's wife

541
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,500
and the Sheng's daughter-in-law.

542
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,590
More importantly,

543
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,900
you're Luo Meijuan.

544
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,380
What's wrong with Luo Meijuan?

545
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,150
Luo Meijuan likes to be pretty.

546
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,580
She loves to wear beautiful dresses.

547
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,870
She likes to tend to flowers and plants sometimes.

548
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,500
Even more,

549
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,620
she likes a little romance.

550
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,380
And then?

551
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,300
As her husband,

552
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,750
I have to understand and support that, right?

553
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,540
At least, I shouldn't rain on her parade

554
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,500
or play Devil's advocate.

555
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,140
What else?

556
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,180
You...

557
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,500
You've worked hard.

558
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,510
To be honest,

559
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,940
you contribute

560
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,340
a lot more to the family

561
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,460
than I do.

562
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,860
Me?

563
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,380
Other than my small salary,

564
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:14,780
I basically

565
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,060
don't contribute to this family at all.

566
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,150
You raised the child yourself.

567
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,100
Our parents...

568
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,580
You're the one taking care of our parents.

569
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,380
I've never done any chores.

570
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,420
In the past,

571
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,060
I knew you wanted to hear these words, but I didn't say it.

572
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,380
I slept on the sofa for a week.

573
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,500
I...

574
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,820
I reached enlightenment.

575
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,630
Actually,

576
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,310
when

577
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,500
I saw you...

578
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,940
When you're angry,

579
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,020
I was angry too.

580
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,900
I was angry that you're angry.

581
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,710
Well...

582
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,870
Sorry to have made you suffer, Meijuan.

583
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,700
I just didn't know

584
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,580
how to stand in your shoes.

585
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,740
I don't know how to think from your point of view.

586
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,180
Where did you get these lines from?

587
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,140
You sound

588
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,750
very fancy.

589
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,140
Director Jian told me.

590
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,390
I knew you couldn't come up with these words yourself.

591
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,820
I can't,

592
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,950
but I do think so.

593
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,030
Please forgive me.

594
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,020
We still have a long way to go.

595
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,020
I won't just say empty words.

596
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,900
Watch my actions from now on.

597
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,020
Why are you so annoying?

598
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,380
I don't have the habit of bringing tissues.

599
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,420
To show my sincerity, let me toast you.

600
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:03,950
Here.

601
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,140
Enough.

602
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,380
Enough.

603
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,460
I bought it for you. It's enough for me.

604
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,510
Drink up.

605
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,220
She is so outstanding.

606
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,140
She

607
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,220
only owes herself a happy look.

608
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,700
Is this pretty woman Luo Meijuan?

609
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,620
Sure enough, people need to dress up.

610
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,820
You did a great job again.

611
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,060
I heard the brand

612
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,860
is very satisfied with the result.

613
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,100
It's all thanks to the director.

614
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,500
Aren't you going to treat the director to a meal?

615
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,700
The director

616
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,580
has been very busy lately.

617
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,860
Maybe in a few days.

618
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,140
Why wait?

619
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,620
Isn't this a good excuse to use right now?

620
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,140
You have to be more shameless.

621
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,580
We have to face our true desires.

622
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,460
What are you talking about?

623
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,830
How is it desire?

624
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,430
Let me ask you a question.

625
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,820
Have you ever called her "sister"?

626
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,140
If you haven't, it means something is wrong,

627
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,620
because you never viewed her

628
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,180
as a sister.

629
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,710
Instead, you see her as a woman.

630
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,700
There are only two things men think about women.

631
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,900
Either stay away from me

632
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,420
and cuddle with me.

633
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,020
Which one is it for you?

634
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,510
[Jian Bing]

635
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,500
Jian Yi.

636
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,900
She's just like her name.

637
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,420
Beautiful.

638
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,140
Stop it.

639
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,060
Are you attracted?

640
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,620
Are we not going to work anymore?

641
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,700
-Yes.
-The receptionist is over there.

642
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,940
Is this the one you fought last time?

643
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,030
Yes.

644
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,380
He does look like he deserves it.

645
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:04,660
Let's go.

646
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,460
Let's get down to business.

647
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,380
Hello.

648
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,020
Well,

649
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,700
this is my nephew, Hao Junjie.

650
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,710
I'm Fang Mu.

651
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,220
We're here to see Director Jian.

652
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,300
Mr. Fang, right?

653
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:13,630
Yes.

654
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,020
Director Jian has told us already.

655
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,660
I'll take you upstairs.

656
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,460
Thank you.

657
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,140
This way, please.

658
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,420
I'll start recording.

659
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,500
If it's not okay, we can start over.

660
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,470
Ready?

661
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,460
Yes.

662
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,660
By the way,

663
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,420
did Director Jian come to the company today?

664
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,100
Yes.

665
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,100
Thank you.

666
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,620
Reduce the shot just now by three frames.

667
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,660
Let me see.

668
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,140
Reduce three frames.

669
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,060
What can I do for you?

670
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,380
Excuse me, I'm looking for

671
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,260
Director Jian Bing.

672
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,030
Where is her office?

673
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:45,940
Director Jian?

674
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,270
Yes.

675
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,310
Director Jian is over there.

676
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:47,750
Over there?

677
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,260
Thank you.

678
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:48,790
You're welcome.

679
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,580
Not good.

680
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,780
Why don't you

681
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,460
add it back?

682
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,820
Add it back.

683
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,740
Speed it up.

684
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:14,740
Ms. Jian,

685
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,900
how come the guy who kept following you around

686
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,340
hasn't come these days?

687
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,420
What guy followed me around?

688
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,070
The one at the set. The handsome one.

689
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,740
You mean Sheng Yang?

690
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,980
Yes, that's him.

691
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,260
Ms. Jian,

00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,740
our clip for that lipstick

693
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,340
got a lot of likes online.

694
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,380
Let me show you.

695
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:49,510
Look.

697
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,780
Different ways of living.

works so hard,

702
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,739
not just to conform to society

703
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,540
and marry the so-called Mr. Right.

704
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,900
It's hand-ground coffee.

705
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,699
Mr. Fang.

706
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:24,020
I remember you didn’t like sour drinks last time,

707
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,420
right?

708
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,699
Yes.

709
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,739
The equipment is really professional.

710
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,260
I thank you on behalf of Junjie.

711
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,710
It's my pleasure.

712
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,500
Are you free tonight?

713
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,739
Let's have a meal together

714
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,460
to express my gratitude.

715
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,139
We can talk about your sister too.

716
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,699
If this goes on with Junjie,

717
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,900
we have to make an agreement, right?

718
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:42,780
What do you think?

719
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:44,860
Yes.

720
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:46,900
Okay.

What?

726
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,700
About what you told me in the ice rink last time,

727
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,660
I thought about it after I went back.

728
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,990
It does make sense.

729
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,790
We can't give up on one thing just for another thing.

but happiness is also important, right?

732
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,220
And about Jian Shuang's grades,

733
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,420
I saw it.

734
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,980
It's unbearable, isn't it?

735
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,660
It must've scared you.

736
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,660
No, it's okay.

737
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,820
I think what she needs to adjust

738
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,950
is her learning method.

739
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,060
She needs a good teacher to guide her.

740
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,180
It works out.

741
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,580
I need to tutor Junjie.

742

Why don't you let her join us?

They can help each other.

744

Why are you here?

751
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,940
That's great.

00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,510
It's all thanks to you.

753
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,700
Are you free tonight?

754
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,660
Didn't I say I owe you a meal?

755
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,660
Let's do it today.

756
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,340
What do you think?

757
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,540
No.

758
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,820
I...

759
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,300
I have something to do tonight.

760
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,300
Can we do it another day?

761
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,780
But my mom has already bought the groceries.

762
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,700
Meijuan insisted on

763
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,020
cooking personally

764
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,190
for you.

765
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,580
She prepared eight dishes.

766
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,180
If you don't go,

767
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,060
my dad and I will have leftovers for a week.

768
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,660
It's okay.

769
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,030
If you're busy,

770
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,100
go ahead.

771
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,350
We can meet up next time.

772
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,660
I can cancel the reservation.

773
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,350
I’m really sorry, Mr. Fang.

774
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,700
His mother is an actress in my advertisement.

775
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,380
How about I treat you next time?

776
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:41,900
It's okay.

777
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,620
I'll still treat you next time.

778
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,140
Director Jian.

779
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,060
The client want us to make the subtitles a larger font.

780
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,300
Please come up and take a look.

781
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,340
I'll go up first.

782
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,300
You go ahead.

783
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,380
Let's meet up next time.

784
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,780
I'll wait for you.

785
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,860
You're quite tall.

786
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,900
It's good that your parents are reconciled.

787
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,060
Have your parents cut in line before?

788
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,620
I haven't introduced myself yet.

789
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,630
My name is Fang Mu.

790
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,060
I'm Jian Shuang's teacher.

791
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,060
Hello, Mr. Fang.

792
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,700
My name is Sheng Yang.

793
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,340
How polite.

794
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,100
Well,

795
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,900
you can wait.

796
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,420
I'll come next time.

797
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,500
Luo Meijuan, smile.

798
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,820
Only a genius would think of this idea.

799
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,620
Genius.

800
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,510
You're a genius.

801
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,220
Luo Meijuan,

802
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,100
smile.

803
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,180
It works now?

804
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,580
The camera is broken.

805
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,020
I collected it,

806
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,180
but look at this now.

807
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:43,660
After I

808
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,300
installed the light in,

809
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,700
it's a lamp now.

810
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,340
You keep doing these useless things.

811
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,460
I'm just busy.

812
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,150
If I have the time,

813
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,470
my craftsmanship is definitely a cultural heritage.

814
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,460
Luckily, you are busy.

815
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,660
Otherwise,

816
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,460
who knows what'll happen to this house?

817
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,260
Hello, Yang.

818
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,550
Mom, I invited Director Jian over for dinner today.

819
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,820
You invited Director Jian over to our house for dinner?

820
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,950
Yes.

821
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,100
We're on our way now.

822
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,820
It's late rush hour.

823
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,100
It's late rush hour.

824
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,740
I think we'll arrive in around two hours.

825
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,660
Probably two hours.

826
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,260
Please prepare more dishes.

827
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,780
How many dishes?

828
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,540
Eight dishes.

829
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,220
We need eight dishes

830
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,660
and you're home in two hours.

831
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,860
How many people are coming?

832
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,660
Your entire team?

833
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,100
Hello?

834
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,620
Mom, I...

835
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,460
My signal is bad. I can't hear you.

836
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:38,980
I'm hanging up.

837
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,020
Bye-bye.

838
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,380
How many of you? How many?

839
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,700
They're on the way. Two hours.

840
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,470
Is there anything in our fridge?

841
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,380
There's only cold air in the fridge.

842
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,100
This boy, seriously...

843
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,220
Why didn't he tell us before inviting someone for dinner?

844
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,180
Tell him

845
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,780
we'll go to a restaurant.

846
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,980
The restaurant's atmosphere isn't as good as home.

847
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,460
Home-cooked dinners are the best for treating others.

848
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,140
Yes.

849
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,780
It's the best treatment,

850
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,950
but you have to have hearty dishes.

851
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,580
You need time to prepare the those dishes.

852
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,780
You have nothing right now.

853
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,220
I also want to eat a heartwarming meal at home.

854
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,220
They're already on the way.

855
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,180
You say one less thing,

856
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,340
we have one more minute to prepare.

857
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,180
For Spring Festivals in the past,

858
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,350
I had to make more than ten dishes for our extended family.

859
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,700
I even had to make dumplings,

860
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,540
but I survived.

861
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,350
Today,

862
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,020
let's take it as celebrating the Spring Festival early.

863
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,060
I want to show off my skills.

864
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,740
I must treat Jian well.

865
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,060
You get one call from your son

866
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,220
and you put on your highest courtesy.

867
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,460
Really, he's the emperor and you're the empress dowager.

868
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,670
Your lowly servant accepts the decree.

869
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,660
I did receive a paper.

870
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,860
Hurry up.

871
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,420
I'll get to work now.

872
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,030
Shaolin kungfu.

873
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,790
Come, have a look.

874
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,100
Every ingredient

875
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,540
was made according to Your Highness's request.

876
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,820
I carefully selected it.

877
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,940
That's enough. You're great.

878
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,660
Help me. Hurry up.

879
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,260
How many people are coming?

880
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,860
Eight dishes.

881
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:58,820
Eight people?

882
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,860
Eight people.

883
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:09,820
Alright.

884
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:10,700
Get changed.

885
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,220
Go get changed.

886
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,140
Why?

887
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,020
They're here.

888
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,510
Hurry up.

889
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,900
Why should I change?

890
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:16,980
Okay.

891
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,460
Change it.

892
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,340
Why don't you tell your parents

893
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,060
to start eating first after they're done cooking?

894
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:40,990
It's too late.

895
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,980
It's okay. They said they would wait for you.
