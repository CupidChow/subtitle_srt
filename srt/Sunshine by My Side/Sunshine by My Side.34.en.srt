1
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,680
She's here. She's here.

2
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,000
Who are you mad at? I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,840
My dad...

4
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,280
My dad...

5
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,750
doesn't want a heart bypass surgery.

6
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,640
He's making a fuss at home.

7
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,400
I won't invite you in.

8
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,000
Sister, how about we find a place to sit?

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,560
No, no.

10
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,640
I...

11
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,680
Just a few words.

12
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,750
I'll leave after I finish.

13
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,640
Big surgery.

14
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,000
Simple Bing.

15
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,680
From now on,

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,960
don't call me Sister Luo anymore.

17
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,160
It sounds awkward.

18
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Yangyang

19
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,840
He hasn't come back for a month

20
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,800
I kicked him out

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,800
Yangyang

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,240
has always been very sensitive

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,440
I

24
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,560
I'm afraid he'll be frustrated here.

25
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm afraid his future relationship will be ruined.

26
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,880
I wanted him to give up.

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,600
But I didn't expect

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,400
this kid is so stubborn.

29
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,400
He is stubborn.

30
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,600
He was kicked out without telling me.

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,600
Do you want to know how I feel about this?

32
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,840
I'm really angry.

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,600
not because

34
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,720
I'm angry because you're with Yangyang

35
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
because

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,440
I treat you as my best friend

37
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,720
and sisters.

38
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,400
I'll tell you everything honestly.

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,000
I won't hide anything from you.

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,080
And you?

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,840
You hid such a big thing from me.

42
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
You think I'm a fool?

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,120
Simple Bing.

44
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,560
I don't know much.

45
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,440
I just think that life is not an idol drama.

46
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,070
I'm not the evil mother-in-law in a drama.

47
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,840
I just want to ask you

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,240
Why can't you

49
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,160
why can't you find someone

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,070
who is similar to you in all aspects?

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,720
Luo.

52
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,840
Actually,

53
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,680
plan to start a new relationship

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,400
to start a new relationship.

55
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,960
Shengyang

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,400
is because of

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,840
I shot Mr. Sheng's commercial,

58
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,520
he will remember me.

59
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,160
He thinks

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,800
I brought light to his life.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,880
I didn't expect

62
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,280
that we would meet after more than ten years.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,840
I also think it's fate.

64
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,200
He always

65
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,480
firmly believe that this person is me.

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,480
He keeps showing up in my life.

67
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,800
in my life.

68
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,480
We're just trying.

69
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,720
Dating?

70
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,160
I think I understand what you mean.

71
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,280
Yes.

72
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,280
Shengyang.

73
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,480
should date.

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,920
Although we don't have

75
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,840
have much time

76
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,000
to each other.

77
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,920
Let's meet occasionally.

78
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
We have to make time.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,480
She's busy, so am I.

80
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,150
But

81
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,280
this is what I've always wanted.

82
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
Respect each other.

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,800
and be independent.

84
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,150
and be independent.

85
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Cherish every second

86
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,240
every minute and every second we are together.

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,680
I'm not here to persuade you.

88
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,160
As an elder,

89
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
I should

90
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,040
respect your relationship.

91
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,800
But

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,800
I just want to see

93
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,160
if you are determined.

94
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,600
With your enthusiasm,

95
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,480
even eight cows can't break you apart.

96
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,240
I know.

97
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,480
But...

98
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,160
regardless of age or economic,

99
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,840
you are indeed

100
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,000
between you two.

101
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,600
There must be a lot of difficulties ahead of you.

102
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,800
You can only

103
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,920
can be together

104
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,240
can we be together.

105
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,120
If one of you

106
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,150
If one of you shrink or hesitate,

107
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,000
to the other person,

108
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
to another person.

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,720
As Shengyang’s mother,

110
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,600
I’m afraid my son will be hurt.

111
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
But through this period of time,

112
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,680
my son is not a bad guy.

113
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,120
He's working hard.

114
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,240
He's planning your future.

115
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,840
It's not just a joke.

116
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,240
He's really doing it.

117
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,480
If you're not that determined,

118
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,360
you should tell him as soon as possible.

119
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,480
if you're really determined,

120
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,720
then

121
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,480
As Yangyang's mother,

122
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
I will bless you.

123
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,280
So,

124
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,480
What do you think?

125
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,600
My opinion is...

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,120
you've thought it through.

127
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,680
there's no need for you to ask my opinion.

128
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,480
It's okay. Don't worry.

129
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,680
I'll take care of your mom.

130
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,150
Yangyang.

131
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,600
It's big.

132
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,600
Yes.

133
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,560
It's 26 years old. Of course it's big.

134
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,680
Okay.

135
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,360
Let's eat something.

136
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,120
Help yourself.

137
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,600
Okay.

138
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,600
I miss the smell at home.

139
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,150
Really?

140
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,480
Come on.

141
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,240
This is just ready. Look at this.

142
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,240
Dad.

143
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,920
Where are the chopsticks?

144
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,240
I'm always like this

145
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,360
I either forgot the spoon or forgot the chopsticks.

146
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,280
I can't leave Meijuan.

147
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,800
Come on.

148
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,480
Here.

149
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,120
Thank you, dad.

150
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,720
Try the taste at home.

151
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
You made all these

152
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,240
I can't cook.

153
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,120
But I can still cook.

154
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,600
Okay?

155
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,920
Sister.

156
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
I'm a woman

157
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,480
who has experienced marriage and love.

158
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,720
I don't know

159
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,040
what your determination and determination are.

160
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,280
A young man

161
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,360
fell in love with

162
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,240
a woman ten years older than him.

163
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,720
There might be only one reason.

164
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
But a woman

165
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,480
should decide

166
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,360
to date

167
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,240
than myself.

168
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,040
need a lot of reasons.

169
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,840
Shengyang is good.

170
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,160
It’s hard for me

171
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,600
to make this decision.

172
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,360
But no matter

173
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,400
between us,

174
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,920
I won’t hurt Shengyang.

175
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,720
Don’t worry.

176
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
If you say so,

177
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,560
As a mother,

178
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,720
I

179
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,600
a little worried.

180
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,440
But as a woman,

181
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,200
I seem to know what you're talking about.

182
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,960
Does Shengyang know

183
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,240
Does Shengyang know?

184
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,000
No.

185
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,640
Can you

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,720
by yourself?

187
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,240
Sure.

188
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,520
I hired a nanny and a nurse.

189
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,360
She's not one of us.

190
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,320
It's not that detailed.

191
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,720
I think you should tell Shengyang.

192
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,360
No.

193
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,200
No need

194
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,240
Yangyang has grown up.

195
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,840
He should learn how to take care of the elderly.

196
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,600
I really

197
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,640
to take care of the elderly.

198
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,600
to take care of the elderly.

199
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,480
You're welcome.

200
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,480
I'm leaving.

201
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,520
Let me give you a ride.

202
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,000
No need.

203
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,480
He needs someone to take care of him.

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,840
Go in.

205
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,480
Okay, Dad, don't see me off.

206
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,520
I'll come back often.

207
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:35,880
Okay.

208
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,520
Go in.

209
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,240
Go in.

210
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,120
Okay, go home often.

211
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,240
Mom.

212
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,080
The leftovers at home.

213
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,080
my dad and I

214
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,320
were all eliminated.

215
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,600
Everything was wiped out.

216
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,000
And

217
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,640
I bought some ribs and shrimps

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,840
I put them in the fridge.

219
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,600
Don't be reluctant to eat it.

220
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,240
It's only been a few months.

221
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,880
Let's do it tomorrow.

222
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,840
And

223
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,960
the frozen dumplings in your fridge

224
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,000
have expired.

225
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,000
I threw them away.

226
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,440
Don't buy things that are about to expire.

227
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,600
It's bad for your health.

228
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,480
You...

229
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,720
If you have to buy it,

230
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,600
you can ask me to come back and help you destroy it.

231
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,760
I have to do it.

232
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,080
Can't you come back by yourself?

233
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,200
You'll forget your mother after you get married.

234
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,600
It's only been a few minutes.

235
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,240
It's not that fast to visit someone.

236
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,760
Mom.

237
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,120
You know I'm your mother.

238
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,760
Mom.

239
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,840
Then...

240
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,000
I will

241
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,200
go home often.

242
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,840
Meijuan.

243
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,600
I'll be back tonight.

244
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,120
Okay, Meijuan?

245
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,440
Who cares?

246
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,840
I do.

247
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,960
Later,

248
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,520
If you have time,

249
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,720
go to Simbing's house.

250
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,360
To her house.

251
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,080
Just do as I say.

252
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
You said it.

253
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,720
I'll be back tonight.

254
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,720
Kan Zhong De.

255
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Time to eat.

256
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Kan Zhong De.

257
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,720
Where are you going?

258
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Kan Zhong De.

259
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,000
Where are you going?

260
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,000
Kan Zhong De, stop!

261
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,240
Kan Zhong De, why are you so troublesome?

262
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,000
Move!

263
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,840
Why did you stop me?

264
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,720
Go back.

265
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,360
I have an appointment.

266
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,240
I won't eat

267
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,440
I won't eat it.

268
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,360
You don't even eat pigs.

269
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,000
Pour it away.

270
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,480
Can you lower your voice?

271
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,640
Don't disturb my neighbor.

272
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,240
Who are you meeting?

273
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,840
Who came to see you these days?

274
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,000
No one asked me out.

275
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,720
Can't I eat alone?

276
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,440
I want to eat hot pot.

277
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
What hot pot?

278
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,880
Do you have money?

279
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,080
I have a phone number.

280
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,000
I just need to call Young Master.

281
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,600
he’ll come to check out.

282
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,480
Believe it or not,

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,080
you dare to call him?

284
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,480
Your stupid phone

285
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,840
called me when you got into trouble.

286
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,640
Can you stop causing me trouble?

287
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,640
She won't let her father eat braised pork.

288
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,440
and doesn't allow her father to go out to meet friends.

289
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,880
He is your father.

290
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,440
I'll help you get him back.

291
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,120
Stop chasing.

292
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,000
Do whatever you want.

293
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,880
It's not about your dad.

294
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,480
Why didn't you tell me?

295
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,880
Why should I?

296
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
You didn't tell me

297
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,720
when you got kicked out from home.

298
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,640
Don't worry.

299
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,840
My problem has been solved.

300
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,720
Go home.

301
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,440
Did you quarrel with your dad?

302
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,480
How can you talk to your dad like that?

303
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,360
What do you know?

304
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,840
Are you not close?

305
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,320
But why can't you talk nicely?

306
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,080
He's your dad.

307
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,440
Stop lecturing me here.

308
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,320
You're so annoying.

309
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,640
No.

310
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,360
You can tell me.

311
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,960
We face it together.

312
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,840
I'll be with you.

313
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,480
OK?

314
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,960
Shengyang, you can’t help me.

315
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,640
I want to handle it myself.

316
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,640
Let's talk after I'm done.

317
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,720
If you don't tell me,

318
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,840
if you didn’t tell me?

319
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,440
Simple Bing.

320
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,600
I told you, you can't help.

321
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,040
I'm sorry.

322
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,320
I don't want to explain anything

323
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,480
to anyone now.

324
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,760
I just want to be alone.

325
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,960
Your mom came to see me.

326
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,840
She didn't say she wanted to separate us.

327
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,600
I told her too.

328
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,120
We're just trying.

329
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,720
We don't know what will happen in the future.

330
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,080
What do you mean?

331
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,000
Why is it a try?

332
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,480
Simple Bing.

333
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,840
Jian Bing, make it clear.

334
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,760
I want this sheep.

335
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,320
Shengyang, you can’t help me.

336
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,000
I want to handle it myself.

337
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,000
If you don't tell me,

338
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,120
if you didn't tell me?

339
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,880
Simple Bing.

340
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,320
I said I want to handle it myself.

341
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,360
We're just trying.

342
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,000
We don't know what will happen in the future.

343
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,480
You're back.

344
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,120
Luo Meijuan slept soundly.

345
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,280
She snored like a nightclub.

346
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,320
You...

347
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,960
We didn't sleep.

348
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,200
have a chat.

349
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,880
I remember when I was young,

350
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,000
Let me tell you.

351
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,880
What's rushing?

352
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,480
I don't know

353
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,480
which two trees on the mountain.

354
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,280
The saw

355
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,240
Dig

356
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,480
Grind

357
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,040
Finally,

358
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,720
it doesn't need a nail

359
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,960
without a drop of glue.

360
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,200
The bite is stuck together.

361
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,880
Two people.

362
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,520
From knowing each other

363
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,640
to adapting to each other,

364
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,480
to the end,

365
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,920
in the end.

366
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,280
It's the same.

367
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,240
About love...

368
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,080
I want to say 4:00 in a simple way.

369
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,920
First,

370
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,160
as long as you are alone,

371
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,320
she's a widow.

372
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,240
About this,

373
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,240
Luo Meijuan agrees.

374
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Second,

375
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,440
as long as you two

376
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,240
truly love each other,

377
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
It has nothing to do with anything else.

378
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,880
That's it.

379
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,800
Luo Meijuan agrees.

380
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,240
The point is

381
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,720
love each other.

382
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,480
You know very well whether you love her or not.

383
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,200
right?

384
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,320
But sometimes

385
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,040
is a little foggy.

386
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,880
It's actually very simple.

387
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,040
When it's late at night,

388
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,160
Think about it.

389
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,920
Is there love

390
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,920
in your eyes.

391
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,560
Everything she did for you

392
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,480
Is there

393
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,720
Is there love?

394
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,160
Yes.

395
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
That's it.

396
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,200
No.

397
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,880
You don't have to believe her if she says she loves you.

398
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,160
Because language is deceiving.

399
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,200
Facing a simple and pure emotion,

400
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,240
all obstacles

401
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,000
are evil.

402
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,480
Never bow to the evil.

403
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
When I chased Luo Meijuan,

404
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,400
I was beaten by boys in their school.

405
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,480
I was beaten by

406
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,280
by the boy next to their school.

407
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,960
He was beaten by a thug in his school.

408
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,920
in their school.

409
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,720
I never hit first

410
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,280
Because you have to pay first.

411
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,160
Where's the money for our first color electricity?

412
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,400
That's how we got it.

413
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,280
Three.

414
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,480
As long as you meet the first and second,

415
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,720
you can move forward bravely.

416
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,560
and walk to the dark.

417
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,720
and hit the south wall,

418
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,720
you don't have to turn back.

419
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,560
As long as you don't forget your original aspirations,

420
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,160
you will

421
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,720
will be together.

422
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,520
Four.

423
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,880
I don't have much emotional experience.

424
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,040
Fourth,

425
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,520
Take your time.

426
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,640
Add more.

427
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,000
Before you go to bed,

428
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,240
soaking your feet in hot water is good for your health.

429
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,440
In the future,

430
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,000
you can also soak with Simple Bing.

431
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,720
Right?

432
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,080
It can stretch your muscles and strengthen your blood.

433
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,280
and promote emotions.

434
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,080
career and emotions

435
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,880
are always annoying.

436
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,920
So you must rest well.

437
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,000
After talking so much,

438
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,720
Anyway,

439
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,960
no matter how this relationship ends,

440
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,800
Keep calm.

441
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,480
Face the normal life.

442
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,320
Do you hear me?

443
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,040
Dad.

444
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,160
Thank you.

445
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,480
Good night.

446
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,400
Coming.

447
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,560
Surprised?

448
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,400
Surprise?

449
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
Did you miss me?

450
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,800
I promise.

451
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,480
I won't ask anything.

452
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,720
I can't help you with anything else.

453
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,400
It's okay to help others.

454
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,240
The studio is on track anyway.

455
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,320
Song Chen and Pan Rou can keep an eye on them for me.

456
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,200
I have a lot of time every day.

457
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
I can take care of him for you.

458
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,720
Let me finish.

459
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
I must

460
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,080
pull you out

461
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,000
from this negative state.

462
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,160
I don't care.

463
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,800
I'll come here every day anyway.

464
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,040
You can do whatever you want these days.

465
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,960
You can be busy with work.

466
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,880
You can eat and chat with your friends.

467
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,240
Anyway, you can't carry it alone.

468
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
Give me some.

469
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,280
Ice.

470
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,760
I know my ability is limited.

471
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,480
I don't have the right

472
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,480
to lecture about your family.

473
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,880
I can't say anything

474
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,760
that makes people feel uneasy.

475
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,640
What I can do

476
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,240
is to spend all my time

477
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,480
I'm your boyfriend, right?

478
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,040
Well,

479
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,480
your business is mine.

480
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,200
If you are unhappy,

481
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,000
I have the obligation to make you happy.

482
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,480
If you are too stressed,

483
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,240
I'm responsible

484
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,560
to remove your pressure.

485
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,480
I'll take it.

486
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,480
This is what I should do.

487
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,440
It's also

488
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,160
I want to do for you.

489
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,240
You can't handle him.

490
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,560
Really?

491
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,320
Actually,

492
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,000
taking care of him is not tiring.

493
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,240
The point is he's very good at playing.

494
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,280
He might tell you something.

495
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,320
I dare not leave you alone.

496
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,760
How would I know if I don't try?

497
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,960
Are you going somewhere?

498
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,880
I have a shoot today.

499
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,040
Go back to work.

500
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,560
We can't delay the shooting.

501
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,560
Don't worry.

502
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,760
I'll take care of the family.

503
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,240
Give me your bag.

504
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,480
Be careful on the road. Take care.

505
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,160
Can you really do it?

506
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,720
Don't worry.

507
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,760
I can definitely handle it.

508
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,080
In other words,

509
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,240
if anything happens,

510
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,760
if anything happens.

511
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,720
I'm leaving. I'm late.

512
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,080
Slow down. Calm down.

513
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,040
Call me if anything happens.

514
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,880
Don't worry.

515
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,920
I can handle you.

516
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
You are

517
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,480
the toy boy my daughter raised?

518
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,960
It's not easy to be a toy boy now.

519
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,480
There are so many things to prepare

520
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,560
You need to be good at cooking

521
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,240
Did she give you a lot of money?

522
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,720
You're not as good as Xue Yi Ming.

523
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,720
Stop pretending.

524
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,880
My daughter is not here.

525
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,240
Stop pretending.

526
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,760
I promise.

527
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,280
I won't tell on you.

528
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
We...

529
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,480
Just leave me alone.

530
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,480
Wherever I go,

531
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,720
don't follow me.

532
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,400
It's a deal.

533
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,560
You're right.

534
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,080
I did come here for your daughter.

535
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,320
What she cares most now

536
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,240
is you don't make any trouble.

537
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,920
What about me?

538
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,640
to guarantee this.

539
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,520
So,

540
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
you can say whatever you want.

541
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,800
and do whatever you want.

542
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,480
I won't leave you.

543
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,200
If you like a follower by your side,

544
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,720
Make yourself at home.

545
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,280
Don't leave me.

546
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,560
I don't believe it.

547
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,440
Are you crazy?

548
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,560
Did she give you a lot of benefits?

549
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,560
Just do your job.

550
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,480
Stop following me.

551
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,520
Where are you going?

552
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,240
Can't I go back to my room?

553
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,720
Go back to your room.

554
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,160
Of course.

555
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,000
Have a good rest.

556
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,200
Slow down.

557
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,560
Don't touch me.

558
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,560
I'm telling you.

559
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,200
I...

560
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,040
I'll call the police. Do you believe me?

561
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Let me help you.

562
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,080
Slow down.

563
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,440
Come on.

564
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,040
Go.

565
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,720
Okay.

566
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,720
Have a good rest. I won't bother you.

567
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,040
I'll call you when the meal is ready.

568
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,880
Have a good rest.

569
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,240
Time to eat.

570
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,000
It smells so good.

571
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,760
The yam is really bad

572
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,920
Try the tomato eggs

573
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,640
Delicious

574
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,800
The tomatoes are sweet.

575
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Try the onions

576
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,720
Delicious

577
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,880
There's really no meat at all.

578
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,400
At least

579
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,520
a salted duck egg.

580
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,000
Will you cook tonight?

581
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,440
Do you know how to cook

582
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,040
Pork with plum cabbage.

583
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,400
Spicy chicken.

584
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,000
Forget it.

585
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,200
Don’t waste time.

586
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,520
She won’t like you.

587
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,000
There's no end between you and her.

588
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,000
It won't end.

589
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,200
Don't hate me so much.

590
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,320
Buy some good meat.

591
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,520
Time to eat.

592
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,480
There's pickled pork.

593
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
The meat smells so good.

594
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,240
Try it while it's hot.

595
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,680
How is it?

596
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,200
Great!

597
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,080
Not bad, right?

598
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,280
You're better than Xue Yiming.

599
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,720
I'm a good cook.

600
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,280
The atmosphere is very harmonious.

601
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,200
What should we eat?

602
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,720
I'll give it to Mr. Bai.

603
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,480
I asked him to make it.

604
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,040
I like it. How is it?

605
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,760
Of course you like it.

606
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,960
It's oily.

607
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,400
He's going to have surgery.

608
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,920
He can't eat oily food.

609
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,720
I'll give you the recipe tomorrow.

610
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,760
Leave her alone.

611
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,960
I got scolded because of you.

612
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,640
You're getting surgery.

613
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,960
Eat less.

614
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,760
It won't kill you.

615
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,920
It's finished.

616
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,440
You really did a good job.

617
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,160
Try it.

618
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Try the chestnuts.

619
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,640
Not bad.

620
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,000
Okay.

621
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,240
Chestnuts.

622
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,680
It's useless to do so many tricks.

623
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,640
She won't like you.

624
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,920
She won't like you.

625
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,640
It's quite big.

626
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,520
I like it.

627
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,320
Who is it?

628
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,880
Look.

629
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,320
What's wrong?

630
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,240
Come on.

631
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,640
Look.

632
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,320
It's so cold.

633
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,680
Aren't you cold wearing so little?

634
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,080
Your heart rate is so fast.

635
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,960
You can't look at these.

636
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,000
You can't read it.

637
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,400
Don't read too many magazines.

638
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,440
Alright, I'll read you the newspaper.

639
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,320
The world in the eyes of female artists.

640
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,480
That's not bad.

641
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,640
I want you to know more about your daughter.

642
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,160
Fashion vanguard, post-80s.

643
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,320
Post-80s.

644
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,160
See?

645
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,160
It's perfect for simple ice.

646
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,320
There are

647
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,240
ten women

648
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,640
Start measuring.

649
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,280
Please be quiet.

650
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,480
Here, take your medicine.

651
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,000
High pressure.

652
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,480
Give it to me.

653
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,240
Give it to me.

654
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,440
Remember, don't stop taking medicine.

655
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,720
Please let me know.

656
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,440
I have good news for you.

657
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,360
I'll see you soon.

658
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,040
Soon.

659
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,760
I'm back.

660
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:55,920
Jian.

661
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,000
Are you asleep?

662
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You didn't eat, right?

663
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,360
I left you some rib soup.

664
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:04,960
It's still hot.

665
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,920
I'll get you some.

666
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,080
I'm not eating.

667
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,440
I've eaten at the set.

668
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,280
Sure.

669
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,960
Jian went to bed so early.

670
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,200
I've been playing all day.

671
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,520
Shengyang, come over if you’re done.

672
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,640
I’m done.

673
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,760
Have some warm water.

674
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,760
Thank you.

675
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,520
Thank you.

676
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,080
What's so hard about it?

677
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,880
I'm very happy

678
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,840
to help you.

679
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,760
Do you still want to know about Kan Chung De?

680
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,640
Yes.

681
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,600
I...

682
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,920
When I was 12,

683
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,760
One day,

684
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,040
In the afternoon,

685
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,360
My stomach hurts.

686
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,000
I asked for leave

687
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,440
and went home to rest.

688
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,480
After I went home,

689
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,480
I saw Kan Zhong De

690
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,640
lying on my parents' bed

691
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,920
with another woman.

692
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,800
Dad.

693
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,520
Ice.

694
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,800
You said no one was home.

695
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,000
I was so scared.

696
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,560
I...

697
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,000
didn't know what to do.

698
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,760
I went to my mom.

699
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,760
Bing.

700
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,440
Why didn't you go to class?

701
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,120
What's wrong?

702
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,000
Did something happen?

703
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,320
Mom.

704
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,400
told my mom

705
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,920
what I saw.

706
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,920
Ever since

707
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,920
that day,

708
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,000
I...

709
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,080
I never saw her happy again.

710
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,320
Maybe when Jian Shuang was in kindergarten,

711
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,760
when Jian Shuang was in kindergarten.

712
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,760
Since then, I hated Kan Zhong De.

713
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,320
If it weren't for him,

714
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,560
my mom wouldn't have left us so early.

715
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,480
Later,

716
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,520
when I grew up,

717
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,400
after

718
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,520
after I got married,

719
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,160
I suddenly realized

720
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,920
there are many secrets

721
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,160
in a grown-up relationship.

722
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,000
I...

723
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,600
I thought maybe my mom

724
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,960
knew about this.

725
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,280
She did it for me and Jian Shuang

726
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,480
for me and Jian Shuang.

727
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,480
That's why

728
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,440
pretend not to see.

729
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,560
Pretend not to know.

730
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,000
So I think

731
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,560
that my mom

732
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,920
because of me.

733
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,760
I don't know why

734
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,360
tell you this.

735
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,200
I didn't tell Xue.

736
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,000
So you must be curious too.

737
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,360
why I am

738
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,760
take care of Kan Chung-de now?

739
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,920
Because

740
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,480
grow up,

741
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,000
I feel

742
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,320
my mom wanted me to do the same.

743
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,320
I...

744
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,000
hate Jian Zhong De anymore.

745
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,400
Just...

746
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,320
hate myself more.

747
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,920
Simple Bing.

748
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,280
Don't blame yourself.

749
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,080
You've done very well.

750
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,760
Whether you were a kid,

751
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,280
and you ten years ago,

752
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,360
or the present you,

753
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,280
or the future you,

754
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,760
In my eyes, you're doing very well.

755
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,960
You're the only one who thinks that.

756
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,320
No way.

757
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,480
So thank you very much.

758
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,640
and very grateful

759
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,760
for showing up in my life.

760
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,960
Because you really lit up my life

761
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,640
like a little sun.

762
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,640
But I'm really sorry.

763
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,320
You showed up

764
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,840
you appeared.

765
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,480
When people walk towards the sun,

766
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,440
there's a shadow behind them.

767
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,280
But that part

768
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,480
is also you.

769
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,320
Fortunately, my name is Shengyang.

770
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,920
It can light up your shadow.

771
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,640
Then you can continue to be the ice from now on.

772
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,640
The little sun will always be with you.

773
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,840
OK?

774
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,120
Okay.

775
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,880
I'll try to walk towards the sunlight.
