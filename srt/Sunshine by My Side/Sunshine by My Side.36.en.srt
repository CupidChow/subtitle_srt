[Episode 36]

4
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,650
Song Chen, hurry up.

5
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,940
What are you dawdling for?

6
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,020
Wait a second.

7
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,250
I...

8
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,850
I decided to tell you something today.

9
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,690
Go ahead.

10
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,810
Actually, I've liked you for a long time.

11
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,330
Today, I decided to

12
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,330
officially confess my love to you.

13
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,460
Pan Rou,

14
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,050
I love you.

15
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,330
Can you be my girlfriend?

16
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,700
Actually, I...

17
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,290
I wasn't asleep last time.

18
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,380
I heard everything that you said

19
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,730
on the bus.

20
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,770
Let's see.

21
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,930
The first time I set up a stall was with you,

22
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,579
the first time I started a business was with you,

23
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,250
and the first time I went to the police station was with you too.

24
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,010
If this continues,

25
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,530
it's just natural that we get married.

26
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,770
Fine.

27
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,530
My first time failing at a confession

28
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,570
is also with you.

29
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,210
Then,

30
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,329
do you accept or not?

31
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,770
What do you think?

32
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,850
If that's the case,

33
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:12,890
does it mean

34
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,970
that we can't go empty-handed later?

35
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,290
Let's go shopping later.

36
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,770
Let's make a toast.

37
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,370
Come on.

38
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,490
Today is our last meal.

39
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,610
A farewell toast to Junjie.

40
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:10,730
Farewell.

41
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,540
Cheers.

42
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,490
Don't drink too much.

43
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,490
It's the thought that counts.

44
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,620
Let me say something.

45
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,500
Our captain

46
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,220
is leaving soon

47
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,530
and my leg is injured too.

48
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,260
This team

49
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,700
depends on all of you now.

50
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,970
Next time you play,

51
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,930
I'll go down there and cheer for you all.

52
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,170
You have to play well. Don't embarrass me.

53
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,020
I just hope

54
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,610
that you all can put down your work

55
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,659
at a phone call in the future

56
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,930
and come back

57
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,690
together.

58
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,980
It's a deal, okay?

59
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,770
Deal.

60
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,210
Deal.

61
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,370
Why are you making it sound so serious?

62
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:52,970
Come on.

63
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,220
I'll drink for Jian Shuang.

64
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,930
Come on.

65
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:56,940
No need, I-

66
00:05:59,290 --> 00:05:59,900
No.

67
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,010
She's a girl.

68
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,610
You can’t take special care of her just because she's a girl.

69
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:04,810
Captain.

70
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:05,490
It’s okay.

71
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,290
This is too obvious.

72
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,300
This is a farewell dinner.

73
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,210
I...

74
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,450
Her leg hasn't recovered yet,

75
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,650
so I'll drink

76
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:15,650
the alcohol for her.

77
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,130
I also want to

78
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,450
toast all of you.

79
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,620
I also want to say something.

80
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,010
I'm not good with words,

81
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,970
but we've been together for such a long time.

82
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,570
Now, it's time to say goodbye.

83
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,610
I really

84
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,370
don't want to leave you all.

85
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,890
I also wish you a successful career

86
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,290
and a bright future.

87
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,530
Come.

88
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:39,850
Come on.

89
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,409
To a successful school life and future.

90
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,210
Come on.

91
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,970
Hao Junjie.

92
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,290
Do you really see us as your friends?

93
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,100
My speech was a bit too formal, right?

94
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:50,810
No.

95
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,970
It has nothing to do with that.

96
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,820
Think again.

97
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,090
You don't know?

98
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,690
Don't move.

99
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,580
What are you two doing?

100
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,610
Why didn’t you tell us you’re dating?

101
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,610
Captain.

102
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,090
No wonder they say

103
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,860
it's the captain who has great achievements,

104
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,610
right?

105
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,010
Yes,

106
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,410
we're dating.

107
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,460
So what?

108
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,010
I didn't have time to tell you.

109
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,610
It's nothing much.

110
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,330
I even thought

111
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,300
that we could take care of Shuang after you left.

112
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,140
There's no need now.

113
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,620
I can take care of her.

114
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,090
Okay.

115
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:23,930
You can take care of her, right?

116
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,300
Come.

117
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,410
Come on.

118
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,620
Come.

119
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,450
I'll take Shuang's drinks today.

120
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,650
I'll drink double.

121
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,700
Our ice hockey team

122
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,409
created a couple after practicing for so long.

123
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,090
It's worth it.

124
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:34,930
Let's drink up.

125
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,530
Today

126
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,290
is our farewell dinner.

127
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,770
I'll also take this opportunity

128
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,290
to officially announce

129
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,330
that Jian Shuang

130
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,010
is my girlfriend.

131
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,290
You're so annoying.

132
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:48,010
Come on.

133
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:48,970
Round of applause!

134
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,570
She's also your sister-in-law.

135
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,770
-Sister-in-law. 
-From now on...

136
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,850
no one is allowed to covet her anymore.

137
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,409
Cheers to our sister-in-law.

138
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:57,650
Here.

139
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,370
Cheers to our sister-in-law.

140
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:58,850
Here.

141
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,020
Come on, Sister-in-law.

142
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,010
Let's eat, my little brothers.

143
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,210
See?

144
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,020
She has a backer now

145
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,260
and our family status is lowered.

146
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,810
Right?

147
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,250
I'll pile up the food

148
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,620
and fatten you up.

149
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,700
Mom, Dad,

150
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
we're back.

151
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,330
You're back?

152
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:20,970
Mr. and Mrs. Sheng.

153
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:21,810
Mr. and Mrs. Sheng.

154
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,850
Come in and sit.

155
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,690
Hurry up.

156
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,050
You two are so experienced.

157
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,930
Welcome, welcome,

158
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,049
the warmest welcome!

159
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,460
Welcome, welcome,

160
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,450
the warmest welcome!

161
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,700
-I missed you.
-I brought you something.

162
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:39,610
You...

163
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,929
Are you trying to turn our house into a supermarket?

164
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,049
I'll put them on the ground.

165
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,820
Eight dishes?

166
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,890
-Eight dishes.
-Of course.

167
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,010
Mr. and Mrs. Sheng,

168
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,220
will you be home on the sixth day of the lunar month?

169
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:50,930
What's up?

170
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,490
We bought a new kitchen hood.

171
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,890
They said they'll come to install it on the sixth.

172
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,490
There's someone at home 24 hours a day.

173
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,250
Our kitchen hood is fine.

174
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,460
Why did you buy a new one?

175
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,690
It's a waste of money.

176
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,130
We just want to feel better

177
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,700
about freeloading dinners in the future.

178
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,340
Besides,

179
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,810
you can't get wool from a bald sheep.

180
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,850
It was Yang who bought it.

181
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:07,890
Mr. Sheng,

182
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,770
don't change things one at a time.

183
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,730
Just give us a new house.

184
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,450
Sure.

185
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,300
I will satisfy whatever needs you have.

186
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,650
The eight dishes are coming up.

187
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,610
Eight dishes?

188
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:16,850
Yes.

189
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,610
Eight dishes.

190
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,290
You should eat more later.

191
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,330
Should I really?

192
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,370
Take your time.

193
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,770
Hello?

194
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,810
Yes.

195
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,450
Go ahead.

196
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,090
No.

197
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,700
What's wrong?

198
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,770
What happened?

199
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,420
Congratulations, Sheng Yang.

200
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,090
The public service ad from Moses has been nominated.

201
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,660
I'm officially informing you on behalf of the organizing committee.

202
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,940
Thank you.

203
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,380
In addition,

204
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,610
I have a new project that I'd like to work on with Director Jian Bing.

205
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,050
Help me arrange a meeting with her,

206
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:47,650
okay?

207
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,220
Sure.

208
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,890
Go and ask later.

209
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,970
I got it.

210
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:50,890
Thank you.

211
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:52,770
Bye.

212
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,300
Who was it?

213
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,420
Mr. Yu.

214
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,100
What happened?

215
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,130
He rejected us?

216
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,130
Spill it.

217
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,340
He said

218
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,260
that our work

219
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,610
has been nominated!

220
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,340
Really?

221
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,180
Yes.

222
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,210
Why did you act like that?

223
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,690
You should've just said it nicely.

224
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,620
You all are too excited.

225
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,170
Come on, beauty.

226
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,050
-Get me a trivet mat.
-Let me.

227
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,930
Slow down, be careful.

228
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,490
Okay.

229
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,100
I told you so.

230
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,490
Our house is a place of good luck.

231
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,020
There's good news as soon as we're back.

232
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:32,570
Finally,

233
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,770
the most beautiful dish is coming soon.

234
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,490
Hold it up and then it can be served.

235
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,890
With your alcohol tolerance,

236
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,700
I told you not to drink, but you insisted.

237
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,530
I'm telling you,

238
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,170
after I leave,

239
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,770
you're not allowed to drink with anyone,

240
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,530
hear me?

241
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,250
Hao Junjie.

242
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,930
The dorm seems to be closed.

243
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,500
Then I'll bring you to your sister's place.

244
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,300
You're so annoying.

245
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,130
Hao Junjie.

246
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,210
Let me tell you.

247
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,170
I...

248
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,490
I will miss you.

249
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,210
Today,

250
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,570
I'll tell you a secret.

251
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,850
I've never told anyone this before.

252
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,370
You are

253
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,130
the second person

254
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,850
in my life that I like,

255
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,180
other than my sister.

256
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,570
You...

257
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,580
You know?

258
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:18,730
Yes.

259
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,860
What's the point of you knowing?

260
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,650
It's better not to know.

261
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,290
All right, go now.

262
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,900
I'm going back to the dorm.

263
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,540
Bye.

264
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,260
My bag.

265
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,330
Hurry up.

266
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,570
Alright.

267
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,170
Take it.

268
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,220
Take good care of it.

269
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,370
Bye.

270
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,100
Why are you looking at me?

271
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,650
Have you contacted the landlord?

272
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,450
Your parents are waiting for you.

273
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,530
They said

274
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,850
they will pick you up at the airport.

275
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,210
Uncle,

276
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,170
did I do the wrong thing?

277
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,250
It's too late for that now.

278
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,010
You said it all already.

279
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,650
I gave you advice,

280
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,650
but you wouldn't listen.

281
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,010
But it's okay

282
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,490
to make things clear.

283
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,210
What's wrong?

284
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,060
What do you want to say?

285
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,490
Nothing.

286
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,450
All these years,

287
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,810
I've always had a question for you.

288
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:09,690
Go ahead.

289
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,890
Do you truly love music?

290
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,010
What are you trying to say?

291
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,130
If it weren't for them,

292
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,220
I wouldn't have chosen to go abroad at all.

293
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,410
You're about to leave

294
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,610
and you don't want to go anymore?

295
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,450
I'm just saying.

296
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,250
Sit down.

297
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,730
To be honest,

298
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,450
I don't want you to go either,

299
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,140
but everyone has their own path to go down.

300
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,370
Don't be like me.

301
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,490
Back then,

302
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,290
I stayed at this school to teach,

303
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,330
because I knew

304
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,540
that school

305
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,850
gave me a better sense of security than society.

306
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,490
Competing with others?

307
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,730
I'm not good at it at all.

308
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,890
I prefer a stable life.

309
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,050
Is it really that great to fight

310
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,810
for first place for everything?

311
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,540
But you've always been my idol.

312
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,330
Really.

313
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,210
To me,

314
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,370
you are the best teacher.

315
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,900
Enough.

316
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,450
Stop trying to cheer me up.

317
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,610
Tell me.

318
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,050
What do you want to do the most now?

319
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,170
What I want to do the most?

320
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,770
I want to take Jian Shuang

321
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,980
to visit every city in the country,

322
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,970
take her on a motorcycle ride,

323
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,050
go hiking,

324
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:12,810
go camping,

325
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,610
go to the beach,

326
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,250
go to the quietest library

327
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,100
and the liveliest pedestrian street,

328
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,130
or do nothing at all.

329
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,090
We can just sit there

330
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,610
and space out,

331
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,810
just sunbathe,

332
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,330
and watch other people's lives.

333
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:40,780
Uncle,

334
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,010
being the good child in parents' eyes,

335
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,700
in my opinion,

336
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,410
is too tiring.

337
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,410
Then go.

338
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,610
Give yourself a year off

339
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,780
and enjoy yourself before deciding anything.

340
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,420
Who says we must

341
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,010
keep running forward in life?

342
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:04,980
Who says we can't pause?

343
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,930
Pausing

344
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,740
is so we can move forward better.

345
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,089
You only

346
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,290
live once.

347
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,490
This life belongs to you.

348
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,690
You decide.

349
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,010
Don't listen to others.

350
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,700
If my parents knew I had this idea,

351
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,369
they'd definitely go crazy.

352
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,329
So what?

353
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,450
If they get mad,

354
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,060
I'll help you bear the brunt.

355
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,500
I can handle it.

356
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,210
Alright.

357
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,130
I appreciate

358
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,650
your words.

359
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:42,810
I'll wash the dishes

360
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,490
today.

361
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,810
No,

362
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,610
I'll do it.

363
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,500
Why?

364
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,490
You...

365
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,690
You need to let me get used to it.

366
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:56,890
It's settled.

367
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,650
How come half a year ended so quickly?

368
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,850
Aren't you leaving next week?

369
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,050
Instead of postponing it, you're even leaving earlier.

370
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,660
Liar.

371
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,540
My parents

372
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,570
want me to adapt to the language and environment

373
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,700
in advance.

374
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,010
How about I postpone it for two days?

375
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,210
Don't you have anything to say to me?

376
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,570
We're at this point already.

377
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,450
I brought the long-distance relationship manual

378
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,180
[Long Distance Relationship Manual]

379
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,100
that you had me put together.

380
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,210
I'll study it hard there.

381
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,650
I'd rather you call me if you have the time for that,

382
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,660
okay?

383
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:13,970
Of course.

384
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:16,730
What about you?

385
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,450
Do you have anything to tell me?

386
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,290
No.

387
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,530
Anyway,

388
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,010
I don't want you to leave.

389
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:25,700
Fine.

390
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,780
Then, for you,

391
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,090
I won't leave.

392
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,650
Are you kidding me?

393
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,530
We're already here. Hurry up and leave.

394
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,370
Don't they all say

395
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,250
that everything is better abroad?

396
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,370
Even the moon is rounder.

397
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,810
I don't know if the moon overseas is round or not,

398
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,170
but this small face in China is quite round.

399
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,570
You're the one who made me eat a lot.

400
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,650
Hurry and leave.

401
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,410
I don't want to see you anymore.

402
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,220
I'm leaving.

403
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,290
Just go.

404
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,450
I'm seriously leaving.

405
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,660
What?

406
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,090
Do you want to see me cry?

407
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,210
I'm leaving.

408
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,340
Your jacket is dragging on the ground.

409
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,450
Jian Shuang.

410
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:52,850
Here.

411
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,730
Here!

412
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,130
I've decided.

413
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:39,730
I'm not leaving.

414
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,290
A piece of diamond like me

415
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,860
can shine anywhere.

416
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,370
I don't have to go abroad.

417
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,450
Are you staying

418
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,980
for me?

419
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,300
Of course.

420
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,570
I'm staying

421
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:57,930
for our moon.

422
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,410
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

423
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,690
I just

424
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,570
made the decision as I was about to leave.

425
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,050
Hao Junjie, look, I'm crying.

426
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,500
Are you lying to me again?

427
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,890
Hurry and leave. You're going to be late.

428
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,570
I'm not lying. I'm telling the truth this time.

429
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,570
I'm not leaving.

430
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,060
Let's go get my luggage now.

431
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,290
Saving starts from the basics.

432
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,810
I spent my precious childhood

433
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,890
in my hometown

434
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,970
with my grandpa, Yaosheng.

435
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,540
The simple life in the countryside

436
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,970
and the teachings of the elders

437
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,450
affected my entire life.

438
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,090
My grandpa's grey sculpture art

439
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,130
planted the seed of art

440
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,940
in my young heart.

441
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,650
His thriftiness

442
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,930
also helped me become thrifty.

443
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,180
The windows of my ancestral home

444
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,170
have gray sculpture decorations made by my grandpa.

445
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,290
Diligence can compensate for what one lacks.

446
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,610
Frugality can support integrity.

447
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,290
Mr. Fang.

448
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,330
Sir,

449
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,690
excuse me.

450
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,370
Is Zone B 302 here?

451
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,100
This is Zone A. You've come to the wrong place.

452
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:31,980
Are you here for class?

453
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,530
I'm here to teach.

454
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,770
Hello, my name is Gao Yitong.

455
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,690
Are you the new teacher, Ms. Gao?

456
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,890
We are in the same department. My name is Fang Mu.

457
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,370
Mr. Fang?

458
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,650
Nice to meet you.

459
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,890
I've heard great things about you.

460
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:42,460
Really?

461
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,570
You flatter me.

462
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,730
How about I take you to the room?

463
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:46,370
It's this way.

464
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,210
Thank you.

465
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,010
It's okay.

466
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,500
Ms. Gao, where did you graduate from?

467
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,450
The Shanghai Conservatory of Music.

468
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,490
The Shanghai Conservatory of Music?

469
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,570
Hello, Mr. Fang.

470
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,410
Shanghai is a great place,

471
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,130
but Shanghai cuisine is so sweet.

472
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,170
Are you accustomed to the food here?

473
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,580
I'm not used to it.

474
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,970
It's too spicy.

475
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,050
I know a good Shanghai restaurant.

476
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:05,890
I can take you there sometime.

477
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,060
Sure.

478
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,210
Let's add each other on WeChat.

479
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,050
Okay.

480
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,740
Coming.

481
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,580
Whose pretty girlfriend is this?

482
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,010
Do you miss me?

483
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,370
I want to ask you

484
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,410
a serious question.

485
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,930
Are you hiding something from me lately?

486
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,820
No.

487
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,250
Let me tell you.

488
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,850
Today is the best time for you to confess.

489
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,410
There's really nothing.

490
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:16,530
No.

491
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,610
Besides,

492
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,340
with my personality,

493
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,620
I wouldn't dare to hide anything from you.

494
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,290
Fine.

495
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,130
I want to ask you something.

496
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,180
I've been working with a visuals team recently.

497
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,930
The leader of this team

498
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:31,810
is very mysterious.

499
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,370
We've worked together on two projects and I still haven't seem him yet.

500
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,010
Apparently he's been on business trips all year.

501
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,770
Have you heard of this team?

502
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,130
So mysterious.

503
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:42,660
Well,

504
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,740
he sounds like a big shot.

505
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,690
How would I know him?

506
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,100
A big shot?

507
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,850
You're a big shot?

508
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,410
Wait.

509
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,210
How did you find out?

510
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,730
I found out

511
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,690
when that big guy came for the interview.

512
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,410
Did you teach him to say those things?

513
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,620
It sounded familiar.

514
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,890
I knew that he was unreliable.

515
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,730
Besides,

516
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,300
I obviously recognize

517
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,490
your art style.

518
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:07,450
Then,

519
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,700
I'll confess.

520
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,980
I'll confess everything,

521
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,370
but don't be angry.

522
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,700
I

523
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,330
just wanted to help you,

524
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,010
but with your personality,

525
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,130
if I told you directly,

526
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,810
you would never agree to it.

527
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,690
So,

528
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,340
I came up with this idea.

529
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,770
It's not my fault. Blame that big guy.

530
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,530
You've watched too many idol dramas.

531
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,210
Yes.

532
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:29,770

I'm not the star.

It doesn't matter what I wear.

539

There are so many cameras too.

Compose yourself.

Lift your head.

Look ahead with your nose.

547

Don't act like it's your first time here.

It's my first time.

549
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,380
Lower your head a little.

550

I knew you'd be unreliable,

551

552
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,010
how could you be this unreliable?

553
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,210
Why did you come in this outfit?

554
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,130
It doesn't match with mine at all.

00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,970
good afternoon.

575
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,980
Good afternoon, everyone.

576
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,370
Welcome to the 19th

577
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,770
First Youth Advertising Competition.

578
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:14,700
It's an honor

579
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,130
to share this wonderful moment with everyone.

580
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,610
How about this one?

581
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,410
Pretty, right?

582
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,340
Nice figure.

583
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,330
Yes.

584
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,860
This one is good too.

585
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,650
She looks cheery

586
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:28,610
and sexy too.

587
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:28,980
Look.

588
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,730
Exactly.

589
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,330
She looks like me when I was young.

590
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:33,820
This one is awesome.

591
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,490
This one?

592
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,730
She graduated from a top school.

593
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,450
Her annual salary is over 300,000 yuan.

594
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,090
Over 300,000?

595
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,570
Really?

596
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,690
Exactly.

597
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:42,970
Don't you worry

598
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,370
that your Yang isn't good enough for her.

599
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,010
Our Yang is a boss now.

600
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,890
Aren't there many girls

601
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,060
chasing after him now?

602
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,930
Yes, indeed,

603
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,130
but there aren't that many.

604
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,250
Young people nowadays

605
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,820
can't just focus on work.

606
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,490
Yes.

607
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,410
He's almost 30 years old, right?

608
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:01,940
It's time to get married.

609
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,690
That's why I'm worried too.

610
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:04,930
Exactly.

611
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,050
I carefully selected these for you.

612
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,450
Let Yang take a good look

613
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,090
and tell me which one he likes.

614
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,130
Leave it to me.

615
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,250
I don't think he'll like anyone.

616
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,820
Because you see,

617
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,450
they all look more or less the same.

618
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,420
How are they the same?

619
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,490
Why don't you put on your glasses and take a good look?

620
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:23,690
Well...

621
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,090
Yang

622
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,130
has a girlfriend now.

623
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,890
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

624
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,930
I wasted my time here.

625
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,330
You didn't ask me.

626
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,580
You just told me to look at the photos.

627
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,410
Of course.

628
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,530
I have too much time on my hands.

629
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,530
By the way,

630
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,770
how old

631
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:46,730
is Yang's girlfriend?

632
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:47,780
What's her job?

633
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,930
Have you seen her before?

634
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,860
Do you like her?

635
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,530
It doesn't matter

636
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,530
if I like her or not.

637
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,050
How can it not matter?

638
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,690
How is she?

639
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,650
How is she?

640
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,180
Well,

641
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,530
there will be an ad award ceremony

642
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,130
on TV in a bit.

643
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,060
Yang and his girlfriend

644
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,780
will appear on TV.

645
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,020
That's amazing.

646
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,050
Let's watch it together.

647
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:12,450
Yes.

648
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,530
You can tell me what you think too.

649
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,450
Sure, no problem.

650
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,330
Nothing escapes

651
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,300
my eye.

652
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,420
It's almost time.

653
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,010
It's time.

654
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,170
[The 19th Onetime Youth Advertising Production Competition 
Awards Ceremony]

655
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:24,540
Next,

656
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,770
please turn to the big screen.

657
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,260
I can see that this is a big competition.

658
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,210
This is the award ceremony,

659
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,260
not a competition.

660
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,010
Now, I will announce

661
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,410
the winner of this year's Best Production Award is...

662
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,320
[Winning Team: Moses Advertisement Design Studio]
[Winner: Jian Bing]

663
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,340
Director Jian Bing

664
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,690
from Jian Yi Advertisement Studio

665
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,660
and

666
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,700
Moses Advertisement.

667
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,890
Let's welcome Director Jian Bing onstage

668
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:57,850
to receive the award.

669
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:58,940
Round of applause.

670
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,650
Jian Bing.

671
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,930
Let's welcome the award presenter.

672
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,890
Who is this?

673
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:08,620
Look.

674
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:09,690
It's her,

675
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,340
my daughter-in-law.

676
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,420
Really?

677
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,380
Yang is quite good at finding a girlfriend.

678
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,290
She looks like a superstar.

679
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:19,610
Exactly.

680
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,290
She's not young though, right?

681
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,170
Yang,

682
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,210
let me salute you.

683
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:25,050
It's okay.

684
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,060
Stop nagging.

685
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,100
Can we listen to her speech now?

686
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,449
Okay, fine.

687
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:48,980
Thank you.

688
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,770
This award truly means a lot

689
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,929
to us.

690
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,770
Jian Yi Advertisement Studio

691
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,140
went through a lot last year.

692
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,900
First, thank you to the organizer

693
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,380
for giving us this award.

694
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,370
Thank you.

695
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,370
Thank you.

696
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,370
I also want to thank

697
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,850
my good partner

698
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,530
and best friend,

699
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,060
Liang Shanshan.

700
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,370
Thank you for being my harbor

701
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,530
these past dozen years,

702
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,060
letting me create according to my wishes.

703
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,170
Thank you, Director Xue Yiming,

704
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,410
my teacher who guided me into my career.

705
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,380
Xue,

706
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,410
you've been out finding inspiration for a long while.

707
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,290
It's time to return with your muse now, right?

708
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,690
We need you.

709
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,340
Sorry.

710
00:35:59,340 --> 00:35:59,770
I...

711
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,610
I'm good at filming at the set,

712
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,890
but onstage,

713
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,170
I'm not very good at talking. I don't like talking either.

714
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,890
Today is very different though.

715
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,930
We won a production award.

716
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,340
We are a team.

717
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,410
Last year,

718
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,980
I met a good business partner.

719
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,610
He told me

720
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,970
that he wanted to

721
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:21,850
use designs

722
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,650
to influence some things,

723
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,130
change some people,

724
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,580
and make the world better.

725
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,100
You did it,

726
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,180
because you succeeded in influencing me.

727
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,140
He also said

728
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,860
that the director is the soul of a team,

729
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,930
but the soul and inspiration of this film

730
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,410
all came from him.

731
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,740
So, I don't think

732
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,660
I can accept this award alone.

733
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,890
I want to invite Sheng Yang,

734
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,290
from our co-production team,

735
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,260
to come up and speak.

736
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:58,650
Go.

737
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:00,410
Hurry up.

738
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,570
Don't be nervous. It's okay.

739
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,410
-What should I say? 
-Good luck.

740
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,570
-It's Yang!
-It's Yang!

741
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,130
He's so handsome.

742
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,090
So handsome. Look at him!

743
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:10,930
Right?

744
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,220
He has good genes.

745
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,850
Can you be a bit more composed?

746
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,050
Your award acceptance speech.

747
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,930
You said everything already.

748
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,860
I don't know what to say.

749
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,610
Just say something.

750
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,090
Sorry, everyone.

751
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:28,570
This...

752
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,100
It's really sudden.

753
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,580
Well, I...

754
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,850
I'll also express my gratitude first.

755
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,450
Thank you, Jian Yi Advertisement Studio,

756
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,020
for your support. Thank you.

757
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,370
Even more, I must thank

758
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,610
Moses Advertisement

759
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:45,250
and my good partners,

760
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,130
Song Chen and Pan Rou.

761
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,010
Thank you.

762
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,450
Without you two,

763
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,850
I wouldn't be here today.

764
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:53,850
Thank you.

765
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,210
It was you who told me

766
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:05,930
that a general may have a sword,

767
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,130
but he won't kill flies.

768
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,250
We shouldn't waste our time

769
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,130
and beat ourselves down

770
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,340
on worthless things.

771
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,170
You also told me

772
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,530
that if I had the authority

773
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,170
one day,

774
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,010
I should never bully the young people.

775
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,810
But as a young person,

776
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,970
I also shouldn't flatter others without dignity.

777
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,170
Jian Bing.

778
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,290
What are you doing?

779
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,010
What are they doing?

780
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,810
Meeting you

781
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,930
was the best thing I have ever encountered in my life.

782
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,330
Before,

783
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,970
you compared love

784
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,490
to a marathon.

785
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,530
You said that two people with different speeds

786
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,290
will gradually grow apart.

787
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,220
But I think the more important thing

788
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,810
is that once I start running,

789
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,770
I will never regret it.

790
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,130
Even if I run too slowly,

791
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,610
I get tired,

792
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,530
or I can't even run anymore,

793
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:21,890
I still don't think

794
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,610
that these are reasons to let go.

795
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,130
On this road,

796
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,180
I only have one goal,

797
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,890
which is to run to the end

798
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,330
with you.

799
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,690
If I knew you were going to say these things,

800
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,540
I wouldn't have asked you to come up.

801
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,680
♫I think I'm willing♫

802
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,540

♫Courage is the path of love♫

809
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:41,770
Wow.

810
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,340
These two kids are great.

811
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,250
They're showing public displays of affection

812
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,050
right in front of the audience.

813
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,580
You two are the same.

814
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,250
Are you jealous?

815
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,090
You should be.

816

♫Some people leave early♫

817
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,290
They're great.

♫Someone once defined it♫

819
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,890
Who was the one that opposed it?

820
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,650
Who?

821
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,310
♫Searching♫

822
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,570
Me.

♫Is the only way♫

824
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,690
I did.

825
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,890
Then, you're wrong.

826
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,650
I was wrong.

827
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:15,210
♫Waiting leaves one exhausted♫

828
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,850
It's my fault to have such a good son.

829
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,990
♫But after seeing you again♫

830
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,550
♫I never thought of♫

Come on.

838
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,370
