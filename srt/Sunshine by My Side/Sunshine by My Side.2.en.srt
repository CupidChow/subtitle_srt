1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,750
Welcome.

3
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,030
Miss, table for how many?

4
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,030
One.

5
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,390
Here.

6
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,270
This is our menu.

7
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,390
I'll have the sirloin steak, medium doneness.

8
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,390
And the Chef's salad

9
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,230
with vinaigrette dressing.

10
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,270
As for the dessert...

11
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,670
Forget about

12
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,790
the dessert.

13
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,550
Give me the wine list.

14
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,270
Okay.

15
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,390
One bottle of this.

16
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,390
Thank you.

17
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,350
Please wait a moment.

18
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,590
It's mine.

19
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,230
Bottoms up.

20
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:38,670
Cheers, Shanshan.

21
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,870
That's enough.

22
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,870
Happy?

23
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:42,990
Fine.

24
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,230
Take off the card and change to another one.

25
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,070
Whose turn is it now?

26
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,270
What?

27
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,150
Then I...

28
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,990
How about I give you a question?

29
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,590
Go ahead.

30
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,390
Let me see...

31
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,230
What's going on?

32
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,150
Xue said you're getting a divorce

33
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,350
and you want to split assets with him.

34
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,390
I'm waiting for you at the karaoke.

35
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,950
What happened?

36
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,270
Send me your location.

37
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,270
I'll go find you.

38
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,670
Don't do anything stupid.

39
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:43,870
What's going on?

40
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,790
What happened to you?

41
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,670
Are you okay?

42
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,510
I'm fine.

43
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,390
Don't worry about me.

44
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,270
Don't do anything stupid.

45
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,510
Does drinking count?

46
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,390
Hello?

47
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,790
Don't drink too much.

48
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,070
Bye.

49
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,830
Draw one.

50
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,709
Don't look.

51
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,589
Don't look!

52
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,350
Don't look.

53
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,590
You're cheating.

54
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,910
It's someone else's question.

55
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,150
The two of you are working together.

56
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,470
Sorry, Mr. Zhang.

57
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,710
I…

58
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,390
I'll go out

59
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,110
and get you a pack of cigarettes.

60
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,150
I'll get you a pack of cigars.

61
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,150
A pack of good cigars.

62
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,710
You will?

63
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,270
Wait for a bit.

64
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,030
I'll be back soon.

65
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,470
Okay.

66
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,710
You have to come back, Shanshan.

67
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,470
I will, I will.

68
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,030
Come back.

69
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,990
I'll be back to pay the bill.

70
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,790
See you later.

71
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,110
Here, a toast to you.

72
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,710
Let's see who's next.

73
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,150
Why are you making me drink?

74
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,990
Target him instead.

75
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,350
Don't target me.

76
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,909
Why are you staring at my steak?

77
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,790
Are you hungry?

78
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,830
I didn't touch it.

79
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,590
Eat.

80
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,030
I'm full.

81
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,470
Can you still eat?

82
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,470
Good.

83
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,270
Finish the wine before you go.

84
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,230
Don't waste it.

85
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,270
Good luck.

86
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,590
Madam, you haven't paid yet.

87
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,110
Sir!

88
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,910
What a coincidence.

89
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,230
You also haven't paid yet.

90
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,030
I'll pay for her too.

91
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,670
Okay.

92
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,270
Hello.

93
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,030
It's 1,980 yuan in total.

94
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,590
How much?

95
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,710
1,980 yuan, sir.

96
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,070
Are you sure you want to pay for that lady?

97
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,030
I'm sure.

98
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,790
Please hurry up.

99
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,230
Okay.

100
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,910
Adding your 168 yuan

101
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,550
spaghetti,

102
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,830
it's 2,148 yuan in total.

103
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,670
Okay.

104
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,909
I don't want the receipt.

105
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:34,790
Thank you.

106
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,590
I'm on my way home.

107
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,110
I'm not a child anymore.

108
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,790
No one will rob or abduct me.

109
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,790
Let's talk at the company.

110
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,830
It's hard to explain now.

111
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,110
Okay.

112
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,230
Don't worry.

113
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,590
I'm on my way home.

114
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,630
Luo Meijuan.

115
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,750
Causing trouble at such a critical moment.

116
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,430
You hooligan!

117
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,430
Is...

118
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,710
the standard of hooligans so high nowadays?

119
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,750
Do you

120
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,630
remember me?

121
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,710
Do young kids nowadays

122
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,430
still flirt like this?

123
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,190
We've met before.

124
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,110
We've met before?

125
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,710
Did we meet

126
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,750
under the sunset?

127
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,190
Yes.

128
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,110
Do you remember it now?

129
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,990
Nonsense.

130
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,630
Look at you.

131
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,590
You are so young

132
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,750
and handsome.

133
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,430
Why don't you pick

134
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,470
a younger girl to tease?

135
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,630
I'm not teasing you.

136
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,590
Yes.

137
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,230
If it was ten years ago,

138
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,310
you would have finished teasing by now.

139
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,190
You know that?

140
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,430
Men are all the same.

141
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,350
No matter how old they are,

142
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,990
they like young girls.

143
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,470
Ten years ago, at the bus stop on Jiefang Road...

144
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,590
I have a question.

145
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,230
Do you think I'm pretty?

146
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,710
Did you follow me all the way here

147
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,990
just to have a chat with me?

148
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,870
Let me tell you.

149
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,230
You're in luck today.

150
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,350
People say men

151
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,070
are fickle

152
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,350
and frivolous creatures.

153
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,430
It's all about

154
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,990
animal instincts.

155
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:31,950
Let's

156
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,950
get a room.

157
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,350
I think you misunderstood.

158
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,430
I really have no other intentions.

159
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,990
I...

160
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,590
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,070
I might have mistaken you for someone else.

162
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,590
It's getting late.

163
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,470
Where do you live?

164
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,710
Let me send you home.

165
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,630
You think I'm too old.

166
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,230
Right?

167
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,470
What did I say just now?

168
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,950
I said it right there.

169
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,870
This world

170
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,430
is so unfair.

171
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,470
Slow down.

172
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,510
Slow down.

173
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,390
Be careful.

174
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,350
Come on.

175
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,710
We're almost there.

176
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,310
Be careful.

177
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,750
Hello?

178
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,710
Hello?

179
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,190
Hello?

180
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,870
Dachen.

181
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,870
Help me look for a hotel

182
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,950
near the Shark Restaurant.

183
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:51,710
Hotel?

184
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,750
Who's with you?

185
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,110
What's going on?

186
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,350
A hostel is fine too.

187
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,350
I'll explain it to you later.

188
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,110
Explain it to me now.

189
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,470
Weren't you meeting your mom?

190
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,230
Did she arrange another blind date for you?

191
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,950
Why are you clinging to me?

192
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,350
No.

193
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,110
Cut the crap. Help me check it.

194
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,990
Then you got your date drunk.

195
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,510
Right?

196
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,870
I can't walk anymore.

197
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,870
Yes.

198
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,990
Cut the crap.

199
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,710
Hurry up.

200
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,830
Just tell me if you are coming.

201
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,710
Not bad, Sheng Yang.

202
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,590
I’m drunk.

203
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,710
Explain to me what happened.

204
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,110
I can't explain it to you.

205
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,510
Cut the crap.

206
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:27,990
Bye.

207
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,070
When we're there,

208
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,630
I must sing

209
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,950
my signature song at the karaoke.

210
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,590
Hello.

211
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,870
I've sent it to you.

212
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,990
Okay, I found one, I don't need your help anymore.

213
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,710
Yes.

214
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,870
We're here.

215
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,230
Are we here?

216
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,110
Yes.

217
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,710
This way.

218
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,830
This way.

219
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,110
We're going to sing soon.

220
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,590
Hello.

221
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,350
Hello.

222
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,990
I need a room.

223
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,870
Do you want a big bedroom or a standard room?

224
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,350
Just one lady.

225
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,350
I'm just sending her upstairs.

226
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,590
I want your biggest room.

227
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,110
That's the big bedroom.

228
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,470
Yes.

229
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,870
Big bedroom.

230
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,990
We have more people coming.

231
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,990
By the hour or overnight?

232
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,110
Through the night.

233
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,510
Overnight.

234
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,110
The deposit is 500 and the room fee is 380.

235
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,830
Will it be Alipay or WeChat Wallet?

236
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,950
I'm fine with anything.

237
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,350
Sir,

238
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,990
please leave your contact number.

239
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,430
Here's the receipt.

240
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,710
Thank you.

241
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,830
Why are you paying?

242
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,630
Ask Liang Shanshan to pay later.

243
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,190
I'll ask her to pay.

244
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:02,950
Liang Shanshan will pay the bill.

245
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,830
Okay.

246
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,470
Sorry.

247
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,110
It's okay.

248
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,430
What's the room number?

249
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,830
Is this place new?

250
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,750
I've never been here.

251
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,350
Be careful.

252
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,110
I've never been to this place.

253
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,470
♫It's inevitable to be sad♫

254
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,830
It's late.

255
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,590
Why is no one singing?

256
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,750
Why aren't the other rooms singing?

257
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,510
Go in and sing.

258
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,590
Be careful.

259
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,710
What do you want to sing first?

260
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,830
I must pick my signature song.

261
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,190
Pick a song.

262
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,230
Ask them to serve a dozen bottles of beer first.

263
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,110
They wake up

264
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,990
before the sun is up.

265
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,750
They help us

266
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,510
send away the night.

267
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,110
My name is Sheng Xiangqian.

268
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,870
I'm 45 years old.

269
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,750
I've been working as an environmental guard for 23 years.

270
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,990
Our work is divided into three shifts.

271
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,990
I recently started working the long night shift.

272
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,830
I'm mainly responsible for

273
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,870
the cleanliness of the new West Road.

274
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,710
I go over the area four to five times a day.

275
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,350
On holidays,

276
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,590
I go over the area two more times.

277
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,990
I took this video.

278
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,590
I personally feel

279
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,470
quite proud of this job.

280
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,750
Seeing the environment get better...

281
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,830
It's so well done.

282
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,470
And the roads become cleaner...

283
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,110
To be honest,

284
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,870
I really like this job.

285
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,590
We are city beauticians.

286
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,070
Did you just have a fight?

287
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,510
I hope society will pay more attention and support us.

288
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,750
Why do you kids like to

289
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,350
fight so much?

290
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,710
My sister fights with others every day too.

291
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,470
That brat.

292
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,350
What is he doing?

293
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,990
He won't answer the phone either.

294
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,710
He's usually quiet.

295
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,470
He'd better not show up with a grandson one day.

296
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,950
Let me ask you something.

297
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,710
Have you talked to him about...

298
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,190
About those

299
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,430
special topics between men?

300
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,270
What topics?

301
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,990
Like how to get along with the opposite sex.

302
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,470
How to protect yourself.

303
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,310
How to protect the lady.

304
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,910
You know...

305
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,630
Those

306
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,630
preventive measures.

307
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,430
Have you talked to him about those?

308
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,030
Kids nowadays

309
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,390
know more than us about those.

310
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,710
That's what I'm afraid of.

311
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,750
What good

312
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,270
can the internet teach?

313
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,510
Sheng Yang is a boy.

314
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,510
As his father,

315
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,150
you should educate him.

316
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,190
You should teach him

317
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,550
to be

318
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,950
a responsible man.

319
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,870
He must respect girls outside.

320
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,750
He can't take advantage of others.

321
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,230
If the girl doesn't want to,

322
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,390
he can't force it.

323
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,430
If the relationship isn't certain,

324
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,510
he must be calm about it.

325
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,150
Wait for him to come back.

326
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,710
I'm already here.

327
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,310
Why aren't you here yet?

328
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,710
♫If separation is the final result♫

329
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,470
I'm queueing.

330
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:29,790
Queue...

331
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,070
Your turn.

332
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,470
Go.

333
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,070
Here we are.

334
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,750
Someone's calling you.

335
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,990
Answer it.

336
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,190
I don't think it's a good idea.

337
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,990
I'll answer it then.

338
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,470
Hello?

339
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,310
Hello, Jian Bing.

340
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,710
Why didn't you go home?

341
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,270
Where are you?

342
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,510
Did anything happen?

343
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,310
We're...

344
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,310
Hello, who is it?

345
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,790
Who are you?

346
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,670
Wait, wait.

347
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,990
Hello, who are you?

348
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:30,750
Where...

349
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,150
Where is my friend?

350
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,190
Who are you?

351
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,310
Why do you have my wife's phone with you?

352
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,710
Say something.

353
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:46,950
I'm a passerby.

354
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,790
What about her?

355
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,230
Why didn't she answer the phone?

356
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,390
Let her answer the phone.

357
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,430
Give it to me.

358
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,070
Hello, handsome.

359
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,150
Can you send me your location?

360
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,390
I'll pick her up now.

361
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,990
Who are you?

362
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,190
I'm Liang Shanshan.

363
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:00,870
Take a look.

364
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,270
I'm on the top of her WeChat chat record.

365
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,070
Please wait a moment.

366
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,750
Let me check.

367
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,990
♫You said you've suffered a lot♫

368
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,670
♫You couldn't find someone you could trust♫

369
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:24,310
♫You said you were very depressed♫

370
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:30,470
♫And started to doubt your life♫

371
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:37,150
♫It's inevitable to be sad♫

372
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,230
Your friend is drunk.

373
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,390
I think she needs someone to take care of her.

374
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,230
I have

375
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,790
sent the address to you.

376
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,950
Come here quickly.

377
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,430
Okay, thank you.

378
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,630
We'll be right there.

379
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,150
It's okay.

380
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,430
What do you mean take care of her?

381
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,070
Listen.

382
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,070
There are surveillance cameras everywhere now.

383
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,270
She's married.

384
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,270
Behave yourself.

385
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:03,710
♫It's inevitable to be sad♫

386
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,670
♫When I wake up from every dream♫

387
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,470
You...

388
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,230
It's from your husband.

389
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,510
♫There are things you don't need to ask now♫

390
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:20,150
♫There are people you don't need to wait for♫

391
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,870
Your husband seems to be worried.

392
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,990
Do you want to take the call?

393
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,470
Why is she drunk?

394
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,230
He sent the address.

395
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,710
Here.

396
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,390
Sorry.

397
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,470
You're so funny.

398
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,910
Why is the price tag still on your shirt?

399
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,150
599.

400
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,630
I can afford it.

401
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,030
I'll buy you one.

402
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,230
Sorry.

403
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,910
Thank you. No need.

404
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,710
You're really the most special guy

405
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,710
I've ever met around Liang Shanshan.

406
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,710
Why won't you talk to me?

407
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:23,550
I...

408
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,710
All the boys around her

409
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,270
would circle around me

410
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,310
when they see me

411
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,190
and try to flirt with me.

412
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,790
Why aren't you saying anything?

413
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,630
I...

414
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,070
Help me pick a song.

415
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,030
Pick...

416
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,910
Go ahead.

417
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,950
"I really love you".

418
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,430
You're drunk.

419
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,430
Although I'm not sure

420
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,910
what happened to you today,

421
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,470
you seem to be really sad.

422
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,390
Don't drink so much in the future.

423
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,630
It's bad for your health.

424
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,270
I've sent you friend, Shanshan,

425
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,710
the address of this place.

426
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,710
They'll pick you up soon.

427
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,510
Your husband is coming too.

428
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,550
My name is Sheng Yang.

429
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,790
He's back.

430
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,990
Go take a look.

431
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,710
Phone number!

432
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,390
I didn't give her my number.

433
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,190
What phone number?

434
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,910
Go take a look.

435
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,230
What phone number?

436
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,470
First of all,

437
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,070
it's definitely not the police's number.

438
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,990
How do you know it's not the police?

439
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,270
If it really was the police,

440
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,750
they would have arrested him by now.

441
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,150
I think he smiled briefly too.

442
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,390
Really?

443
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:55,910
I saw it.

444
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,030
Ask him tomorrow.

445
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,270
Let him sleep.

446
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,710
What matters is that

447
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,270
he is back.

448
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:10,870
Yes.

449
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,310
As long as he's back.

450
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,190
We'll ask him tomorrow.

451
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,510
Yes. We'll ask him tomorrow.

452
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,710
Yes, you're right.

453
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,990
It's good that he's back.

454
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,470
Thank goodness he's back.

455
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,710
Mom, can you stop urging me to get married?

456
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,990
So what if I'm renting a house?

457
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,710
All the young adults are renting one.

458
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,070
You're the one who should be embarrassed.

459
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,430
I didn't agree to have dinner.

460
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,750
Besides, the one you introduced to me last time,

461
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,150
your colleague's son.

462
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,070
As soon as we exchanged WeChat contacts,

463
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,270
he demanded a selfie without makeup.

464
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,190
I posted something on my Moments

465
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,310
and he said I was showing off my wealth.

466
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,310
I went out to dance

467
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,510
and he said I didn't love myself.

468
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,510
The one before that,

469
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,430
the guy who studied in the UK.

470
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,790
He looked like a decent person.

471
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,670
But

472
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,990
he said girls shouldn't study

473
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,950
because girls will get married anyway.

474
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:41,550
My goodness.

475
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,270
Why did he bother to study abroad?

476
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,390
To embarrass himself overseas?

477
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,310
I've had enough of the terrible men

478
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,710
you recommended.

479
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,230
Thank you so much.

480
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,190
It was truly something.

481
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,310
This time, I'll make my own choice.

482
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,070
I don't care about this

483
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,910
Sheng Yang or Sheng Niu.

484
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,190
I'll work hard on my internship

485
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,070
and leave.

486
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,910
Stupid company and its

487
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:21,950
stupid access control.

488
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,790
Mom, I was wrong.

489
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,070
Hello.

490
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,310
Are you the new intern today?

491
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,750
Yes, I'm Pan Rou.

492
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,910
This way, please.

493
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,630
Yang.

494
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,510
Goji berry drink.

495
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,910
I made it for you.

496
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:37,950
Tell me

497
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,030
What happened yesterday?

498
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,150
Nothing.

499
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:44,790
Impossible.

500
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,030
Get back to work.

501
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,150
Hurry up.

502
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,790
I told you everything when I used to date.

503
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,790
You think I wanted to know

504
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,070
about your nonsense?

505
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,230
How is her figure?

506
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,710
What about her looks?

507
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,750
Is she the temperamental or cute type?

508
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,070
Actually, I personally like the mature type.

509
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:10,950
You want to know?

510
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,270
Boss's office.

511
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,190
See for yourself.

512
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,630
It's the intern who came today?

513
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,470
What a coincidence.

514
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,510
Office romance is exciting!

515
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,710
Go ahead if you like it.

516
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,510
Let me remind you.

517
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,990
That girl stood me up yesterday.

518
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,470
I waited for two hours

519
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,150
but she never showed up.

520
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,630
Wait, then...

521
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,790
Who went to the hotel

522
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:40,990
with you last night?

523
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,750
Wasn't it her?

524
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,910
What happened?

525
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,990
Tell me.

526
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,510
Are you busy?

527
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,390
Boss, why are you here?

528
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,990
Just give me a call.

529
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:55,710
This is the new intern.

530
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,990
I'm here to ask you to arrange things.

531
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,710
What's your name?

532
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,510
Pan Rou.

533
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,390
Miss Pan.

534
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,070
Boss.

535
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,190
You're so nice to Division Two.

536
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,950
How can the kids focus on work

537
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,510
with such a beauty around?

538
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:10,190
Don't scare the little beauty.

539
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,989
Settle her in and show her around.

540
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:12,350
Okay.

541
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:12,590
Okay?

542
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,110
Okay.

543
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,949
Don't worry.

544
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:16,750
Miss Pan.

545
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,310
Were you born in the 2000s?

546
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,429
Yes, I'm in my third year of college.

547
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,469
I'm not stupid. Don't worry.

548
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,510
Can you drink?

549
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:25,989
Don't be nervous.

550
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,030
Our division has a rule.

551
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,989
We always welcome newcomers with a group meal.

552
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:30,909
Let me show you around.

553
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,150
This way.

554
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:36,989
Miss Pan.

555
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:37,630
This

556
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,310
is our reference room.

557
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,350
You can read and find inspirations here.

558
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:42,989
This is Division One.

559
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:43,909
By the way,

560
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:44,750
you're not allowed to answer calls

561
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,949
in our shared space and zones.

562
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,670
You can answer calls in the call room.

563
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:48,989
The restroom is over there.

564
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,310
That is the changing room.

565
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,389
This is the pantry.

566
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:52,630
Our division, Division Two,

567
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,909
is usually in charge of copywriting and idea-generating.

568
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,389
This is our Division Two.

569
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:00,910
Hello, Senior.

570
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,670
Do you know each other?

571
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,350
We're from the same school.

572
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,830
Team Leader, I won't bother you any further.

573
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,470
My senior can show me around instead.

574
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,470
Sure.

575
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:10,990
Okay.

576
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,590
Sheng Yang.

577
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,670
Show Miss Pan around.

578
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,310
The boss introduced her.

579
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,550
Okay.

580
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,070
Stop grinning.

581
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,830
Work hard.

582
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,310
Hello, Senior.

583
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,190
My name is Pan Rou.

584
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,990
There's an empty seat behind.

585
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:27,670
Have a seat.

586
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,030
Is she really from

587
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,550
our school?

588
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,950
Is she?

589
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:49,670
Senior.

590
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,510
I'm sorry about last night.

591
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,550
My mom is always like that.

592
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,190
It's not the first time.

593
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,190
But I'm really not a big no-show person.

594
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,750
I've accepted your WeChat friend request.

595
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,670
Since we are in the same alumni school...

596
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,590
Missy, Missy.

597
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,070
You have a bright future.

598
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,350
You knew he was your senior,

599
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,150
yet you stood him up.

600
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,070
Do you know how busy Mr. Sheng is?

601
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,310
In order to meet you last night,

602
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,430
he gave up on overtime

603
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,750
and left without completing his work.

604
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,990
Yet you stood him up?

605
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,110
I'm really sorry,

606
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:18,510
Senior.

607
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,070
I've let you down.

608
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,310
Don't talk about personal matters at work.

609
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:25,990
Take these documents

610
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,510
and familiarize yourself with them.

611
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,190
Okay.

612
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,310
I'll definitely read them.

613
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,910
What are these?

614
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,190
Our team's projects.

615
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,990
Remember to memorize our work flow.

616
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,950
After receiving cases,

617
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,070
we'll generate ideas according to the strategy.

618
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,790
The copywriting team is responsible for generating the concept and slogan.

619
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,790
The AE team and PR team hold events together,

620
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,070
and the visuals team is responsible for the final visual presentation.

621
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,390
Regardless of TV advertisements or prints,

622
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,350
we have to make a few different visual proposals

623
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,430
for the client's reference.

624
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,310
After deciding on a proposal,

625
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,750
we'll find relevant graphic designers and photographers.

626
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,470
Lastly, we'll contact the production company and director.

627
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,550
Senior, can you slow down?

628
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,590
Call me Sheng Yang.

629
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,310
Sheng Yang.

630
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,150
How is your health?

631
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,990
My health?

632
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,830
It's pretty good.

633
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,390
That's good.

634
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,990
From today onwards,

635
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,590
you'll have to work overtime and stay up late.

636
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,990
In our industry,

637
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,430
to sum it up,

638
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,510
if you can't finish it during work hours, work overtime.

639
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,790
If you can't finish it during overtime, stay up late.

640
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,470
If you still can't finish it after staying up late,

641
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,910
do it over the weekends.

642
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,950
Your hairline is not bad.

643
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,110
Just in case,

644
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,550
prepare two bottles of anti-hair loss shampoo.

645
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,510
Do you have a boyfriend?

646
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,390
No.

647
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,470
I'm single.

648
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,590
That's good.

649
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,510
I predict that from now on,

650
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,070
you won't have time to date anymore.

651
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,990
In our division,

652
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,150
everyone except Ms. Liu is single.

653
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,070
Even your Senior Song

654
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,790
broke up five times

655
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,390
because of work.

656
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,750
Let me give you another piece of advice.

657
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,790
It's common to be tortured by clients

658
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,950
in this industry.

659
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,470
Don't talk back when you're being scolded.

660
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,790
If you really can't stand it,

661
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,950
you can go outside and yell.

662
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,550
Don't scare her.

663
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,190
It's okay. You don't have to listen to him.

664
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,270
It's just an internship.

665
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,510
There isn't that much requirements.

666
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,590
You just need to be contactable 24 hours a day,

667
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,070
respond to group messages immediately,

668
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,470
and don't stand anyone up.

669
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,070
That's all.

670
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,670
You're quite cruel.

671
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,430
Get back to work.

672
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,790
Hurry up.

673
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,510
Get in.

674
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,590
Morning, Ms. Shan.

675
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,550
Morning.

676
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,150
Did you

677
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,190
wait for me here all night?

678
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,510
That silly boy only sent me a location

679
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,990
but didn't tell me your room number.

680
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,390
I'm really sorry.

681
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,870
I was so drunk, I couldn't check my phone.

682
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,030
Wear your seatbelt.

683
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,110
How did you get here?

684
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:25,990
Do you remember?

685
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,310
No.

686
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,350
I couldn't remember anything.

687
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,670
Why didn't you call me?

688
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,070
I'll call and invite you to my wedding next time.

689
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,790
My life is over.

690
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:38,870
Who was that guy

691
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,750
last night?

692
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:40,870
I don't know.

693
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,310
I picked him up on the way.

694
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,950
Hooligan!

695
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,590
Is...

696
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,990
the standard of hooligans so high nowadays?

697
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:55,990
Let me tell you.

698
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,150
You're in luck today.

699
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,110
Let's go.

700
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,830
Not bad.

701
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:03,830
You've outdone yourself.

702
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,510
I need to call him.

703
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:13,070
Righteous kids like him

704
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,390
are rare these days.

705
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,390
You know what? This kid is very interesting.

706
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,870
When I woke up in the morning,

707
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,990
there was a glass of water by my bed.

708
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,510
He rented a power bank for me

709
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,590
and even charged my phone.

710
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,430
Isn't he nice?

711
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,310
I need to pay him for the room.

712
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,430
How much can a room in this shabby place cost?

713
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,790
If he doesn't even have that much money,

714
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,190
he shouldn't be trying to hit on you.

715
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,990
What if he's a student?

716
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,270
He might be using his living expenses.

717
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,390
A student?

718
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,670
So young?

719
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,790
Did anything happen between you two yesterday?

720
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,070
Would I still call him righteous if something had happened?

721
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,070
I'd call him a righteous man if something happened.

722
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,310
Oh, please.
