[Ward 5, Bed 9]

5
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,060
Hello.

6
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:37,220
Jian Bing.

7
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,060
Are you almost there?

8
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,100
I'm done after one more scene,

9
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,979
and I'll head there.

10
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:42,490
Where am I going?

11
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,979
To the meeting with the client.

12
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,060
What meeting?

13
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,380
Well, about the cabinet advertisement.

14
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,380
Our company will be relying on this advertisement for the second half of the year.

15
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,140
Why did you arrange for a meeting at this hour?

16
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,289
It's a meeting with drinks, right?

17
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,259
I think I'm not going if we have to drink.

18
00:01:59,539 --> 00:01:59,900
Wait.

19
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,660
Why would we drink?

20
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,100
We've already agreed

21
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,420
to have a meeting

22
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,540
in the company today.

23
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,330
The client is coming for you.

24
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,940
You're in charge of this project.

25
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,580
I'm just attending out of courtesy, right?

26
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,660
We agreed last week. Did you forget?

27
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,579
I'm sorry, Xue. I...

28
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,410
I'm caught up with something now.

29
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,860
Can I be a little late?

30
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,420
Please record the meeting for me first.

31
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,020
Hey, Jian Bing.

32
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,290
What's wrong with you now?

33
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:30,660
I...

34
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,579
You don't even want to work now that you're dating.

35
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:35,850
Director Xue.

36
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,900
We are ready and can start filming.

37
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,780
Lin, let's do it like this.

38
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,780
For this scene,

39
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,980
just film according to our storyboard exactly, and it's done.

40
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,700
You are...

41
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,460
Stay focused. Make sure the actors don't exceed their time.

42
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,900
I have to go talk to the client.

43
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,810
Okay. Sure.

44
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,690
Call it a day when you think it's appropriate later.

45
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,820
-Safety first.
-Okay.

46
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,780
Director, your phone.

47
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,260
Bye.

48
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,500
Okay, director.

49
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,020
Is everyone ready?

50
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,580
It's okay.

51
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,380
Go ahead.

52
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,100
I told Junjie and the rest

53
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,250
to not trouble you.

54
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:09,620
No.

55
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,620
Work is important.

56
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,020
No.

57
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:12,980
There's a nurse.

58
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,100
She went for dinner.

59
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,620
I can leave when she comes back.

60
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,010
I'll wait here for you.

61
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,540
If you have time to talk,

62
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,820
you should already be on the way there. Go now.

63
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,140
Then I...

64
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,940
I'll get my bag.

65
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,579
Yes, go.

66
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,980
When the nurse comes back, you...

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,780
-I'll call you anytime.
-can leave.

68
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,290
Don't worry.

69
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:35,860
-Thank you.
-Go.

70
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,579
Thank you so much.

Very Grape Cheezo Boba tea with taro puree.

72
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,700
Lesser sugar and more ice.

73
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,820
Substitute milk foam with ice cream.

74
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,050
Right?

75
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,340
You shouldn't be here.

76
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,180
Go home now.

77
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,980
Why didn't you tell me

78
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,340
when you've come to this stage?

79
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,220
I didn't want you to worry.

80
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,780
Well,

81
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,860
we are two grown men.

82
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,100
We can stay anywhere.

83
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,380
You're a lady.

84
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,060
What's wrong with me being a lady?

85
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,380
I'm afraid you'll suffer along with us.

86
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,860
How do you know I don't want to suffer along with you?

87
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,860
Look at your sad face.

88
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,300
Why can't you tell others

89
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,610
so that we can solve it together?

90
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,500
What we need to solve now

91
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,300
is not

92
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,420
the problem about the work environment.

93
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,370
It's the clients not paying.

94
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,980
I hired the client who didn't pay.

95
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,020
So I feel especially like a failure.

96
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,420
Let me see your phone.

97
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,060
What for?

98
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,340
Let me have a look.

99
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,220
I remember

100
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,140
that these two pages

101
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,180
were previously all girls.

102
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,260
They're all clients now.

103
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,810
Song Chen.

104
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,700
You may not realize it,

105
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,220
but you've changed a lot.

106
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,740
During this period,

107
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,730
you've been online half as frequently as you were before.

108
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,220
This is not failing.

109
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,100
It's called growth.

110
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,140
Although

111
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,500
things are not going well for us lately,

112
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,090
the client not paying

113
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,700
is him being irresponsible.

114
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,900
You shouldn't feel responsible for it.

115
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:27,820
Besides,

116
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,180
it's thanks to you that we could receive this order.

117
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,340
Sheng Yang needs you,

118
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,300
and the studio needs you too.

119
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,460
Previously, I've been thinking

120
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,300
that I'm of no help to you guys

121
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,180
and I'm even a burden.

122
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,700
But I

123
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,500
thought about it again.

124
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,090
I can only work hard

125
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,020
and try my best.

126
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,700
Song Chen.

127
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,420
Do you think I'm important

128
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,300
to the studio?

129
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,300
Yes.

130
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,300
You too.

131
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,740
Sheng Yang is doing his job.

132
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,620
We are also doing our own jobs.

133
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,860
But right now, we mustn't

134
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,260
blame ourselves, mope around

135
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,980
and give up.

136
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,180
Pan Rou is right.

137
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,860
No wonder they always say

138
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,540
that girls mature earlier than boys.

139
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,380
I finally witnessed that today.

140
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,260
Pan Rou is much more composed than us.

141
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,380
I'm quite composed too.

142
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,420
I didn't collapse.

143
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,490
No?

144
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,170
That's good.

145
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,940
Then just be happy

146
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,980
and get back

147
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,140
all the orders that we lost.

148
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,620
The lady is so strong.

149
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,500
As grown men,

150
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,210
we should work harder.

151
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,180
Yes.

152
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,780
Work harder.

153
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:54,780
Come on.

154
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,140
Come on.

155
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,610
Get to work.

156
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,180
Okay.

157
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,580
Don't worry.

158
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,820
I'll look for them.

159
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,300
I'll get back everything we've lost.

160
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:04,900
Okay.

161
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,780
Why is it so sweet?

162
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,300
How is it sweet?

163
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,540
Have another bottle of water.

164
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,580
I'd better go to the restroom first.

165
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,539
Mr. Deng.

166
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,299
Hurry

167
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,500
and go with Mr. Tang.

168
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,179
I know the way.

169
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:38,659
Take care.

170
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,500
This way, please.

171
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,620
What’s wrong with Jian Bing?

172
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,250
Now that she's dating, she doesn't even care about her work.

173
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,980
You sure are a good Chinese ex-husband.

174
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
You don't even know anything.

175
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,540
For the next two days,

176
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,820
we have to more concerned

177
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,900
with the company's work

178
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:54,980
and be more vigilant.

179
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,620
Wait.

180
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,490
What do you mean?

181
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,100
Am I not concerned enough?

182
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,460
After filming just half of my film,

183
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,780
I rushed back to the company.

184
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,100
She's dating outside

185
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,300
and you want me to keep an eye on her work?

186
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,180
Your ex-father-in-law is in the hospital. She can't leave him.

187
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,540
That's what she's been busy with.

188
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,770
Get your facts right and don't spout nonsense.

189
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,820
Jian Zhongde is sick?

190
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,130
It seems quite serious.

191
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,780
She didn't tell me.

192
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,740
Why would she tell you?

193
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,940
You two are divorced.

194
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,980
But you didn't tell me either.

195
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,260
What's the point of telling you?

196
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,860
We can just cover for her.

197
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,980
Now,

198
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,460
the greatest help you can offer her

199
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,700
is to focus on taking care of the company's affairs.

200
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,420
Rest assured.

201
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,420
I'll call her

202
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,740
and tell her not to come.

203
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,340
Hello.

204
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,220
I couldn't even get a taxi.

205
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,020
I'm already taking the subway.

206
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,220
I just entered the subway station.

207
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,300
Okay, I got it.

208
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,180
Well, just don't come over.

209
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,180
He's not being spiteful, trust me.

210
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,340
Can't you talk nicely?

211
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,300
Shanshan is there too.

212
00:09:59,420 --> 00:09:59,940
Yes.

213
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,300
Well, I'm asking you

214
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,250
not to come.

215
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,060
It just means that you shouldn't come.

216
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,460
But if you're already on the subway,

217
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,700
we'll wait for you.

218
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,020
But you don't have to rush.

219
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:08,970
Well,

220
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,700
Shanshan and I are covering for you.

221
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,220
Shanshan is really good at placating the client.

222
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,540
Mr. Tang...

223
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,780
Mr. Tang already forgot

224
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,460
that you're coming.

225
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,610
I'm really sorry.

226
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,730
I was so stressed out by my father's matter

227
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,700
that I completely forgot about the meeting.

228
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,660
Yes.

229
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,020
I know the matter about your father.

230
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,540
-Mr. Tang is back.
-This way, Mr. Tang.

231
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,180
Mr. Tang is back.

232
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,900
Mr. Tang, I'm on the phone with Jian Bing.

233
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,140
Don't worry. I've apologized to Mr. Tang.

234
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,180
She's already o-on the subway.

235
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,020
She'll be here soon.

236
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,900
Sure. Mr. Tang is not an outsider anyway.

237
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,620
We'll have the meeting while waiting for you.

238
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,420
Xue.

239
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,060
Thanks.

240
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,860
Okay, don't worry.

241
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,060
The main thing is, this proposal

242
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,060
was made by Director Jian Bing.

243
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:52,860
Well,

244
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,220
we're discussing her proposal

245
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,770
but she's not here.

246
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,780
It's inappropriate.

247
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,740
Yes.

248
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,650
She's almost here.

249
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,620
Okay.

250
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:32,780
[Sheng Yang: I’m a little busy today. I don't think we can meet.]

251
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:42,280
[Jian Bing: I may not be able to meet you today. I have a meeting in the company.]

252
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,460
[Sheng Yang: It’s okay. I’m busy too.]

253
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,780
[Sheng Yang: And here I was thinking of an excuse to stand you up, but you stood me up first.]

254
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,560
[Jian Bing: Have you been busy all day?]

255
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,520
[Sheng Yang: Yes, I also missed you all day.]

256
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:13,860
[Jian Bing: Looks like you still don’t have enough work. 
(Work hard) (Hug)]

257
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,770
[Sheng Yang: I miss you.]

258
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,980
This is impossible!

259
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,540
Darn fate.

260
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,770
I just said we can't meet.

261
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,020
Ms. Jian.

262
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,540
You're all dressed up and pretty.

263
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,980
Where are you going?

264
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,780
How am I pretty?

265
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,540
I'm disheveled

266
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,700
from all the stress these days.

267
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,980
Why do you smell like smoke?

268
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,860
Where are you going?

269
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,740
I just met a client.

270
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,500
He's a chain-smoker. He's always smoking.

271
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,220
Now, I'm going to...

272
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,540
transfer to Line 2

273
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,700
to meet another client.

274
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,260
Mr. Sheng is so busy.

275
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,300
How many orders have you received?

276
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,010
It's too many that I can't even count them.

277
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,490
You're successful now, aren't you?

278
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,580
I'm still finding my feet.

279
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,740
Fine.

280
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,460
Then work hard to make money

281
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,580
and save up to buy me dinner.

282
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,300
Okay, I'll treat you to something nice.

283
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,620
Have you had dinner?

284
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,940
No.

285
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,010
I knew you didn't eat well.

286
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,420
Here.

287
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,260
Eat it on the way.

288
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,140
Thank you.

289
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,260
Let me recharge.

290
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,940
My girlfriend works so hard and is so pretty.

291
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,540
I have good taste.

292
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,420
That's cringy.

293
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,820
I really want to lean on your shoulder and sleep for a while.

294
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,340
Then sleep.

295
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,460
I wish the next subway

296
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,980
never comes.

297
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,540
Is it here yet?

298
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,090
Not yet.

299
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,700
It went past the stipulated time, so they stopped its operation.

300
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,500
It's coming.

301
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,700
Is the subway here?

302
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,220
Let's hug for a little longer.

303
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,020
Why don't you wait for the next subway?

304
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,380
I can't.

305
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,300
I'm already late.

306
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,820
And I've been so busy

307
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,500
that I forgot that I have a meeting today.

308
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,220
I'm leaving. Bye.

309
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,530
Go on.

310
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,620
Be careful.

311
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,740
Have you eaten?

312
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:05,540
[Jian Bing: Thank you for recharging me. I'm suddenly not tired anymore.
I hope I can recharge longer next time.]

313
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:20,119
[Jian Bing]

314
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,260
That kid Yang is really something.

315
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,140
It only takes a total of four words

316
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,540
to text a "good morning" when he gets up

317
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,500
and a "good night" when he goes to sleep.

318
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,540
It's not even that troublesome.

319
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,530
If he's really that busy, he could just send a heart emoticon.

320
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,700
I've heard nothing from him.

321
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,260
The soup in here is very fresh.

322
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,540
If you don't eat it,

323
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,700
there will be no soup left when it gets cold.

324
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,740
For his entire life,

325
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,540
Yang has never lived on his own before.

326
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,140
Aren't you worried at all?

327
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,380
Has he rented a place?

328
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,580
Is he sleeping well?

329
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,740
Is he eating well?

330
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,140
He must be ordering takeout every day.

331
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,140
It's good enough that he gets to eat takeout food.

332
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,300
What else do you want?

333
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,100
Are you really his mother?

334
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,380
I can't stand it anymore.

335
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,500
Don't you miss your son?

336
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,740
What's there to miss?

337
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,820
Well done.

338
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,380
You nagged about it so much that you chased him away.

339
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,660
That lady is just a little older than him.

340
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,900
What era is it now?

341
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,060
She calls you sister

342
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,570
but you two look like you have a huge age difference.

343
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,540
Isn't it enough as long as he likes her?

344
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,980
Is that enough?

345
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,580
Do you really think

346
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,610
I made things difficult for them

347
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,740
and didn't agree to their relationship

348
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,980
because of their age gap?

349
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
For Yang,

350
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,660
this is a hurdle.

351
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,260
He has to cross this hurdle himself.

352
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,890
If he really wants to be with Jian Bing,

353
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,580
they must advance

354
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,420
and progress together.

355
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,340
What is life experience?

356
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,540
Last time,

357
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,660
when Jian Bing was at our home

358
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,420
and talked about

359
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,340
marathons and sixpences,

360
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,940
I already knew she's extraordinary.

361
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,540
Her understanding of life

362
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,700
and Yang's understanding of life

363
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,980
are not on the same level.

364
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,380
She has already seen the world

365
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,660
that Yang has yet seen.

366
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,100
Well, Yang

367
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,580
has his strengths too.

368
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,810
Otherwise, why would she like him?

369
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,740
Yes.

370
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,820
But it's not enough.

371
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,810
It's a good thing

372
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,620
that Yang ventured out.

373
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,500
If he really makes a name for himself,

374
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,090

00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:46,980
Perfect.

565
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,380
See you later.

566
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,980
See you at our usual place.

567
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,100
Bye.

568
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,100
Girlfriend!

569
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,730
Did you miss me?

570
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,700
Yes.

571
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,380
Here.

572
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,620
I've bought the movie tickets.

573
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,220
It's over three hours.

574
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,660
Then why are we eating?

575
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,140
Of course we need to eat.

576
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,940
You can't starve.

577
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,420
The Sichuan cuisine here is good.

578
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,570
It's quite spicy. You'll like it.

579
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,420
What else?

580
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:43,940
Have a look.

581
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,020
This one.

582
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,660
Okay, that's it for now.

583
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,540
Okay, please wait a moment.

584
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,540
Can you make it quick?

585
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,020
We're in a rush.

586
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,260
I really don't think we can make it.

587
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,260
We can. I'll ask her to hurry up.

588
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,780
I have a good idea.

589
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,220
I think we can go to the cinema

590
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,500
and get some snacks.

591
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,860
Excuse me, we're cancelling our order.

592
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,660
Sorry.

593
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:15,910
Let's go.

594
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,270
[Love 100]

595
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,100
You bought so many snacks.

596
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,100
Is it enough?

597
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,460
What do you mean?

598
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,690
How can we eat so much?

599
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,500
Take your time.

600
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,300
Try the popcorn.

601
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,100
It's sweet.

602
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,500
Try it.

603
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,450
[Song Chen: Yang. The client said he'll arrive early.
I'm not in the office. Can you rush back now?]

604
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,620
What's wrong?

605
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,980
I think I need to go back to the company.

606
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,250
A client of mine that worked with me before

607
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,260
wants to sign a long-term contract with us.

608
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,860
He was supposed to arrive two hours later,

609
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,290
but he suddenly said he's arriving early.

610
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,740
Then go ahead.

611
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,740
It's good that someone wants to sign a long-term contract.

612
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,900
But I want to accompany you.

613
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,860
Kid.

614
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,260
It's more important to do the laborious work when starting a business.

615
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,940
Luckily, you have a girlfriend who knows how to prioritize the big picture.

616
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,500
Well...

617
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,690
The movie is long anyway.

618
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,220
I'll come back after I'm done.

619
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,740
I think I'd be able to watch the end of the movie with you.

620
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,460
No, thanks.

621
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,700
After your work,

622
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,860
go home and accompany your parents.

623
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,220
Didn't I tell you two days ago?

624
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,580
I've been busy lately.

625
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,900
I still have to go back to work at night.

626
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,690
Sorry, girlfriend.

627
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,700
I'm doing the laborious work so I can treat you better.

628
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,180
I believe my girlfriend

629
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,500
will understand that, right?

630
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,980
I understand.

631
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,620
Well,

632
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,820
why don't I just come back to accompany you?

633
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,300
Why don't you just go home?

634
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,420
Okay then, I'll listen to you.

635
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:06,860
Bye.

636
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,620
Give me a call if you miss me.

637
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,540
I'm leaving.

638
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,100
Bye.

639
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,300
Hello, Song Chen.

640
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,100
I’ve signed the contract with the client.

641
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,179
I've also sorted out the materials they asked for.

642
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,100
The documents are on my computer's desktop.

643
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,739
Send it for me when you're free.

644
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,179
Will you go back to the studio for dinner later?

645
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,060
I won't go back for dinner.

646
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,780
I want to go home

647
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,370
and see my parents.

648
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,140
That's good.

649
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,420
It's been many days since you left.

650
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,570
You should go back and see them.

651
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,500
Okay, I'm hanging up.

652
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,420
Dad.

653
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,980
I'm home.

654
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,260
You brat.

655
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,020
What's wrong with you?

656
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,460
You can't change your bad habit, right?

657
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,260
You came back without greeting me

658
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,300
nor did you let me know in advance.

659
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,140
How can I cook eight dishes for you now?

660
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,060
Why are you hitting me as soon as I came back?

661
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,540
These are all leftovers from lunch.

662
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,900
Why didn't you let me know in advance?

663
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,300
I'll cook some dumplings for you later.

664
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:55,980
It's okay.

665
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,740
Don't bother.

666
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,220
Why are you being polite with me?

667
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,090
You brat.

668
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,740
Dad.

669
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,820
Where is my mom?

670
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,340
Is she not in?

671
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,820
She said she'll be back soon.

672
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,380
Make yourself comfortable.

673
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,300
This is your home.

674
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,180
Luo Meijuan.

675
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,210
Your son is back.

676
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,420
I'll meet him first.

677
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:27,700
I think

678
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,180
he can't survive on his own anymore.

679
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:29,740
He wants to...

680
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,090
Who says I can't survive on my own anymore?

681
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,660
This is an out for your mom.

682
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,540
You're still so clueless.

683
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,700
Seriously.

684
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:37,660
You're still young.

685
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,620
-How have you been?
-How have you been?

686
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,460
Look at our chemistry.

687
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:52,420
You've lost weight.

688
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,580
No, I've gained weight.

689
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,340
Feel it.

690
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,500
It's all muscle.

691
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:00,780
Right?

692
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,180
You're living alone outside.

693
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,460
Why did you splurge on gifts?

694
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,020
I didn't splurge.

695
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,260
We don't lack anything at home.

696
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,820
Have a look

697
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,740
at this.

698
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,890
It's an air fryer.

699
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,340
Meijuan loves it the most.

700
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,820
She has been reluctant to buy it,

701
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,380
so I bought it for her.

702
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,300
You're still thinking about this?

703
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,460
Are you taking photos for her again?

704
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,460
-Come on.
-If she...

705
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,220
If she sees this...

706
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:27,660
S-She...

707
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,780
She'll be so happy if she sees this.

708
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,380
Luo Meijuan.

709
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,090
Look, your son bought this for you.

710
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,260
I think

711
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,140
he might be doing quite well.

712
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,380
I don't know if he's just putting up a front.

713
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,580
What do you mean I might be doing quite well?

714
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,420
This is for you.

715
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,060
There's one for me too?

716
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,170
Didn't you say there's discomfort in your cervical spine?

717
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,700
This can help you relieve it.

718
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,980
This must cost a few thousand.

719
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,700
It's not expensive.

720
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,100
Dad.

721
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,020
I also bought some dietary supplements and fruits.

722
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:06,940
Remember to eat them.

723
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,900
Gosh, you're really...

724
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,580
I'm so overwhelmed by this.

725
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,060
Make sure everything's in the picture.

726
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,740
Luo Meijuan.

727
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,140
Your son just came back casually

728
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,820
and he bought so many gifts that it feels like New Year's Day.

729
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,210
It's a party at our house.

730
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,700
Our family of three is only missing you now.

731
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,300
I think your son is doing well.

732
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,220
I guess he doesn't want to come back and live with us anymore.

733
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:42,810
Yang.

734
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,540
You and Jian...

735
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,260
We're

736
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,660
getting along pretty well.

737
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,420
That's good.

738
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,620
That's good.

739
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,170
Okay.

740
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,900
Next Wednesday, right?

741
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,300
No problem.

742
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,450
He's been taking the medicine on time.

743
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,340
I've been keeping an eye on his daily routine too.

744
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,420
I think his blood pressure and heart rate have been normal these days too.

745
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,900
Okay, we'll be there on time next week.

746
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:17,940
Thank you.

747
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,130
Thank you so much.

748
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,060
This wine bottle is empty.

749
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,770
What are you keeping the bottle for?

750
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,180
Are you doing that to tease me?

751
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,660
Jian Zhongde, listen up. Keep your voice down.

752
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,900
You shouldn't be so agitated in your current condition.

753
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,490
I like to shout.

754
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,100
Are you unhappy with that?

755
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,940
If you are, kick me out.

756
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,020
Let me freeze and starve to death on the streets.

757
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:40,940
I promise

758
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,780
I won't say a word about you.

759
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,220
What do you want for dinner?

760
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,610
I want... braised pork with preserved vegetables

761
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,420
and crispy spicy chicken.

762
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:51,980
That's it.

763
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,900
They're too greasy.

764
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,300
I'll order some shrimp with spinach for you.

765
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,860
Then why did you ask me?

766
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,860
Are you teasing me?

767
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,340
How unnecessary.

768
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,660
Did the hospital call you just now?

769
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,900
No.

770
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,140
I'm having the surgery

771
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,100
next Wednesday.

772
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,490
I heard everything.

773
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,100
Then why are you asking?

774
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,780
Didn't you do the same?

775
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
Don't bother.

776
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:27,980
I won't go.

777
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,300
Look at me now.

778
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,660
I can't drink alcohol,

779
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,260
can't eat meat,

780
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,420
and can't smoke.

781
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,980
I'd rather die.

782
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,580
Find me a rope tomorrow.

783
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,060
I'm also telling you that this surgery must be done.

784
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,450
So stop resisting it.

785
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,780
I won't do it. Never!

786
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,820
Can you lower the volume?

787
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,420
Don't forget about my takeout!

788
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,860
Remember what I want to eat!

789
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,380
Braised pork with preserved vegetables and spicy chicken!

790
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,020
If you make me eat just vegetables again, I'll go on a hunger strike!

791
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,460
Jian Bing!

792
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,540
Why did you bring me back?

793
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,220
It’d have been great if you just left me alone to die.

794
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,180
Mrs. Sheng?
