1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,390
We're here.

3
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,270
Be careful.

4
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,630
Thank you, sir.

5
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,030
Thank you, sir.

6
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,630
Careful, it's slippery.

7
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,270
I'm so dizzy.

8
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:53,910
Go up the stairs.

9
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,270
Slow down.

10
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,390
Wait.

11
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,110
Here...

12
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,830
Hang in there. We're almost there.

13
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,390
Almost there.

14
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:04,670
Come on.

15
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,510
Turn left.

16
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,870
Turn left?

17
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,150
Go straight!

18
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,110
Go straight.

19
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,510
We're here.

20
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:17,550
We're at the door.

21
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,550
Slow down.

22
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,990
This one?

23
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,590
Your house uses a password lock?

24
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,070
Be careful.

25
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:47,950
Okay.

26
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,230
I can sit wherever I want.

27
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,670
Thank you, kid.

28
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,790
You saved me twice.

29
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,390
Go home now.

30
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,870
Okay.

31
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,150
I'll go home.

32
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,670
Jian Bing.

33
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,230
Um...

34
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,150
Anything else?

35
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:35,870
I...

36
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:36,590
I...

37
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,070
I have something to tell you.

38
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,070
Go ahead.

39
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,390
Jian Bing.

40
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,829
You should treat yourself better.

41
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,510
Wine is not good for you.

42
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,110
Don't drink too much in the future.

43
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,110
If you drink too much,

44
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,270
your face will swell.

45
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,990
I know

46
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,709
you might be experiencing some bad things recently.

47
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,150
Like divorce...

48
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,230
Don't throw up.

49
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,470
Here's some tissue.

50
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,110
Did you hear

51
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,710
what I said in the car?

52
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:36,590
I still remember

53
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,470
your eyes were gleaming.

54
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,470
Really.

55
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,030
I'm not lying.

56
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,150
Am I a wolf?

57
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,270
How could my eyes be gleaming?

58
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,990
I was immature when I was young.

59
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,909
I thought my dad was just a street cleaner.

60
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,710
But after watching your film,

61
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,390
I realized

62
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,830
how great

63
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,350
my dad is.

64
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,030
That man is your dad?

65
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,470
You remember it now?

66
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,030
We're destined to meet. Let's drink.

67
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,030
I know I'm not good enough yet,

68
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,910
but I'll work hard.

69
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,390
I hope one day when you see me,

70
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,390
you'll be reminded of your past self.

71
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,150
The design of care.

72
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,230
Look.

73
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,470
The lights are on.

74
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,350
What did I say?

75
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,230
We were worried for nothing.

76
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,230
She's back now. She's completely fine.

77
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,550
How do you know she's back for sure?

78
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,030
She often keeps the lights on.

79
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,710
I'll go upstairs and check.

80
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,910
Good for you, kid.

81
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,909
Why are you here?

82
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,470
I'll be more assured if I take a look too.

83
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,350
No need.

84
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,790
I've checked.

85
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:44,710
She's back.

86
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,390
Let's go.

87
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,790
I should have a word with her.

88
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,030
She's not young anymore, how can she do this?

89
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,790
She's already asleep. It's late.

90
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,909
Let's go.

91
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,390
Why did she go missing?

92
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,150
Was it just to scare us?

93
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,710
You're right, it's her fault.

94
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,150
We'll have a word with her tomorrow.

95
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:03,990
Get in.

96
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,150
Hurry up. Take me home. Hurry up.

97
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,790
Let's go.

98
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,150
Why are you still sitting here?

99
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,270
I'm reading.

100
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,150
You can have it. Take it home.

101
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,270
I want to sleep.

102
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,909
Close the door for me.

103
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,470
I...

104
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,230
I'm leaving.

105
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,590
Drink some ginger tea

106
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,990
when you wake up tomorrow.

107
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,630
Hello.

108
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,830
Hello, Director, you're awake.

109
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,590
I've been awake for a while.

110
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,470
I'm preparing to go out.

111
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,350
Wait. Don't talk.

112
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,190
I need my earpieces.

113
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,590
Okay, go ahead.

114
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,110
What did you do last night?

115
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,510
I was worried for nothing.

116
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,950
I thought something happened to you.

117
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,230
Turned out, you were doing something else.

118
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,870
Didn't I tell you?

119
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,990
I went to find my trophy.

120
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,830
You brought the trophy home, didn't you?

121
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,350
The shoe size looked big.

122
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,590
He must be pretty tall.

123
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,990
What are you talking about?

124
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,630
You already brought him home.

125
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,590
Stop pretending.

126
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,830
You were in a bad mood and

127
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,870
you needed comfort, I can understand.

128
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,750
But next time,

129
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,350
at least tell me if you were going home.

130
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,750
I looked for you all night.

131
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,350
Also,

132
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,310
are you in such a rush to divorce

133
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,070
because you have a new target?

134
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,590
You've been acting strange these days.

135
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,830
Very mysterious.

136
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,830
I do have a target,

137
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,710
but it's not a man.

138
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,230
What do you mean?

139
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,990
Yesterday,

140
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,710
I had a conversation

141
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,190
with my trophy.

142
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,830
Although I don't care about the divorce,

143
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,310
but regardless,

144
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,470
Xue has stayed in my life for ten years.

145
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,510
It has a deep impact on me.

146
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,110
But my trophy told me

147
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,110
I have to continue down

148
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,190
the path I have chosen for myself.

149
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,750
Don't worry about me.

150
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,230
From today onwards,

151
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,830
my drunkard days are over.

152
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,990
I want to do something that adults do.

153
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,630
And what would that be?

154
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,190
Work on my career.

155
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,230
I'm hanging up.

156
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,190
I need to go out now.

157
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,350
If you add one small stroke

158
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,710
to the word "imperfect",

159
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,950
it will become

160
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,830
"I'm perfect".

161
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,470
Defects can be perfect.

162
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,230
A rough terrain can be scenery too.

163
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,830
By changing perspectives,

164
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,470
one can find beauty in life's every corner.

165
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:32,710
Director.

166
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,070
Morning.

167
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,510
We'll shoot very fast today.

168
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,230
Director.

169
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,070
You're here.

170
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:38,870
Morning.

171
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:39,430
Morning, Director.

172
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:39,990
Morning, Yuan.

173
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:40,990
Morning, Director.

174
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:41,830
Good morning.

175
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,430
Director.

176
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:42,870
Ruyi.

177
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,110
Move your arm to the left.

178
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,750
What's with the big earrings?

179
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,630
My boyfriend bought them for me.

180
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,630
You're quite lovey-dovey.

181
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,110
Not as sweet as you and Director Xue.

182
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,590
You two even helped each other with shooting.

183
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,430
Here.

184
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,350
Good morning, Mr. Zhang.

185
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,190
Mr. Zhang.

186
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,230
Director Jian is here.

187
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,070
Good morning.

188
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,710
Director Jian.

189
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,470
Didn't you say

190
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,070
Director Xue will take over today?

191
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,510
No, this...

192
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,190
Why would Director Xue take over my project?

193
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,830
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhang. The shooting was delayed

194
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,310
due to some personal matters yesterday.

195
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,350
We'll catch up today so nothing will be overdue.

196
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:23,750
That's not right.

197
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,070
This is not what Director Xue said last night.

198
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,710
What's going on?

199
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,750
They must have had a new agreement between them.

200
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,310
The director was drunk.

201
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:32,830
Right?

202
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,590
Are they fooling me?

203
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,830
Of course not.

204
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,110
I'll ask him.

205
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,510
Call him now.

206
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:37,990
Ms. Jian Bing.

207
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,350
Didn't Director Xue tell you yesterday?

208
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,590
I thought you two decided that

209
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,230
he'll do the shooting for you today.

210
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,190
Why would he be doing it for me?

211
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,350
You didn't come to the company yesterday.

212
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,870
He came to help you edit the clips.

213
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,710
They had a good chat.

214
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,470
He said that today...

215
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,430
Look.

216
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,470
Look, it's still the same.

217
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,190
Yes.

218
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,950
There must be some other factors.

219
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,870
Okay, go through it again.

220
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,110
Later, we'll shoot according to this.

221
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,230
Send it to everyone.

222
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:16,830
Okay.

223
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,870
Bing.

224
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,470
You're flying this afternoon for your business trip, right?

225
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,990
No, I wanted to call you just now to tell you.

226
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,710
I canceled it.

227
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,230
What do you mean you canceled it?

228
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,190
Are you staying back to take my job?

229
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,830
Don't say it that way.

230
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,470
I just wanted to help you.

231
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,830
Do I need your help?

232
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,710
There can only be one director on the set.

233
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,830
If you're here, who will call the shots?

234
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:41,630
No, listen...

235
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,230
I don't care what you said to the client yesterday.

236
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,950
This project is mine.

237
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,870
Your absence

238
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,590
is the greatest form of respect for me.

239
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,230
Okay?

240
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,110
Why are you reading a paper book in this time and day?

241
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,430
You're holding it like it's some treasure.

242
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,630
Is there a beauty inside? Let me see.

243
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,190
There's a golden house inside.

244
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,590
Let me tell you.

245
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,830
I lost half a month's salary

246
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,110
for you yesterday.

247
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,230
You sure have nerves to mention that.

248
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,830
I did all your work

249
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,950
for you this week.

250
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,470
How are you going to settle this?

251
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,310
You have no conscience.

252
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,110
You left me alone yesterday.

253
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,870
I listened to Wang sing the same song all night.

254
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,430
I'm telling you, I've recorded it.

255
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,950
I'll play it on a loop for you all day.

256
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,710
-Believe it or not. -No, no.

257
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,510
I don't deserve it. Thank you, but no thank you.

258
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,470
After I left,

259
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,590
did he get mad at you?

260
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,710
Who?

261
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,710
Who else?

262
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,470
Wang.

263
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:51,750
No.

264
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,230
It's because I'm good at talking.

265
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,830
You were really something.

266
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,950
In the past,

267
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,190
no matter how annoying we thought he was,

268
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,990
we never showed it on our faces.

269
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,630
Right?

270
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,590
Who is

271
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,950
so important to you that

272
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,950
you're willing to risk your job for them?

273
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,990
I met her.

274
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,830
Who?

275
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,590
Who is it?

276
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,310
Is it that director lady?

277
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,470
Why didn't you tell me?

278
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,110
Do you take me as your friend?

279
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,230
How is she now?

280
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,110
She's just like that.

281
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,070
She must have changed, right?

282
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,710
It's been ten years, what do you think?

283
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,990
She must be married, right?

284
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,590
Is she a mother now?

285
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,990
Let me see.

286
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,310
She was already working when you were 16.

287
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,830
She must at least be in her 30s now.

288
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,750
She's a director,

289
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,350
so she must work in the sun and rain a lot.

290
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,830
Her appearance must be unsightly now.

291
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,070
What are you talking about?

292
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,710
Your appearance is unsightly.

293
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,190
She can't be as charming and stunning as you remembered.

294
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,990
She must be different from your first impression now.

295
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,230
Well, I am different too.

296
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,710
Yes, you are.

297
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,350
But you're different in a positive way.

298
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:08,990
Is she?

299
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,110
That's not important.

300
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,190
Then what is important?

301
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:13,990
Let me tell you.

302
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,870
If she is three years older than you, you're in luck.

303
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,630
But if she's 13 years older than you, you're out of luck.

304
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,590
An age gap smaller than five is fine.

305
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,430
But if she's 10 years older than you, it means you're trying to marry rich.

306
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,190
Of course, I don't mean to discriminate against you.

307
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,430
It depends on what she thinks too.

308
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,830
Where did she meet you?

309
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,990
What did you two do last night?

310
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,110
Does she still remember you?

311
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,350
Why do you have so many questions?

312
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,230
Of course.

313
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,310
You've been thinking about her for over ten years.

314
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,830
So, what do you think?

315
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,590
I just think

316
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,830
she's different from what I remembered.

317
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,590
She doesn't seem

318
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,350
to be doing well.

319
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,950
Not doing well in what way?

320
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,870
I'll send it to you later.

321
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:55,750
Sheng Yang.

322
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,470
Good morning.

323
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,230
I'm going to work.

324
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,150
See you.

325
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,950
I just found out yesterday.

326
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,390
Action.

327
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,390
No reply.

328
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,270
I'm not saying she's not good at her work.

329
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,710
But

330
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,910
Director Xue promised me last night.

331
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,869
I just want him to do it.

332
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:28,510
Okay, cut.

333
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,790
You know what I mean, right?

334
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,310
Zhang...

335
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,190
You should at least...

336
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,230
Yesterday...

337
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:36,990
Okay, it's approved.

338
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,030
Get ready for the next scene.

339
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,790
Yang.

340
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,990
What do you mean by she's not doing well?

341
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,510
Let me guess.

342
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,990
She doesn't get along with her husband.

343
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,030
Her child's grades are bad.

344
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,510
Her parents are in poor health.

345
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,470
Or her career is in shambles.

346
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,710
It has to be one of them.

347
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,230
I think she's getting a divorce.

348
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,230
See?

349
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,470
It's within my range of guesses.

350
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,990
Did you go to comfort her last night?

351
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,750
She doesn't need my comfort.

352
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,310
You're so worried about her. Do you really like her?

353
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,030
I said I like the mature type.

354
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:31,950
But I was just joking.

355
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,950
I didn't take it seriously.

356
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,230
You offended our Team Leader

357
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,910
because of a divorced woman?

358
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,150
Are you out of your mind?

359
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,990
Or do you plan to be a gold digger

360
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,510
and marry rich so you can

361
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,190
lie around and look pretty?

362
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,270
Are you that kind of person?

363
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,710
Listen to me.

364
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,710
Don't do it.

365
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,190
A divorced woman

366
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,950
gave her love to her ex-husband

367
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,270
and her money to her child.

368
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,790
She only wants you because you're fresh.

369
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,190
She's full of tricks and methods.

370
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,470
Can you defeat her?

371
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,190
Let's just keep it real

372
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,990
and date a normal girl.

373
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,990
For example, that girl

374
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,510
with a naive face and pure intentions.

375
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,070
Senior.

376
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,390
Sheng Yang.

377
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,910
You haven’t had breakfast, have you?

378
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:15,790
I bought it downstairs.

379
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,630
Try it.

380
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,430
Try it, Senior.

381
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:25,630
No need.

382
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,950
I've eaten. Thank you.

383
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,270
No need to thank me.

384
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,230
If it weren't for you yesterday,

385
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:29,910
Team Leader would have...

386
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,430
Just take it.

387
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,510
Sheng Yang,

388
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,230
don’t be ungrateful.

389
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,390
You might die single like this.

390
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,630
Junior,

391
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,670
you may not know.

392
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,470
Senior Sheng Yang likes it strong.

393
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,910
This is old chives and eggs.

394
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,710
It has a fragrant scent,

395
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,190
a refreshing flavor,

396
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,470
and a rich aftertaste.

397
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,510
A mere sandwich

398
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,710
is no match for it.

399
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,950
That's right.

400
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,150
This is my favorite.

401
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,630
Smells good.

402
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,150
All you care about is eating.

403
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,910
Stop eating.

404
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:40,870
We're having a meeting.

405
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,270
Mr. Zhang.

406
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,670
I...

407
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,070
Director Jian.

408
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,190
Well,

409
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,150
where is Director Xue?

410
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,190
Why do you keep asking for him when I'm sitting here?

411
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,950
No.

412
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,430
The key client said

413
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,310
that

414
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,990
Director Xue promised

415
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,230
to take a long shot for him here today.

416
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,230
How funny.

417
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,150
Call him back.

418
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,470
I'll take a long shot for him.

419
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,430
You've seen the quality of my work before.

420
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,430
Do you have any problem with it?

421
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,990
Of course not.

422
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,990
Otherwise, I wouldn't have asked you to be the director.

423
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,270
I didn't say anything about the quality of your work.

424
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,190
Then what is it?

425
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,750
You think my attitude is bad?

426
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,790
I think

427
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,750
there's nothing wrong with your attitude either.

428
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,030
So it's personal.

429
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,990
Director Jian,

430
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,950
agencies like us

431
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,510
don't have it easy either.

432
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,390
The client insists on

433
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,510
working with Director Xue instead.

434
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,230
If you insist that he's targeting you,

435
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,230
I think...

436
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,670
you should know if that's true or not.

437
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,070
How about this?

438
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,270
Take it as helping me instead.

439
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,990
Call Director Xue

440
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,430
and ask him to come to the set.

441
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,430
It shouldn't be difficult.

442
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,470
The client wants to see Director Xue,

443
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,470
but why must they meet at my set?

444
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,390
Right?

445
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,270
Why can't they meet somewhere else?

446
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,990
I don't know where his attitude is coming from,

447
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,470
but you should coordinate with the client instead.

448
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,710
Is that what you think?

449
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,710
Fine, I'll get the client back.

450
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,510
I'll point him in the nose and say,

451
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,430
"Zhang, you're crazy".

452
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,430
Do you think this is appropriate?

453
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,430
Hurry up.

454
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,750
Did you two quarrel again?

455
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,270
My goodness.

456
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,150
You've been married for so long.

457
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,950
Why are you two so stubborn?

458
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,150
What problem can't be solved

459
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,550
together at home?

460
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,230
Let me tell you.

461
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,190
You two are considered

462
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,550
the exemplary couple in our community.

463
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,750
Everyone is watching.

464
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,390
Everyone thinks

465
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,710
you are a

466
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,070
perfect match.

467
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,230
This is what I think.

468
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,710
No matter what happens,

469
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,230
let's finish the shooting first.

470
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,750
Then we can solve the internal conflict

471
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,950
in private.

472
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,030
Okay?

473
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,390
Let me tell you clearly.

474
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,470
Our problem

475
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,990
is no longer an internal conflict.

476
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,430
One is internal, one is external.

477
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,790
My project is my project.

478
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,470
His project is his project.

479
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,630
We need to make it clear.

480
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,230
Understand?

481
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:30,950
Understood.

482
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,870
I understood clearly.

483
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,470
Today,

484
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,430
I have two good news to announce.

485
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,150
The first good news,

486
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,230
our team's KPI this month

487
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,030
has been reached.

488
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,790
It's better than the planning team and the media team.

489
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,030
So,

490
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,150
there will be a bonus

491
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,270
for this month.

492
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,030
Of course,

493
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,790
some members are more outstanding than others.

494
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,470
For example, Sheng Yang from our group.

495
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,230
Sheng Yang.

496
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,470
You must be properly praised.

497
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,070
Be it the usual work

498
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,390
or overtime and staying up late,

499
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,150
you have never complained or backed down.

500
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,150
Now, onto the second good news.

501
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,150
As you can see,

502
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,670
it's your most anticipated project,

503
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,550
the Mid-Autumn Festival Park Hyatt PR gift box design project.

504
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,190
As you all know,

505
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,710
this is the company's biggest order in the first half of the year.

506
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,030
In the past,

507
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,510
Liu was in charge of these projects.

508
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,910
But this time,

509
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,990
I hope Sheng Yang can be in charge.

510
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,070
Are you okay with that?

511
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,710
Of course.

512
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,230
Okay.

513
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,470
No.

514
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,270
Team Leader, I have a lot of...

515
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,270
Sheng Yang.

516
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,230
I know.

517
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,470
Time is limited

518
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,470
and the task is heavy.

519
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,470
But it's a rare opportunity.

520
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,510
Don't let me down.

521
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,790
You got this.

522
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,550
Dismissed.

523
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,190
You got this.

524
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:11,910
It's a good chance.

525
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,030
Liu.

526
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,230
I...

527
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:19,990
See you, Liu.

528
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,710
Check if there are any missed shots.

529
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,070
No, it's all done.

530
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,990
Okay, that's all for today. Good job, everyone.

531
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,630
Thank you, Director.

532
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,270
Director.

533
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,070
We support you.

534
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,790
We support you.

535
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,390
Director.

536
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,710
We all support you.

537
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,550
We all support you.

538
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,310
Director,

539
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,510
let's have dinner and drink together tonight.

540
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,470
I need to edit the clips.

541
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,790
It won't hurt to start tomorrow.

542
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,470
Let's drink to relieve some stress.

543
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,310
What stress do I have?

544
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:05,990
Go ahead.

545
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,630
Director, we know everything.

546
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,150
What do you know?

547
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,270
What are they supporting me for?

548
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,470
It's about you and Director Xue...

549
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,510
Who was talking about it? So busybody.

550
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,990
You look haggard these days.

551
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,430
Do I?

552
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,030
Yes, you do.

553
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:23,910
There are

554
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,230
wrinkles on your face.

555
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,470
Ms. Jian Bing.

556
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,150
I know it's inappropriate for me to say this,

557
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:31,870
but

558
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,070
it's from the bottom of my heart.

559
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,150
You must listen to me.

560
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,150
Go ahead.

561
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,230
Director Xue is 40 years old.

562
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,550
He has a beer belly and wrinkles on his face.

563
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,070
But the young ladies in their 20s

564
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,670
are still eagerly throwing themselves at him.

565
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,150
But what about you?

566
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,710
How many pursuers do you have?

567
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,510
Yes.

568
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,150
We look good and work well.

569
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,230
We have everything we want.

570
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,910
But our age isn't competitive anymore.

571
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,310
Are you done?

572
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,430
I'm only 36.

573
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,310
Why must my happiness

574
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,510
be tied to a man?

575
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,310
You can't be single forever.

576
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,470
Who are you earning the money for?

577
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,430
For myself to spend.

578
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,230
How much can you spend on your own?

579
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,470
If you don't have a husband or a child to depend on,

580
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,710
what will you do during festivals,

581
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,950
or when you're sick and need help?

582
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,710
According to you,

583
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,990
if my husband cheats on me and my child is unfilial,

584
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,710
I should just die.

585
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,230
Listen to your own argument.

586
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,150
Lin, were you really born after 1995?

587
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,310
If my mom were still alive,

588
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,150
she wouldn't sound as old-fashioned as you.

589
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,710
Did I say too much to make you angry?

590
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,990
No, I can tell that you did it for my own good.

591
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,510
These words are from the bottom of my heart.

592
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,310
Ms. Jian Bing.

593
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,870
You can get a divorce.

594
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,550
But I'm quite informed

595
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,710
about Director Xue's situation.

596
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:48,870
Look.

597
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,150
If you didn't leave yourself a way out,

598
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,710
and you don't have any backup plans,

599
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,470
you should

600
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,990
think it over.

601
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,510
You are so energetic.

602
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:00,990
How about

603
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,270
you work overtime with me?

604
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,310
I have to pick up my kid. I'm leaving.

605
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,390
Goodbye, Liu.

606
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,870
I’m leaving first.

607
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,750
Goodbye, Liu.

608
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,510
See you tomorrow.

609
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,510
Bye.

610
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,190
Bye.

611
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,030
Congratulations.

612
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,470
Our Mr. Invisible received

613
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,270
such a big project to work on.

614
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,670
Quit being sarcastic.

615
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,390
This was such a brutal move.

616
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,310
Did you see Liu's expression just now?

617
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,710
She even ignored me.

618
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,910
She must hate you to death.

619
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,670
Think about it.

620
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,030
You have to finish the whole proposal in three days

621
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,390
without delaying your existing tasks.

622
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,910
If you do a great job,

623
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,270
Liu will feel upset.

624
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,070
If you fail,

625
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,510
Wang will definitely punish you.

626
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,990
It's a lose-lose situation.

627
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,390
Wang just wants me to bow to him

628
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,990
and admit that I'm incompetent.

629
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,070
Then he will be merciful

630
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,550
and entrust this job to Liu.

631
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,630
This way,

632
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,710
I can give in

633
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,270
and Liu will think nicely of him.

634
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,910
Then just bow your head.

635
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,310
We don't have three heads and six arms,

636
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,550
only one pair of hands.

637
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,310
How can you finish so much work?

638
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,910
A man must know when to yield.

639
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,990
Well,

640
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,430
what if I can finish this job?

641
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,190
Dude.

642
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,150
You only have three days.

643
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,310
He is obviously making things difficult for you.

644
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,710
This is an impossible task.

645
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,510
Stop dawdling.

646
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,030
Tell me.

647
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:51,750
Will you help me or not?

648
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,870
Of course I will help you.

649
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,310
I've figured it out.

650
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,950
In life, we either endure or fight.

651
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,990
Even if you endure to the end, you have to fight.

652
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,230
I'll explain things

653
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,950
to Liu another day.

654
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,790
The team leader already gave me this opportunity,

655
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,150
if I fail,

656
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,870
I'll really be incompetent.

657
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,670
I've made up my mind.

658
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,870
Even if I don't sleep for three days,

659
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,790
I must seize

660
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,470
this project.

661
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,510
Get to work.

662
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,030
What work?

663
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,790
I'm off work.

664
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:27,990
Work overtime.

665
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:30,990
Work overtime?

666
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,150
Working overtime is good.

667
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,870
It's none of your business.

668
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,430
I apply to work overtime.

669
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,310
Senior.

670
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:20,710
Senior.

671
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,470
Be careful.

672
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,710
Pick it up.

673
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:24,990
I'm sorry.

674
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,870
I didn't mean it.

675
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:28,990
Senior.

676
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,790
Why don't you take a break and eat something?

677
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,470
Why are you still here?

678
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,070
Senior, you're so focused.

679
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:38,950
No wonder people say

680
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,430
a serious man is the most handsome.

681
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,550
It's already so late. Go back.

682
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:44,630
No.

683
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,190
It's hard for you to work alone.

684
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,990
Is there anything I can help you with?

685
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,750
No.

686
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,430
I can help with trivial tasks too.

687
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,510
Do you know how to use AI (Adobe Illustrator)?

688
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,230
You mean Artificial Intelligence?

689
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,470
What about PR (Premier Pro)?

690
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,950
AE (After Effect)?

691
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,990
InDesign?

692
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,710
CorelDRAW?

693
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,310
You don't know any of them?

694
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,030
You should at least know how to use Photoshop, right?

695
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,870
I can use Meitu Photo Editor. Does it count?

696
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,750
You know how to use Meitu?

697
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,710
Then I must sign you up for

698
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,070
the National Advertising Design Competition next time.

699
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,470
Your care porridge is pretty good.

700
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,670
Senior Sheng Yang has received your kind gesture.

701
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,030
You can leave now.

702
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,430
Off you go.

703
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,470
Stop looking and go home, okay?

704
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,550
See you.

705
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,070
You're welcome.

706
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,710
You're welcome!

707
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,510
She's finally gone?

708
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,990
You're making me embarrassed.

709
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,670
Yes, let's meet.

710
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:35,310
Okay.

711
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,710
Keep in touch.

712
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,950
Do you know what Tian Limei said?

713
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,470
He just unsheathed his sword,

714
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,310
why did you turn it off?

715
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,150
For the first time in years,

716
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,750
she rushed to call me.

717
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,630
Do you know what she talked to me about?

718
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,150
How would I know?

719
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,270
She said after her daughter went back,

720
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,389
she kept praising Sheng Yang.

721
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,790
She said that Sheng Yang

722
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,350
is handsome

723
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,310
and talented.

724
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,389
This girl has high standards.

725
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,830
No one is good enough in her eyes.

726
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,350
No one, except Sheng Yang.

727
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,750
Isn't that normal?

728
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,590
She also said her daughter

729
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,989
bought a lot of books on advertising.

730
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,630
She read them even when she was eating.

731
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,949
It's all because of our son's influence.

732
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,350
His mother taught him well.

733
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:33,909
His mother taught him well.

734
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:34,989
Of course.

735
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,469
She asked me to ask Sheng Yang

736
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:40,110
what he thought of her daughter.

737
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,510
Don't agree rashly.

738
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,590
It's his own business.

739
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,870
Let him decide.

740
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,830
I want to celebrate.

741
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,470
What does it have to do with you?

742
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,830
Why are you celebrating?

743
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,350
Do you know how much she looked down on me?

744
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,030
Now she called me on her own accord

745
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,630
and wanted to meet up with me.

746
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,030
Go, meet up with her.

747
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,790
But I don’t have any decent clothes.

748
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,830
I also want to go to the Western restaurant Sheng Yang went to.

749
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:31,670
I'll arrange it.

750
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,750
Hello.

751
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,750
Where are you?

752
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,510
I'm reviewing the clips in the company.

753
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,990
You're so calm.

754
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,350
What happened?

755
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,670
What do you mean?

756
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,790
Today,

757
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,830
from clients to the agency,

758
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,990
even the cleaning lady of our company asked me

759
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,550
if you were going to divorce Xue.

760
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:07,670
You didn't have to

761
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,990
announce it so early.

762
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,030
I didn't announce it.

763
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,830
You didn't?

764
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,270
No wonder

765
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,470
the people in the studio

766
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,430
were so caring towards me today.

767
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,030
They kept saying they'd support me.

768
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,470
Support me for what?

769
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,550
It's just a divorce.

770
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,910
I'm just getting divorced at an old age.

771
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,910
Do they think

772
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,070
Xue abandoned me?

773
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,510
Why couldn't it have been me abandoning him?

774
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,470
Is the value of us women

775
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,110
defined by the success of our marriage?

776
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,430
Tell me.

777
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,390
Tell me, Liang Shanshan.

778
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,150
That's not what I meant.

779
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,590
I know you're annoyed.

780
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,430
I'm not.

781
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,910
Divorce is not annoying at all.

782
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,630
What's annoying is a bunch of irrelevant people

783
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,030
questioning and gossiping.

784
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,550
Why are they so free?

785
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,550
Do they have nothing to do?

786
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,070
I'm busy.

787
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,070
I'm working.

788
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,830
Editing and shooting are my true love.

789
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,270
Yes, you're right.

790
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,990
I know you're in a bad mood.

791
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:02,830
How about this?

792
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,110
I'll go there and stay with you for a while.

793
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:04,990
Forget it.

794
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,470
You always end up

795
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,510
falling asleep anyway.

796
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,430
I'm hanging up.

797
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,670
Wait.

798
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,910
Can you stop it?

799
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,910
I've already started, I might as well complete the set.

800
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,670
Eat.

801
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:38,950
I made sure not to fully cook it.

802
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,030
I guarantee there will be myoglobin.

803
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,030
It's absolutely authentic.

804
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,350
It's too tough.

805
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,590
It's the same style as the ones served in Western restaurants.

806
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,110
The toughness is part of the style.

807
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:21,470
People in Western restaurants drink wine, listen to jazz,

808
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,630
and light candles.

809
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:25,070
How can your setup compare?

810
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:26,990
I'll arrange it.

811
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,550
This is the expired grape juice

812
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,790
taken off the shelves of the supermarket!

813
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:41,990
No.

814
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,030
It's not expired.

815
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,030
It expires the day after tomorrow.

816
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,750
Look, right here.

817
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,390
It's written here.

818
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:47,990
Take a look.

819
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,110
Let me summarize the client's requirements.

820
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,510
We need to combine Chinese traditional elements

821
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,790
with the current fashion trend.

822
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,270
The range is too big.

823
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,390
It can't be completely fulfilled.

824
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,190
We have to narrow it down.

825
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,630
We'll do it the old way.

826
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,550
You ask and I answer.

827
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:01,830
Okay.

828
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,510
Come on.

829
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:03,950
In terms of style,

830
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,590
will it be simple or fancy?

831
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,270
Simple.

832
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,550
Realistic or freehand?

833
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,190
Freehand.

834
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,150
Classic or modern?

835
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,670
Tell me.

836
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,470
Hurry up.

837
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,270
Classic.

838
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,670
Warm or cool colors?

839
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,390
High saturation or low saturation?

840
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,430
Rainbow or solid colors?

841
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:18,910
That question is way too long.

842
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,270
Hurry up.

843
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:19,910
Hurry up.

844
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,790
Tell me.

845
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,670
Cool color, low saturation, solid color.

846
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,110
Flora or fauna elements?

847
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:24,750
Flora.

848
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:25,990
Scene or architecture?

849
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,390
Architecture.

850
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,270
Do you like older or younger girls?

851
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:27,550
Older.

852
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,510
You said it yourself.

853
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,150
You admitted it.

854
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:32,870
Right?

855
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,990
Are you crazy?

856
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,510
Let me tell you,

857
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,430
in every young man's heart,

858
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,950
there was a goddess in their hearts.

859
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,110
I had one too.

860
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:40,870
No need to be shy about it.

861
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,390
Young man?

862
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:43,830
You?

863
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,910
I used to be one.

864
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,190
Fine.

865
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,150
Take a good look at the customer's needs.

866
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:50,910
Get to work.

867
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:51,390
Okay.

868
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,590
A toast to you.

869
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,550
For what?

870
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,070
Thank you.

871
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,990
for giving birth to such a good son.

872
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:05,950
You've done well.

873
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,430
Keep praising me.

874
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,030
The decision you made before

875
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:18,870
was right.

876
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:19,790
What decision?

877
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,550
Have you forgotten?

878
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,990
When Yang was in primary school,

879
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,150
he insisted on taking drawing lessons.

880
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,030
I calculated that hiring a teacher

881
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,190
and buying all those art materials

882
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,470
would cost a lot of money.

883
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,190
Luckily,

884
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:33,750
you insisted on supporting his decision.

885
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,470
Who would have thought that

886
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,190
Yang can

887
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,470
make a living out of this.

888
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,390
I knew I had better foresight.

889
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,430
Of course.

890
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,270
I always thought that

891
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:54,590
this kid

892
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,630
could only work for me.

893
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,310
I didn't expect that he could make a living on his own now.

894
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,150
I don't think you need to worry about his marriage.

895
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:07,990
He's better than me.

896
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,910
Everything he has today

897
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,030
is all thanks to his father

898
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,470
who pinched and saved every penny.

899
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,190
Look at the furniture in his room.

900
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,270
They were all made by you.

901
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,470
That's true.

902
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,630
Why do you have to sneak inside?

903
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:41,430
You're right.

904
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,110
This is our son's room.

905
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,550
He's not here anyway.

906
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:51,510
Look.

907
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,190
How nice.

908
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,310
It's all memories.

909
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,110
We've had this sofa

910
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,390
for so many years.

911
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,750
It's still so sturdy.

912
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,750
Of... Of course. I made it.

913
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,270
You're right.

914
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,270
It's cozy.

915
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,110
What is this?

916
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,150
Lady's perfume.

917
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,310
Earrings.

918
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:53,270
We have a situation.

919
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,670
Not an ordinary one, too.
