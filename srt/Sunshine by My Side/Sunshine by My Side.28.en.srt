[Episode 28]

4
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:33,860
No, man.

5
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,860
We have rules here.

6
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,850
That's a lot of trash.

7
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:38,620
You

8
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,060
are making it difficult for us.

9
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,580
We are all students.

10
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,460
This is the first time that we shoot

11
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,900
this kind of public service advertisement.

12
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,210
We have no experience.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,100
Look.

14
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,620
I bought some braised stews and roast chicken.

15
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,979
Take them.

16
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,620
Public service advertisement?

17
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,539
Yes.

18
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,660
Look.

19
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,130
It is indeed

20
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,979
a public service advertisement.

21
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,020
It's not for commercial use. It's non-profitable.

22
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,180
But we're shooting here without permission.

23
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,300
It's indeed our problem.

24
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,300
The trash you just mentioned

25
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,979
is not trash.

26
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,539
It's the props

27
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,820
arranged by our art directors.

28
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,780
When we finish shooting,

29
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,380
we'll clean it up.

30
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,460
Is that okay? Please.

31
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,300
Okay?

32
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,300
Can you finish shooting within one day?

33
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,540
We'll try our best, okay?

34
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,180
You have to finish shooting within one day.

35
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:24,940
Okay.

36
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,020
Within one day.

37
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,100
There are no fences inside.

38
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,060
Be careful.

39
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,340
Safety first. Safety first.

40
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:30,860
Fine.

41
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:31,940
Sir, thank you.

42
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,780
Thank you.

43
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,260
Eat the roast chicken while it's hot.

44
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,140
Okay.

45
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,020
Thank you.

46
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,420
Later,

47
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,740
you walk down the stairs,

48
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,540
pick up the plastic bottle on the ground,

49
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,500
-and throw it into this blue trash can.
-Old Hen.

50
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,620
And then...

51
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,300
What?

52
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,900
I officially give up.

53
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,010
Give up what?

54
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,700
I'll ship them from now on.

55
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,420
Okay.

56
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,260
One last take, everyone.

57
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,700
-Okay.
-Okay.

58
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,700
Ready, Lin?

59
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,660
Yes.

60
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,420
Everything is ready.

61
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,220
Do you remember that?

62
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:06,940
Okay.

63
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,860
Let's get ready for shooting.

64
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,060
Okay, friends.

65
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,900
Ready.

66
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:17,820
Action.

67
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:30,540
Okay, cut.

68
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,020
Good.

69
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,020
Everyone, thank you for your hard work.

70
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,460
This film is done.

71
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,980
Everyone, we wrapped up the filming.

72
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,020
Hurry up.

73
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,220
We're halfway there.

74
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,900
So tonight,

75
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,010
we have to celebrate somewhere.

76
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,780
Of course.

77
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,890
Let's go to the club.

78
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,660
Wonderful.

79
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,060
Let me show you a tornado later.

80
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,380
Director,

81
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,370
let's go together tonight.

82
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,540
Come on.

83
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,420
Do you think she likes to play like us?

84
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,780
We've been working with her for so many years.

85
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,290
Have you ever seen her join in this kind of fun?

86
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,420
Right, Director?

87
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,940
Yes, I need to browse the materials.

88
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,420
Take them to have fun.

89
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,820
Come on.

90
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,170
Congratulations to Mr. Sheng on finishing the first film.

91
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,660
Thank you, Director.

92
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,900
Are you...

93
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,020
really not coming with us?

94
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,100
I never join in this kind of fun.

95
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,820
So sweet.

96
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,980
Pack our things. What are you doing?

97
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,780
I'm creating an opportunity for you.

98
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,900
Jian Shuang.

99
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,980
Jian Shuang.

100
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,540
You have finished your work?

101
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,420
You scared me.

102
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,820
Why did you walk so quietly?

103
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,010
Have you had dinner?

104
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,020
It doesn't matter if I have eaten or not.

105
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,900
What matters is

106
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,100
you...

107
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,540
wrapped up the filming.

108
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,900
Don't act like this.

109
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,460
I wrapped up the filming. So what?

110
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,420
Now you start to care about my work, huh?

111
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,060
What I care about is

112
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,140
whether you will still meet Sheng Yang in the future.

113
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,820
What about meeting him?

114
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,780
It doesn't matter who you meet.

115
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,020
I don't object to your relationship with someone younger than you.

116
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,100
The point is

117
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,340
you...

118
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,140
you already had an unsuccessful marriage.

119
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,220
Do you want to make the same mistake?

120
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,980
Who told you

121
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,409
a divorce means an unsuccessful marriage?

122
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,860
You're still young, but you've learned to define others.

123
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,659
Let me tell you.

124
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,860
You are not allowed to define others,

125
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,020
especially women.

126
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,220
Looks like you're serious.

127
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,740
Judging from your way of getting along,

128
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,650
he dared to sleep in your bed

129
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,860
after drinking some wine.

130
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,700
How can he be reliable?

131
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,140
Look at Mr. Fang.

132
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,730
He would never do such a thing.

133
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,700
Sister,

134
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,380
I have to say this.

135
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,980
Your job

136
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,300
is unstable.

137
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,100
If you are with a man who also has an unstable job,

138
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,540
what will your life be like?

139
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,180
Look at you.

140
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,380
You're holding a thermal cup like an old lady.

141
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,060
Come on, tell me what my life was like.

142
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,220
You always lived separately.

143
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,820
And you ate take-out every day.

144
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,820
You went on business trips, and he had social engagements.

145
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,580
How many times did you meet a year?

146
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,220
Now you want to be with a young boy.

147
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,820
I've asked around.

148
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,980
He just lost his job.

149
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,170
You have asked around?

150
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,780
Wouldn't it be better

151
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,020
if you are so serious about your studies?

152
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,460
Who did you ask?

153
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,540
None of your business.

154
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,500
Anyway, I know he's poor.

155
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,940
What do you mean?

156
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,690
Sheng Yang likes me

157
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,420
because he wants my money.

158
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,540
Right?

159
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,860
Is this what you mean?

160
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,610
How could you say that?

161
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,220
You just described a rich and happy single woman

162
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,380
as

163
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,940
a poor and old rich lady.

164
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,380
Am I like what you said?

165
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,940
Let me tell you.

166
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,690
There were many people pursuing me.

167
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,100
There is someone pursuing you now.

168
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,540
Mr. Fang.

169
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,340
He can marry you.

170
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:29,820
Stop.

171
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,580
Please.

172
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,500
Stop speaking well of Mr. Fang.

173
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,540
I have a headache whenever I hear his name.

174
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,340
Why do I have to get married?

175
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,700
Do I have to get married because I'm in my 30s?

176
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,130
Can't we just date?

177
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,140
It's not decent if you don't get married.

178
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,340
If we are suitable

179
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,140
and we get married.

180
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,620
But we don't like each other.

181
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,690
It's not decent either, right?

182
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,659
What kind of mindset is that?

183
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,460
You haven't graduated from college yet.

184
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,860
But you are thinking like an old lady.

185
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,380
Let me tell you, Jian Shuang,

186
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,900
thank you for talking to me tonight.

187
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,140
I think I'm really young.

188
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,940
I can't stay home at this hour.

189
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,340
Well.

190
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,460
Where are you going?

191
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,050
I... I haven't finished talking to you.

192
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,220
I'm gonna get changed and go out to have fun.

193
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,180
When can she grow up?

194
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,420
Enough.

195
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,020
The finger-guessing game.

196
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,980
15, 20, 10.

197
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:27,980
Drink.

198
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,420
I also said 10.

199
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:29,780
Come on.

200
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,100
Drink.

201
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,420
15.

202
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,900
20.

203
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,020
15, 20, 5.

204
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,580
I'm not drinking.

205
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,659
You are good at drinking.

206
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,780
Don't just play the game. Drink.

207
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,539
Ms. Jian Bing is here, right?

208
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,620
Fill the cup. Come on.

209
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,220
Ms. Jian Bing.

210
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,659
Ms. Jian Bing.

211
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,299
Here.

212
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,940
Director is here.

213
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,220
Director.

214
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,930
Here, Ms. Jian Bing.

215
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,100
Hello.

216
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,180
Hello.

217
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,020
Where is Sheng Yang?

218
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,100
He's not here.

219
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,340
Don't stand there.

220
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,820
Come, have a seat, Director.

221
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,900
What took you so long, Director?

222
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,540
Drink.

223
00:08:59,540 --> 00:08:59,820
Drink as punishment.

224
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,620
You are late. Drink as punishment.

225
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,420
You are late. Drink as punishment.

226
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,140
Cheers.

227
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,580
Congratulations on the wrap.

228
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,740
Congratulations on the wrap.

229
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,860
Thank you.

230
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,780
What took you so long, Director?

231
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,020
I went home to take a look at Jian Shuang.

232
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,900
Bottoms up. Drink it all.

233
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,900
Sorry, I'm late.

234
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,940
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

235
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,180
Look at you.

236
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,460
Ms. Jian Bing, why are you here?

237
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,580
Why are you dressed like this?

238
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,300
I came here for fun, right?

239
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,060
I've never seen you so serious about your work.

240
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,860
Come on.

241
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,420
Oh no.

242
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,820
I'm going to be fired.

243
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,020
Come, sit here.

244
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,940
Come on.

245
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,540
Thank you.

246
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,020
You are late. You should be punished.

247
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,620
I'm gonna drink.

248
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,130
-I'm proposing a toast.
-You're late. You have to drink.

249
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,140
I'm sorry.

250
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,060
Come on.

251
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,740
Cheers.

252
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,380
Cheers.

253
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,620
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

254
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,660
Congratulations on the wrap.

255
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,300
My goodness. These...

256
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,740
These girls' outfit

257
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,220
is so weird.

258
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,540
What's so weird about it?

259
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,660
It's great.

260
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,180
They are young and energetic.

261
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,300
Look.

262
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,100
So much collagen.

263
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,780
They have nice figures.

264
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,260
They are perfect.

265
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,100
How wonderful.

266
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,260
I want to wear like this too.

267
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,580
How old are you?

268
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,540
I can wear like that no matter how old I am.

269
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,380
No one should interfere.

270
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,500
Fine.

271
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,250
Go burn your calories.

272
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:19,870
[Song Chen: Where are you?]

273
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,300
I'm gonna change the channel.

274
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,420
Why?

275
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,460
I'm watching.

276
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:26,050
[Sheng Yang: I'm washing dishes at home.]

277
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,050
Look at their big red lips.

278
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,280
It's fashionable.

279
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,770
The skirt is so short.

280
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,860
Women

281
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,220
can wear whatever they like

282
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,860
and whatever they want.

283
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,020
You men wear T-shirts

284
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,950
[Song Chen: Stop washing dishes. Ms. Jian Bing is here.]

285
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,380
and short pants in summer.

286
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,100
You roll up your T-shirts when it's hot,

287
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,480
[Song Chen]

288
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,060
exposing your bellies.

289
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,020
Do you think it's decent?

290
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,740
You are being unreasonable.

291
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,140
You should wear age-appropriate clothes.

292
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,300
Yang,

293
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,460
come and be the judge.

294
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,980
Do you think I can dress like this?

295
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,740
They are dancing. Do you agree?

296
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,540
Do you agree?

297
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,460
I agree.

298
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,660
But be careful.

299
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,380
Dad, Mom, I'm going out.

300
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,300
Be careful.

301
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,530
Why did Yang say

302
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,100
I should be careful if I dress like this?

303
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,540
He's afraid you may hurt others.

304
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,340
Don't listen to him.

305
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,610
You can't do this.

306
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,300
Song Chen lost just now. Drink.

307
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,140
Good.

308
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,340
Good.

309
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,060
Impressive. Impressive.

310
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,340
Come on.

311
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,420
Do you want to play?

312
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,140
It's okay. We didn't drive.

313
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,860
I'll find a designated driver for you.

314
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,660
He loves drinking.

315
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,300
Come on.

316
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,860
Hurry up.

317
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,980
Sheng Yang is here.

318
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,450
What took you so long?

319
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,490
You're late.

320
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,460
Give him one bottle.

321
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,780
I'm sorry. Sorry.

322
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,900
You are late. Drink as punishment.

323
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,460
Drink.

324
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,260
Come on.

325
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,460
Cheers.

326
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,340
Congratulations on the wrap.

327
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,300
Don't you think it's too little?

328
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,820
Bottoms up, okay?

329
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,540
That's right.

330
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,250
Take it easy.

331
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,740
We wrapped up the filming. The boss was not here celebrating with us.

332
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,580
Is it appropriate?

333
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,650
You are the soul of our team.

334
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,340
If you are not here,

335
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,300
why should I come?

336
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,460
I'm here, right?

337
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,140
Come on, drink again. Drink again.

338
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,500
That's why I'm here too.

339
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,100
You are really good at drinking.

340
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,860
I'll get drunk with just one cup.

341
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,340
I don't believe it.

342
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,700
It's awful.

343
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,700
You mean this song?

344
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,410
Then what is not awful?

345
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,820
I'm not flexible.

346
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,580
Wait.

347
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,300
What is she doing?

348
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,100
I don't know.

349
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,980
What's going on?

350
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,060
Lin. Lin.

351
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,580
Make him drink.

352
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,660
Why haven't they started playing it?

353
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,340
Why would I avoid it?

354
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,260
Come on. Drink.

355
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,460
Come on. Drink.

356
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,340
Why don't we drink the same amount?

357
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,260
There is so much left.

358
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,140
So retro.

359
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,020
Director dances so well.

360
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,620
Director, go there and dance.

361
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,540
Go there and dance.

362
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,540
Go there and dance.

363
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,820
Come on.

364
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,660
Yes, dance on the stage.

365
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,900
Let's go. Dance together.

366
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,500
Pan Rou, join us.

367
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,500
-Come on.
-Let's go.

368
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,900
Let's go.

369
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,940
Come on.

370
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,020
Come on.

371
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,220
Come on.

372
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,300
Give them some space.

373
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,540
You sit here.

374
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,740
I'm going to buy you something to drink.

375
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,780
Okay.

376
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,020
Come on.

377
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,730
It's hot.

378
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,460
Warm your hands.

379
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,380
Bro, you took me out

380
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,500
just to drink milk?

381
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,780
Who drinks milk after dancing?

382
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,980
You should have bought two bottles of wine.

383
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,380
You still want to drink?

384
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,220
You've drunk enough tonight.

385
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,180
Drink some milk.

386
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,060
I haven't drunk enough.

387
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,860
This is the most uncomfortable feeling.

388
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,860
You still haven't drunk enough?

389
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,780
You were dancing the whole time tonight.

390
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,660
Don't you want to sleep tonight?

391
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,500
Milk helps you sleep.

392
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,250
Just drink milk.

393
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,380
Okay.

394
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,610
Why do you always

395
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,060
talk like an old man?

396
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,300
Sometimes I can't tell

397
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,420
if I'm almost 40 or you're almost 40.

398
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,420
I don't understand

399
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,740
why you always talk about the age.

400
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,020
Even if you're 30, 40, 50,

401
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,340
or 80...

402
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,900
60, 70, 80.

403
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,250
I'm the most beautiful woman in the club.

404
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,500
Of course.

405
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,740
Is that what you want to say?

406
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,140
I thought you admire my talent, right?

407
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,570
When did you start to covet my beauty?

408
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,420
You are right.

409
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,500
But no matter how pretty a woman is,

410
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,610
she'll look ordinary after a long period of time.

411
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,140
But you are different.

412
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,820
How?

413
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,060
Tell me.

414
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,100
Besides being pretty,

415
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,860
you have a good personality.

416
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,220
You insist on what is right and forget what is wrong.

417
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,300
You are independent.

418
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,860
You have your own thoughts.

419
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,940
You are competent.

420
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,780
You even look beautiful when you're angry.

421
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,340
You are still

422
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,980
talking like an old man.

423
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,579
You were dancing in the club.

424
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,099
In terms of the rhythm

425
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:07,900
and posture,

426
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,380
you looked much prettier

427
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,220
than girls of 17 or 18 years old.

428
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,210
How does this sound?

429
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,260
Not bad.

430
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,020
Didn't you see

431
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,260
they gave me wine?

432
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,500
None of them is reliable.

433
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,540
They're no match for me.

434
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:27,900
Meijuan.

435
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,580
Hello, Meijuan.

436
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,260
What's wrong?

437
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,500
You left before finishing washing dishes.

438
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,420
Where are you?

439
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,380
I'll be back soon.

440
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,460
It's in the middle of the night.

441
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,940
Who are you with?

442
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,940
A woman?

443
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,820
Don't worry about this.

444
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,500
You are being shy.

445
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,450
You wrapped up the filming today, right?

446
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,300
Invite Director Jian home tomorrow.

447
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,020
I'll treat her to a meal.

448
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,860
Invite Director Jian over for a meal tomorrow?

449
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,340
Are you sure?

450
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,370
She helped you a lot.

451
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,940
We should thank her,

452
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,540
right?

453
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,340
Yes.

454
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,980
We should thank her sincerely.

455
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,860
You brat.

456
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,140
You are ungrateful.

457
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,660
Besides,

458
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,980
I haven't seen her for a long time.

459
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,050
I miss her.

460
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,330
Mrs. Sheng,

461
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,500
I'll be there tomorrow.

462
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,180
Director Jian.

463
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,460
Well...

464
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,660
See you tomorrow.

465
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,220
See you tomorrow,

466
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,730
Mrs. Sheng.

467
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:25,900
Bye. Bye.

468
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,220
I'll talk to you later. Let's talk after I come back.

469
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,090
Rest early.

470
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,260
Will you really come tomorrow?

471
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,380
You don't welcome me?

472
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,460
I'll give you a warm welcome.

473
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,140
I'll lay a red carpet downstairs

474
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,540
to welcome you.

475
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,300
Okay.

476
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,140
When I arrive tomorrow,

477
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,220
if I don't see a red carpet downstairs,

478
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,530
I won't go upstairs.

479
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,380
It's a deal then. You have to come.

480
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,260
Coming.

481
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,340
Dad, I'll get the door.

482
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,020
Coming.

483
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,980
You are really fast.

484
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,260
You are here.

485
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,740
Hello.

486
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,540
Come in.

487
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,260
Where should I put them?

488
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:28,980
Give them to me.

489
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,380
How was your trip?

490
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,300
Was there a traffic jam?

491
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,340
It was not bad.

492
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,580
Are you sober now?

493
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,900
I was not drunk.

494
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,900
Mr. Sheng.

495
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,220
Meijuan.

496
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,020
Mrs. Sheng.

497
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,410
Bing, you're here.

498
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,500
Well.

499
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,860
You shouldn't have bought these things.

500
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
Tea and honey.

501
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,060
-And these are the masks for Mrs. Sheng.
-I like it.

502
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,620
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

503
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,260
Bing, you came at the right time.

504
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,100
The meal is about to be ready.

505
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,740
Really?

506
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,180
Come.

507
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,810
Come.

508
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,220
Please come in.

509
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,540
Come.

510
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,020
Sit where you sat.

511
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,420
Okay.

512
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,260
Let's sit next to each other.

513
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,820
Okay.

514
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,380
Give me a hand.

515
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:58,620
Give it to me.

516
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,180
Your scarf.

517
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,540
Come.

518
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,180
This way, please.

519
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,820
I'm gonna sit here.

520
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,780
Okay. Still this seat.

521
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,860
Thank you.

522
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,860
What a feast.

523
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,580
Mrs. Sheng.

524
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,780
I wonder how they taste.

525
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,010
Of course they taste good.

526
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:16,940
Bing,

527
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,220
you helped us.

528
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,420
We should thank you.

529
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,980
What did I do to help you?

530
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,020
Don't thank me. I'm here for a free meal.

531
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,980
We

532
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,890
asked you to help Yang find a job.

533
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,660
Although you didn't find one for him,

534
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,340
you two cooperated with each other.

535
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,380
It's better than finding a job,

536
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,010
right?

537
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:36,980
Come on.

538
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:37,940
I'm proposing a toast to you.

539
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:38,970
Mom.

540
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,740
We haven't eaten anything yet.

541
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,380
We are not drinking all of it.

542
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,730
Just one sip.

543
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:42,980
Come on.

544
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,340
Mrs. Sheng.

545
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,380
Cooperate. Cooperate.

546
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,900
Enough.

547
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,940
Let's eat.

548
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,180
Come on.

549
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:53,660
Let's eat.

550
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,660
Let me do it.

551
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,060
I forgot this.

552
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,810
Give it to me.

553
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,020
Thank you.

554
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,460
Don't stand on ceremony.

555
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,260
Eat whatever you want.

556
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:01,620
Thank you.

557
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,500
The spoon is here.

558
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:04,740
Mapo tofu.

559
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:05,740
Eat it while it's hot.

560
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,900
Did the filming go well?

561
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,500
Yes.

562
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,500
Did Yang cause you any trouble?

563
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,370
No.

564
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,180
Our cooperation was great.

565
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,260
Do you hear that?

566
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,300
The cooperation was great. It was cooperation.

567
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,980
That's because she was willing to help you.

568
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,220
I

569
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,740
don't like being hypocritical.

570
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,380
Yes.

571
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,540
Every word I say is sincere.

572
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,740
I think

573
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,540
you are kind,

574
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:31,860
capable,

575
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,170
generous,

576
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,010
and straightforward.

577
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,980
It's not easy to find such a good girl.

578
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,770
You are right.

579
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,300
Mrs. Sheng, if you praise me again,

580
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,940
I don't even know how to use my chopsticks.

581
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,140
Come here often.

582
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,220
Regard this place as your home.

583
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,740
From now on,

584
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,810
call me sister.

585
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,380
And Yang's father

586
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,940
will be your brother-in-law.

587
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,300
Okay.

588
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:51,900
Yang,

589
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,540
come on.

590
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,860
Pour wine for your aunt.

591
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,780
What aunt?

592
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,010
She's much younger than you.

593
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,740
Then she's your little aunt.

594
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,210
There is still wine in the glass. Pour wine after she drinks all of it.

595
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,380
It doesn't matter.

596
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,730
There is still wine in the glass. Pour wine after she drinks all of it.

597
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,020
Mom.

598
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,100
Don't drink too much.

599
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,900
Eat more food.

600
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,020
Drinking is bad for your health.

601
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,940
Regard this place as your home from now on.

602
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,450
If you are not busy,

603
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,020
take me out to go shopping or do something else.

604
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,860
Let me

605
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,740
broaden my vision.

606
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,660
No problem.

607
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,140
Great. Come on.

608
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,420
Cheers.

609
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,860
You drink as much as you like. I'll drink all of it.

610
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:29,820
Come on.

611
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,060
I should drink all of it too.

612
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,820
No need to drink all of it, Mom.

613
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,500
That's right.

614
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,540
It's okay.

615
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,020
Slowly.

616
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,180
Drink slowly.

617
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:37,660
You...

618
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:39,740
Good.

619
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,620
Here, Mrs. Sheng.

620
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,540
Cool.

621
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,100
Are you okay, Mom?

622
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,860
I'm fine. I'm happy.

623
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:46,940
Director.

624
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,700
Well...

625
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,900
Don't blame her.

626
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,620
She's straightforward.

627
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:51,900
I like her.

628
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,700
Didn't you say

629
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,980
you want to find a boyfriend for her?

630
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,980
I forgot.

631
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,940
I've spent much time

632
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,100
on my phone these days.

633
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,060
I found many dating apps.

634
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,460
Mom.

635
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,940
Are you crazy?

636
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,900
What?

637
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,620
I'm keeping pace with the times.

638
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,420
Right?

639
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,220
Actually,

640
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,220
Bing, you don't have to find a boyfriend so soon.

641
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,290
You just got out from the shackles of marriage.

642
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,900
You should

643
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,220
enjoy the time of being single.

644
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:28,940
I understand now.

645
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,180
I completely understand now.

646
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,380
You haven't taken it seriously.

647
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,380
How could you say that?

648
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,580
Not every woman

649
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,180
wants to get married, have children,

650
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,700
and serve men.

651
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,770
Some women need a warm home.

652
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,820
A warm harbor.

653
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,090
But some women

654
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,110
like

655
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,810
flying in the sky.

656
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,020
Right, Bing?

657
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,660
Yes.

658
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,660
I'm going to get my phone.

659
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,580
I'll download an app.

660
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,330
You just said flying.

661
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,220
Mom.

662
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:56,540
Well...

663
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,900
Stop talking. Just eat.

664
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,420
Okay?

665
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,780
I know. Actually, what I want to say is

666
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,100
you can chat with others

667
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,660
online.

668
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,300
Chat if he's reliable.

669
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,380
Delete him if he's not reliable.

670
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,900
Who said she wants to go on a blind date?

671
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,180
You don't want a girlfriend,

672
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,740
and you don't want her to find a boyfriend either?

673
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,740
I want to use the bathroom.

674
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:16,940
-Yang.
-Well...

675
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,260
Let me take you there.

676
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,660
What's wrong with your son today?

677
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:29,820
He wouldn't let me talk.

678
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,620
Did I say something wrong?

679
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,500
No.

680
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:31,820
Thank you.

681
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,940
Just mind your own business.

682
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,740
My mom is always like that.

683
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,140
Don't mind her.

684
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,340
I understand.

685
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,940
I'm worried about her.

686
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,940
You were not suggesting.

687
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,620
What about me?

688
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,020
You were making arrangements.

689
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,820
Was I?

690
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,660
No.

691
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,580
Come on.

692
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,580
Let me pour wine for you.

693
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,060
Well...

694
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,540
Sorry, I'm back.

695
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,020
Not at all.

696
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,420
-The dishes are almost cold.
-Come. Sit.

697
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:51,740
Sit down.

698
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,220
Come.

699
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,020
Mom.

700
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,540
You only care about other people's relationship status.

701
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,380
What about my relationship status?

702
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,300
Why have you never asked me about it?

703
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,180
Actually, I...

704
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,820
I introduced a girl to you, right?

705
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,700
You failed. Who should be blamed?

706
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:07,620
I...

707
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,380
Mrs. Sheng, Mr. Sheng,

708
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,250
I actually answered a call just now.

709
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,580
There is a meeting in the company.

710
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,540
It's urgent. They want me there.

711
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,180
I need to leave after a drink.

712
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,930
Well, why are you...

713
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,340
You are leaving so soon?

714
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,900
Let's drink and go shopping alone some other day.

715
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:20,900
Okay.

716
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,900
Wait a minute.

717
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:23,940
Gosh.

718
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,620
I forgot the most important thing.

719
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,340
Recently,

720
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,220
I met a handsome boy on the Internet.

721
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,100
You two look perfect together.

722
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,980
Take a look.

723
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,020
If you like him,

724
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,540
I'll share his WeChat ID with you.

725
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,060
Mrs. Sheng,

726
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,020
actually, I...

727
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,300
have a boyfriend.

728
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,020
You have a boyfriend?

729
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,260
He's a college teacher.

730
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,330
How old is he?

731
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,020
We haven't known each other for long. I'm still in contact with him.

732
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,860
So you are dating, right?

733
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,380
Yes.

734
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,250
Well, I was fussing.

735
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:52,500
That's right.

736
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,340
In the future,

737
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,500
take him here too, okay?

738
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,860
Okay, I'm leaving.

739
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,060
Let's keep in touch on WeChat.

740
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,740
You...

741
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,380
I'm going to walk her out.

742
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,500
Sit. Sit.

743
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,620
You've been busy for so many days.

744
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,060
Stay with your parents.

745
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,260
I'm sorry,

746
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:04,860
Mrs. Sheng, Mr. Sheng.

747
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,940
Mrs. Sheng, you made a lot of dishes.

748
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,660
Let's chat alone later.

749
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,420
Walk her out.

750
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,620
Director, I...

751
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,490
I have to walk you out.

752
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,220
Come on.

753
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:10,660
Okay.

754
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,380
Be careful.

755
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,620
-Bye, Bing.
-Thank you.

756
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,060
-Bye, Mrs. Sheng.
-Come often.

757
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,420
I just want you to know

758
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,460
you're welcome anytime.

759
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,020
Okay.

760
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,740
Be careful.

761
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,140
She just drank a little

762
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,060
and ate some dishes.

763
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,140
She didn't even eat rice.

764
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,450
Why did she leave so soon?

765
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,860
What's so important?

766
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,420
She didn't eat much.

767
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:41,700
Yang,

768
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,020
have you seen her boyfriend?

769
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,340
What does he look like?

770
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,500
I've never seen him.

771
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,460
Are the dishes too salty today?

772
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,010
They taste good.

773
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,260
But

774
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,540
she didn't eat anything.

775
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,740
Didn't she say someone called her and there is something urgent?

776
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,460
You...

777
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,780
You are so imaginative.

778
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:03,940
They are really not salty, right?

779
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,660
Let me have a taste.

[Sheng Yang Missed calls 6 notifications Now]

781
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,380
Hello?

782
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,700
Are you home?

783
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,340
I'm gonna come to you.

784
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,340
I have something to ask you.

785
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,380
It's not convenient.

786
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,340
My sister is at home.

787
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,180
I only have one question.

788
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,260
Today, you said Fang Mu is your boyfriend.

789
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,020
What do you mean?

790
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,220
Did you confirm your relationship with him behind my back?

791
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,620
Or did you say that to my mom deliberately?

792
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,620
You're so funny.

793
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,380
What do you mean by behind your back?

794
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,660
No matter who I'm in a relationship with,

795
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,100
why should I inform you?

796
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,820
What's our relationship?

797
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:22,980
Then what?

798
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,180
Should I call you Aunt from now on?

799
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,180
Hello?

800
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,820
Whatever.

801
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,980
You scared me.

802
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,900
Are you okay?

803
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,620
Did you have a fight?

804
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,500
Where's your thermal cup?

805
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,300
Come, sit here.

806
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,980
I need to talk now.

807
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,700
Okay.

808
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,060
Go ahead.

809
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,180
I think what you said is right.

810
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,300
I've been a bit arrogant lately.

811
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,900
What I said may not be right.

812
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,090
Your feeling is what matters.

813
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:19,900
But

814
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,580
according to what I heard when you were on the phone,

815
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,260
did you use Mr. Fang

816
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,500
as an excuse?

817
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,900
I just

818
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,980
blurted it out.

819
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:35,900
Why?

820
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,220
Because someone wanted to arrange a blind date for me.

821
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,260
I really don't want to go.

822
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
But I...

823
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,220
His name suddenly

824
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,380
appeared in my head.

825
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,300
There is no other man around me.

826
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,140
I...

827
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,010
I can't tell them

829
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,980
That's right.

830
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,180
Do you know what this is?

831
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,580
You blurted it out.

832
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,100
It's your intuition.

833
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,660
You're an artist.

834
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,260
Artists should follow their intuition.

835
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,580
Actually, you've already

836
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,980
had an answer in your heart.

837
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,410
It's just

838
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,020
you haven't realized it yet.

839
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:05,860
Enough.

840
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,460
The conversation is over.

841
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,580
The more we talk, the more unhappy I am.

842
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,020
Follow your heart.

00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,500
Great!

844
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,340
It's done.

What's this about?

854
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,260
You really did it.

855
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,620
Oh my god.

856
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,420
You are a great director.

857
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,060
For this small and unimportant public service advertisement,

858
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,860
you found equipment for them,

859
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,460
asked someone for help,

860
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,380
and looked for a studio.

861
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,460
And you told me

862
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,580
to forget about our company's work because you need to use this studio.

863
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,460
You're really something.

864
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,100
Good for you.

865
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,980
You are a little lovesick now.

866
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:09,980
It's okay.

867
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,980
You can date whoever you like.

868
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,860
It has nothing to do with me.

869
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,140
As long as you're happy.

870
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,180
Well, are you happy?

871
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,620
Are you doing monologue comic talk here?

872
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,220
Huh?

873
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,450
Come on.

874
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,420
Tell me why you brought me this box of fruits.

875
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,420
It's for you to eat.

876
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,570
You want me to feed you?

877
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,660
Eat it yourself.

878
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,700
If you want to say something, just say it.

879
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,220
Don't hinder me from editing.

880
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,700
Well, I'm just wondering

881
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,980
when you can finish this.

882
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,620
There is a lot of work waiting to be done in the company.

883
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,380
It'll be done soon.

884
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,220
And I'll do our company's work after I finish it.

885
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,100
I've read the project proposals you gave me.

886
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,980
Which one do you mean?

887
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,700
That's right.

888
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:47,980
Well,

the down jacket project.

890
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,220
The client

891
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,100
wants you to film for him.

892
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,180
But there is a requirement.

893
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,620
The client said

894
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,050
we have to film on the snow mountain.

895
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,380
Well,

896
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,660
it's very cold.

897
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,020
How about letting me go?

898
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,020
Then go.

899
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,340
But the client wants you to do it.

900
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,700
I'll go then.

901
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,820
That's good.

902
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,810
Then I'm going to ask legal personnel

903
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:11,980
to sign the contract for you, okay?

904
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,700
Okay, I'm going now.

905
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,180
I'm going to legal personnel now.

906
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,620
You asked Mr. Deng to leave,

907
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,820
who's going to edit this for me?

908
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:40,780

909
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,700
Ms. Jian Bing sent the demo.

910

00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,980
I didn't expect

915
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,699
the effect is so good.

916
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,100
I have a feeling

917
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,780
we will win this time.

918
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,300
Of course.

Only 30 days of Moments are visible.]

920
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,140
Yang, I have to say

921
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,740
you did a great job in special effects.

922
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,620
It's really amazing.

923
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,610
Director Jian is awesome too.

924
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,340
She finished editing within just several days.

925
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,180
Yes.

He's going to treat her to a meal.

930
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:52,980
Good.

931
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,980
Everything we did

932
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,130
is

933
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,540
worth it.

934
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,500
It's worth it.

935
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,020
Are these clothes

936
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,580
for you to look at or wear?

937
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,980
Before I wear them,

938
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,060
I need to take a close look at them, right?

939
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,020
You came at the right time.

940
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,610
Take a look for me.

00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,650
No.

do you think?

Let me take a look.

00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,020
Am I handsome?

948

Your collar is so ugly.

949

Really?

950
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,860
You should fold it down.

How about now?

00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,610
you look like a gentleman.

954
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,620
What's the occasion?

955
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,620
I'm going to visit someone.

956
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,740
24,000 yuan.

957
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,300
So expensive?

958
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,300
If I want to visit her,

959
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,620
a sense of ceremony is needed, right?

960
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,050
You are going to wear this

961
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,380
to visit Ms. Jian Bing?

962
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,260
That's right.

963
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,260
By the way...

964
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:08,820
Oh no.

965
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,420
This is bad.

966
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,820
There is something wrong

967
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,780
with your coat.

968
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:16,780
Take it off and let me see.

969
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,780
Is the color not proper?

970
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,660
I think it has nothing to do

971
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,740
with the color.

972
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,180
But there is

973
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,090
something wrong.

974
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,180
Tell me now.

975
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:25,860
What is wrong?

976
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,100
I have a white one

977
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,020
and a brown one.

978
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,580
I'm gonna change this if this is not okay.

979
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,180
Jian Shuang told me

980
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,860
Jian Bing will go on a business trip to Fairy Mountain for three days.

981
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:35,930
But I think

982
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,980
it's inappropriate for me

983
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,540
to go there uninvited, right?

984
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,780
I should at least call her

985
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,740
and tell her, right?

986
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,660
You can't make this call.

987
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,060
Why?

988
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,380
You can't go there if you make this call.

989
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,620
Why?

990
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,980
Why?

991
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,140
If you call her,

992
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,300
what if

993
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:51,890
she refuses you?

994
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,340
You are right.

995
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,540
But don't worry.

996
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,380
I'll go with you.

997
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,580
Why do you want to go?

998
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,060
Because I want to help you.

999
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,660
Help me?

1000
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,460
I should thank God if you don't cause me trouble.

1001
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,900
Uncle,

1002
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,980
it seems

1003
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,700
your coat is no long needed.

1004
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:18,700
Why?

1005
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,980
Just give it to me, okay?

1006
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,580
Give it to you?

1007
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,780
You are just a little kid.

1008
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,020
It's too large for you.

1009
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,260
I'm an adult.

1010
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,540
I look good in it.

1011
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,980
Although you are an adult, you don't need to do what adults do.

1012
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,380
As an adult,

1013
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:31,980
I want to...

1014
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,420
Are you planning to confess your love to Jian Shuang?

1015
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:37,740
Yes.

1016
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,860
You will leave soon.

1017
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,260
Don't you think it's not suitable to confess your love to her?

1018
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,740
Listen.

1019
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,180
If you don't confess your love,

1020
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:46,980
you can still be friends.

1021
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,060
You can't even be friends if you confess your love.

1022
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,980
I just don't want

1023
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,060
to be ordinary friends with her anymore.

1024
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,620
Well, take it off.

1025
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:54,740
No.

1026
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,100
Take it off.

1027
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:56,900
Listen.

1028
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,580
Just because I will leave soon,

1029
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,260
I have to take a step forward.

1030
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,140
Can you support me?

1031
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,980
You can take a step forward.

1032
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,300
Don't wrinkle it.

1033
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,210
And

1034
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,380
I'm lending it to you.

1035
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
I'm not giving it to you.

1036
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,820
I know.

1037
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,180
Don't disgrace me.

1038
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,860
Why did you flip up the collar again?

1039
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:36,930
Thanks, Uncle.

1040
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,740
Wish us

1041
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,580
success.

1042
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,820
You're not home?

1043
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,660
Where are you?

1044
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:10,780
Director Jian,

1045
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,140
I've reflected on myself

1046
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,860
at home these days.

1047
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,500
I've thought about it carefully for a long time.

1048
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,260
I really understand.

1049
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,380
I understand your embarrassment that day.

1050
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:19,820
Really.

1051
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,580
Put myself in your position.

1052
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,330
Well,

1053
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,980
if I were you, I would feel awkward too.

1054
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,100
I mean it.

1055
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,020
And I think...

1056
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,380
you were right that day.

1057
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,140
My mom's attitude is very important.

1058
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,780
But I think

1059
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,500
it is not the most important.

1060
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,740
Director Jian,

1061
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,340
just...

1062
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,820
give me one more chance, okay?

1063
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,940
I want to talk to you.

1064
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,060
Just the two of us.

1065
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,140
Talk alone.

1066
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,580
After all,

1067
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,380
it's between us.

1068
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,540
What do you think?

1069
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,020
I promise.

1070
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,850
I promise I won't take too much of your time.

1071
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,860
I won't disturb you either.

1072
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:15,420
I...

1073
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,700
I just want to talk to you.

1074
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,020
I'll leave after that.

1075
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,090
If you...

1076
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,020
If you see my messages,

1077
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,250
give me a reply, okay?

1078
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,100
Or...

1079
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,820
tell me where you are,

1080
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,820
I can go to you.

1081
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:27,580
Okay?
