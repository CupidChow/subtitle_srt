Okay, cut.

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,980
How was it?

7
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,500
It was good.

How should I put it? More beautiful.

Smile more happily.

Your mom is actually very soft-hearted.

106
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,620
She just cares about her appearance.

107
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,940
And your dad is so nice.

108
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,850
He's reliable, a family man,

109
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,980
and humorous.

110
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,180
And your parents have really good taste.

111
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,460
Our set dresser and art director
said to me just now

112
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,300
that such a lovely home

113
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,900
can never be created in a studio.

114
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,700
Our place can't be that nice.

115
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,860
It's obvious that your parents

116
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,540
love this family very much,

117
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,980
and they're very carefully managing it.

118

You didn't see it,

119
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,180
but my mom was crying really hard beside me.

120
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,540
I've never seen her cry like that before.

121
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,260
Your dad's words almost made me cry too.

122
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,180
Be careful.

123
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,820

130
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,490
and done me a huge favor.

131

142

What?

He knows nothing about me.

See for yourself when you get home.

I'll take it then.

What are you doing?

You want to quit?

181
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,270
I know you don't acknowledge me
as your captain.

182
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,270
But you still want to win the tournament,
don't you?

The team is short of players.

If we don't pull together,
 we'll end up at the bottom.

into the men's team.

192
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,550
take a good look at yourself?

193
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,150
Shut up, Luo Tianliang!

194
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,110
She became the captain with her ability.

195
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,870
What's the problem?

196
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,780
Her scoring rate

197
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,070
is the highest on the team.

198
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,630
Her defense is only slightly inferior to yours.

199
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,270
She's never missed a penalty.

200
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,650
Who's been able to do that?

201
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,310
Junjie.

202
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,740
You changed your mind?

203
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,190
Coach,

204
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,110
I probably still won't be able
to play in the tournament.

205
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,030
I apply to be an external assistant.

206
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,549
But whenever I'm free,

207
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,230
I'll come and oversee your training.

208
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,460
From now on,

209
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:43,909
Jian Shuang

210
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,870
is your captain.

211
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,790
If any of you have a problem,

212
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,310
come talk to me!

213
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,430
Captain's jersey.

214
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,260
Here.

215
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,470
Now here's the plan for today's training.

216
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,510
All of you

217
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,870
will do cone dribbling in groups.

218
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,860
Thank you, captain.

219
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,490
You're the captain now.

220
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,010
Smells nice.

221
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:06,920
Come on.

222
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,760
Closer to each other!

223
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,330
Come on, keep up!

224
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,720
Dinner's ready.

225
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,160
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

226
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,360
Tell him dinner's ready.

227
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,880
I'll go get him.

228
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,760
Dad.

229
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,170
Mom says dinner's ready.

230
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,800
Hurry up.

231
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:51,600
The dishes are getting cold.

232
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,040
He's coming.

233
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,530
The fish is fresh.

234
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,210
Mom,

235
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,530
Dad is talking to you.

236
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,890
He didn't say my name.

237
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,600
How would I know he was talking to me?

238
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,610
Yang.

239
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,480
Get me the chili sauce.

240
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,640
Here you go. Thank you.

241
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,920
There's no need

242
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,290
to bother Yang for it.

243
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,130
You can say my name.

244
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,170
Sheng Xiangqian,

245
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,520
Xiangqian or Qian. Any one of those.

246
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,240
I'm not picky.

247
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,160
Actually, call me Qian.

248
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,400
For good fortune.

249
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,170
Is it so hard for you to just say

250
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,000
"Sheng Xiangqian, please go get a spoon"?

251
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,800
Get a spoon.

252
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:09,710
Mom.

253
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,910
Have some more.

254
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:13,980
Thanks, Mom.

255
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,000
You want some?

256
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,080
Sure.

257
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:20,810
It's spicy.

258
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:21,850
It's okay.

259
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:22,930
It's okay.

260
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,490
I can eat spicy food.

261
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,410
You want some?

262
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,610
I'm good.

263
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,490
Of course. I dare not say no.

264
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,820
[Happy Mid-Autumn Festival, Director Jian Bing.]

265
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,800
"Ms. Jian,

266
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,400
thank you.

267
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,010
I got this idea

268
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,730
because of you.

269
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,210
I made this

270
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,530
with your help.

271
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,810
Isn't it kind of

272
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,250
special?

273
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,210
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

274
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,160
The end result is for you.

275
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,290
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival."

276
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

277
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,190
[Happy Mid-Autumn Festival, Director Jian Bing.]

278
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,000
Mr. Wang.

279
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,680
Back from your vacation?

280
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,450
Some local specialties. Have a taste.

281
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,330
Thank you.

282
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:18,680
You're welcome.

283
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,410
See you around.

284
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,290
Yang. Yang.

285
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,770
So,

286
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,920
your team is really good.

287
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,290
They kept everything going
while you were away.

288
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,570
As they were supposed to.

289
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,170
Thank you.

290
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,160
Boss even made an exception
to promote Sheng Yang.

291
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,920
One more go-getter under you.

292
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,930
Right. Go ahead.

293
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,170
Okay, thank you.

294
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,960
Team Leader's back.

295
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,070
You're back.

296
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,520
I'm back.

297
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,880
[Chief Designer]

298
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,530
Well... Let's have a team meeting.

299
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,640
Let's have a meeting.

300
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,680
Come on.

301
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,770
Kind of strange, don't you think?

302
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,250
Is everyone here?

303
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,800
Okay, let's begin.

304
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,360
I brought you some specialties.

305
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,170
Have a taste later.

306
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,520
So,

307
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,760
this colleague from Client Relations told me

308
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,040
that while I was away,

309
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,720
all went smoothly with the project.

310
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,640
Mr. Wang, let me fill you in

311
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,440
on the latest progress...

312
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,320
Sit down, Liu.

313
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,090
Sit down.

314
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,210
I know you were very busy.

315
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,560
You didn't report much.

316
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,490
Actually, while I was away,

317
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,800
I did some self-reflection.

318
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,210
Well,

319
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,760
maybe I was

320
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,080
too harsh on you guys.

321
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,610
I'm an old one.

322
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,280
My ideas are kind of outdated.

323
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,330
Anyway, please bear with me.

324
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,160
Sheng Yang.

325
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,410
Congratulations

326
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,680
on becoming the chief designer.

327
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,730
I'm very happy for you.

328
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:06,930
After all,

329
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,609
I'm your mentor.

330
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,210
Besides,

331
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,000
I kept saying good things

332
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,480
about you in front of the boss

333
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,880
for so many years.

334
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,440
So you should thank me.

335
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,930
Mr. Wang, I really should fill you in.

336
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,410
Okay.

337
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,410
We've received feedback from the client.

338
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,160
They're still not satisfied with our proposal.

339
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,770
Perhaps you could make a decision?

340
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,160
It was Sheng Yang

341
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,800
who was in communication with them, right?

342
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,170
Yes.

343
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:28,770
That's right.

344
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,920
We'll let Sheng Yang decide then.

345
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,730
By the way, Singles' Day is coming.

346
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,280
The Sales Department of Park Hyatt

347
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,410
contacted me

348
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,730
and said they want us to design

349
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,650
the venue for their promotional event

350
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,160
again this year.

351
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,890
As you all know, this is a big order.

352
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,200
The company's revenue in the latter half
of the year will depend on it.

353
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,320
So if you have any ideas,

354
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,490
let us hear them now.

355
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,730
Can I have a go?

356
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,160
It's indeed a big job.

357
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,410
But big companies like them
are also very fussy.

358
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,160
They do this every year, don't they?

359
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,690
And they always want something new.

360
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,480
There're only so many options.

361
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,360
Inviting celebrities or setting up
display stands.

362
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,160
The cost is high while the profit is low.

363
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,360
I think we should consider
Sheng Yang's idea.

364
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,400
He suggested earlier

365
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
that we turn it into an online event.

366
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,720
Wouldn't that be nice?

367
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,480
I know.

368
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,330
But Park Hyatt is an old brand.

369
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,320
Their annual promotional events
follow a set pattern.

370
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,690
And they've set aside the funds for it.

371
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,010
If we don't do it,

372
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,490
some other company will do it.

373
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,890
Why shouldn't we make this money?

374
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,770
Sheng Yang.

375
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:39,970
Sheng Yang?

376
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,490
why don't you think about it?

377
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,440
Don't.

378
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,240
Don't say yes.

379
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,290
Okay, no problem.

380
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,490
Okay, that's it for now.

381
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,120
I'll leave you to it.

382
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,520
What were you thinking?

383
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,600
This project has been a nightmare every year

384
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,720
for the team in charge of it.

385
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,120
Right?

386
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,560
Now that you've been promoted,

387
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,160
Wang doesn't dare to openly bully you,

388
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,080
so he's playing this dirty trick.

389
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,770
I know.

390
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,480
I'm telling you,

391
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,880
if you don't take this lesson today,

392
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,650
don't expect to ever get your phone

393
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,640
or your motorcycle back.

394
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,920
-Playing this trick with me?
-Old fogey.

395
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:12,270
[A Lifelong Pursuit]

396
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:14,680
We'll pause for a minute.

397
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,240
Okay.

398
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,410
Hello.

399
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,680
Hello, sis.

400
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,890
What?

401
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,080
Are you busy?

402
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,320
Yes.

403
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,080
I know you're busy.

404
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,530
But I do have a favor to ask.

405
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,490
I really can't find anyone else to help me.

406
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,880
I can't help you either.

407
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:36,920
But...

408
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,000
Sis, you haven't even asked me what it is.

409
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,080
Because I don't want to know.

410
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,490
Please, I...

411
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:43,930
It's something important.

412
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,000
Have you ever called me
for anything important?

413
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,730
Go ahead.

414
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,320
Sis, well...

415
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,490
Our captain Hao Junjie

416
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,050
is trapped at home

417
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,330
by his uncle Fang.

418
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,320
Our training is not over yet.

419
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,930
The coach is not here.

420
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,320
We can't do without him.

421
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,250
Can you help figure something out?

422
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,720
But how can I help you with that?

423
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,000
You want me to train you guys?

424
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,840
Sis, please.

425
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,720
I...

426
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,000
Surely you can figure something out.

427
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,770
I...

428
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,520
I know I'm not well behaved most of the time.

429
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,930
I'm not studying hard.

430
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,610
It's wrong of me.

431
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,770
But this tournament

432
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,810
is really important to us.

433
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,330
I'm going to graduate soon.

434
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,720
We're all going our separate ways.

435
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,490
Going to graduate school, going abroad,

436
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,080
or going into civil service.

437
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,490
We'll become adults who follow the crowd.

438
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,280
I won't be able to bring everyone together

439
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,520
to play ice hockey again

440
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,890
by then.

441
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,560
Hao Junjie was going to leave the team.

442
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,800
He came back because of me this time.

443
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,480
This is probably

444
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,200
the most rebellious thing
he's ever done in his life.

445
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,570
"In his life"?

446
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,760
How old are you guys

447
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,160
to say something like that?

448
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,160
Sis,

449
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,730
I'm begging you. Please help me.

450
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,010
Conditions?

451
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,930
You name them.

452
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,930
Don't fail any course again this semester,

453
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:15,680
okay?

454
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,810
I don't want to get

455
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,160
any more calls from your counselor.

456
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,330
What...

457
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,640
What if I've failed already?

458
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,730
Take the make-up exam!

459
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,680
What if I fail the make-up exam?

460
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,770
Bye.

461
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,560
No, wait. I'll take the exam.

462
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,250
Also,

463
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,880
complete your studies

464
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,280
after this ice hockey tournament.

465
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,800
You'll have to start looking
for internships next year.

466
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,210
Got it.

467
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,160
Have you passed CET-6?

468
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,010
No.

469
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,560
You must pass it the next semester.

470
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,320
I haven't passed CET-4 yet.

471
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,200
Aren't you ashamed of it?

472
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,330
Pass both then.

473
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,320
Why do you have so many conditions?

474
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,000
I...

475
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,570
The reception is bad here.

476
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,280
Fine, I got it.

477
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,320
I promise you.

478
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,050
Put it in writing.

479
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,330
If you fail to fulfill it,

480
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,880
I'll put your ice hockey uniform up
online for sale.

481
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,690
I'm telling you.

482
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,240
Fine.

483
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,770
I will.

484
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,720
So...

485
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,360
you've agreed.

486
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,280
Put it in writing first.

487
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,760
Send me a photo of it when you're done.

488
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,160
This is for your own good.

489
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,570
Do you want to go abroad or not?

490
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,210
You think it's easy to make
these appointments?

491
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,530
Two grand per hour.

492
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,570
Coming.

493
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,130
Ms. Bai.

494
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,320
Sorry, I'm a little late today.

495
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,160
No, I'm sorry.

496
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,610
-To make you come all this way.
-There was a traffic jam.

497
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,290
If Junjie's studies can...

498
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,930
Get up and say hello to Ms. Bai!

499
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,210
Hello, Ms. Bai.

500
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,330
The same room as before?

501
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,010
Yes, the same room.

502
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,560
Get up!

503
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,080
Just a moment, Ms. Bai.

504
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,090
Okay.

505
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,570
Junjie, hurry up!

506
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,120
Coming.

507
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,760
So much trouble.

508
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,640
Hello, Ms. Bai.

509
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,730
Have you warmed up your fingers?

510
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,600
Not yet.

511
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,720
Hurry up and do that.

512
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,000
We'll start when you're ready.

513
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,370
Excuse me, Ms. Bai.

514
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,920
Your fingers are not separate enough.

515
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,000
Right.

516
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,080
I'll practice a bit more.

517
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:39,810
Who is it?

518
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,000
Is this Mr. Fang's place?

519
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,480
Yes.

520
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,570
Hello, Mr. Fang.

521
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,800
I'm Jian Shuang's sister, Jian Bing.

522
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,610
I remember you.

523
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,090
What brings you here?

524
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:55,880
I'm sorry

525
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,520
for disturbing you.

526
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,530
There's something I'd like
to consult you about.

527
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,760
How do you know my address?

528
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,520
Jian Shuang gave it to me.

529
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,880
Don't stand at the door. Come in.

530
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:09,720
Come in.

531
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,760
Shall I change my shoes?

532
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,690
No, no, no.

533
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,130
Make yourself at home.

534
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,010
Have a seat here.

535
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,880
You were saying Jian Shuang gave you

536
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,680
my address?

537
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,490
Yes.

538
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,290
Yes.

539
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,560
What would you like?

540
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,730
Tea or coffee?

541
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,720
Coffee.

542
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,800
Okay. Nice.

543
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,320
I have some fresh coffee beans.

544
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,160
Right.

545
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,960
I'll make you a cup.

546
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,890
Take your time.

547
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
I'll get the door, Ms. Bai.

548
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,360
Jian Shuang is asking for you.

549
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,930
You take care of her.

550
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,010
I'll take care of your uncle.

551
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,810
Be quick.

552
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,090
Be quick.

553
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,600
There're so many pictures here.

554
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,520
They're all related to music.

555
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,400
Such a big photo.

556
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,160
I took this on my trip to New York.

557
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,160
Brooklyn Bridge.

558
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,640
Ms. Bai, I think I need to practice this

559
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,400
for a bit longer.

560
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,480
Go ahead.

561
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,160
Do you like these coffee beans?

562
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,090
Have a smell first.

563
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,320
We'll use these then.

564
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,530
Do you usually like it

565
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,010
strong or weak?

566
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,330
Either, as long as it's not sour.

567
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,170
So you like dark roast coffee.

568
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,490
So that's called "dark roast," right?

569
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,090
Yes.

570
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,530
What do you want the proportion
of water to be?

571
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,440
-Fifteen to one?
-I...

572
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,160
I don't know.

573
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,760
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

574
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,560
Junjie is practicing the piano.

575
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,080
He plays so well.

576
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,560
By the way, what did you say
you are here for?

577
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,640
I hope you won't laugh at me.

578
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,330
Jian Shuang's counselor called me today

579
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,010
and told me she's failed some courses.

580
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,480
She'll have problem graduating
if she doesn't retake these courses

581
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,210
or take the make-up exams.

582
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,330
I was worried

583
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,750
and didn't know what to do.

584
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,490
Then I suddenly thought of you.

585
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,690
I see.

586
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,320
It's actually okay to fail courses.

587
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,720
This happens to some students every year.

588
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,200
Jian Shuang is only a sophomore now,
isn't she?

589
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,400
But she's doing too badly as a sophomore.

590
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,040
She's already failed three courses now.

591
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,480
How is she going to manage going forward?

592
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,160
Three courses?

593
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,090
Why are you stopping?

594
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,800
Ms. Bai, I...

595
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,490
My stomach hurts.

596
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:28,640
Go ahead.

597
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,680
Okay.

598
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,210
What courses are they? Are they
elective or compulsory?

599
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,760
Her counselor sent me her transcript.

600
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,330
I printed it out.

601
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,170
Please take a look.

602
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,650
Hold it for me.

603
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,360
I'll hold this.

604
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,680
I'll make your coffee.

605
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,490
This compulsory course...

606
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,010
It's not too difficult.

607
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:08,760
For a specialized course,

608
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,680
you just...

609
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,530
go see the instructor

610
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,640
and make a request.

611
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,160
So you have to make a request?

612
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,770
Yes, to get her a place
in the make-up exam.

613
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,520
Let me take care of it.

614
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,120
Don't worry.

615
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,480
It's even easier with these electives.

616
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,520
Just reselect two courses

617
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,290
on the school's website later.

618
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,050
[Jiangbei Music Academy Undergraduate Transcript]
[Jian Shuang]

619
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,920
Right.

620
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,690
So it depends on whether
it's elective or compulsory.

621
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,240
Yes.

622
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,490
Let me take a look.

623
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,480
This is... One compulsory course,

624
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,800
and two electives, right?

625
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,600
Yes.

626
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,080
Right?

627
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,880
Don't worry.

628
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,490
Do you want more water in it or less?

629
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,770
Well...

630
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,800
I don't know.

631
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,130
So you know the instructor?

632
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,210
Yes.

633
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,200
We're quite close.

634
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,200
Thank you.

635
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,240
I'll take care of it.

636
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,520
What a coincidence.

637
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,770
You have a nephew and I have a sister.

638
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,810
Both of them are troublesome.

639
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,600
No,

640
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,400
it's mostly Jian Shuang who's troublesome.

641
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,690
Junjie is a good kid.

642
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,560
Did someone leave just now?

643
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,240
Hao Junjie!

644
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,010
Ms. Jian,

645
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,640
you're not here just for your sister, are you?

646
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,440
Th-This is all for my sister.

647
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,560
You let him go, right?

648
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,210
Do you know how hard it is to book
an appointment with this teacher?

649
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,160
Two grand an hour!

650
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Just to record a video for the interview!

651
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,530
There's a reason I'm not letting him

652
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,770
participate in the tournament.

653
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,120
They're all still just kids,
who can be reckless

654
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,570
when they're playing.

655
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,480
What if he gets injured or a fracture?

656
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,890
What should I say to his parents
if he misses his exams

657
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,480
or important opportunities because of that?

658
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,600
I think I've really made a mistake.

659
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,450
Well...

660
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,370
How about this?

661
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,640
Let's go to the school and catch them.

662
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,490
Sorry, I got...

663
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,170
a little worked up.

664
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:12,560
No, no,

665
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,330
you should be angry.

666
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,960
It's been a while since I was
criticized by someone.

667
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,360
I think you were right.

668
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,890
Just a moment. I...

669
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:22,760
Okay.

670
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,240
I'll get changed.

671
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,640
Okay.

672
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,200
Great shot!

673
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,810
Come on!

674
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,310
Come on!

675
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,480
Can we take a break now?

676
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,200
What's point of practicing like this?
We're exhausted!

677
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,440
We really need a break.

678
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,000
It's a waste of our time and energies.

679
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,320
What can you do? She is the captain.

680
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,800
We have to listen to her.

681
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,520
If this is how we practice,

682
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,850
we might as well put a dog in front of us

683
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,200
and have it drag us along, right?

684
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,410
At least we'll be fast.

685
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,090
Wouldn't it have the same effect?

686
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,930
There's no cooperation, right?

687
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,680
There's no speed.

688
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,920
There're no tactics.

689
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,890
There's nothing.

690
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,200
We're just pouring away our energies.

691
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,120
No amount of food can sustain us
through something like this.

692
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,570
Come on. That's a bit too much.

693
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:29,240
Jian Shuang.

694
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,880
You're finally here.

695
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,130
Your sister saved me.

696
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,490
Ignore them.

697
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,530
Let's go.

698
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,640
Let's rehearse that set-up we designed.

699
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,480
Go on!

700
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,240
Come on.

701
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:58,890
Come on.

702
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,730
They're here.

703
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,050
Look.

704
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,080
Oh my god.

705
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,400
Is little Jian Shuang going to

706
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,880
be sent flying?

707
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,489
So how are we going to catch them?

708
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:16,040
What's Junjie's jersey number?

709
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,010
No. 32. That one in white.

710
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:23,889
Pass it!

711
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,730
No. 32 is Jian Shuang, no?

712
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,810
It's true.

713
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,400
Where is Junjie?

714
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:40,730
Mr. Fang,

715
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,810
they're in the middle of a game.

716
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,530
We shouldn't interrupt them.

717
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,679
Why don't we watch till they finish?

718
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:47,120
It's quite interesting.

719
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,239
And this is my first time.

720
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,239
Okay.

721
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,280
I'll find you a place.

722
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,199
You can see for yourself

723
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,679
how dangerous this sport is.

724
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,050
-This way.
-Okay.

725
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:00,760
This way.

726
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,450
This way.

727
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,600
Have a seat.

728
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,000
That No.17 who just scored is Hao Junjie.

729
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,450
This is so interesting.

730
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,230
They're all dressed like loaves of bread.

731
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,240
They look like a bunch of LEGO Minifigures.

732
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,730
"Interesting"?

733
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,860
It's dangerous!

734
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,800
This is really your first time
watching a game?

735
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,720
Believe me,

736
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,360
it's really very hard to book an appointment

737
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,480
with that piano teacher.

738
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,920
Let's get down to business.

739
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,640
Junjie should record that video

740
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,050
in our company.

741
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:53,650
We have

742
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,370
a very professional recording studio.

743
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,010
Come on,

744
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,090
let's add each other on WeChat.

745
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,530
You can make an appointment anytime.

746
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Is it really okay?

747
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,960
Let me know the price.

748
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:03,840
I'll pay.

749
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,810
No, I'm sorry for what I did earlier.

750
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,690
Jian Shuang and I have this
peculiar relationship

751
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,730
where

752
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,280
sometimes I have to be her parent,

753
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,690
sometimes I'm her sister,

754
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,240
and occasionally I kind of enjoy

755
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,720
getting into mischief with her.

756
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,880
So your username is "Cool Breeze"?

757
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,720
Yes.

758
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,560
As in, "A cool breeze is blowing gently."

759
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,370
It suits you.

760
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,000
Be careful!

761
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,210
Hao Junjie, be careful!

762
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,530
There's a lot of physical contact

763
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,880
and it's very dangerous.

764
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,680
Come on, Jian Shuang!

765
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,650
-Look.
-Nice shot!

766
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,930
These college students

767
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,130
are wasting their time.

768
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,680
They're young.

769
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,080
Young people's time is for wasting.

770
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,520
Pushing the boundaries.

771
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,920
But that's a fallacy.

772
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,400
It's true when they are

773
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,130
in their 20s.

774
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,880
The whole world belongs to them.

775
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,090
Who hasn't taken a wrong path

776
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,850
or made a mistake?

777
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,930
When they get self-reflective one day

778
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,490
and start to follow the rules,

779
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,320
they'll be entering into middle age.

780
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,320
So you're saying

781
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,040
we should just let them be

782
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,920
and forget about school?

783
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,250
Now you're just trying to contradict me.

784
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,920
You can't just give up one thing

785
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,890
because of another.

786
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,050
Work hard, play hard.

787
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,760
I know Jian Shuang can be irresponsible

788
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,080
and fails her courses sometimes.

789
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,640
Come on, Jian Shuang!

790
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,450
But I can't make her stop playing ice hockey

791
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,840
or doing other things that she really enjoys

792
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,050
just because she's failed
some courses, can I?

793
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,650
Wouldn't that be the same as killing her?

794
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,240
We get killed many times in this life,

795
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,520
especially women.

796
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,930
On the day of graduation,

797
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,520
the day we start work,

798
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:44,040
the day we get married,
and the day we give birth to a child.

799
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,680
Each time we're killed,

800
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,250
we lose a bit of our edge.

801
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,160
Well...

802
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,370
Look,

803
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,330
I'm not against them being passionate
about sports.

804
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,770
But this sport

805
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,090
is too dangerous.

806
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,090
If they really like sports,

807
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,640
they can switch to some other sport.

808
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,680
But this...

809
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,400
This won't do.

810
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,770
You're indulging them.

811
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,520
They are still kids.

812
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,280
That's because you treat them like kids.

813
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,120
Kids nowadays mature much earlier

814
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,370
than we used to.

815
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,680
You think they don't know the things

816
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,760
we're telling them?

817
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,240
They do.

818
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,920
Why are they still the same?

819
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,840
Because they have their own ideas

820
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,320
and their own personalities.

821
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,360
But you only get so much time in this life,

822
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,530
and this limited amount of time

823
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:22,640
should be spent on meaningful

824
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,760
and worthy things.

825
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,490
What is meaningful?

826
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,920
What is worthy?

827
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,560
For example, they are

828
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,240
all students, right?

829
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,450
As a student,

830
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,490
you should study hard.

831
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,880
When you graduate and step into society,

832
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,010
find a good job...

833
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,280
And find a good spouse and have a good child.

834
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,760
Isn't this what life is like

835
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,160
for most people in this world?

836
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,370
But who gets to decide what is meaningful

837
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,770
and what is worthy?

838
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,530
Everyone has their own criteria.

839
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,330
You do have a point.

840
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,170
Why do I feel like

841
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,570
you're preaching at me?

842
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,360
No, no.

843
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,530
I wouldn't dare.

844
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,200
What does it mean? The whistle.

845
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,210
It means it's time for an intermission.

846
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,130
A standard period of ice hockey
usually lasts for 20 minutes,

847
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,850
and there're 15-minute intermissions
between the periods.

848
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,870
Well done.

849
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,930
Why are they here?

850
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,680
I don't know.

851
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,850
I wonder what they're mumbling about.

852
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,570
Thinking of ways to punish us?

853
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,500
No way.

854
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,650
My sister is not that kind of person.

855
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,510
Let's go.

856
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,150
Where are Hao Junjie and Jian Shuang?

857
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,270
That's them, right?

858
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:45,230
Yes.

859
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,830
Are they running away?

860
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,030
Are we still going to catch them?

861
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,270
Yes.

862
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,270
Go ahead.

863
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,110
And remember to scold Jian Shuang for me.

864
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,110
I'm heading back to the company.

865
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:53,590
Okay.

866
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:53,990
Come on.

867
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,390
We'll...

868
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,830
-Talk to you on WeChat.
-Talk to you on WeChat.

869
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,960
Where are the pickles?

870
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,370
You cook less well

871
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,720
when Yang's not home for dinner.

872
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,250
Have you eaten?

873
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,240
You didn't make soup.

874
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,600
You wrote them down yesterday,

875
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,090
and now you're bargaining with me already?

876
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,080
Don't you know how contracts work?

877
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,730
I'm not listening to your excuses.
Make your own arrangements.

878
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:27,880
I only care about results.

879
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,400
I don't know what came over me yesterday

880
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,080
that made me do that awful favor for you.

881
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,200
Stop pestering Hao Junjie.

882
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,330
You're beyond my control,

883
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,320
but I think he's fairly happy
to obey his uncle.

884
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,930
Do you hear me, Jian Shuang?

885
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,770
Hello. Good morning.

886
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,760
Morning.

887
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,530
I want to come to the set with you today

888
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:53,320
and learn from you guys.

889
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:54,210
Is it okay?
