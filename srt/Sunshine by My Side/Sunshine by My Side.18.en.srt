167
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,900
I'll go get them.

168
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,220
No need. Let the waiters serve them...

Come on, have a seat.

172
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,890
It's so kind of you.

173
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,500
I also wanted to make it more casual.

174
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,940
Actually, I counted.

175
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,740
We've only seen each other twice, so we don't know each other very well.

176

It was quite awkward for me

177
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,620
to ask you out.

178
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,100
But apart from you,

179
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
I don't know

180
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,860
anyone else in this industry.

181
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,260
I understand.

182
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,900
Feel free to tell me what you need.

183
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,020
I'll do my best

184
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,940
within my capabilities.

185
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,900
I'll say it then.

186
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,540
Sheng Yang has been looking for a job recently.

187
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,700
That kid is thin-skinned.

188
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,740
He didn't tell you that he lost his job, did he?

189
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,460
No.

190
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,250
When did it happen?

191
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,580
I don't know.

192
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,700
I didn't dare to ask.

[Let's Sway Twin Oars]

194
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:01,940
You're here.

195
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,580
When did you start liking this?

196
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,380
Order yourself.

197
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,460
Boss. I want mine with extra fried tofu skin,

198
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,940
pork intestines,

199
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,340
and a fried egg.

200
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,300
Extra spicy and hot,

201
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,380
with two spoonful of vinegar, right?

202
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,300
Right.

203
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,860
Got it.

204
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,450
Even the boss knows you.

205
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,940
You've never mentioned this restaurant before.

206
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,060
Boss, I want the same thing as his.

207
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,500
But no vinegar, please.

208
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,340
No problem.

Just a moment.

210
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,140
Okay.

Young man,

212
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,180
why didn't your girlfriend come with you today?

213
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,700
Girlfriend?

214
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,060
She can't eat spicy food recently.

215

How's your job hunting going?

00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,140
What do you think?

219
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,900
All those companies' HR turned me down for reference checking.

220
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,580
I guess Wang badmouthed us behind our back.

221
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,580
Isn't it the same with you?

222

Take care.

223

Let me tell you something.

224
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,100
I think my mom

225
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,900
knows that I lost my job.

226
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,770
How did she know?

227
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,260
How could I know how she knew?

228
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,740
I mean how did you know that she knows?

229
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,580
She called you, didn't she?

230
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,140
She did, once.

231
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,890
You must have slipped it out.

232
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,060
No way.

233
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,580
What I said in that phone call was perfect

234
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,980
and flawless.

235
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,300
Forget it. She got to know about it some way.

236
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
I just feel like

237
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,180
she's been acting strange lately.

238
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,820
She's been cooking extra dishes for me every meal

239
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,180
and putting apples in my bag.

240
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,140
And the way she's been talking

241
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,980
is way more gentle than before.

242
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,740
So weird.

243
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,980
So you two

244
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,460
are both acting in front of each other now?

245
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,340
I was thinking about telling her about this

246
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,340
after I find a new job.

247
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,860
It's okay. It won't take long

248
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,620
for you to find a job.

249
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,460
Don't worry.

250
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,260
That kid has always been like this.

251
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,260
He only tells us good news, and hides bad news from us.

252
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,060
He keeps everything to himself.

253
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,900
He wouldn't tell me or his dad.

254
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,940
I thought

255
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,180
I'd turn a blind eye to it.

256
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,620
Because I thought a little setback

257
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,940
is good for him.

258
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,220
But it's been almost two weeks.

259
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,580

260
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,900
instead of staying at home.

261
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,900
He's been out there, running around the city.

262
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,140
He lost a lot of weight.

I feel

264
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,740
really bad for him.

265
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,820

You're so funny.

272
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,580
Just say it.

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,060
Here's what I think.

274
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,300
You must know a lot of people since you have your own company.

please get an interview for Sheng Yang.

00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,250
Okay?

Oh, right.

282
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,220
Well,

283
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,780
this is his resume. Take a look.

[Sheng Yang's Personal Portfolio]

285
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,700
Although Sheng Yang is my son and I am his mother,

286
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,770
I don't really know

287
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,250
if he's capable and reliable

289
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,500
I'm thinking maybe you can

00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,740
let him have a try and get him an interview.

291
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,700
Or let him work there for a few days.

292
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,500
If he's not capable enough,

293
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,780
you can ask him to leave.

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,660
you see...

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,660
I see what you mean.

297
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,580
I'll keep Sheng Yang's resume.

Actually, I worked with Sheng Yang once.

He is very capable.

300
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,900
So you don't have to worry.

301
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,740
Our company happens to be hiring now.

302
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,700
I'll ask the HR

303
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,130
to give him a strict assessment.

304
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,100
So this doesn't count as using my connections.

305
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,500
I think it's more like

306
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,380
having a talent sent to our company.

307
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,890
Really?

308
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,740
That's great.

309
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,300
That's really great.

310
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,980
Sorry for the trouble.

311

Just you and me.

320
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,010
This has nothing to do

321
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,140
with Sheng Yang's job.

322
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,780
Okay.

I think we get along well.

327

Can we become

328
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,980
friends, like sisters?

329
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,860
Just like those young sisters.

330
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,940
They can hang out together.

331
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,500
They can go watch a movie,

332
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,100
go to a bar,

333
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,940
or have a spa together.

334
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,860
We can do that too, right?

335
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,660
Of course,

336
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,730
the premise is

337
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,340
if you don't mind that I'm old.

338
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,060
I don't.

339
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,860
Okay.

340
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,500
How have you been with Jian Bing lately?

341
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,500
I sent her a few WeChat messages.

342
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,780
She said she was fine.

343
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,100
And only a few check-in messages

344
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,370
after that.

345
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,220
What are you thinking?

346
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,660
That was such a good opportunity.

347
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,260
You should have talked to her more and got closer to her.

348
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,540
You're just too self-conscious.

349
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,740
For real.

350
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,700
It hurts your pride

351
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,220
that she turned you down once.

352
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,460
So you stay away from her.

353
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,100
You know what?

354
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,660
When dealing with a woman, you have to be good to her constantly,

355
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,220
and push her along non-stop.

356
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,580
Isn't she cold like a piece of ice?

357
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,730
She's still a fragile piece of ice now,

358
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,380
while you are like the sun.

359
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,980
You have to warm her

360
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,860
and melt her,

361
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,020
right?

362
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,740
When did you become a relationship expert?

363
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,260
I've always been an expert, okay?

364
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,060
Haven't you heard that saying?

365
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,060
A man needs to get married first before he builds his career.

366
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,060
You're not getting any luck in your career now.

367
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,140
What does that mean?

368
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,020
It means now is the time

369
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,700
for you to be lucky in your love life.

370
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,089
Listen.

371
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,540
If you still don't get to hold her hands

372
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,290
before I go back to my hometown,

373
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,579
I won't be able to leave in peace.

374
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,220
What do you mean?

375
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,579
You're going back to your hometown?

376
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,940
What's going on?

377
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,580
My dad knew I lost my job,

378
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,900
so he transferred me some money.

379
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,140
Not much. Only 30,000 yuan.

380
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,260
What are you thinking?

381
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,220
After I got the money,

382
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,780
I paid the bills for my credit card,

383
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,090
Ant Credit Pay, and JD Baitiao.

384
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,220
There was 10,000 yuan left after that.

385
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,940
My rent is 4,000 yuan.

386
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,500
I can last for a month and a half, considering my life expenses.

387
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,050
But as the saying goes,

388
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,020
people will fight to live

389
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,540
when confronted with the danger of death.

390
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,740
Also, wealth is obtained from taking risks.

391
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,740
So, money

392
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,260
is not for saving.

393
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,460
We need to let money have its babies.

394
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,580
Speak in human language, Bro.

395
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,900
What do you want to do exactly?

396
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,740
I made a reservation for tonight

397
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,540
and invited some clients we used to be on good terms with.

398
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,220
Look.

399
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,500
We can drink, sing karaoke,

400
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,060
and get closer to them.

401
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,660
They have pretty good background.

402
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,060
I think after this meal,

403
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,940
they may offer us jobs.

404
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,180
Think about it.

405
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,500
A meal will cost

406
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,460
5,000 yuan.

407
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,300
But they may find us

408
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,220
jobs with a salary of 20,000 yuan a month.

409
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,100
Don't you think

410
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,730
it's worth it?

411
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,570
Let me ask you.

412
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,580
Do you know what you should do now?

413
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,540
Well.

414
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,740
Although I don't have much money now,

415
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,780
I can still pay for this meal.

416
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,260
Song Chen.

417
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,740
I'm talking to you.

418
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,260
Just because you bought them drinks,

419
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,860
they'd offer you jobs?

420
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,340
I'm telling you, clients are clients.

421
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,370
They didn't treat you well

422
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,460
because of who you are.

423
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,700
It was only because you were from July Advertising.

424
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,460
What's behind the clients are their companies,

425
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,570
and companies only hire people for their ability and qualifications.

426
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,380
If you're really good,

427
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,930
you don't have to buy them drinks.

428
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,580
They will come to you themselves.

429
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,060
Friends need to be made, right?

430
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,180
Friends?

431
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,100
Bro, wake up, okay?

432
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,500
Will they

433
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,060
treat you as a friend?

434
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,090
What can I do now?

435
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,340
I can't find a job.

436
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,380
I can't just

437
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,900
stay at home, play games,

438
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,900
and eat instant noodles all day, right?

439
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,460
I just want to make some changes.

440
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,740
I just want to take a risk.

441
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,060
Tonight.

442
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,900
Either I become friends with those bosses,

443
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,900
or I'll go back to my hometown after that.

444
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,330
Just tell me if you'll go with me.

445
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,300
Song Chen, listen to me.

446
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,660
Don't go.

447
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,500
Find an excuse and cancel it.

448
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,260
I've invited them.

449
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,380
And I've made a reservation.

450
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,460
I can't cancel it.

451
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,300
Forget it if you don't want to come.

452
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,760
[Sheng Yang]

453
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,160
[Are you feeling better?]

454
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,230
[Come on!]

455
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,290
Here's to you.

456
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:58,900
Cheers.

457
00:20:59,330 --> 00:20:59,980
Let's drink together.

458
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,660
Okay.

459
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,900
Come on. Let's have a drink together.

460
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,500
Come on.

461
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,940
Let me know if you need anything.

462
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,700
Okay?

463
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,940
Go propose toasts with me.

464
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,140
Why are you sitting here?

465
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,660
Go propose toasts yourself.

466
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,580
Don't drink too much.

467
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,740
Don't drink too much.

468
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,580
The gesture is enough.

469
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,780
Alright.

470
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,500
Handsome, let's have a drink.

471
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,300
Bro.

472
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,780
Come on.

473
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,660
We're here to have fun.

474
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,300
Let's drink.

475
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,380
Have fun.

476
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,380
-Drink up.
-Drink some.

477
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,220
Okay.

478
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,500
Water is enough for me.

479
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,940
It's boring to drink water. Have some wine.

480
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,820
I'm allergic to alcohol.

481
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,860
Waiter.

482
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,490
Bring us some more wine.

483
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,300
Okay, Sir.

484
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,940
Thank you.

485
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,650
How boring it is to play on your phone.

486
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,900
Come on.

487
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,060
Come on. Let's drink together.

488
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,340
Your girlfriend?

489
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,660
Is she checking on you?

490
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,720
[Jian Bing]

491
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,220
So I guessed it right.

492
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,100
Give it back.

493
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,380
I need to take this. Give it back to me.

494
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,460
I...

495
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,380
Hey.

496
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,420
Okay.

497
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,180
Where are you going? My phone!

498
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:14,940
What are you doing?

499
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,660
Hey.

500
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,180
What are you doing? I need to take this call.

501
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:17,780
Give it to me.

502
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,900
I just wanted to take you

503
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,860
-somewhere quieter
-Come on.

504
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,860
to answer the phone.

505
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,220
Hello?

506
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,500
What are you doing?

507
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,140
I'm outside.

508
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,780
What's up?

509
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,060
Anything wrong?

510
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,460
Is it a good time to talk?

511
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,500
Yes. Go ahead.

512
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,220
Go ahead. What's wrong?

513
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,180
It's nothing.

514
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,180
We can talk tomorrow if it's not a good time for you.

515
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,820
It's okay. I can talk.

516
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,250
Handsome, I'm so cold.

517
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,820
Can I borrow your coat?

518
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,180
Wait a minute.

519
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,500
What are you doing? I'm on the phone.

520
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,340
You're not a gentleman at all.

521
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,540
You don't even want to lend me your coat.

522
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,220
I brought you here.

523
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,180
So boring.

524
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,460
Hello?

525
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,340
That was just some random drunk.

526
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,180
I don't know her.

527
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,180
Don't overthink it.

528
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,900
I...

529
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,820
Actually,

530
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,700
I...

531
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,340
I heard that

532
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,980
you're looking for a new job.

533
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,770
How did you know?

534
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,100
It doesn't matter.

535
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,540
Our company is hiring...

536
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,340
No need.

537
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,340
I mean

538
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,220
I can find a job on my own.

539
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,700
I don't need your help. Thank you.

540
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,420
Are you sure?

541
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,740
Our company really wants to hire you.

542
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,730
Are you sure you don't want an interview?

543
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,220
Yes.

544
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,090
Very sure.

545
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,740
Okay.

546
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,380
If you need anything...

547
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,940
Handsome, are you done?

548
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,860
I'm freezing to death.

549
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,980
Have fun.

550
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,180
Hello?

551
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,500
Hello?

552
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,340
Didn't you see I was on the phone?

553
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,500
What do you want?

554
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,540
Why are you so testy?

555
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,700
I was just worried that you'd get lost

556
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,810
and couldn't find which room it is.

00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,380
Get me a bin.

568
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,140
Here.

569
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,810
I feel so sick.

570
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:53,900
All right. You'll be better after throwing up.

571
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,060
Here, wipe your mouth.

572
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,540
Have some water.

573
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,460
The wine must be adulterated, you know?

574
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,980
Feeling better?

575
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,260
Yang.

576
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,900
I'm sorry.

577
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,180
I shouldn't have treated them to drinks today.

578
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,740
I just want to make money in a decent way, right?

579
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,980
So that I can take you to fancy dinners

580
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,140
and have you covered in the future, right?

581
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,060
Okay, I got it.

582
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,060
Don't worry.

583
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,140
After I find a job,

584
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,890
I'll pay your rent for you.

585
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,540
I won't let you sleep on the street.

586
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,020
Yang.

587
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,820
I feel so sorry.

588
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,740
I shouldn't have treated them to drinks today.

589
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,260
But I just hope I can

590
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,380
-take you to fancy dinners.
-fancy dinners.

591
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,140
You know?

592
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,860
I know.

593
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,730
-I know, Bro.
-I hope I can have you covered.

594
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,940
Alright.

595
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,220
Get some rest.

596
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,180
-You vomited so much.
-I'm sorry.

597
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,140
You don't need to say sorry.

598
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,250
I'm the one who should say sorry.

599
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,140
I shouldn't have let you drink so much.

600
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,940
I shouldn't have let you drink adulterated wine.

601
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,020
Lift your legs.

602
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:09,860
Come on

603
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,180
Sorry, Yang.

604
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,020
Alright, stop talking.

605
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,620
Go to sleep.

606
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,860
Have a good sleep.

607
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:27,940
Water.

608
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,380
I'm putting it on the table.

609
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,380
I'm leaving.

610
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,140
With me here,

611
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,700
everything's going to be okay.

612
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,300
Everything's going to be okay.

613
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,580
Yang.

614
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,380
I've washed the apples and pears for you.

615
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,740
You can eat them directly,

616
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,540
or wash them again before eating.

617
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,380
I made you

618
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,460
beef with tomatoes

619
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,220
and fried eggs with chopped chili.

620
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,140
Mom.

621
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,220
Don't prepare these things for me anymore.

622
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,380
What will you eat if I don't?

623
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,770
I lost my job.

624
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,820
You lost your job?

625
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,050
When did that happen?

626
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,340
Enough, Madam Luo.

627
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,140
You already knew. Why are you still acting?

628
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,580
Your acting was too dramatic.

629
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:43,900
Have a seat.

630
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,980
How would I know?

631
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,820
What happened?

632
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,100
I'll tell you about it in detail

633
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,820
in case you overthink it.

634
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,220
It's because of a project I was in charge of.

635
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,820
There was a stage accident.

636
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,620
The specific reason is still under investigation.

637
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,540
I've been following up as well,

638
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,220
but there's no result yet.

639
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,860
So I may not be able to find a new job

640
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,180
for the time being.

641
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,180
Because on surface, it seems that the accident

642
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,700
happened

643
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,580
because of an error in my design.

644
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,540
But don't worry.

645
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,940
I have some savings.

646
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,020
I'm also taking on some part-time projects.

647
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,460
I should be able to support myself.

648
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,900
The money I give you every month

649
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,780
will also be paid as usual.

650
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,420
Not a penny less.

651
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,020
No.

652
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,410
I don't care about this.

653
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,250
I don't care about this.

654
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:41,660
Mom.

655
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,540
You have to trust me.

656
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,380
The cause of the accident

657
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,620
was definitely not my design.

658
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,460
After the truth is revealed,

659
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,020
I'm sure I can find a better job.

660
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,700
It's just...

661
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,620
Can you stop asking Jian Bing for help?

662
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,140
I only did it because

663
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,460
you didn't tell us

664
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,940
about such a big matter.

665
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,580
You keep it to yourself all the time.

666
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,420
You've been looking for a job

667
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,620
out there,

668
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,620
and you had to act in front of us

669
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,780
when you came back home.

670
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,860
I feel

671
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,140
really bad.

672
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,780
You're only 26,

673
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,060
and you're already under so much pressure.

674
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,380
But your dad and I can't help you at all.

675
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,940
Mom, don't be like this.

676
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,010
Yang.

677
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,620
I also want to give you the best.

678
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,420
But your dad and I don't have the ability.

679
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,620
In the end, you're on your own.

680
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,340
Mom.

681
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,060
It's normal for young people to lose jobs and get new ones.

682
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,420
Luo Meijuan, let me ask you.

683
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,980
Do you believe in your son?

684
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,540
Of course I believe in you.

685
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,220
You've always been a good boy.

686
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,060
You never made me worry.

687
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,180
That's it.

688
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,620
Don't worry about this as well.

689
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,260
Just believe

690
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,780
I can take care of it.

691
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,100
I've been working so hard since I was a kid

692
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,540
so that you and my dad can rely on me

693
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,860
instead of me relying on you all the time.

694
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,730
It's not a bad thing to rely on others.

695
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,780
We want you to

696
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,420
rely on us.

697
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,420
Wipe your tears.

698
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,140
Stop crying, Mom.

699
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,940
That's why

700
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,770
I secretly went to see Jian Bing.

701
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,660
I don't want you to struggle that hard.

702
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,570
If she can help you,

703
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,250
isn't that good?

704
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,660
But I don't want to trouble her.

705
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,740
I don't want to trouble her either.

706
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,140
But I think she is different from others.

707
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,620
She has a good impression of you.

708
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,900
She's willing to help you.

709
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,620
Mom.

710
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,460
It's exactly because she's different from others

711
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,780
that I can't trouble her.

712
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,460
Meijuan.

713
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,540
You've promised me just now.

714
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,250
You'll believe in me, right?

715
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,260
Give me some time.

716
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,450
I can find a better job

717
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,100
without anyone's help.

718
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,420
Okay?

719
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,460
You've promised me. Why are you still crying?

720
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,570
Stop crying.

721
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,850
You will be less pretty if you keep crying.

722
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,380
I'm not pretty anyway.

723
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,090
Who said that?

724
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,140
Your dad.

725
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,460
I'll teach him a lesson when he comes back.

726
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:31,940
Don't cry.

727
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,860
Let's talk after Xue arrives.

728
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,250
Come on.

729
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,780
Have you recovered?

730
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,220
Why are you in such a hurry to have a meeting?

731
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:58,740
I've recovered.

732
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,460
Really?

733
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:04,860
What's up?

734
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,540
I'm here to discuss with you

735
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,170
about Mr. He's project.

736
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,460
What's to discuss?

737
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:12,620
We'll just make compensations

738
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,820
and apologize as we should.

739
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,179
Xue has told me what you think.

740
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,020
I don't agree.

741
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,219
Talking about quitting the project and quitting the company.

742
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,770
We didn't do anything wrong.

743
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,739
I got injured that day.

744
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,420
So I wasn't thinking straight.

745
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,780
That's good. What do you think now?

746
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,850
I've made a new plan.

747
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,820
You two, take a look.

748
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,940
I'll use my own money

749
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,940
for follow-up shooting.

750
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,380
You two can stay out of it.

751
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,929
I'll try my best to make up for the loss I caused to the company.

752
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,449
The spokesperson wouldn't accept it

753
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,420
if I continue the shooting, right?

754
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,010
I'll finish the shooting with the kids first.

755
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,060
At least it'll be a complete piece of work.

756
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,380
I'll use the settings and props from before.

757
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,340
Right.

758
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,100
The footages we shot on the rainy day can still be of use.

759
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,620
I've changed all the scenes after that into rainy scenes.

760
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,180
I just added some special effects.

761
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,740
Here's the concept design.

762
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,780
I drew it last night.

763
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,200
[Concept Design]

764
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,220
Anyway, I think

765
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,940
I don't want to give up on this project.

766
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,340
I won't return the deposit either.

767
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,100
And I don't think it's necessary

768
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,570
to use your money to solve this problem.

769
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,900
I myself believe that the complete work

770
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,140
will be better than the footages.

771
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,780
And I think the client will approve.

772
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,460
What if the spokesperson also likes it?

773
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,780
I'll add him in then.

774
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,620
Are you done?

775
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,660
Yes.

776
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,940
Don't you think it's superfluous?

777
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,620
I also believe that

778
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,380
the result will be very good.

779
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,740
But it's still an effort to make up for the loss made.

780
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,980
Also, the special effects.

781
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,620
They will cost extra money, right?

782
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,420
Compared to the compensations you're about to make,

783
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,210
the cost of the special effects

784
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,020
is nothing, right?

785
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,580
You just can't accept it.

786
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,820
Right?

787
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,020
If we proceed according to your plan,

788
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,780
we complete the shooting,

789
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,060
and deliver it to the client,

790
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,380
what happens if the client is still not satisfied?

791
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,140
Won't it be a waste of your time

792
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,220
and money?

793
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,020
At least

794
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,780
I'll have tried my best make up for it.

795
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,620
Isn't this a gamble?

796
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,780
What?

797
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,090
Do you think I'm not likely to win?

798
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,060
No, no.

799
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,620
I trust your ability.

800
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,900
But...

801
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,180
But I'll take all the risks.

802
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,380
I think that's a good idea.

803
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,780
But don't use your own savings only.

804
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,100
Our savings and your savings

805
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,940
are the same thing, right?

806
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,180
We opened this company together.

807
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,180
We should take the profits and losses together.

808
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,460
Right. Besides, you've just recovered.

809
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,740
Don't work so hard.

810
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,260
Since it's the same thing,

811
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,090
we don't have to waste any more time arguing about this.

812
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,170
I'm serious about this.

813
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,060
And I must take this bet,

814
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,010
because the stake is our company.

815
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,260
You know what my thoughts are now.

816
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,180
I won't take money from the company

817
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,740
or the two of you.

818
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,780
But I'll need to use

819
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,060
the manpower and equipment of our company.

820
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,340
Thank you, bosses.

821
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,940
I'll go check the footages of the rainy day.

822
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,420
Don't you think there's something strange about her today?

823
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:23,700
Yes.

824
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,580
What happened?

825
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,420
Did you talk nonsense outside?

826
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,780
What did I say?

827
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,810
Is the lighting ready?

828
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,480
I'll start if it's ready.

829
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,780
Lift that light higher.

830
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,820
Okay.

831
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,090
Move this inside.

832
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:52,940
Okay.

833
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,900
Director.

834
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,740
Why are there so many people on set?

835
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,460
They're all here to help.

836
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,380
For free.

837
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,420
Thank you for your hard work.

838
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,100
I'll give you red packets after work.

839
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,380
Thank you, Director.

840
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,740
Director.

841
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,340
Of course we'll support you.

842
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,500
Director, don't mention it.

843
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,620
I won't help you if you give me money.

844
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,220
Okay, I'll buy you drinks then.

845
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,380
By the way, Director.

846
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,420
It's almost ready.

847
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,100
Adjust and check again for the last time.

848
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,180
We'll start shooting at dawn.

849
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:33,860
Okay.

850
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,180
Get ready. We'll start shooting.

851
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:36,700
The raincoats have arrived.

852
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,260
Get the kids changed.

853
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:38,860
Okay.

854
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,340
Remember to remind them to be careful when shooting rainy scenes.

855
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,260
Tie it tight.

856
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,610
Come on, kids.

857
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,140
Put on your raincoats.

858
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,260
It's going to rain.

859
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,380
Make sure to be careful.

860
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,180
Don't run around.

861
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,100
Do you hear me?

862
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,940
Yuan, make sure the equipment is well protected in the rain.

863
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,540
Roger that.

864
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,780
Time is limited and the task is heavy.

865
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,980
Thank you for your hard work in advance.

866
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
Hurry up.

867
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,980
They have a really tight schedule today.

868
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,540
They've only got the venue booked for two days.

869
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,980
They only have half an hour to eat.

870
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:23,980
I know.

871
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,610
Is it heavy? Let me carry it for you.

872
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,020
Stay away from me.

873
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,940
Listen.

874
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,180
Watch your mouth.

875
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,860
Got it.

876
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,780
Hello.

877
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,460
Shanshan is here.

878
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
You started working before dawn.

879
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,420
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Hello, Director Xue.

880
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,980
We brought you some food and drinks.

881
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,940
Director Xue, thank you for these.

882
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,180
Some snacks for you.

883
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:43,780
Let me.

884
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,620
It's nothing.

885
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,460
Thank you, everyone.

886
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,740
Not at all.

887
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,820
Thank you, Shanshan.

888
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,580
Thank you, Director Xue. Thank you, Shanshan.

889
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,460
No need.

890
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,140
Thank you, Director Xue. Thank you, Shanshan.

891
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,420
You don't have to thank us.

892
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,020
Director Jian is the one working here.

893
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,100
Thank you, everyone.

894
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,140
Thank you, Director Jian!

895
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,820
Thank you, Director Jian!

896
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,580
Shanshan and Director Xue.

897
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,860
Eat.

898
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,660
Eat while it's hot.

899
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,420
Thank you.

900
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:02,940
Not at all.

901
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,650
Why are you two here?

902
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,820
You're injured and working overtime.

903
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,620
The budget has been severely reduced this time,

904
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,060
and there're only few people here to help you.

905
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,100
Of course we have to come.

906
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,100
-Shanshan.
-Come on.

907
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,220
Sit here.

908
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:13,540
Okay.

909
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,060
Director Xue.

910
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,220
Thank you.

911
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,000
It's okay.

912
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,860
Come on, eat this.

913
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,140
Director.

914
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:21,780
Shanshan.

915
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,140
Director Xue.

916
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,620
You guys talk. I'll go first.

917
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,420
Okay, there's food we brought here.

918
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:26,780
Okay.

919
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,820
Eat fast.

920
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,260
Okay.

921
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,020
Filming Team, hurry up and eat.

922
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,780
One second.

923
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,620
This time,

924
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,940
if there's anything you need on set,

925
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,620
like if you need water, food,

926
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,210
or night snacks, it's on me.

927
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,140
I'll pay for it myself.

928
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,940
Right, if you

929
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,060
need any help here,

930
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,860
just call me.

931
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,700
I can come anytime.

932
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,340
Don't worry.

933
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,140
I won't interfere with your directing

934
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,380
while I'm here.

935
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,930
I'll just give you a hand.

936
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,260
Come on.

937
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,060
How can I eat so much by myself?

938
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,820
Eat.

939
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,660
Let's eat together.

940
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,100
No.

941
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,220
-We already ate.
-I already ate.

942
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,260
I didn't eat with him.

943
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,380
I ate with that client.

944
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,460
I ordered takeout.

945
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,220
Here.

946
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,420
Lin.

947
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,050
-Well...
-What?

948
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:20,740
Get it done.

949
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,020
You have an umbrella there.

950
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,780
Hurry up and get the rain-shield cloth.

951
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,500
What's wrong?

952
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,260
Yuan, what's going on?

953
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,020
Get us the rain-shield cloth.

954
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,460
I'll take a look.

955
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,180
Get Shanshan an umbrella.

956
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,320
Okay.

957
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,610
Let's have dinner together tonight, the three of us.

958
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,060
Okay.

959
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,780
What happened?

960
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,820
Director, this thing is broken. It can't be hung up.

961
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,820
Fix it now.

962
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,980
So you...

963
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,940
You've ordered?

964
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,900
So many dishes.

965
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,260
Have a seat.

966
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,460
I...

967
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,900
Should I sit here?

968
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,820
You can stay outside for a while.

969
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,460
I'll have a talk with Liang Shanshan.

970
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,530
Well...

971
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:33,620
You two...

972
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,460
Have a good chat.

973
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:35,900
Close the door.

974
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,340
When do you plan to tell me about your relationship?
