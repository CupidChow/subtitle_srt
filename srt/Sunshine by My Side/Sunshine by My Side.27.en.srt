[Episode 27]

4
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,420
Hello.

5
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,380
Hello.

6
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,340
We just ordered.

7
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,820
I'm here to pay the bill.

8
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,700
The gentleman sitting next to you

9
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,140
has come and told us that

10
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,259
only he can pay for your meal today.

11
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,460
He wouldn't let you pay.

12
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,860
There's a reason why it's expensive, right?

13
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,729
Okay.

14
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:52,900
Sorry for the trouble.

15
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:53,620
Thank you.

16
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:55,860
Didn't I tell you?

17
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,740
Not a penny less.

18
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,740
I'll pay as I should.

19
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,940
Don't argue with me about this.

20
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,900
As expected from you, Director Jian.

21
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,100
We're learning from you, Director Jian.

22
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,340
It's...

23
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,170
Very detailed.

24
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,010
There are many things

25
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,900
that we didn't think of

26
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,780
included.

27
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,220
Yes.

28
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,579
Are you sure

29
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:31,220
your sister is having dinner at in this restaurant?

30
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,220
From noon until now?

31
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,260
She's coming.

32
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,220
We're leaving, then.

33
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,860
Bye.

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,820
-Bye.
-Bye.

35
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,300
Thank you for today.

36
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,260
Let me drive you home.

37
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,420
You drive me home?

38
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,700
I'm the one who drove here, okay?

39
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,340
They're still chatting?

40
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,300
Alright, you can drive me home then.

41
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,100
Who is that guy?

42
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,820
Her colleague.

43
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,740
The one I told you about last time.

44
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,540
Alright, you can drive me home then.

45
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,180
Okay, I'll give you a ride.

46
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:00,840
Let's go.

47
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,220
Bing.

48
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,940
Did you forget

49
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,890
that you had a dinner date with Mr. Fang?

50
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,500
Get in the car.

51
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,500
I totally forgot.

52
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,180
Well,

53
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,060
I have to treat my sister's college teacher to a meal.

54
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,620
Since her leg was broken, we've troubled him a lot.

55
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,340
You should go now. It's okay.

56
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,340
I'll give you a ride next time.

57
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,980
Okay, I'll take a taxi.

58
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,700
Okay. Let's talk on WeChat.

59
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,260
Bye.

60
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,060
Bye.

61
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,180
Be safe.

62
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,900
Miss Jian Bing.

63
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,460
You're done with that?

64
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,420
So you are...

65
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,380
Get in the car.

66
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,620
Where to?

67
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,220
I made a reservation at a very tasty restaurant.

68
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,620
It's very difficult to make a reservation there.

69
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,690
You'll regret it for the rest of your life if you don't go.

70
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,820
You made a reservation at a restaurant.

71
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,980
What does it have to do with me?

72
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,460
Didn't you say you don't have a dinner date tonight?

73
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,660
I said I don't have a date,

74
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,860
but I didn't say I don't have to work.

75
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,380
Mr. Fang.

76
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,060
Jian Shuang is so immature.

77
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,580
You have to discipline her.

78
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,460
Sorry.

79
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,700
I have work to do.

80
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,740
You can treat Mr. Fang to dinner.

81
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:06,900
Hey.

82
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,460
Shouldn't you do something

83
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,140
to thank Mr. Fang?

84
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,340
So you didn't tell your sister?

85
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:12,980
Alright.

86
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,820
Enough.

87
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,220
I...

88
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,700
I'll treat you two to dinner.

89
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,899
It wasn't easy to make a reservation there.

90
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,579
How are you not too ashamed to eat?

91
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,420
This place won't do.

92
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,409
The lighting isn't good enough.

93
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,250
Don't worry.

94
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,140
We're not shooting here.

95
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,500
What's there to shoot?

96
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,700
It's ahead.

97
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,020
Is it okay that we just come in like this?

98
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,540
Of course. There's no problem.

99
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,540
Mind this area.

100
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,340
Here.

101
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,100
How is it?

102
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,659
You're really something.

103
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,340
How is it?

104
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,140
It's perfect.

105
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,940
As long as you're satisfied.

106
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,380
We have to get rid of

107
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,300
these cardboard boxes here.

108
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:04,980
Okay.

109
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,620
Let's get it done later.

110
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,460
Can I step on it?

111
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,940
I think so. Be careful.

112
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,410
It's okay.

113
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,100
Let me see.

114
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,660
This escalator is perfect.

115
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,420
This escalator should be fine.

116
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,900
It looks pretty safe.

117
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,540
Song Chen.

118
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,370
Think about

119
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,020
where we should put the four trash cans.

120
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:19,940
Here.

121
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:20,580
Right?

122
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,140
I'll take a photo first

123
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,620
and let the director decide.

124
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,820
Natural light.

125
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,300
Director Jian said we should use natural light extensively.

126
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,930
Let's get at it.

127
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,900
-Come on.
-Come on.

128
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,420
Put it here.

129
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,900
Please make it cheaper.

130
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,140
Give us a discount.

131
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,620
We'll make up to you when we make money.

132
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,500
Girl.

133
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,260
I really can't rent it to you

134
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,740
at that price.

135
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,780
Boss.

136
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,620
We just started a business.

137
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,100
If we make money,

138
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,140
we will make it up to you

139
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,260
and cooperate with you in the future.

140
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,020
Please.

141
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,020
Just this once.

142
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,140
Boss, I'm begging you.

143
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,060
This is the waste warehouse of our company.

144
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,140
It has to be cleaned regularly anyway.

145
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,380
If you need anything,

146
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,140
just take it.

[Lake Blue] [Medium Yellow]

148
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,580
Where have you been?

149
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,659
What took you so long?

150
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,940
I took some time to take a shower at home.

151
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,420
I haven't showered for days.

152
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,659
Right.

153
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,380
You've worked very hard.

154
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,900
Did you get the equipment?

155
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,300
Yes.

156
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,100
They didn't want to rent it to us in the first place

157
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,170
because the money we offered wasn't enough.

158
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,540
I sweet-talked a lot to get it done.

159
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,060
Nice.

160
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,580
Awesome.

161
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,860
God, there's an escalator?

162
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,220
Let me tell you.

163
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,340
Song Chen

164
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,500
found this site.

165
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,780
He did a great job this time.

166
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,180
Not bad, Song Chen.

167
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,900
Right?

168
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,140
I'm not messing around every day.

169
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,500
I have some serious work to do,

170
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,020
okay?

171
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,780
I spent hundreds of yuan on public transportation

172
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,580
before I found this abandoned building.

173
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,660
Remember to reimburse me.

174
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,980
Talking about money is so tacky.

175
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:21,860
How about this?

176
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,940
Take your public transportation fee

177
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,420
as the site fee.

178
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:24,980
What do you think?

179
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,260
So the credit goes to me as well?

180
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:27,820
Deal.

181
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,180
Come here.

182
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,340
Sit down and eat.

183
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,260
Eat while it's hot.

184
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,420
Look.

185
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,740
How shall we lay the garbage out later?

186
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,850
Okay.

187
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,180
Pan Rou.

188
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,140
You'll be...

189
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,170
Hurry up and finish eating first.

190
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,850
When you're done,

191
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,140
take all the garbage out.

192
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,820
Me? Why don't you do it?

193
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,140
Don't worry. We'll do it together.

194
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,420
So we've nailed the site.

195
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:02,660
The equipment

196
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,460
is also taken care of.

197
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:04,810
As for the director,

198
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,140
it's on me.

199
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,940
Let's eat first.

200
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,260
And then we'll get to work, okay?

201
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,050
Okay.

202
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:10,860
Let's eat.

203
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,610
Coming.

204
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,980
Hello.

205
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,900
Aren't you Sheng Yang

206
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,700
from Moses Advertisement who wants to work with me?

207
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,900
You only thought of me

208
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,740
the day before the shooting, right?

209
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,780
Director Jian.

210
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,820
I'm sorry.

211
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,010
What's going on?

212
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,460
Where have you been these days?

213
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,059
Where is the set?

214
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,940
What's the set like?

215
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,730
Does it meet my requirements?

216
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,380
Who will be responsible if the shooting is delayed tomorrow?

217
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,020
So many questions.

218
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,820
Yes.

219
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,100
Fine.

220
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,490
I'll take you to a place.

221
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,820
Now?

222
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,580
Now.

223
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,380
Be careful. It's a bit dark.

224
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,700
There are many nails

225
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,010
and broken glass on the floor.

226
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,140
Are you afraid of the dark?

227
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,580
I...

228
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,780
I'm okay with it.

229
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,610
So, do you know

230
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,060
what this place used to be?

231
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,940
I don't know.

232
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,780
It was a hospital.

233
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,130
Then why...

234
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,540
Why is it like this now?

235
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,740
It's a scary story.

236
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,010
I'll tell you about it later.

237
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,580
Don't tell me if it's scary.

238
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,580
Wait for me.

239
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,620
I'll be right back.

240
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,660
Don't move.

241
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,220
Don't run around.

242
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,770
You...

243
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,780
Where are you going?

244
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,180
Sheng Yang.

245
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,060
Sheng Yang!

246
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,500
Sheng Yang!

247
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,650
If you dare to leave me here alone,

248
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,900
you are dead.

249
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,010
Come out, Sheng Yang!

250
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,340
It's not funny at all.

251
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,450
What do you think about this set?

252
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,140
Director Jian.

253
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,220
Tell me.

254
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,980
Isn't it awesome?

255
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,620
Isn't it amazing?

256
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,660
You really found an abandoned building.

257
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,700
Praise me.

258
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,380
Praise me.

259
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,330
It took me so long to find this place.

260
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,380
Praise you for what?

261
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,580
We'll be shooting here during the day,

262
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,940
and you brought me here for set review at night.

263
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,940
I don't even know what it looks like during the day.

264
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,740
How should I film?

265
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,620
You have no idea.

266
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,660
This place was full of garbage.

267
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,140
I, Song Chen, Pan Rou.

268
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,700
It took us a whole day

269
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,780
to clean it up.

270
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,660
You three are pretty funny.

271
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,620
The film we're shooting is about garbage,

272
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,060
yet you cleaned it up.

273
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,660
Put it back tomorrow.

274
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,500
Okay.

275
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,300
I'll make sure it's back to where it was before the shooting starts tomorrow.

276
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,380
You need to make a sign post.

277
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,580
It's for reference

278
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,980
when we shoot the scene

279
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,220
of the monster.

280
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,580
How tall should it be?

281
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,140
Make it taller than

282
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,500
that kid so that it'll be frightening for him.

283
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,220
In terms of how tall it should be.

284
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:17,900
Okay.

285
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,420
Got it.

286
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,020
I've taken it down.

287
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,340
What else?

288
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,460
Also, please take me to set review during the day

289
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,740
if we are shooting in the daytime.

290
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,020
I've never heard of anyone doing set review at night.

291
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,260
Moreover, the set we're reviewing is for shooting during the day.

292
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,540
All right. Moving on.

293
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,290
It will be Moses Advertisement's first film.

294
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,140
I've always wanted to ask you.

295
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,580
Why did you name your company Moses?

296
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,660
There was a painter called Grandma Moses, you know?

297
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,380
Well.

298
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,100
She only started to learn drawing when she was 76.

299
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,620
She had a famous saying.

300
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,490
She said,

301
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,380
as long as you're doing what you like,

302
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,380
even God will open a door of success

303
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,700
for you.

304
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,780
Even if you are 80 years old,

305
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,620
it's not too late.

306
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,010
She also said that

307
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,490
many people said she started too late.

308
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,660
But actually,

309
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,060
the best moment in life

310
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,690
is the present.

311
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,300
She also said that

312
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,060
every moment of life

313
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,620
is young

314
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,610
and timely.

315
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,420
I've heard of her.

316
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,380
She also wrote a book, right?

317
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,010
Yes.

318
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,540
I'll give you one as a gift later.

319
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,660
You two are quite alike.

320
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,820
We are quite alike?

321
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,460
How are we alike?

322
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,460
You are both old women.

323
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,300
Are you crazy?

324
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,220
How dare you call me an old woman?

325
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,020
I was just kidding.

326
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,780
How dare you?

327
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,540
How old are you this year?

328
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,130
How old?

329
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,770
Say it.

330
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,610
48 years old.

331
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,060
You...

332
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,300
I'm 48?

333
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,060
I'm 56, okay?

334
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,420
You're so well-maintained.

335
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:48,980
Yes!

336
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,980
I'll beat you to 48 today.

337
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,540
Jian Bing, there’s something behind you.

338
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,460
Stop that!

339
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,980
Stop there!

340
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,260
Move it.

341
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,260
Okay.

342
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,060
Put it here.

343
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,780
Don't move.

344
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,580
Okay, it's pretty close.

345
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,380
Just put it here.

346
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,580
The power supply is over here.

347
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,580
Move the lights over there a bit.

348
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,220
Okay.

349
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,500
Why isn't Pan Rou here yet?

350
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,700
Let her order lunch for the crew today.

351
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,180
Remind her to ask everyone about what they don't eat.

352
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,300
Okay, I'll ask her.

353
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,420
Ma Le.

354
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,700
Is it ready up there?

355
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,220
Director, we're all set.

356
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,500
We can start anytime.

357
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,700
We'll start filming if you're ready.

358
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,450
Be quiet. We'll start filming.

359
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,780
Come on. Let's start.

360
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,580
Rolling.

361
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,140
Action.

362
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,260
Okay, cut.

363
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,220
This one is a pass.

364
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,100
No one moves.

365
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,980
Go collect the spectrum.

366
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,700
Okay, Director.

367
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,300
What do you think?

368
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,980
Isn't that kid very cute?

369
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,100
He has that kind of purity and innocence, right?

370
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,900
Yes.

371
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,220
Your mission is completed.

372
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,900
The steps he took are so cute.

373
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,580
Let's go straight for a close shot.

374
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,140
The one where he picks up bottles.

375
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,100
What's it with you?

376
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,820
You're not an actress.

377
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,660
Why are you wearing so little on such a cold day?

378
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,820
It's the first day of shooting. Why can't I look good?

379
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,620
I can't lose big time

380
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,890
to Jian Bing, right?

381
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,770
Have you ordered lunch?

382
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,740
Yes.

383
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,260
16...

384
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,980
Director, we're ready.

385
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,700
Okay, let's start shooting.

386
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Rolling.

387
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,780
Action.

388
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,940
Cut.

389
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,540
The camera's out of focus.

390
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,700
Jian Bing is so serious when she works.

391
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,580
Director, let's do another take.

392
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,660
I've almost become a fan of her.

393
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,660
Alright. Let's get started.

394
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,220
Rolling.

395
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,900
Action.

396
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,980
Cut.

397
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,860
What's wrong?

398
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,460
There's no focus.

399
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,380
Director.

400
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,900
Something's wrong with the camera lens.

401
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,700
It can't focus within five feet.

402
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,420
Director, there seems to be something wrong with my microphone as well.

403
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,940
The sound is intermittent.

404
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,020
I don't know if it's the microphone or the earphone.

405
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,220
Did you check the equipment when you rented it?

406
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,820
Yes.

407
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,100
I'll go check.

408
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,660
Check...

409
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,500
Who are you?

410
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,780
Who allowed you to shoot here?

411
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,020
Well...

412
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,460
Bro, who are you?

413
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,940
I'm a security guard here.

414
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,340
I'm in charge of this place.

415
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,740
I'm sorry.

416
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,860
We thought this building was abandoned.

417
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,220
Can you make an exception?

418
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,660
You see, no one lives here now.

419
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,060
We'll get it done real fast...

420
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,940
So you can break in

421
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,140
just because no one lives here?

422
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,820
It's not like that, Bro.

423
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,380
We can pay the rent. Alright?

424
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,460
Look what you've done.

425
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,460
How can we sell the building with garbage all over the place?

426
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,020
Bro.

427
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,220
Please, make an exception for us.

428
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,099
We're just filming a student assignment here.

429
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,380
What about it even if it's a student assignment?

430
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,819
Did any of you file for it?

431
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,680
[Jian Bing: Director Xue, are you there?]

432
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,180
It's our bad that we didn't file for it.

433
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,500
Just three hours, okay?

434
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,660
We'll leave in three hours after we finish shooting.

435
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,060
Leave right now.

436
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,099
Please make an exception.

437
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,020
Don't be angry.

438
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,420
I'm sorry.

439
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,460
Sorry, Bro.

440
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,980
We'll leave right away.

441
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,540
Give us some time to move the equipment, OK?

442
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,980
Come on, let's move to another set.

443
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,020
Pack the stuff up.

444
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,420
Okay.

445
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,060
Alright, Bro, we'll leave right away.

446
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,140
Give us some time

447
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,020
to move the equipment.

448
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,100
Sorry.

449
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,260
Be careful.

450
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,140
Luckily, we got the footage of the escalator.

451
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,620
Otherwise, we'd be more doomed.

452
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,250
Let's go.

453
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,290
Pack your things. Come on.

454
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,180
Leave the rest to me.

455
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:43,620
Okay.

456
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:43,980
Okay.

457
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,780
Over there.

458
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,500
Hurry up.

459
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,220
Don't forget the shelf.

460
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,740
Do you need help with the bag?

461
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:53,980
No.

462
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,500
Xue.

463
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,370
Come on.

464
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,460
I'll show you around the studio.

465
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:05,940
This way.

466
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,010
Stack them here.

467
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,650
In a pile.

468
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,140
Put them here.

469
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,620
Okay.

470
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,060
Is this studio okay?

471
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,460
Is there anyone behind?

472
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,940
This will do.

473
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,770
I'm really sorry

474
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,540
that I have to trouble you, Director Xue.

475
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,020
Don't mention it.

476
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,460
You made the right decision to call me.

477
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,180
It wasn't easy for me to get the resolve

478
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,020
to make that call.

479
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,420
I was afraid you would say something I didn't want to hear.

480
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,340
I didn't say anything, did I?

481
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,340
No need. I know what you wanted to say.

482
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,380
As long as you do.

483
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,660
I didn't have to say it with my mouth.

484
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,660
Check out this studio.

485
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,420
I think it's pretty close

486
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,260
to what you described on the phone.

487
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,700
If you think it can do,

488
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,580
let them set the equipment up

489
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,980
and get to work now.

490
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,340
Okay.

491
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,180
Well,

492
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,900
is their company's equipment good enough?

493
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,860
If not, use our company's stuff.

494
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:03,940
It's okay.

495
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,700
It can do.

496
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,820
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

497
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,700
Well,

498
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,010
I'll help you

499
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:08,780
clean the messes up over there.

500
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,460
You are really reliable when it comes to work.

501
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,570
What do you mean when it comes to...

502
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,490
Lin.

503
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,100
Well,

504
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,300
come to the studio.

505
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,860
Clean the things up here.

506
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,290
You must be cold.

507
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,380
I told you to put on more clothes, but you wouldn't listen.

508
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,500
Right?

509
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,460
Here.

510
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,050
Thank you.

511
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,250
Seriously,

512
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,620
can they really let us use

513
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,820
such a good studio?

514
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,980
I think so.

515
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,380
After all, we have Director Jian's connections.

516
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,700
Think about it.

517
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,060
When that accident happened to Director Jian in the amusement park,

518
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,260
Sheng Yang left the booth behind

519
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,490
and rushed to the hospital to see her,

520
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,060
so he lost his job.

521
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,220
You can say that

522
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,860
Sheng Yang lost his job for Director Jian.

523
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,860
So, of course she can do him a small favor like this.

524
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,100
Who lost the job for whom, you said?

525
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,500
The booth

526
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,460
was tampered with by the team leader's men in the first place.

527
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,460
Besides, Sheng Yang...

528
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,940
He was

529
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,060
worried about you,

530
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,340
so he wasn't at the event.

531
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,730
I saw that an accident happened during shooting

532
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,020
on your set.

533
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,620
So I thought

534
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,180
I'd come to see you.

535
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,140
Drive me to the hospital then.

536
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,340
Do you want to eat Luosifen noodles?

537
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,050
Our company

538
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,420
took on an offline activity of a mall.

539
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,500
I'm in charge of

540
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,380
the booth design.

541
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,420
What did you say?

542
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,220
The booth collapsed.

543
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,380
The booth collapsed.

544
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,380
When the boss held him accountable,

545
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,180
he couldn't explain it even though it wasn't his fault.

546
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,580
In the end, he had to take full responsibility.

547
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,820
You're returning the equipment so soon?

548
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,460
Is this how you do business?

549
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,260
What happened?

550
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,050
What do you think?

551
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,420
Your equipment is all broken.

552
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,820
What's going on?

553
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,380
Boss, take a look yourself.

554
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,300
Your equipment is seriously aging.

555
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,740
We only used it for less than two hours

556
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,460
before it stopped working.

557
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,300
Now what?

558
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,820
When you took the equipment

559
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,420
from us,

560
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,300
it was intact, right?

561
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,340
You used it for two hours,

562
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,570
then it broke.

563
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,250
So you broke it, right?

564
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,220
Just compensate me.

565
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,980
What do you mean I broke it?

566
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,980
Your stuff was broken in the first place.

567
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,180
Are you trying to cheat?

568
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Hand me the contract.

569
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,740
What do you mean?

570
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,140
Can we use the studio tomorrow?

571
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,060
The company needs to use it tomorrow. What do you think?

572
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,500
Jian Bing.

573
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,860
Didn't I tell you

574
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,220
that boy is unreliable?

575
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,100
You're being a bit willful now.

576
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,660
I'm telling you. He's not unreliable.

577
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,700
He's just inexperienced.

578
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,220
Think about it. When you first got in the industry,

579
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,860
did you ever get scolded

580
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,220
by the clients?

581
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,050
You did, didn't you?

582
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,020
Everyone has to go through

583
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,820
this process of growth step by step.

584
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,980
You always look down on him for your qualifications.

585
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,060
You think it's fun?

586
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,660
What do you mean?

587
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,420
I helped you, and now I'm the bad guy?

588
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,860
Well, Lin.

589
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,420
Let's get to work.

590
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,980
Sign it after confirming the information is correct.

591
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,260
In case of any damage being done to the equipment,

592
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,340
the deposit will be forfeited, and compensation has to be made at full price.

593
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:22,940
Your people

594
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,490
signed this, right?

595
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,710
[Party B (Signature): Pan Rou, Moses Advertisement Agency]

596
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,540
[Party B (Signature): Pan Rou, Moses Advertisement Agency]

597
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,010
It was signed by our people. I admit it.

598
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,020
I paid for it,

599
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,300
but the equipment you gave me

600
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,940
was all broken.

601
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,220
The whole crew was delayed today.

602
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,460
Will you compensate my site fee, labor cost

603
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,220
and all my losses?

604
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,780
Aren't you being unreasonable?

605
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,220
What do you want?

606
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,860
Do you want to get physical?

607
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,220
Let's be reasonable.

608
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,220
You rented my equipment, and you broke it.

609
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,540
You don't want to compensate me.

610
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,580
Instead, you want me to compensate you.

611
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,980
Is that what you mean?

612
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,620
Alright, enough with all that.

613
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,220
Anyway, because of your equipment,

614
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,380
we failed to shoot the film today.

615
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,180
Either you pay for

616
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,900
all my losses,

617
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,980
or you return the deposit to me.

618
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,980
Otherwise, I won't leave today.

619
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,660
Don't think about leaving today.

620
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,060
I was going to give you a discount.

621
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,140
With your attitude,

622
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,780
you won't be able to leave

623
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,980
if you don't compensate me at full price.

624
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,700
Why did you come without me?

625
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,540
Why are you here?

626
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,060
I...

627
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,740
I can handle it. Go back now.

628
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,900
You can handle it?

629
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,580
What are you here for?

630
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,980
A beauty is here to save the hero?

631
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,140
He just got in this industry.

632
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,140
He's not very experienced.

633
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,020
May I take a look at the contract we signed?

634
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,620
You're the producer?

635
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,580
I'm the director.

636
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,780
Who is he?

637
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,220
My younger brother.

638
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,460
Well, your younger brother

639
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,820
is too aggressive.

640
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,700
He doesn't know the rules at all.

641
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,340
He broke my equipment.

642
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,420
Instead of compensating me,

643
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,020
he asked me to compensate him.

644
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,770
If you had came a little late,

645
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,700
I would have called the police.

646
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,740
Don't.

647
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,340
He doesn't know the rules,

648
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,420
so I'm here. I know the rules.

649
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,010
Did you hear that?

650
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,540
The gears are loose.

651
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,780
How can it focus?

652
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,540
The capsule of this wireless headphone was mended by 502 Glue, right?

653
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,460
What's with the equipment you have here?

654
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,700
They should be phased out, right?

655
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,530
The filter is already broken like this,

656
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,980
and you still rented it out?

657
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,780
Isn't this a mess of junk?

658
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,940
With his money,

659
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,020
our equipment is good enough.

660
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,380
As I said,

661
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,540
the equipment is old.

662
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,050
Besides,

663
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,500
you didn't check it carefully

664
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,300
before you took it, right?

665
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,620
Who's to blame?

666
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,220
Of course we're to blame.

667
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,580
Bro, can you

668
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,300
give us an exception this time?

669
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,900
You can search our company online.

670
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,420

Of course I know him.

677
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,660

Go back and rest.

732
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,940
and you want me to go back alone?

733
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,220
It wasn't your fault in there.

734
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,220
Look at those people inside. Which one seemed easy to be dealt with?

735
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
I saw it. Pan Rou signed it.

736
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,180
They must have given you

737
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,660
that kind of equipment

738
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,780
because they thought she's a little girl who's not professional.

739
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,700
I asked Pan Rou to come here.

740
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,620
I should have told her

741
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,380
to check the equipment repeatedly.

742
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,140
It was my careless mistake.

743
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,940
They obviously wanted to cheat you on this deal.

744
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,620
It would have been useless

745
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,980

746
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,780
Stop blaming yourself.

747
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,260
Don't blame Pan Rou, either.

someone barged in.

00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,220
It's also obvious that it was a rip-off.

756
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,850
If I knew how hard you worked

757
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,860
for the site and equipment,

758
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,500
I would have offered to help you.

759
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,780
Don't worry.

760
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,340
I'll take care of it.

761
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,220
I can't let you take care of everything for me.

762
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,740
Then why did you invite me?

763
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,540
If you don't want to use my resources?

764
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,060
Am I here for decoration?

765
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,380
You are the director.

766
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,500
The director is the soul of the whole crew.

767
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,020
You said it.

768
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,900
Since I'm the soul,

769
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,620
why can't I make my contributions?

770
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,980
That was really nothing.

771
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,860
The trouble I made when I was young

772
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,620
was much more serious than this.

773
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,900
You're really something.

774
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,490
Have you forgotten

775
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,660
that we are a team?

776
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,020
When something goes wrong, you take it all on yourself

777
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,300
and refuse to discuss with your teammate.

778
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,460
Is your dignity really that precious?

779
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,540
No.

780
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,340
I just don't want...

781
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,340
You don't want to be looked down

782
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,140
upon by me.

783
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,700
Didn't you tell me that

784
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,380
Xue is no longer my best partner the other day?

785
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,820
Didn't you ask me to consider you?

786
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,580
I've thought about it.

787
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,620
Your advantage

788
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,180
is design and creativity.

789
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,500
My advantage

790
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,980
is filming and resources.

791
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,500
So the best way for us to cooperate

792
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,140
is collaboration.

793
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,860
Don't compare your weaknesses to my strengths,

794
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,580
okay?

795
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,580
My strengths

796
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,820
were useless in today's situation.

797
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,220
Do you think it's not the same for me?

798
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,540
Don't consider yourself good-for-nothing

799
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,300
just for a setback.

800
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,100
If you're really good-for-nothing,

801
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,420
how did you catch my eye?

802
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,260
Why would I want to work with you?

803
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,740
Am I that blind?

804
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,940
I only got to know how to deal with this kind of stuff

805
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,900
with accumulation of experience.

806
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,780
But experience

807
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,860
is something you gain with age.

808
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,620
It's worthless.

809
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,420
What's precious is your simplicity, straightforwardness,

810
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,500
and the passion to get things done well.

811
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,780
Okay?

812
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,220
Didn't you say I had a long day?

813
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,340
So when can I go home?

814
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,460
Be my driver.

815
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,580
What should we do about the equipment?

816
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,140
We don't know where Sheng Yang is.

817
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,260
I… I'm really…

818
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,900
I'm too ashamed to see him anymore.

819
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Do you think I'm bad for him?

820
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,180
You can't say that.

821
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,220
No one wants this to happen.

822
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,420
Let me tell you.

823
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,500
When we were

824
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,700
in the company before,

825
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,900
whenever I got into trouble,

826
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,620
he would help me.

827
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:42,820
To be honest,

828
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,060
during these years I've been with him,

829
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,780
he did more for me than my own father.

830
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,220
He always took the initiative

831
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,740
to raise me and educate me.

832
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,820
I thought we three

833
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,500
finally opened our studio.

834
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,220
Finally, it's my turn

835
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,980
to repay him.

836
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,500
I wanted to make our opening case a great success.

837
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,660
But what happened?

838
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,540
It was more like a head-on blow.

839
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,780
And he took it so hard that he's nowhere to be found now.

840
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,290
He must be running around

841
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,300
to think of a solution now.

842
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,580
Old Hen.

843
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,980
It’s not all your fault, right?

844
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,260
You did check the equipment.

845
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,220
It's just that you didn't find anything wrong with it.

846
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,860
Pan Rou, is something wrong with your eyes?

847
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,180
I'm not Sheng Yang.

848
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,700
Why are you being so gentle to me?

849
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,180
Can't I be nice to you?

850
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,500
Do you want to be scolded instead?

851
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,460
That’s more like it.

852
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,900
Sheng Yang's message.

853
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,300
What did he say?

854
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,580
He said,

855
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,380
"You two go home first.

856
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,860
I'll take care of the equipment and the studio.

857
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,580
The shooting will start on time the day after tomorrow."

858
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,699
Let's go.

859
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,699
It's going to rain.

860
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:20,980
Let's go.

861
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,620
Put the coat on.

862
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,340
It's okay. Let's go.

863
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:23,980
Hurry up.

864
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,860
Hurry up.

865
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,139
Come back. Put it on.

866
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,570
Wait for me.

867
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,100
Don't come out yet.

868
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,380
Let's go.

869
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:35,780
Let's go.

870
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:37,139
Hurry.

871
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,020
Don't catch a cold. This coat.

872
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,659
Stop laughing.

873
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:44,260
It's too small.

874
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,520
Shush.

875
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,100
My sister is at home.

876
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:56,340
Can I

877
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,460
use your...

878
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,700
Turn right. In the bathroom.

879
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,700
You can use a white towel.

880
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,530
Here.

881
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,170
Wipe it.

882
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,700
I'm okay.

883
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,500
Don't catch a cold.

884
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,260
Spread your coat out. Give it to me.

885
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,500
Have some warm water.

886
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,410
On our way here,

887
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,700
I was thinking about

888
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,180
what you said to me.

889
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,900
I think

890
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,460
you're right.

891
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:25,820
Yes.

892
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,540
I'm not mature enough.

893
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,260
I didn't do well enough.

894
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,660
But there are still a few things I haven't figured out

895
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,180
that I want to ask you about.

896
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,500
-Well...
-Wait a minute.

897
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,620
I also have a question to ask you.

898
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,620
I went through so much trouble

899
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,780
asking Xue Yiming to let us have the studio.

900
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,940
The whole crew also moved there.

901
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,020
Why did you leave?

902
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,340
We agreed that

903
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,180
we'd only talk about work, not relationship.

904
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,020
I did try very hard to do so.

905
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,620
But today,

906
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,140
I didn't know what happened to me at that moment.

907
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,780
I just couldn't accept his kindness to me.

908
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,260
I understand.

909
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,540
But

910
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:19,620
this is another immature part of you.

911
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,060
Once the shooting begins,

912
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,780
everyone is the same.

913
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,380
Whether you're the director, a photographer,

914
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,740
an actor, or a member of the lighting or art department.

915
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,900
As long as you're there on set,

916
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,610
you'll be doing services for the film.

917
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,460
We can't let personal feelings,

918
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,220
like if you feel wronged

919
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,490
or mad with someone,

920
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,340
interfere our work and make it stop.

921
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,380
Right?

922
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,500
It will cause losses.

923
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,780
Got it.

924
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,020
Of course.

925
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,980
It's all from my experience.

926
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,380
Who told me

927
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,420
experience is not important just now?

928
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,540
I did.

929
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,820
It was me.

930
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,340
But

931
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,860
what I wanted to say is

932
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,900
I hope you can keep the purity,

933
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,660
persistence and passion about creation you have.

934
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,380
Right?

935
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,380
Why am I sharing my experience

936
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,170
with you?

937
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:23,820
It's because

938
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,490
we are partners now.

939
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,900
I hope you can make fewer detours

940
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,340
and suffer fewer losses,

941
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,020
right?

942
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:31,860
Yes.

943
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,660
Director Jian, you're always right.

944
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,620
Always.

945
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,420
Director Jian.

946
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,740
I have another thing I'd like to report to you.

947
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,780
Go ahead.

948
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,650
I still want to use the set I found

949
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,660
for the shooting this time.

950
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:48,980
But...

951
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,290
Let me finish.

952
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,620
The set

953
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,860
is ready-made, so we don't need to decorate it again.

954
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,860
If we change the set now,

955
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,570
first, it's expensive.

956
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,020
Second, the footage will be inconsistent.

957
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,090
Third...

958
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,020
Actually,

959
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,260
it took me a lot of effort and time to decorate that set.

960
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,900
Most importantly,

961
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,140
you've seen it

962
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:06,940
and approved it.

963
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,980
But they wouldn't let you use it.

964
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,420
I'll take care of it

965
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,380
in my own way.

966
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,460
Give me some time.

967
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:14,980
How do you want to take care of it?

968
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,660
Don't worry about that.

969
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,060
I have my way anyway.

970
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,510
Well.

971
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,060
At worst,

972
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,300
I'll make use of the experience you just mentioned.

973
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,140
What a good student.

974
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,380
Well,

975
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,900
about the equipment, I want to discuss with you.

976
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,580
I remember you told me

977
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,180
that good films can also be shot on mobile phones.

978
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,500
So this time, I'm thinking about shooting it on a mobile phone.

979
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,610
I mean, if there's no other way,

980
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,620
then we'll use a mobile phone.

981
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,580
But now we have good equipment.

982
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,940
Why don't we use it?

983
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,620
If you shoot it on your phone.

984
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,820
it will affect the result of the whole film.

985
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,420
I totally understand.

986
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,580
But I won't have that much money left

987
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,820
for equipment renting

988
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,620
after the set issue is solved.

989
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,060
Can I rent the equipment then?

990
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,420
Just take it as the director bringing her own equipment to the set.

991
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,740
Of course not.

992
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,580
Look, here we go again.

993
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,660
Of course.

994
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,500
I'm not letting you take advantage of me for nothing.

995
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,540
This is what I think.

996
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,380
From now on,

997
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,050
Jian Yi will have a share

998
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,860
in every project Moses takes on.

999
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,820
We'll split the profit 30/70.

1000
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,940
As for all the projects you take on,

1001
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,580
as long as I like it,

1002
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,740
you can't get another director to do it.

1003
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,140
That's great.

1004
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,220
I'm more than happy to do that.

1005
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,300
This is our...

1006
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,210
This is an honor for Moses.

1007
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:34,980
Okay.

1008
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,420
It went pretty much as I expected.

1009
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,540
Let's sign the contract.

1010
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,940
I've prepared the contract for you.

1011
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,380
No problem. I'll sign it right away.

1012
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,340
Come on.

1013
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,580
Sign it.

1014
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,740
You signed it without reading.

1015
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:13,580
No need.

1016
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:14,380
I trust you.

1017
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,500
What if I just sold you?

1018
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,020
Is it an indenture?

1019
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,010
Well...

1020
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,570
It's not bad to sell myself to Director Jian.

1021
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:28,140
Director Jian, from now on,

1022
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:28,940
I'll be yours.

1023
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,060
I can't afford it.

1024
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,020
This is an invalid contract.

1025
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,020
One more piece of experience.

1026
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,260
When you sign a contract,

1027
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,100
except with me,

1028
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,140
you must take a look at the content.

1029
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,980
I'll draft a new contract and send it to you by Shansong Delivery.

1030
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,300
Okay.

1031
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,060
It's a deal then.

1032
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,330
Let's have fun working together.

1033
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,380
Of course.

1034
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,900
It's delicious.

1035
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,850
They're chatting so happily.

1036
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,460
Why is there even a contract involved?

1037
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,500
So they'll be working together for a long time.

1038
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,180
She found herself someone from this industry again.

1039
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,010
She's not young anymore,

1040
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,740
yet she's still infatuated with him.

1041
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,020
She's laughing that happily.

1042
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,530
What about Mr. Fang?

1043
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,060
He won't stay here again tonight, will he?

1044
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,580
Again?

1045
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:47,980
I...

1046
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:52,780
I'm so worried.
