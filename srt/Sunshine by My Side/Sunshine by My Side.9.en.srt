00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,340
What's wrong?

5
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,860
Song Chen,

6
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,850
I think it's her.

7
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,979
I've never seen her in person either.

8
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,900
She's quite elegant.

9
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,420
Very elegant.

10
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,500
No wonder he can't forget her.

11
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,570
It turns out she's gorgeous.

13
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,190
You sent your goddess away?

14
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,030
I finally saw her in person today.

15
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,430
Who would believe that you're not doing this for your personal gain?

16
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,110
She has an extraordinarily strong aura.

17
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,110
I didn't realize she's this talented.

18
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,390
She's made so many films

19
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,470
and won so many awards.

20
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,110
Of course.

21
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,390
Otherwise, how could Sheng Yang

22
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,590
be so lovestruck?

23
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,829
Don't talk nonsense.

24
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,030
She has a husband.

25
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,940
According to the Internet,

26
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,350
they are the Mr. and Mrs. Smith of the advertising industry.

27
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,670
What Mr. and Mrs. Smith?

28
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,400
It said so online.

29
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,079
It said they've been together for many years

30
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,210
and started a business together.

31
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,890
They're well-known in the industry.

32
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,840
She's divorced.

33
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,530

The team leader wants you to see him.

37
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:08,890
Be careful.

38
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,880
Watch your mouth.

39
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:25,840
Come in.

40
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,970
Team Leader,

41
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,770
you wanted to see me?

42
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:37,720

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,680
How long have you been in the company for?

More than three years.

47
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,000
I remember

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,280
you started working with me

49
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,360
as an intern in your senior year, right?

50
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,130
Yes.

51
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,160
Over three years.

52
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,370

53
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,290
what do you think

54
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,570
about how I treat you?

55
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,440
Pretty good.

56
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,280
I think you're pretty good too.

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,480
You're capable

58
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,160
and quite talented.

59
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,650
All these years, you've done a lot for the company

60
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,120
and suffered a lot too.

61
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,010
But I hope you can understand.

62
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,290
This is how our company is.

63
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,800
Everyone has their role and there are no extras.

64
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,960
The business environment is bad these years too.

65
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,320
I've mentioned it to the boss countless times

66
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,770
to give you a promotion and a raise.

67
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,370
But I can't do anything

68
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,690
if he doesn't agree, right?

69
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,159
Am I right?

70
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,050
Actually, I always thought

71
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,840
that our team culture is quite good.

72
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,360
If anyone has any complaints or grievances,

73
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,170
I'm always open

74
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,520
for a talk.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,170
But recently,

76
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,250
you've been doing things behind my back.

77
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,730
It's troubling for me.

78
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,440
I haven't.

79
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,360
You haven't?

80
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,130
What's your relationship with that director?

81
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:23,570
I...

82
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,010
She and I...

83
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,250
We don't have any relationship.

84
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,360
You're not relatives?

85
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,920
Of course not.

86
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,080
I'm serious.

87
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,640
Alright.

88
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,400
How about this?

89
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,000
Tomorrow,

90
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,080
I'll tell the boss

91
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,600
to give you a promotion.

92
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,080
Your base salary

93
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,370
will rise from 5,000 to 6,000.

94
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,920
Project commissions will be calculated separately.

95
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,720
By the way,

96
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,840
tell the director

97
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,480
to not to take this project.

98
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:50,920
Everyone understands.

99
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:53,920
No,

100
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,480
Team Leader, I...

101
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,240
I know.

102
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,600
You're all grown up.

103
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,280
You have your own ideas and ambition.

104
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,000
I understand and respect that.

105
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,010
I'm not doing this for personal gain.

106
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,720
Then why are you

107
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,770
being so selfess?

108
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,680
Anyway, it's not for myself.

109
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,440
Then who are you doing it for?

110
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,010
It's simple.

111
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,000
The brand wanted a new director

112
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,240
and the boss asked me.

113
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,200
Jian Bing is the only director I know.

114
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:17,530
Plus, I think

115
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,120
the style of our product this time

116
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,090
suits her very well,

117
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,640
so I just helped them connect.

118
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,160
I recommended her to the company.

119
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,680
As you can see,

120
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,720
the boss is very satisfied with her.

121
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,440
Listen, Sheng Yang.

122
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,840
Stop using the boss to pressure me.

123
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,280
So, you didn't do this for any reason,

124
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,400
other than the good of this project?

125
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,290
Yes.

126
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,890
Great.

127
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,250
You've learned to act innocent for a surprise attack.

128
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,400
I...

129
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,330
Listen, Sheng Yang.

130
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,170
When I came to this company,

131
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,050
you were still playing with dirt in kindergarten.

132
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,170
Don't think you're so great

133
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,010
just because that stupid proposal got accepted.

134
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,640
There are more than enough students

135
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,520
with your level of skills in art schools.

136
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,160
Don't get mad.

137
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,400
If you leave today, a new batch will come tomorrow.

138
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,560
I've said what I need to say.

139
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,210
I've given you respect too.

140
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,400
Don't take it for granted.

141
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,330
Go back to work.

142
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,970
Don't take it to heart.

143
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,080
Wang.

144
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,090
He's just a jerk.

145
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,050
I just don't understand.

146
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,800
How come a jerk can live well,

147
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,450
while I have to take all this crap?

148
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,800
Because...

149
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,840
Because you're a good person?

150
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,560
We've known him for a while.

151
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,090
Don't you know how he is?

152
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,250
Do you think someone like him

153
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,799
will have a good ending?

154
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,010
No way.

155
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,890
Who said that?

156
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,440
Really.

157
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,559
The boss wants the kid in your team to take charge.

158
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,680
The director's contract has been drafted.

159
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,290
He said they know each other,

160
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,330
so it's easier to work together.

161
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,560
Did the client agree?

162
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,890
Yes.

163
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,010
They met the director in private

164
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,600
and reached an agreement over a meal.

165
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,930
Your team has two projects in a row.

166
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:00,930
What a showoff.

167
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,410
The other teams are envious.

168
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,040
Does Sheng Yang have any background?

169
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,560
What background?

170
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,640
His mom sells vegetables in a supermarket.

171
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,160
His dad is just a street cleaner.

172
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,530
Back then,

173
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,840
if I hadn't hired him

174
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,610
and taught him personally,

175
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:15,960
he wouldn't be where he is today.

176
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,880
It's clear to me now.

177
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,690
These kids

178
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,800
are all ungrateful.

179
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:23,960
Hey,

180
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,200
what about the female director?

181
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,080
They have a special relationship.

182
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:28,800
You can see it too?

183
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,970
Yes.

184
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,130
These kids are all open.

185
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,440
It's easy for them to sell.

186
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,680
Watch your language!

187
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,400
Hey, hey.

188
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,600
You little brat.

189
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,530
Who are you talking about?

190
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,880
I'm talking about you.

191
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,890
Who are you talking about?

192
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,280
It's you two getting kickbacks together.

193
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,120
So what if I say he sells himself?

194
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,130
Let go!

195
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,170
Let go!

196
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,530
Stop fighting. Calm down.

197
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,560
They're hitting me!

198
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,400
I'm dying!

199
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,640
They're hitting me!

200
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,880
They're fighting!

201
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,960
There's a fight inside

202
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,400
Pull them back.

203
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,450
You even got a weapon!

204
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,760
Tell me.

205
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,840
What happened?

206
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,450
Boss,

207
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,090
you have to help me this time.

208
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,170
These two

209
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,050
got together to beat me up.

210
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,280
How can I meet my client tomorrow?

211
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,520
I have an appointment.

212
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,770
Don't you know why we hit you?

213
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,800
Listen to what you said.

214
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,330
What do you mean?

215
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,570
Go ahead.

216
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,650
Go ahead.

217
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,730
The boss is here.

218
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,440
I just don't like

219
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,120
how you take advantage of your position.

220
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,400
Do you hear that, Boss?

221
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,650
Is this what a subordinate should say?

222
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,130
I admit,

223
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,040
I'm usually

224
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,890
too serious about work.

225
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,120
I do put a lot of pressure on them.

226
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,290
But I think,

227
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,840
as subordinates,

228
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,480
you can come tell me

229
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,920
about your complaints and ideas,

230
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:00,960
right?

231
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,410
I was minding my business

232
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,090
and they burst into the bathroom.

233
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,730
They started hitting me without explanation.

234
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,970
Ask Zhao.

235
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,000
Zhao was there.

236
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,840
Wasn't that so?

237
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,000
Harmony.

238
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,050
Harmony.

239
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,320
Enough.

240
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,770
Look at you.

241
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,720
You're injured.

242
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,440
Look at their faces.

243
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,720
They're injured too.

244
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,000
Boss,

245
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,530
they got hurt accidentally.

246
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,810
You didn't see it.

247
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,570
Let me put it this way.

248
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,610
Boss,

249
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,680
I do everything for the sake of the company.

250
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,600
I'm a senior in the company.

251
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,930
But what happened today

252
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,240
is a great humiliation to me.

253
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:40,920
Really.

254
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,690
It's a disgrace.

255
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,570
Let me make it clear.

256
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,120
Either I leave

257
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:47,770
or they leave.

258
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,250
It's up to you.

259
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:07,930
Yan.

260
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,570
Your dress is so beautiful.

261
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,400
Your shirt is pretty too.

262
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,810
My son bought it for me.

263
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,920
The color looks great.

264
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,330
Not as good as yours.

265
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:23,720
Sister-in-law,

266
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,170
are you off work?

267
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,320
Yes.

268
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,760
Have you eaten?

269
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,680
Not yet.

270
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,960
Come to my house when you're free.

271
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Sheng, you're back.

272
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,440
Greet Uncle Sheng.

273
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,480
Hello, Uncle Sheng.

274
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,410
Hello, handsome.

275
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,450
Which household did this?

276
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,720
You littered trash.

277
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,090
If everyone cuts themselves some slack,

278
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,210
the society takes one big step back.

279
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,560
It's made quite well.

280
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,880
They threw it away when it's still usable.

281
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,880
People are so wasteful these days.

282
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:56,640
You're back.

283
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,480
Yes, I'm back.

284
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,490
Are you watering the flowers?

285
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,240
Yes.

286
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,080
Be careful.

287
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:01,680
You're back.

288
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,520
You're back.

289
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,050
Remember to sort your trash.

290
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:04,530
Okay.

291
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,480
Don't throw them randomly.

292
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:05,920
Okay.

293
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,680
Thank you.

294
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,920
Sister-in-law.

295
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:17,970
Qiao?

296
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,200
It's me.

297
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,410
Coming.

298
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:23,720
Qiao,

299
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,450
come in.

300
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,330
Would you like to come in?

301
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,280
No need.

302
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,480
Am I bothering you?

303
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,360
You're never a bother.

304
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,600
What's this?

305
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,000
I just think that your outfit

306
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,680
really suits you.

307
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:36,560
Looks great.

308
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,440
Is it suitable?

309
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,770
Sheng gave it to me,

310
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,450
so I just wore it.

311
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,880
What are you talking about?

312
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,120
You look much better

313
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,840
than when I wore it.

314
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,640
Look at your slender waist.

315
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,200
I was afraid you might dislike it,

316
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,600
so I went back to my room and found some more.

317
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,680
I've gained weight.

318
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,960
I can't wear them anymore.

319
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,200
It's a pity to leave them at home,

320
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,330
so I wanted to show you.

321
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,210
Which one do you like?

322
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,080
You can take all of them too.

323
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:57,800
Look.

324
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,250
Wait.

325
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,000
What do you mean?

326
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,770
Didn't Xiangqian tell you?

327
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
This dress is mine.

328
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,320
It's yours?

329
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,840
Look at this one. It's nice.

330
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,410
The color is great.

331
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,810
-People who can't sort trash
-It's green.

332
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,080
are practically living in the Dark Ages.

333
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,040
You're back.

334
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:17,920
You two are chatting?

335
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,570
We talked about

336
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,410
everything already.

337
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,170
Go on.

338
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,520
There's nothing else to say.

339
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,400
Sister-in-law.

340
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,520
Brother, look.

341
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,090
This...

342
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,640
My clothes are brand new.

343
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,330
Is she upset?

344
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,210
She doesn't like this dress?

345
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,600
The clothes are fine.

346
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,730
The clothes are fine.

347
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,520
Xiangqian,

348
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,650
be honest.

349
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,770
Did you not tell her?

350
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,640
Is that necessary?

351
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,320
Do I have to report everything to her?

352
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,960
Is that necessary?

353
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,410
Look at what you did.

354
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,120
You're making me seem like the bad person.

355
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,520
You...

356
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,840
What can I say about you?

357
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,010
You messed this up.

358
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,410
Look.

359
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:07,920
My mistake.

360
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,520
Xiangqian, I really...

361
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,750
-I don't know what to say.
-My problem.

362
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,569
You changed your outfit so quickly.

363
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,569
We added a new performance for the Spring Festival?

364
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,250
Outfit transformation?

365
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,640
You were so rude just now.

366
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,920
She was still standing outside the door

367
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,490
and you shut the door on her.

368
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,480
You are polite.

369
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,450
You're so polite.

370
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,170
You lied to me and insulted me.

371
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,720
You've gone too far.

372
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,440
How did I insult you?

373
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,810
What you said is so harsh.

374
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,290
I was very happy

375
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,040
when I woke up this morning.

376
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,720
When I saw this dress,

377
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,240
I almost cried.

378
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,440
I was so happy

379
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,240
and excited all day.

380
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,640
I never thought

381
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,970
that I'm just a clown.

382
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,210
How are you a clown?

383
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,770
All I've been thinking about these days was your dress.

384
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,610
When Qiao's wardrobe broke,

385
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,120
I fixed it for her and mentioned this.

386
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,320
You could've taken anyone's clothes,

387
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,330
but you just had to take Qiao's clothes.

388
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,290
I even went through the building to show off

389
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,800
and you crushed my dignity

390
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,640
before I even finished.

391
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,760
What?

392
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,010
What are you talking about?

393
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,920
I wanted to buy a dress for you,

394
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,360
but I'm broke.

395
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,930
Even though I'm broke,

396
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,520
right,

397
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,760
I went through the trouble

398
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,800
to get 1,000 yuan from my son.

399
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,450
I was going to buy you a dress.

400
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,200
Is this about the dress?

401
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,560
Is it about the dress?

402
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,920
How is it not?

403
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,330
This is about the dress.

404
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,450
I'll transfer the money to you.

405
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,010
There's no need to talk about it anymore.

406
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,600
Go cook.

407
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,040
Okay, I'll transfer it to you right now.

408
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,720
You want dinner?

409
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,120
No food.

410
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,880
You deserve to starve to death.

411
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,040
You...

412
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,690
You have a transfer

413
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,040
of money to purchase a dress.

414
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,850
Please remember to accept it.

415
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,000
You look good in this.

416
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,210
If you feel uncomfortable wearing it,

417
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,320
then don't wear it.

418
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,840
How come it's an insult?

419
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,560
Women, really...

420
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,530
It's a little cold. Hang in there.

421
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,080
I'll do it myself.

422
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,880
Thank you.

423
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,370
Song Chen, come here.

424
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,200
Be gentle.

425
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,960
This is a face,

426
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,010
not a radish.

427
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,010
It's a wound.

428
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,330
Deal with the pain.

429
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,210
How old are you?

430
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,650
Why were you so impulsive?

431
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,810
Can I ask you a question?

432
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,370
Go ahead.

433
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,690
Why can't you

434
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,040
treat us equally?

435
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,610
You are so gentle to him

436
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
and so mean to me.

437
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,370
Keep going.

438
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,920
See if you'll still be this matter-of-fact

439
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,440
when you get fired tomorrow.

440
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,210
I won't get fired.

441
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,520
Have you heard that the law doesn't punish the masses?

442
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,730
He can't fire two people at once.

443
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,050
Who else would he fire?

444
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,490
You hit him first.

445
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,120
It's impressive that the team leader didn't call the cops on you.

446
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,200
He started it.

447
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,640
He was saying horrible things.

448
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,080
Haven't you heard of this saying?

449
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,560
If you're a man,

450
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,200
you speak with actions instead of words.

451
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,850
You are a man.

452
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,930
You're a man who lost your job.

453
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,210
Is pride more important than bread?

454
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,800
You two

455
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,570
apologize to the team leader tomorrow.

456
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,000
Maybe he can forgive you

457
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,240
for old times' sake.

458
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,970
Listen.

459
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,050
Apologizing

460
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,970
is impossible.

461
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,360
I should've hit him harder.

462
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,400
I think Pan Rou is right.

463
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,200
Which company would hire us

464
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,010
if we got fired suddenly?

465
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:09,930
Let me ask you,

466
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,280
how much savings do you have in the bank?

467
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:13,930
If you really lost your job,

468
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,880
can you afford

469
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,770
next month's rent?

470
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,890
Are you regretting it?

471
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,010
You feel like we shouldn't have hit him?

472
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,240
What he said to you today

473
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,450
was inhuman.

474
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,720
Don't you know how he bullies you usually?

475
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,480
And now you think we shouldn't have hit him?

476
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,560
Listen.

477
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,930
You're not allowed to apologize.

478
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,170
Even if the sky falls down, I'll hold it up.

479
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,240
How?

480
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,680
Yeah, how?

481
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,920
Push it up with a pot lid?

482
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,010
Song Chen, listen.

483
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,600
The employment situation is really bad right now.

484
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,000
Many graduates can't find a job.

485
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,880
What's our advantage?

486
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,690
Listen.

487
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,840
Wang is a senior in the company.

488
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,560
He can fire us at anytime.

489
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,480
But you...

490
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,000
What's the use of saying this now?

491
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,250
It's too late for this talk.

492
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:15,890
I did this

493
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,970
for you, didn't I?

494
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,040
Alright, I know.

495
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,400
Okay, okay.

496
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,320
Come to the company early tomorrow

497
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,730
and apologize to the team leader.

498
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,370
Maybe this matter will be over.

499
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,530
Wang is quite a fighter though.

500
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,640
He threw some punches on you two.

501
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,400
-He did it.
-He did it.

502
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,650
-Friendly fire.
-Friendly fire.

503
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:48,850
Luo Meijuan,

504
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,640
I don't think it's insulting

505
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,920
to wear your son's old clothes.

506
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,320
Anything you bring back for me to use,

507
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,210
I use it.

508
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,440
I don't think it's insult.

509
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,130
What now?

510
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,810
You think it's insulting

511
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,090
that a neighbor gave you a dress?

512
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,960
Do you have a fragile ego

513
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,160
or are you being vain?

514
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,250
Luo Meijuan.

515
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,490
I have a temper too.

516
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:23,890
Listen.

517
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,730
If I lose my temper...

518
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,560
When our neighbor's husband died,

519
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,930
he left her some money.

520
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,930
If one day you are gone,

521
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,210
you'll leave me this junk, right?

522
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,560
With how you're acting,

523
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,170
I want to be gone right now.

524
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,850
What do you mean by leaving junk?

525
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,800
I carefully selected all of these things.

526
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,970
One man's trash is one man's treasure.

527
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,450
What's wrong with reusing?

528
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,480
People go to thrift stores just for these things.

529
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,160
Do you understand?

530
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,240
I don't understand.

531
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,840
I only know that I, Luo Meijuan,

532
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,450
only deserve to wear

533
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,160
clothes that my neighbor doesn't want anymore.

534
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,360
The day has passed and we're still arguing about this.

535
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,890
What do you want?

536
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,440
Do you plan on starting a full-out war?

537
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,130
She gifted you a dress.

538
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,970
She's so nice, but you're not thankful at all.

539
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,960
She's nice?

540
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,770
If she's nice, you should go live with her.

541
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,560
You're speaking nonsense again.

542
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,040
What did you say?

543
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,330
Let me make it clear today.

544
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,880
In this house,

545
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,290
you either have me and not this junk,

546
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,570
or you have this junk and not me.

547
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,450
Throw them out!

548
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,120
Why are you staring at me?

549
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,880
Are you going to toss them, or should I?

550
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,800
Tell me.

551
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,080
Xiangqian.

552
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,370
Xiangqian.

553
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,290
Qiao.

554
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,560
In my opinion,

555
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,410
you can't blame your wife for being angry.

556
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,600
If it were me,

557
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,170
I would be unhappy too.

558
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,370
You two have quarreled about this

559
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,850
so many times already.

560
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,920
In the future,

561
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,080
stop bringing these things home for no reason.

562
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,560
Trash should be thrown away, right?

563
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,720
How are these things trash?

564
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,560
Take a look.

565
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:29,840
This one.

566
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,960
It used to be a decoration,

567
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,480
but she threw it away because it was chipped.

568
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,440
I planted flowers in it

569
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,650
and turned it into a flowerpot.

570
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,690
It's beautiful,

571
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,360
right?

572
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,330
You know,

573
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,250
back when Yang was learning how to draw,

574
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,240
he drew a picture using this as reference.

575
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,480
His art teacher

576
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,690
praised him

577
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:45,930
in front of the whole class.

578
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:46,920
That silly boy

579
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,800
was happy for a week after that class.

580
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:50,840
Now, she threw it away.

581
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,160
Look.

582
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,200
And this one.

583
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:54,160
Right?

584
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,120
With this CD,

585
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,250
its material and this coating

586
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,080
can all be recycled.

587
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,880
But the cost of recycling and reusing

588
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,890
is too high.

589
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,570
You can only throw it away as dry garbage

590
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,360
and destroy it.

591
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,690
I...

592
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,170
I turned it into a bicycle.

593
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,720
You can put it on the coffee table

594
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,600
or put it on the bookshelf.

595
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:11,240
This...

596
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,640
Right?

597
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,720
You can put sewing tools on it.

598
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,320
Or I can make a big one

599
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,000
and you can put a remote control on it. It's great!

600
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,720
But she threw it away.

601
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,890
Quiet down.

602
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,730
And this one.

603
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,930
After I took it home,

604
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,360
I brushed and disinfected it.

605
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,520
When Yang was little,

606
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,600
he sat on it while eating.

607
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,250
It's great.

608
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,050
Trash.

609
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,530
She's going to throw it away now.

610
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,200
I'm not targeting her.

611
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,370
I really can't bear to see this.

612
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,760
You have no idea.

613
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,960
Young people nowadays

614
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,840
buy things irresponsibly online.

615
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,970
Whether you need it,

616
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,610
or you don't need it,

617
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,160
you can use it,

618
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,760
or you won't use it,

619
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,640
you can afford it or not,

620
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,600
they even take out loans to buy things.

621
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:48,970
Yes.

622
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:49,720
Sure, buy it.

623
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,280
But after buying it,

624
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,840
they get tired of it after a few days

625
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,800
and throw it all out.

626
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,050
I do this job every day.

627
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:55,650
I think

628
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,000
I really...

629
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,170
It really hurts my heart, you know?

630
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,450
I take them home

631
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,080
and use them well.

632
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,490
What's wrong with that?

633
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,240
Calm down.

634
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,320
Xiangqian,

635
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,530
you don't say.

636
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,110
You are

637
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,050
quite detailed.

638
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,160
What's the use?

639
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,400
She doesn't understand.

640
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,560
I understand.

641
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,080
Qiao,

642
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,160
I salute you

643
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,450
No, no.

644
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,080
I said I understand Sister-in-law.

645
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,560
I salute you.

646
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,130
It's true.

647
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,650
No woman would be happy

648
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,960
if the gift her husband gave her

649
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,770
was used by another woman

650
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:40,960
or worn by another woman, right?

651
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,360
She must be unhappy.

652
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,170
In my opinion,

653
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,410
as her husband,

654
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,120
you should be more considerate.

655
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,600
Care more about her feelings,

656
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,120
right?

657
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,760
Try to understand her more.

658
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,640
Qiao.

659
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,720
First of all,

660
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,640
regarding your kind action

661
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,770
of giving your own clothes

662
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,090
to Luo Meijuan,

663
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,640
I express my gratitude.

664
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,920
Really, I salute you.

665
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:06,760
But I think the point

666
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,370
isn't whether you've used it before or not.

667
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,440
The point is

668
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,520
when Luo Meijuan needed a dress,

669
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,130
her husband gave her a dress.

670
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:12,730
That's the point,

671
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,210
right?

672
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:13,640
Also,

673
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,160
isn't life about being concerned,

674
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,890
taking care of others,

675
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,840
and being considerate.

676
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,160
Maybe I'm uncultured.

677
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,530
I only care about

678
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,570
food and vegetables.

679
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,930
What's the point of understanding?

680
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,880
Go back and talk to her.

681
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
It'll be okay as long as she understands.

682
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,160
I'm leaving now, or else she'll be unhappy.

683
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,080
Let's go

684
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:29,920
Qiao,

685
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,000
if there's anything else that needs to be repaired,

686
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,040
just let me know.

687
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,480
Don't worry, I'll call you.

688
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,440
It's okay. Don't always stay home alone.

689
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,440
Talk to your sister-in-law more.

690
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,480
Ping-pong is fun to watch, right?

691
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,200
This shirt is from the 80's, right?

692
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,570
I bought this when I went to Suzhou in the 90's.

693
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,570
It’s too tacky.

694
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,090
Why did you say you don't have nice clothes?

695
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,480
Isn't this pretty?

696
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,230
[Retail price: RMB 3,000]

697
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,690
Three thousand yuan?

698
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,490
Did you buy

699
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:02,730
this dress?

700
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,360
Yes.

701
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,680
I bought it.

702
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,250
What's wrong?

703
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,280
You spent 3,000 yuan on a dress.

704
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,690
Are you crazy?

705
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,880
A bedsheet costs 80 yuan.

706
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,520
It's barely half as big as a bedsheet

707
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,170
and it costs 3,000 yuan.

708
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,760
You're yelling at me.

709
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,120
Shut up!

710
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,280
I'm not deaf or stupid.

711
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,800
It's 3,000.

712
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,930
Yes, it's 3,000.

713
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,440
So what?

714
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,480
Let me ask you.

715
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,280
Is it diamond-studded

716
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,490
or is it sewn with gold thread?

717
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,330
Is it worth 3,000 yuan?

718
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,570
I think it's worth it.

719
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,610
It's your problem that you think it's not worth it.

720
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,720
I work so hard all day long.

721
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,090
What's wrong with buying a dress

722
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,370
to reward myself?

723
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,490
Is this a reward for yourself?

724
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,690
You just want to show off

725
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,370
at your classmate reunion.

726
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,250
Three thousand yuan.

727
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,130
I won't scold you if you spent 3,000 on food and drinks.

728
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:01,840
You...

729
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,770
It's just a dress.

730
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,880
You wasted

731
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,490
half a month's salary.

732
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,520
Right now,

733
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,360
there are so many children in remote lands

734
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,080
who can't even get a sip of clean water.

735
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,050
Fine.

736
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:12,760
You're getting off-topic.

737
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,930
Don't play this trick on me.

738
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,050
People need hobbies.

739
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,680
It's said online that

740
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,320
women will get depression

741
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,560
if they don't buy clothes.

742
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,040
Why don't you respect my hobby?

743
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,360
You threw away all my hobbies.

744
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,040
What kind of hobby is collecting trash?

745
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,370
I...

746
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,250
It's called waste recycling.

747
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,400
I give them a new life.

748
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,920
Well, buying clothes

749
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,730
is to extend my own life.

750
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,090
Hang it back.

751
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,130
I'll cut it up with scissors.

752
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,010
Three thousand.

753
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,480
I'll tell you what it means to extend life.

754
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,840
You have food and water

755
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,930
and you can extend your life.

756
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,650
Are you done?

757
00:32:58,890 --> 00:32:59,930
Have I had a single happy day

758
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,960
after marrying you?

759
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,800
We eat discounted food,

760
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,320
you made the furniture,

761
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,850
and we live in a second-hand house.

762
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,040
I put up with all that.

763
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,450
Now, I spent my own money to buy some clothes

764
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,690
and I have to hide it from you.

765
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,480
Shouldn't you

766
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,210
reflect on yourself?

767
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,730
What have you done to me?

768
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,080
I hand you my paychecks.

769
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,000
I don't smoke, drink, or mess around outside.

770
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,370
I come back to accompany you right after work.

771
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,210
What else do you want me to do?

772
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,010
You accompany me?

773
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,840
Have you ever done a single household chore?

774
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,000
Do you think you are the family mascot

775
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,280
or a lucky cat?

776
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,160
You stand there without doing anything.

777
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,840
Even our son is better than you.

778
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,890
Let him be the judge when he comes back.

779
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,240
Yes, he is better than me.

780
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,050
He works overtime every day.

781
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,530
He eats, sleeps, and leaves.

782
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,600
For him,

783
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,970
this home is just a hotel.

784
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,690
Who accompanies you more, me or him?

785
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,250
That's because my son has an actual job.

786
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,050
Actual job?

787
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,280
He pays for food every month.

788
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,600
He pays more than you.

789
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,040
If I dress nicely,

790
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,640
he would even compliment me.

791
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,320
What about you?

792
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,930
Not a single peep from you.

793
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,040
I get it now.

794
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,400
You look down on me for not making enough money.

795
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,120
Luo Meijuan, you weren't so materialistic when you were young.

796
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,530
It's not too late

797
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:06,240
to look down on me now.

798
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,480
I won't live a peaceful life anymore.

799
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,760
I'll cooperate with you.

800
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,280
Fine!

801
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,679
As a female director,

802
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,600
you've worked on set for more than ten years

803
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,679
and you can't figure out a drainage pipe.

804
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,170
You know I worked on set for more than ten years,

805
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,010
but you don't know what I do?

806
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,210
I'm in charge of actors' performance and cameras.

807
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,730
Why would I need a prop team if I can fix pipes?

808
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,920
Fine.

809
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,560
How about I send Xue over there

810
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,440
to repair it for you?

811
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,120
He can also

812
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,760
fix everything else in your home.

813
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,080
No, no, no.

814
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,960
We're divorced. Don't call him.

815
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,570
Don't be shy.

816
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,920
This is called after-sales service for divorce.

817
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,200
Seriously, Liang Shanshan.

818
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,720
It's not suitable for us to meet now.

819
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,010
Don't add more trouble for me.

820
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,280
If you really want to help me,

821
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,720
think back to all your boys.

822
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,200
Has anyone fixed drainage pipes for you before?

823
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,320
Send one to me.

824
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,200
No problem. I'll start looking now.

825
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:35,240
No, no, no.

826
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,250
I'm just kidding.

827
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,400
Hang up now. The smell is coming out.

828
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,210
I need to hold my breath.

829
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,200
Okay, bye.

830
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,840
She sent a guy over already?

831
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,130
-Have you had dinner?
-Do you know how to fix drainage pipes?

832
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,250
-I can.
-I haven't eaten.

833
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,200
Come in.

834
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,840
I'll fix it for you.

835
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,210
You really fixed it?

836
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,370
You men,

837
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,320
do you have a natural talent

838
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,800
for fixing and repairing,

839
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,010
or do you have to learn it?

840
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,650
There's nothing I can't do.

841
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:56,720
Really?

842
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,850
Let's eat.

843
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:00,690
The food is ready.

844
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,850
You cook well too.

845
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,360
You can fix pipes and cook.

846
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,010
Which technical school did you go to?

847
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,600
I did go to a technical school.

848
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,770
It was in my home.

849
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,600
I learned how to fix pipes from my dad

850
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,410
and how to cook from Meijuan.

851
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,320
Try it.

852
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,290
Try my cooking.

853
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,280
Thank you.

854
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,800
Just helping a friend out.

855
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,770
It's nothing.

856
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,010
Is it okay?

857
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:37,920
Delicious.

858
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:44,680
Delicious.

859
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:46,890
Eat more.

860
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,280
What happened to your face?

861
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,120
I...

862
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,000
had a fight

863
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,480
in the company today.

864
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,250
With whom?

865
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,680
My team leader.

866
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,960
I beat him up.

867
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,890
Why?

868
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,520
Because he deserved it.

869
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,640
I know

870
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,520
it's wrong to hit someone.

871
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,160
I can tolerate it

872
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,200
if he insults me,

873
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,770
and I can tolerate it if he insults my friends,

874
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,520
but he insulted my parents

875
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,040
and even you.

876
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,120
That's my bottom line. I couldn't hold back.

877
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,570
I wanted to do more too.

878
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,650
If he insulted this many people,

879
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:24,600
then just beat him up.

880
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,040
Some people just need to be taught a lesson.

881
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,200
You support me?

882
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,770
Yes.

883
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,840
Don't you think I was being impulsive?

884
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,450
You're not impulsive every day.

885
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,440
You're much more sensible

886
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,810
than my sister.

887
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,570
You didn't see how Wang Youde was like today.

888
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,410
He's so foul with his insults.

889
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,450
Is your team leader

890
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,930
the one you told me

891
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,650
to be careful of

892
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,930
when we left the company?

893
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,170
Yes, that's him.

894
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,360
I've seen many middle-aged greasy men.

895
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,930
He always brags about his performance,

896
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,410
tries to build connections with everyone,

897
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,440
and loves to make girls drink,

898
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,570
but he never pays the bill.

899
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,760
He's always like this.

900
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:06,930
Does he love to talk about past hardships

901
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,120
at parties,

902
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,650
love to make people work overtime,

903
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,970
and eight out of ten sentences he says

904
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,490
are about his achievements when he was young?

905
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,050
Their catchphrase is...

906
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,600
"I used to be really close to so-and-so.

907
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,450
If I say the word,

908
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,160
so-and-so has to help me out"?

909
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,290
All the credit

910
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,330
goes to him,

911
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,810
but if anything goes wrong,

912
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:30,930
it has nothing to do with him.

913
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,920
He's like a vampire

914
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,000
to young subordinates like you

915
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,410
and won't stop until he sucks out

916
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,410
all your passion and energy.

917
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,640
People like him

918
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,520
also have some usual tricks.

919
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,090
He'll hit you with a stick,

920
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,240
then give you a carrot,

921
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,050
exhaust you with countless menial tasks,

922
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,130
and use countless unrealistic goals to waste your time.

923
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,880
You understand all of this.

924
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:51,850
Just quit.

925
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,850
Quit what?

926
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,370
I'll get fired tomorrow anyway.

927
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
Doesn't that work out?

928
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,520
But I've been working here

929
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,000
for more than three years.

930
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,720
I was about to get a promotion and raise.

931
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,970
But you beat him up,

932
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,810
so you have to bear the consequences,

933
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,090
right?

934
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:19,850
Wait,

935
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,530
didn't you say you would support me?

936
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,530
Yes.

937
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,880
I support you in teaching him a lesson.

938
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,120
But

939
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,810
if you can't bear the consequences of hitting someone,

940
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,530
you should've thought twice before doing it.

941
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,600
So what if you hit him?

942
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,040
It's no big deal.

943
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,010
You're young.

944
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,210
You're capable and you're smart.

945
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,440
Just find another job.

946
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,240
What are you afraid of?

947
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,040
Don't rush me. I'm already here.

948
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,040
I told you.

949
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,610
She can't do anything without me.

950
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:15,250
Oh, you.

951
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,370
Backtrack and leave.

952
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,360
She really doesn't need you.

953
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,360
No.

954
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,570
She doesn't need me?

955
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,520
Correct.

956
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,130
She's already cleared the obstacle

957
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,320
and gone toward the broad avenue.

958
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,690
Didn't you say it's troublesome?

959
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,890
She won't trouble you now.

960
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:33,840
Alright.

961
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,320
I'm leaving.

962
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,600
Hurry and leave.

963
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,170
Bye.

964
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,240
I already got here.

965
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,330
I have advice for you.

966
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,000
If you want to become a big tree,

967
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,720
don't fight with grass.

968
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,360
A general has a sword

969
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,640
but doesn't kill flies.

970
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,490
Flies?

971
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,090
What fly?

972
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:07,850
Your team leader.

973
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,840
Doesn't your team leader buzz around like a fly

974
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,210
in your ears every day?

975
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,690
He doesn't bite,

976
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,930
but he's still annoying.

977
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,210
You should stay away

978
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,360
from people like him early on.

979
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,210
You worked with him

980
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,800
and had a fight with him.

981
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,600
All of this lowered your level

982
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,050
and consumed your energy.

983
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,530
Don't you think it's a loss

984
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:28,320
to waste your time

985
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,410
fighting with people like him every day?

986
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,760
Yes.

987
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,840
It's a huge loss.

988
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,640
So,

989
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,560
quit your job as soon as possible

990
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,970
and start a new chapter of life.

991
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,170
-Okay.
-There were people who thought

992
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,600
I shouldn't have gotten a divorce at 36,

993
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,210
but I did it.

994
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,050
What's there to be afraid of?

995
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,920
Bing.

996
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,840
I'm here to fix your pipe.
