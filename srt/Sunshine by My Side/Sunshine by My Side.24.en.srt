00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,100
Can you check the cycle?

5
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,420
I'm done arranging it.

6
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,570
It's good. Leave it here.

7
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,100
Thank you.

8
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,940
Not at all.

9
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,900
Hello, I'm here to pick up the parcel.

10
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,180
I'll leave this in your care.

11
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,140
Please deliver it as soon as possible.

12
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,820
Don't worry.

13
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,660
I'll deliver it on time.

14
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,020
Okay, thank you.

15
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,250
What time is it now? Your uncle didn't reply to my messages.

16
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,060
When is he coming?

17
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,340
He...

18
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,650
He obeys traffic rules.

19
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,140
He doesn't look at his phone when driving.

20
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,860
Just wait.

21
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,700
Okay.

22
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,980
We can't wait anymore.

23
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,740
If your uncle doesn't come soon,

24
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,220
my sister will rush in

25
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,060
and settle the score with me,

26
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,659
I'll be doomed.

Junjie.

28
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,060
It's your turn. Come in.

29
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,900
Okay, teacher.

30
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,420
Jian Shuang.

31
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,540
Enough.

32
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,410
Don't force yourself to sleep if you can't sleep.

33
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,220
I heard you talking.

34
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,740
Get up and eat.

35
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,700
What time is it?

36
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,500
Bing.

37
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,540
You...

38
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,540
Don't be mad at me.

39
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,580
I'm not mad.

40
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,260
I'm a little tired.

41
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,100
I haven't cooked for years.

42
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,740
Xue Yiming still doesn't know I can cook.

43
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,260
I cooked for you every day when we were young.

44
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,860
I cooked so much,

45
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,050
I was sick of it.

46
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,420
Now, I'm cooking because of you again.

47
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,500
Hurry up. Don't let my comeback be in vain.

48
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,100
Get up and eat.

49
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,380
Sorry, I caused trouble again.

50
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,490
It's okay.

51
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,500
It's fine.

52
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,860
It's great. I'm happy.

53
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,300
You didn't listen to me before

54
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,500
and kept messing around.

55
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,900
Let's see how you mess around now.

56
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,780
Just be good and study at home.

57
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,340
That's right.

58
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,220
Good.

59
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,780
Stand here.

60
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,380
Let me see how to get you down.

61
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,100
Don't move.

62
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,900
One, two, three. Go.

63
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,060
You've gotten so heavy.

64
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,540
All right, put your feet on the ground.

65
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,780
Sit.

66
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,620
Bing...

67
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,740
Are you okay?

68
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,500
I'm okay.

69
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,820
Why won't I be okay?

70
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,540
Something is wrong with you.

71
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,770
What's wrong?

72
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,780
Will you be

73
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,060
staying home with me every day?

74
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,740
The good thing about my job is freedom.

75
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,260
I just submitted the film.

76
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,060
I'll serve you this month.

77
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,140
It's a good opportunity for us to do some bonding.

78
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,300
Come on, brush your teeth.

79
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,540
No!

80
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,300
Brush your teeth!

Old Hen.

82
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,340
Projector.

83
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,900
Here.

84
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,420
How is the place we just saw?

85
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,540
It's in the central business district.

86
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,700
You can see the river from the wide window.

87
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,380
Isn't 100,000 a month too expensive?

88
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,980
You need feng shui to do business.

89
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,620
You can't just rent a basement.

90
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,020
Where will the client sit when he comes?

91
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,780
Think about it. We can put a coffee machine in our office

92
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,500
and set up a bunch of coffee beans

93
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,500
from different countries and nations.

94
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,540
It will show the taste of our office.

95
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,060
We need a massage chair in the lounge too.

96
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,620
Staying up late and working late is hard on the neck.

97
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,650
Buy it.

98
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,300
Okay, we'll buy it.

99
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,140
We haven't bought the massage chair yet.

100
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,340
What massage chair?

101
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,500
You talk as if you like to work overtime.

102
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,820
You're the laziest.

103
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,660
I've never been lazy, okay?

104
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,660
Yes, you have never been lazy.

105
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,490
Not at all.

106
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,900
Hello.

107
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,140
That will be 19,500 yuan.

108
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,620
Payment by?

109
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,740
Card.

110
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,860
Sorry.

111
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,900
You can't use this card.

112
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,980
No way. I always use this card.

113
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,060
Try again.

114
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:22,880
Okay.

115
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,060
It really can't be used.

116
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,940
The card has been rejected.

117
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,780
Do you have other cards?

118
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,850
I only have this card.

119
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,659
How could it be rejected?

120
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,500
I just called my mom.

121
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,740
She told me she terminated all my cards.

122
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,020
So you're out of money.

123
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,060
How do I explain to Sheng Yang?

124
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,900
I think

125
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,060
we should keep it from him for now.

126
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,180
What should we do?

127
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,140
I'll think of another way.

128
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,780
There's one.

129
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,220
This one.

130
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,170
Thank you.

Yes.

137
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,050
Do you have my package?

138
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,820
No.

139
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,140
But there's one for Director Jian.

140
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,140
Give it to me.

141
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,980
Are you cold here?

142
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,850
I'm fine.

I sincerely invite you

149
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,860
to be the director of my film.

150

151

willing?

152

Yes.

153
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,740
Did you dream of your crush?

154
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,700
Did you dream of your crush?

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,700
What's wrong with you?

156

What time is it?

157
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,940
Enough. Get down.

158
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,420
Get down.

159
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,370
Did you sleep well?

160
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,020
Come and take a look.

161
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,420
I finally finished this last night.

162
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,900
And I’ve asked someone

163
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,650
to deliver the proposal to Jian Bing.

164
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,300
Take a look.

165
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,260
How is it?

166
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,260
You two fell asleep last night. I didn't wake you up.

167
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,340
Isn't it nice?

168
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,780
Look at this.

169
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,820
Hey.

170
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,700
If you have a suggestion, just tell me.

171
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,620
I can change it.

172
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,100
Nevermind. Look at this.

173
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,540
It's really good.

174
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,700
Yes, very good.

175
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,660
What's wrong with you two?

176
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,340
There's no need to flatter me.

177
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,220
I can only improve if I get proper feedback.

178
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,580
Besides,

179
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,500
I can't let Miss Pan's investment

180

Yes.

182
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,380
I've made up my mind. Look.

183
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,980
Now, we have the funds

184
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,540
and the idea for the copy.

185
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,540
If Jian Bing can join our team,

I need to take this.

193
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,310
I need to take this call.

194
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,260
Hello?

195
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:37,980
Moses Advertisement.

196
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,300
Congratulations.

197
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,100
You are...

198
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,740
Xue Yiming.

199
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,100
Do you have time for a chat?

200
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,690
From now on,

201
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,500
everything will go according to my plan.

202
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,260
Bing,

203
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,250
I know I was wrong.

204
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,980
You're so gentle. It's really scary.

205
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,700
Just scold me instead.

206
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,850
Put your leg down.

207
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,260
Let's eat.

208
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,580
Take your medicine after eating.

209
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,820
Study hard after taking the medicine.

210
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,980
What are you doing?

211
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,020
Don't act like a kindergarten teacher.

212
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,260
Can you compare to a kid in kindergarten?

213
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,060
Kids in kindergarten

214
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,340
are more sensible than you.

215
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,020
Aren't you going to work?

216
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,100
Didn't you hear me just now?

217
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,580
Here.

218
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,700
Have some soup.

219
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,580
Free-range chicken.

220
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,660
You'll recover faster after drinking it.

221
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,500
Is it good?

222
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,380
Bing,

223
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,940
do you know why the soup tastes good?

224
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,980
Because this chicken

225
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,620
had freedom.

226
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,740
It was always free.

227
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,940
It could do whatever it wanted.

228
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,940
That's why it's better than normal chicken.

229
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,980
Are you a free-range chicken?

230
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,180
Freedom?

231
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,500
Hurry up and finish eating so you can study.

232
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,300
I like watching you study.

233
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,700
When you study hard,

234
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,020
I think it's worth raising you.

235
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:21,980
Have an egg.

236
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,500
Mr. Fang.

237
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,980
You're finally here.

238
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,060
Morning.

239
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,780
Mr. Fang.

240
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,500
Morning.

241
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,420
Jian Shuang asked me to tutor her.

242
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,340
I don't have many classes this semester.

243
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:47,980
So...

244
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:48,850
Hurry up.

245
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,490
Sorry for troubling you.

246
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,660
It's no trouble at all. Please come in.

247
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,500
It's no problem.

248
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,540
You haven't had breakfast, have you?

249
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,380
Come on, let's eat together.

250
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,180
I've eaten.

251
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:54,980
It's still hot.

252
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,860
Have a seat.

253
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:56,940
Come here.

254
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,580
This way.

255
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,260
-Go ahead and eat. Don't mind me.
-Sit there.

256
00:15:59,260 --> 00:15:59,750
It's okay.

257
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,540
You're quite flexible, right?

258
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,260
Finish your meal.

259
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,020
Did you eat?

260
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,860
Yes.

261
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,380
Thank you.

262
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,100
You guys eat. It's okay.

263
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,420
Have some more.

264
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,420
You're here. Have a seat.

265
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,260
I didn't treat you well at the company that day.

266
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,220
I invited you out for a cup of coffee.

267
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,370
I didn't expect you to

268
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,500
start a company and become a boss so soon.

269
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,100
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

270
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,180
Thank you.

271
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:49,700
Okay.

272
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,020
Please enjoy.

273
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,540
Okay.

274
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,020
What is it?

275
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,020
Just say it.

276
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,089
[To: Jian Bing]

277
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,210
[To: Jian Bing]

278
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,900
I addressed this to Jian Bing.

279
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,140
Why do you have it?

280
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,380
At work,

281
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,900
Jian Bing and I

282
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,780
don't hold back much.

283
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,700
I hope you don't mind.

284
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,859
I've read your idea.

285
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,780
Don't worry.

286
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,860
I won't leak it.

287
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,260
But I have a few questions for you.

288
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,780
What are the

289
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,020
qualifications of your company?

290
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
How big is the scale?

291
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,260
It won't be

292
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,770
easy to

293
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,620
execute this proposal.

294
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,660
It has both animation and live-action parts.

295
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,490
It costs a lot of money.

296
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,740
If it's about the cost,

297
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,660
you have no need to worry.

298
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,820
Besides,

299
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,940
I won't treat Director Jian Bing badly.

300
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,180
You're quite arrogant.

301
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,660
You see.

302
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,780
Our company

303
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,660
made many public service advertisements like this.

304
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,380
We won many awards too, right?

305
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,180
Don't think this matter is that simple.

306
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,820
This is what I think.

307
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,860
Even if we don't care about the performance,

308
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,820
the effect

309
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,780
of this film

310
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,140
is also very important.

311
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,980
Your company

312
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,020
doesn't have government resources,

313
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:31,820
right?

314
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,540
You have no broadcast platform.

315
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,500
Right?

316
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,620
You have nothing.

317
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,580
You spend so much money

318
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,860
and so much energy

319
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,340
to hire such a good director

320
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,300
to make a film like this.

321
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,260
But in the end, you reap nothing.

322
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,580
Then what is the point?

323
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,020
Isn't it a waste?

324
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,900
For Director Jian Bing,

325
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,180
considering her position in this industry,

326
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,900
she doesn't need your small film

327
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,220
or meager money.

328
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,020
You know?

329
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,860
It's a public service advertisement.

330
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,900
Not charity, okay?

331
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,500
We plan to use this film to participate in a competition.

332
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,060
Just one competition?

333
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,660
You won't even consider the returns

334
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,020
for your first project?

335
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:15,980
If we win,

336
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,580
we'll be famous in the industry.

337
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,420
This is the return.

338
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,660
Who will invest in your idea?

339
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
An angel?

340
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,660
Then introduce your angel to me.

341
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,900
Let me get to know them.

342
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,140
I have a bold question.

343
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,380
Does your company

344
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,100
even have a basic customer base?

345
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,250
You don't have to worry about that.

346
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,860
We're not inviting you.

347
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,020
I'm inviting Director Jian Bing.

348
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,940
Anything else?

349
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,860
I don't think you understand.

350
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,420
I'll get straight to the point.

351
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,300
Jian Bing is shy.

352
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,340
She can't refuse you.

353
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,380
So, please find another director

354
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,340
for your project.

355
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,420
What do you mean?

356
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,700
What do I mean?

357
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,060
Your proposal is with me.

358
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,660
Don't you understand?

359
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,900
Why didn't she tell me herself?

360
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,900
She's been busy these days.

361
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,060
Besides,

362
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,780
it was always my job

363
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,580
to refuse others.

364
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,420
It's not easy

365
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,860
to start a company.

366
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,260
I've been through this phase.

367
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,570
How about this?

368
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,620
Tomorrow night,

369
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,300
there will be a

370
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,740
industry gathering here.

371
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,020
This is

372
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,020
an invitation.

373
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,500
Many big shots in the circle will be here.

374
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,500
If you are interested,

375
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,860
take this invitation

376
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,820
and bring your project here.

377
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,820
By then,

378
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,580
I'll introduce you to some peers.

379
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,300
That's it.

380
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,700
I'm leaving.

381
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,420
Let me.

382
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,620
What? It's just two cups of coffee.

383
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,620
I don't need you to pay.

384
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,930
You're competing at speed with me.

385
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,130
I didn't drink the coffee.

386
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,060
Don't waste it, pack it up.

389
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,700
I have a small announcement.

390
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,380
No one needs to stay back this year.

-To visit Jian Shuang.
-Sure.

Come in.

Mr. Fang.

You...

411
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,500
Have some tea.

412
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,050
I brought some myself.

413
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:02,660
Alright, you can drink that.

414
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,860
No, I'll drink yours.

415
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,060
Okay.

Thank you.

You taught her and tuned the piano.

420

Close the door.

421
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,160

Close the door.

Are you okay?

426
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Do I look okay to you?

427
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,940
I've been studying here all day.

428
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,380
I've never studied so hard since I graduated from primary school.

429
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,490
I must have been out of my mind

430
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,500
to have the two of them watch over me.

Studying is not hard.

432
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,260
Being sympathetic is not hard either.

Lower your voice.

For the girl…

461
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,090
I'm done reading them. You read them to me.

462
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,730
No. Read them yourself.

463
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,900
You asked me to search online.

464
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:37,660
You…

465
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,340
Is this how you top students win girls' hearts?

466
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,670
Well,

467
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,500
gathering information is a good way to start everything.

468
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,980
You gathered them. Read them to me.

469
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,660
No.

470
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,500
Read them.

471
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,170
No.

472
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:50,940
So much for our friendship!

473
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,780
Fine. I'll read them.

474
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,260
How did Jian Shuang do?

475
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,740
She's hard-working.

476
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,780
but haven't got the hang of it.

477
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,500
She's a sophomore now.

478
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,700
She needs to hurry up.

479
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,860
If she were in my class,

480
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,500
I would have...

481
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,260
But I remembered

482
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,260
that she was your sister,

483
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,380
so I

484
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,940
didn't say anything too harsh.

485
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,980
Don't be easy on her for me.

486
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,220
Just do what you need to do.

487
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,340
Otherwise, how can she make progress?

488
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,940
Actually,

489
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,860
Jian Shuang is quite smart.

490
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,620
It's just

491
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,380
that her focus

492
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,860
is not on school.

493
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,020
I'll help her get the hang of it.

494
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,700
Don't worry.

495
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,820
Timing

496
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,860
is very important.

497
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,940
Wait for a special moment.

498
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,740
I love you.

499
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,980
It's a serious matter.

500
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,500
It can completely change a relationship…

501
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,580
Hold on. I don't understand.

502
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,340
What does it have to do with them?

503
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,900
Enough. Forget all this rubbish.

504
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,780
Those articles make it clear that…

505
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:15,820
Mr. Fang.

506
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,620
I'd love to

507
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,740
have you stay for dinner.

508
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,420
But I

509
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,740
don't cook. I usually order takeouts.

510
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,340
How about we go out to eat

511
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,100
after

512
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,740
Jian Shuang is done?

513
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,380
It's so kind of you.

514
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,500
Actually,

515
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,780
I'm good at cooking.

516
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,380
How about I

517
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,250
cook for you next time?

518
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,060
Sure.

519
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,980
Why isn't Sheng Yang back yet?

520
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,300
I bet

521
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,700
he's gone to meet Jian Bing after finishing his work.

522
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,020
He's so thoughtless.

523
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,500
He can give us a call.

524
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,660
We…

525
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,580
Don't you think we should tell him about our tight budget?

526
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,500
The three of us are a team.

527
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,540
We should go through thick and thin together.

528
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,740
Why don't we tell him about it?

529
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,660
No.

530
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,500
He's got enough on his plate.

531
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,820
The last thing he needs

532
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,180
is more trouble.

533
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,050
I'll figure it out.

534
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,300
How?

535
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,140
Your pockets are empty.

536
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,140
The shooting will start soon.

537
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,050
How are we going to pay the director?

538
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,660
If

539
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,050
Sheng Yang can get in good with Director Jian,

540
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,340
we won't have to pay her.

541
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,380
Be serious!

542
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,060
I'm working on it. Don't worry.

543
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,540
Stop.

544
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,100
That's enough.

545
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,540
Jian Shuang, here's the thing.

546
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,420
Well,

547
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,260
you got every note right.

548
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,820
But you played like a primary school student reading a textbook.

549
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,180
No emotion at all.

550
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,980
It's so flat.

551
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,420
No dynamics.

552
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,780
Mr. Fang.

553
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,500
Can you show me how to play with emotion?

554
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,380
Watch carefully.

555
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,980
Pay attention to your strength.

556
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,420
It should come from your back.

557
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,620
Make it flow down your arms

558
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,220
like water

559
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,660
to your wrists,

560
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,860
and then to your fingertips.

561
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,220
Look.

562
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,860
Awesome.

563
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,620
Mr. Fang, when you play the piano,

564
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,700
you're so charming and elegant.

565
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,300
Old but charming.

566
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,570
This is my sister's favorite piece.

567
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,660
Because it brings back

568
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,660
some of her sweetest memories.

569
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,020
Really?

570
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,250
Ask her about it later.

571
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,900
Me?

721
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,940
When I was in college,

722
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,620
Sheng Yang and I shared a bunk bed.

723
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,900

724
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,130

725
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,940

727
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,140
At that time,

728
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,020
I spent a lot of time

729

I promised you a bright future.

737
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,820
I didn't consider the difficulties we'd meet

738

739
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,700

740
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,740
You don't have to apologize.

We can't leave all the hard work to Sheng Yang.

743
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,570
We shouldn't count on him to solve all the problems.

744
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,300
We should do something too.

745
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,220

746
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,100

00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,610
It's okay.

761
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,500
Can you afford it?

762
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,220
This is an antique.

763
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,500
Yeah. It's an old machine.

764
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,940
It's just a prop I used.

765
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,780
Come here. It's okay.

766
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,490
Okay.

767
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,980
Sorry, Bing.

768
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,210
It's fine.

769
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,020
Sit down.

770
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,380
How about this?

771
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,980
Let me take a look at it.

772
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,980
Mr. Fang.

773
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,740
You don't need to fix it.

774
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,220
Don't mind him.

775
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,500
He loves fixing things.

776
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,650
Machines like that

777
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,060
excite him more than girls.

778
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,020
It's not complicated.

779
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,260
I'll bring tools with me next time

780
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,820
and fix it for you.

781
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,100
You really know how to fix it?

782
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,180
Yeah.

783
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,530
He's good at fixing things.

784
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,380
Eat.

785
00:40:59,340 --> 00:40:59,690
Here.

786
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,980
Let's eat.

787
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,940
-Thank you, Mr. Fang.
-Let's eat.

788
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,020
Mr. Fang is so versatile.

789
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,540
Few men are as great as him.

790
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,380
Do you agree, Bing?

791
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,940
Has that nurse from the hospital

792
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,180
contacted you?

793
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,260
When we were in the hospital,

794
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,780
a nurse showed interest in Mr. Fang

795
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,300
and asked for his number.

796
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,660
She was so enthusiastic.

797
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,140
She's also pretty.

798
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,940
As pretty as you, Bing.

799
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,300
Your uncle is popular among girls, isn't he?

800
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,580
Of course.

801
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,060
In his school,

802
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,900
many female teachers are fond of him.

803
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,220
Really?

804
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,940
Bing, do you hear that?

805
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,500
Mr. Fang, have you taken the hint?

806
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,780
They want to set us up.

807
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,500
Whose idea is it?

808
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,620
Jian Shuang's idea, right?

809
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,020
I…

810
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,490
I…

811
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,980
You two look great together.

812
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,660
So I…

813
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,170
You're taking it too slow

814
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,650
so I decided to give you a push.

815
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,820
Give us a push?

816
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,500
Fool kid.

817
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,020
Stay out of grown folks' business.

818
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,170
Are all these delicious dishes

819
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,340
not enough to shut you up?

820
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:13,780
Wait.

821
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,940
I don't think it's Jian Shuang's idea.

822
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,300
Is it your idea?

823
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,140
Let's eat.

824
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,420
Finishing all the dishes

825
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,770
is the best way to show respect for the cook.

826
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,100
Eat up.

827
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,860
Don't be so naughty.

828
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:32,660
Eat.

829
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,500
Mr. Fang.

830
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,780
Great.

831
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,340
I mean his cooking.

832
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:45,940
It is great.

833
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,700
Amazing.

834
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,100
It's never been this good before.

835
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,540
Shut up.
