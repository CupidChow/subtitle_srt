00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,270
Morning.

3
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:36,829
Are you going to work?

4
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,390
Are you going to work?

5
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:43,990
Good morning.

6
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,230
Some people say

7
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,110
that your hobby shouldn't become your career.

8
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,430
Just like how you shouldn't set your favorite song

9
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,350
as your alarm ringtone.

10
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,670
Because once a hobby becomes work,

11
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,430
it loses its sense of novelty

12
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,790
and becomes tiring.

13
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,110
You'll get tired of dealing with it.

14
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,550
You'll forget why you embarked on it in the first place.

15
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,790
Just like how you'll forget

16
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,550
the initial excitement

17
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,790
after being in a relationship for a long time.

18
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,230
Let go of me.

19
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,790
I said we're breaking up.

20
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,270
Do you understand?

21
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,550
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

22
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,910
I'm breaking up with you.

23
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,270
Let's break up. Do you understand?

24
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,150
Don't let me see you.

25
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,030
Hello?

26
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,230
We broke up.

27
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,790
Let me tell you.

28
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,550
That girl today

29
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,910
got a bob haircut

30
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,470
and begged me not to leave her.

31
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,790
She was like a fool.

32
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,590
I'll be playing games all night long

33
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,190
with the brothers tonight. Can you join us?

34
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,030
Is there any problem?

35
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,550
Okay, see you tonight.

36
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,230
Bye.

37
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,390
Come here.

38
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,030
Come here!

39
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,550
Pick it up.

40
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,470
I'm asking you to pick it up!

41
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,909
Okay.

42
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,790
What a wacko.

43
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,350
In this era, where everything is fast paced,

44
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,350
it's easy to go with the flow.

45
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,910
It's hard to stick to your original intentions,

46
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,350
but it's also the most precious thing.

47
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,030
Excuse me.

48
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,830
Excuse me.

49
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,550
Are you wondering

50
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,150
if I'm not afraid that reality would slap me in the face?

51
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:21,710
Yes.

52
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,470
But I'm more afraid of

53
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,030
already compromising

54
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,910
to society when I'm only in my twenties,

55
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,710
and becoming the person I despise the most.

56
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:09,670
Morning, Director Jian.

57
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,910
Morning.

58
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,150
Morning, Director.

59
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,030
Morning, Director Jian.

60
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,790
Morning, sir.

61
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,390
Morning, boss.

62
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,550
Morning.

63
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,550
Sorry.

64
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,230
This matter is urgent.

65
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,590
That's why today's meeting is so early.

66
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,150
It's okay.

67
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:33,909
Is everyone here?

68
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:34,710
Yes.

69
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:35,830
Let's start then.

70
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,390
Okay.

71
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,710
About the case of Shuming's packaging box,

72
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,990
there's no feedback from the client

73
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,390
with regards to the last version of the design plan.

74
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,550
Isn't that good?

75
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,710
That's the scariest thing.

76
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,710
They've been delaying the payment,

77
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,590
and we only found out after we asked.

78
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,710
They said we exceeded the budget.

79
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,270
No.

80
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,150
We didn't exceed the budget.

81
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,550
It's just that their business hasn't been doing well lately

82
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,790
and they don't have that much money,

83
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,270
but they also don't want to change their design team.

84
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,990
And we can't lower the standards either.

85
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,230
They are a big enterprise.

86
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,110
How shameless.

87
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,550
They want us to increase the cost

88
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,470
without people noticing it?

89
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,710
Boss.

90
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,590
You really hit the nail on the head.

91
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,710
They want the price lowered,

92
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,150
but they can't lower their expectations.

93
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,670
The client

94
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,110
is trying to maximize returns with minimal investments.

95
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,150
They're spoiled.

96
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,470
This is considered a violation of the contract.

97
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,910
But we can't sue them either.

98
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,830
Otherwise,

99
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,350
no one would dare to work with our company again.

100
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,350
Boss, I...

101
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,150
You came so early and haven't even had drink a sip of water.

102
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,270
Sheng Yang.

103
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,350
Please go to the cafe downstairs

104
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,590
and get some coffee for everyone.

105
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,230
Team Leader.

106
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,950
Don't we have coffee in the office?

107
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,870
How can the coffee in the office

108
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,350
compare to the cafe's downstairs?

109
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,110
My treat.

110
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,429
Boss.

111
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,830
An Americano as usual?

112
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:36,750
Sure.

113
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,070
I'll have an Americano too.

114
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,870
Iced, please.

115
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,870
What do you want?

116
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,190
Hurry up. My treat.

117
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:41,750
Sheng Yang.

118
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,590
An Americano.

119
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,350
A latte.

120
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:43,990
A latte for Liu.

121
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,470
Sheng Yang.

122
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,990
I want an Americano too.

123
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:45,990
A latte for me too.

124
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,710
A latte for me too.

125
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,710
Go ahead.

126
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,710
I'll go now.

127
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,590
Are you sure Director Jian

128
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,190
trained under Director Xue?

129
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,590
Of course.

130
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,590
Yes.

131
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,830
A female director?

132
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,710
Is she up to the job?

133
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,590
She doesn't look that reliable.

134
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,110
She's definitely reliable.

135
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,870
She's been under Director Xue for over ten years.

136
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,590
Don't you know

137
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,590
that they're married?

138
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,470
They're a married couple.

139
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,230
Are you done?

140
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,710
Director, it's done.

141
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,630
We can start.

142
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,350
Everyone, be quiet.

143
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,230
Okay. Ready.

144
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,230
Rolling.

145
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,710
Knife advertisement.

146
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,310
Take No. 6.

147
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,310
Action.

148
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,310
How does Director Xue

149
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,110
tolerate Director Jian's temper?

150
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,110
She's on set.

151
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,870
As a director,

152
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,430
she has to be in control of the entire situation.

153
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,590
Be in control of the entire situation?

154
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,470
A male director married a female director.

155
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,230
How do they live together?

156
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,110
They must fight about everything.

157
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,350
But I hope

158
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,950
Director Xue is in control at home.

159
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,470
Miss, you're chopping very seriously,

160
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,110
but

161
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,230
you don't look happy enough.

162
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,750
You don't look happy while chopping.

163
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,110
These are my thoughts.

164
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,830
Good.

165
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,350
So you'll first...

166
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,830
Team Leader.

167
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,310
Hand me the boss's Americano.

168
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,230
Here.

169
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,750
Be careful, it's hot.

170
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:45,990
Boss.

171
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,990
Your Americano.

172
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,310
It makes sense.

173
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:48,710
Right?

174
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,110
Okay.

175
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:50,950
By the way,

176
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,190
did Sheng Yang have something to say just now?

177
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:54,830
Yes.

178
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,710
Boss.

179
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,750
I think

180
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,990
packaging

181
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,590
is the first representative facade of a brand.

182
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,110
And it's the bridge to communicate with customers.

183
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,750
This is really important.

184
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,190
We can't be careless.

185
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,070
Well...

186
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,590
So my idea is

187
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,830
a simplified design

188
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,070
that emphasizes on being eco-friendly.

189
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,230
The recent overpackaging trend

190
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,190
is getting worse.

191
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,070
A lot of the packaging boxes

192
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,830
have unnecessary adornments on them.

193
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,590
Inside the packaging box,

194
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,950
there are also a lot of non-degradable linings.

195
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,310
In the end, they all become trash.

196
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,710
So,

197
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,990
being eco-friendly

198
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,710
is the design concept that we should advocate right now.

199
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,430
It's no doubt that you're your team leader's apprentice.

200
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,590
Boss.

201
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,710
My apprentice is very intelligent.

202
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,230
Your team leader just said the same thing.

203
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,510
That's a good idea.

204
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,350
Let's put it into practice then.

205
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,350
Okay?

206
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,230
Nowadays,

207
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,630
we have to save every penny we can.

208
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,590
Yes.

209
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,590
Dismiss.

210
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,230
Okay.

211
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,830
Thank you for the coffee.

212
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,110
It's nothing, boss.

213
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,710
How was it?

214
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,190
Good.

215
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,590
Your idea's great.

216
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,110
Are we going to get any sleep?

217
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,230
Okay. Get ready to shoot.

218
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,350
Rolling.

219
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,190
Rolling.

220
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,350
Our art design...

221
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,190
Action.

222
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,470
Nice.

223
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:36,830
Push.

224
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,710
Push it forward.

225
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,110
You're an expert.

226
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,190
Take a look.

227
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,110
There's a reflection on the knife.

228
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,310
Push it forward.

229
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,350
Push.

230
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,230
Nice.

231
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,070
A close-up.

232
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,110
You can be the director of your next project.

233
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,590
Cut.

234
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,230
Yuan.

235
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:53,990
Can we

236
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,470
make it seem like there's more natural sunlight?

237
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,310
It's too flat.

238
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,110
Okay, director.

239
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,110
She makes strict requirements.

240
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,430
Take off the soft light filter.

241
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,710
Yang.

242
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,230
Can you do me a favor?

243
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,990
I suddenly realized

244
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,470
I remembered the deadline wrongly.

245
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,190
I have to submit this to my client this afternoon.

246
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,710
I played games all night yesterday.

247
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,590
I really have no energy.

248
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,230
You're very efficient. Help me.

249
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,590
Then I'll pay for the coffee just now.

250
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,430
Do you have money?

251
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,710
I'm not paying for your lunch today.

252
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,710
Sheng Yang, have you forgotten?

253
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,310
When we were in the third year of university

254
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,470
and I went out to do some nature sketching,

255
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,950
you ran into a bunch of drunkards bullying a girl.

256
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,710
When you got into a fight with them because of the injustice,

257
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,310
who was it that helped you out?

258
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,990
Let's go.

259
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,070
You can't blame me for not doing my work conscientiously.

260
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,590
Slogging for a salary of 14,000 yuan.

261
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,510
There's no motivation.

262
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,830
How do you endure it?

263
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,710
I don't.

264
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,590
Isn't drawing fun?

265
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,630
Isn't it exciting trying to outwit

266
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,830
impossible clients?

267
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,350
When you see your work being realized,

268
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,630
don't you feel accomplished?

269
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,750
There are so many people gathering around down there.

270
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,070
Are they filming an advertisement?

271
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:28,990
Yes.

272
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:29,830
Are they in our field?

273
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,710
They are...

274
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:31,950
Well...

275
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,350
Ying. Ying.

276
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,630
Your idol seems to be

277
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,310
shooting an advertisement.

278
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:35,950
Shooting an advertisement?

279
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,230
I think the director is a woman.

280
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,190
Film it and send it to me later.

281
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,110
Okay.

282
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,870
Where is she?

283
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,990
Zoom in.

284
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,350
Cut.

285
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,350
Cut.

286
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,630
Our company only sends a few people for an advertisement shoot.

287
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,350
It seems like you still miss

288
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,990
that director from ten years ago.

289
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,990
Are you still obsessing over her?

290
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,990
Have you been staying single

291
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,710
because of her?

292
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,990
It's because I'm too poor. Are you satisfied?

293
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,830
She must not know that you studied design and came into this field

294
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,230
because of her, right?

295
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,630
Do you think she still remembers you?

296
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,430
I was wrong.

297
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,990
Don't be angry, okay?

298
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,350
Cut.

299
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,230
How is it, Mr. Zhang?

300
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,710
Not bad.

301
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,470
But this scene...

302
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,110
Something's lacking...

303
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,990
It lacks...

304
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,830
It lacks the vibe of a masterpiece.

305
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,990
What is the vibe of a masterpiece?

306
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,470
One minute of this

307
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,950
cost me hundreds of thousands.

308
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,870
You have to show me that it's worth it, right?

309
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,870
When they film an advertisement abroad,

310
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,470
they use all kinds of tricks

311
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,350
and do all kinds of shots.

312
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,190
Our shots are too flat.

313
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,590
Can we spice it up?

314
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,470
Well, our script...

315
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,510
This is according to the final plan

316
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,670
that you gave us.

317
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,470
Right?

318
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,310
Then tell me.

319
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,270
How can we spice it up?

320
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,230
Can we do this?

321
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:09,310
Here.

322
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,950
The first frame is

323
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,510
of the reflection in the actor's eyes,

324
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,390
and then

325
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,470
a stroke of blue light flashes by

326
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,270
and we're directly zoomed out into a long shot.

327
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,430
And then it focuses on her hand,

328
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,470
where a cold stream of air

329
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,270
freezes all five of her fingers,

330
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,190
and moves

331
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,030
all the way up along her arm.

332
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,390
And then,

333
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,870
the focus shifts to the knife.

334
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,510
Once the cold light shines,

335
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,470
she collapses...

336
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,430
Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang.

337
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,230
She transforms into...

338
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,030
Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang.

339
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,710
Calm down.

340
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,750
If you say any more,

341
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,550
the knife will become a dragon-slaying sword.

342
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,190
Yes.

343
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,990
This is not a martial arts film.

344
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,150
I understand what you mean.

345
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,070
A close-up shot of the knife.

346
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,550
Right? The knife as the main character.

347
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,670
I'll shoot a close-up of the knife tomorrow.

348
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,790
I'll shoot another version for you

349
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,750
in which...

350
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,870
the knife will be the main character.

351
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,510
A still life version.

352
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,790
As to which one you'll use,

353
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,910
you can decide then.

354
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,550
Let's call it a day.

355
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,470
Thank you for everyone's hard work.

356
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,270
Yes.

357
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,950
She's giving you another version.

358
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,950
It's a great bargain for you.

359
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,550
Director Jian.

360
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,230
You must be tired from shooting the whole day.

361
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,950
This is just a small gift for you.

362
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,550
Thank you.

363
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,390
Please accept it.

364
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,990
I wish you and Director Xue a happy life together.

365
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,710
Thank you for your blessing.

366
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,790
We'll try to resolve our fights every day before we go to bed.

367
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,470
You sure have a sense of humor.

368
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,190
I was just blabbering.

369
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,630
But today,

370
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,030
I was really surprised.

371
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,510
I didn't expect that a female director

372
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,670
could shoot this well.

373
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,430
It's all thanks to a good leader like Director Xue.

374
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,990
Mr. Zhang. I'm a very

375
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:41,910
forthright person.

376
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,870
I don't think the quality of a shoot

377
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,990
has anything to do with gender.

378
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,630
You're my client, so I respect you.

379
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,750
We'll do whatever you say.

380
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,870
But

381
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,190
please respect me too.

382
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,750
Please refrain from talking about

383
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,030
the director's private life behind her back.

384
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,470
Wait, I didn't do that...

385
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,310
Thank you for everyone's hard work.

386
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,230
This was...

387
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,990
Director, thank you.

388
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,230
That wasn't what I meant...

389
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,150
Bye.

390
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:03,470
Wait.

391
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,150
What did she mean?

392
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,230
What?

393
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,510
A female director...

394
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,870
I paid for the shoot.

395
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,550
I know you are professional.

396
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,470
Did I say anything wrong?

397
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,190
Let's go.

398
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,670
Let's go for drinks.

399
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,390
Let's talk while drinking.

400
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,430
She made it sound like I'm trying to break up her family.

401
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,630
Hello?

402
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,910
Hello, Jian Bing.

403
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,310
What's wrong with you?

404
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,710
Are you crazy?

405
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,230
Why are you making two versions?

406
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,790
Do you know much work that is?

407
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,910
You're so well-informed.

408
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,910
That's not important.

409
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,790
Tell me about the work.

410
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,190
Xue, I'm tired from working all day.

411
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,230
Why are you torturing yourself if you're tired?

412
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,150
Just shoot it however

413
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,390
the client likes.

414
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,990
Right?

415
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,670
Do you really think you're an artist

416
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,710
doing art?

417
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,710
We received one payment,

418
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:43,990
right?

419
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,670
So we just need to complete one task.

420
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,390
Look at you and your artist act.

421
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,430
You're asking everyone in the company

422
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,670
to play along with you.

423
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,230
Is it appropriate?

424
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,150
But right now,

425
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,510
the client also thinks the original plan is problematic.

426
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,470
Besides, I'm only filming still life.

427
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,230
I can finish it tomorrow.

428
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,630
Are you not tired?

429
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,990
Can you stop trying to prove yourself?

430
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,510
You're not young anymore.

431
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,150
Right?

432
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,470
Let's be mature.

433
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,950
You're doing twice the work for a portion of money.

434
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,230
Director Xue.

435
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,150
It's me.

436
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,870
After our last shoot,

437
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,550
I didn't have time to add you on WeChat.

438
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,230
Can I add you on WeChat?

439
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,230
Sure.

440
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,230
I've added it.

441
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,870
Okay, thank you.

442
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,990
I look forward to working with you.

443
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,470
See my guests off for me.

444
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,310
Thank you for your hard work.

445
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,070
This way, please.

446
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,390
Okay.

447
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,190
This way, please.

448
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:46,710
By the way,

449
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,870
we owe the eco-friendly concept to you.

450
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,710
Time is tight and the task is important.

451
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,630
Thank you for your hard work.

452
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,150
It's all thanks to your leadership.

453
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,150
It's our duty.

454
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,310
Don't flatter me.

455
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,390
Do your job well.

456
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,230
Rest assured.

457
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,510
By the way,

458
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,310
the client said

459
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,990
the deadline is this weekend, right?

460
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,710
Yes.

461
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,230
Call Sheng Yang here.

462
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,750
Hurry up.

463
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,430
Okay.

464
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,710
Come in. Sheng Yang.

465
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,550
Sit down.

466
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,990
The client has decided.

467
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,190
Let's do as we said this morning.

468
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,990
The deadline is this weekend.

469
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,150
Is the schedule okay?

470
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,510
The schedule

471
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,990
is quite tight.

472
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,990
You can overcome it.

473
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,790
Back then,

474
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,390
when I did a 3D rendering assignment,

475
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,750
do you know how long I couldn't sleep?

476
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,510
A whole 48 hours.

477
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,910
Young people nowadays

478
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,310
are too delicate.

479
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:56,990
Team Leader.

480
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,710
It's my honor that

481
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,870
you used my ideas.

482
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,310
But my notes this morning

483
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,990
were all written impromptu.

484
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,510
They're not well-developed.

485
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,750
Many details need to be finetuned.

486
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,470
What do you mean?

487
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,550
Do you think I took credit of your work?

488
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,310
Have you ever thought about this?

489
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,870
If your proposal today

490
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:27,710
were rejected by the boss,

491
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,990
although it seems to be your own business,

492
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,630
our whole team would have to cover for you.

493
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,790
So I had to propose in your stead.

494
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,710
I know

495
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,950
young people like you have many ideas.

496
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,790
That's not a problem.

497
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,990
I was once young too.

498
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,390
To be honest, Sheng Yang,

499
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,990
you remind me of a younger version of myself

500
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,670
a lot of the time.

501
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,990
That's why I see your potential and train you a lot in particular.

502
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,310
There are so many people in the company.

503
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,750
Why do I entrust so many tasks to you?

504
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,470
Because I trust you.

505
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,470
Work overtime if you have to

506
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,710
and finish it before the weekend.

507
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,270
You can do it.

508
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,910
Since we've changed the plan,

509
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,550
we have to change suppliers.

510
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,790
We can only get the samples next weekend at the earliest.

511
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,230
I don't want to hear any explanations from you.

512
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,630
Sure.

513
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,030
I'll discuss it with the client then.

514
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,310
That's right.

515
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,470
Team Leader.

516
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,990
I'll get back to work.

517
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,710
Okay.

518
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,990
It's done.

519
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,030
Render it yourself.

520
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,390
Yang, I love you.

521
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,670
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

522
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,510
How is it? Have a look.

523
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,230
It's pretty good.

524
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,230
Wang is such a jerk.

525
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,310
If he asks you to get coffee again,

526
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,310
you should spit inside his drink.

527
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,510
Come on.

528
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,670
It's just how society works.

529
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,230
Malatang, right?

530
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,870
Okay.

531
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,430
30 yuan's worth. You can choose the ingredients.

532
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,150
I'll add an egg as extra protein for you.

533
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,710
Extra spicy and no vinegar, right?

534
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,950
I must finish it.

535
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,510
Let's postpone this meal.

536
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,470
Madam Luo

537
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,910
has summoned me.

538
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,470
I'm so lucky.

539
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,750
I don't have to treat you to dinner then.

540
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,470
You wish.

541
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,190
Listen.

542
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,230
I've already written it down in my notebook.

543
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,990
Okay.

544
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,550
I'm leaving.

545
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,870
Bye.

546
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,790
Hello.

547
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,510
Where are you fooling around again?

548
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,950
I'm nothing compared to you.

549
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,230
Look at what you did today.

550
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,630
You transformed into a feminist warrior.

551
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,630
I'm cleaning up your mess.

552
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,790
How much did you drink?

553
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,630
I've drunk so much that

554
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,430
I actually find Mr. Zhang handsome.

555
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,790
Endless grievances in the world.

556
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,990
You must have really drank a lot.

557
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,710
Is Xue there?

558
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,950
Are you two still in a cold war?

559
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,390
No.

560
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:27,750
Wait.

561
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,950
Aren't you tired of fighting?

562
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,030
You've been married for so long.

563
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,670
I'm tired of being sandwiched between the two of you.

564
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,950
Can you come here for a while?

565
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,470
I don't think it's appropriate that you're absent.

566
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,190
What's inappropriate about it?

567
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,990
Don't accompany him anymore. It'd be better if you come and accompany me.

568
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,670
I'm driving. I'm hanging up.

569
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,510
Here, have some water.

570
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,430
No thanks.

571
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:02,990
You can have it.

572
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,310
Have some.

573
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,510
Did you sprain your ankle?

574
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,230
I'm fine.

575
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:13,990
My shoelaces are untied.

576
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:14,670
Let's go.

577
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,150
Don't...

578
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,950
Don't pull me.

579
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,790
Don't hold onto me.

580
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,190
Stand in line.

581
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,310
Can you have some manners?

582
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,230
Can't you see that everyone is queuing up?

583
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,190
Excuse me.

584
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,430
Luo Meijuan.

585
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,190
What is it?

586
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,710
Yang.

587
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,710
Cover for me.

588
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,190
Sure.

589
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,190
Sheng Yang is here.

590
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,430
You're getting more and more handsome.

591
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,470
Do you have a girlfriend?

592
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,510
I'm waiting for you to find me one.

593
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,030
No problem, since you're so handsome.

594
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,990
Why didn't you greet her? Don't be rude.

595
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:08,990
Luo Meijuan.

596
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,230
Don't touch my head.

597
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,670
I'll be back soon.

598
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,470
Go along.

599
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,950
Luo Meijuan.

600
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,030
Where are you taking me?

601
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,750
Hurry up.

602
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,990
I haven't finished my work.

603
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,670
I still have to go back.

604
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,710
Hurry up.

605
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,710
I came because you told me there was an emergency.

606
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,390
It is something urgent.

607
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,030
What is it?

608
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,190
Tell me.

609
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:27,750
Look.

610
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,990
Does this look good?

611
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,630
Here, try it.

612
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,470
Here?

613
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:33,630
Hurry up.

614
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,550
Mom, there are so many people here.

615
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,270
Let me have a look.

616
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,270
Luo Meijuan.

617
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:37,710
Luo...

618
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,710
Here, put it on.

619
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,070
What's going on?

620
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,990
Why are you suddenly buying me new clothes?

621
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,990
Isn't it a coincidence?

622
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,710
My primary school classmate's child

623
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,030
graduated from the same school as you,

624
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,230
and is going to intern in your company.

625
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,430
You should

626
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,670
treat her to a meal.

627
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,670
That doesn't require new clothes.

628
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,870
It's a waste of money.

629
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,990
Put it on.

630
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,710
Let me have a look.

631
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,790
Hang on, Luo Meijuan.

632
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,990
Your classmate's child

633
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,750
is a girl, right?

634
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,150
You're trying to get me to go on a blind date again.

635
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,750
What's wrong with that?

636
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,230
She's an eligible bachelorette.

637
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,030
You're not even good enough for her.

638
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,230
Aren't you my mother?

639
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,710
How else would you be so handsome if I'm not your biological mom?

640
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,230
It fits perfectly.

641
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:24,990
Great.

642
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:25,990
Right?

643
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,790
Yes, you have good taste.

644
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,390
Let me check the price.

645
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,230
Don't remove the tag.

646
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,710
It's 399 now.

647
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,790
It'll be 199 in a few days.

648
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,470
I'll buy it when it's 199.

649
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,390
How impressive.

650
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,230
Luo Meijuan.

651
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,510
You sure know the ways of living.

652
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,950
Isn't it nice?

653
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,790
Yes.

654
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,430
But

655
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,230
Mom, let's forget about this blind date.

656
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,230
How dare you!

657
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,030
Comrade Luo Meijuan.

658
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,990
How many times has it been this month?

659
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,790
How much have you spent on the meals?

660
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,750
You're wasting money.

661
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,990
What do you know?

662
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,710
This is called investment.

663
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,950
You're already 26 and still don't have a partner.

664
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,870
How are you so unconcerned?

665
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,030
Take off the shirt.

666
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,470
Sure.

667
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,030
I don't want to wear it anyway.

668
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,070
Here you are.

669
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,390
Look at the price.

670
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,030
Right now,

671
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,950
it's 399.

672
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,470
The original price is 599.

673
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,470
It'll be 199 in a few days.

674
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,670
You're like the price of 599.

675
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,990
You think you look good,

676
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,070
so you don't need to rush.

677
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,910
You just leave it there

678
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,270
because you don't want others to dirty it.

679
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,270
But in the end,

680
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,470
this shirt is placed in the discount area

681
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,990
and its price has plummeted,

682
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,190
but still, no one would give it a look.

683
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,550
When you were young, you always asked me

684
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,190
about

685
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,230
why spring wear is always launched in winter

686
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,270
and why fall wear is always launched in summer.

687
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,710
Let me tell you.

688
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,510
If you don't rush to put yourself on the market,

689
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,710
after 30,

690
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,390
you'll be out of fashion.

691
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,310
Hello, sir.

692
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,470
Do you have a reservation?

693
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,030
Probably.

694
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,550
May I ask whose name it's under?

695
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,030
Madam Luo.

696
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,790
Oh, yes. This way, please.

697
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,670
This way.

698
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:04,990
Have a seat.

699
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:05,750
Thank you.

700
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,310
Sir.

701
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:19,990
May I

702
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,270
take your order now?

703
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,670
Give me a glass of water first.

704
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,630
Thank you.

705
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:26,990
Okay.

706
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,150
Jian Bing.

707
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,510
Wait.

708
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,710
Why did you buy a set of knives?

709
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,710
You don't cook.

710
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,390
Is it a weapon?

711
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,990
Do you want to kill me with a knife?

712
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,750
No need, honey.

713
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,910
I'll do it myself.

714
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,150
I'll kill myself.

715
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,470
I know I was wrong.

716
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,310
Screw you...

717
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,630
Honey.

718
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,270
I love you.

719
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,230
It hurts.

720
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,390
Well,

721
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,470
the girl you saw today

722
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,990
is a model.

723
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:50,710
Actually...

724
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,550
Let's not talk about the girl today.

725
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,950
If we start on this topic, we'll have to start from

726
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,230
two months ago.

727
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,950
Only then can we finally reach the girl today.

728
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:58,950
Right?

729
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,270
There are reasons for all the girls

730
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,190
from a month ago and two months ago.

731
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,470
Let me explain them to you one by one.

732
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,990
But after my explanation...

733
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,470
Xue.

734
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,710
If I wanted your explanation,

735
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,030
I would have asked you to explain.

736
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,910
When did I ask you to explain?

737
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,670
I think it's useless to listen to your explanation.

738
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,030
Let's talk about us instead.

739
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,510
That's great.

740
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,670
Firstly,

741
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,030
as your wife,

742
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,070
I have to apologize to you.

743
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,990
We've been married for more than ten years,

744
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,870
but I've never

745
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,390
done the laundry or cooked once.

746
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,470
The client on today's set even said

747
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,470
that it wouldn't be easy for you to have a wife like me.

748
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,990
I think he's right.

749
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,870
As a wife,

750
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,470
I'm sorry.

751
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,230
Why are you talking about this?

752
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,710
You're not that kind of person anyway, are you?

753
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,030
I've never made any of those

754
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,230
presumptuous demands either.

755
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,150
Secondly,

756
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,510
I actually think I'm really lucky.

757
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,510
When I first entered the industry ten or so years ago,

758
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,070
I met such a good teacher like you

759
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,870
who personally taught me how to direct in detail.

760
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,550
Can we stop talking about this?

761
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,190
I have to.

762
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,950
Although I really don't want to admit it,

763
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,310
the truth is that

764
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:09,830
you're the reason

765
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,310
I could gradually

766
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,790
become who I am today.

767
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,350
As a student,

768
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:17,989
thank you.

769
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,949
Can you not be so polite?

770
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,830
It's giving me goosebumps.

771
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:26,150
Finally,

772
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:30,190
I've been keeping these words in my heart for a long time.

773
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,870
If I don't say it out, I'll begin to rot inside.

774
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,270
Bear with it.

775
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:37,909
It must hurt when you're stabbed with a knife.

776
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,150
But you've already

777
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:45,949
stabbed me too many times.

778
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,870
I think we're even now.

779
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,389
Don't...

780
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,070
Xue, listen.

781
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,750
I know that

782
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,670
as a director,

783
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,830
you're around more temptations than other men.

784
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,830
I understand that,

785
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,430
but I can't accept it.

786
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,030
You're really

787
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,830
a good friend

788
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,350
and a good partner.

789
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,590
But you're not a good husband.

790
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:07,350
Wait.

791
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,630
What kind of husband do you want?

792
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,430
No matter how harmonious a married couple is,

793
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,790
it can't stand the test of time

794
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,830
over ten or so years, right?

795
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:17,550
Haven't I been tolerant of you

796
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,670
fooling around over the ten or so years?

797
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,750
That's why we are suitable for each other.

798
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,750
That's what you think.

799
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,670
Do you remember what you taught me?

800
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,110
You told me to have persistency

801
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,910
and ideals.

802
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,910
No matter what happens, a director

803
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:40,190
has to be resolute in their vision and expressive of their thoughts.

804
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,190
Are you still like that?

805
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,910
You've long given up on that.

806
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,590
You just do whatever's the easiest.

807
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,110
What's wrong with that?

808
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,630
But I'm different now.

809
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:55,990
I've grown up.

810
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,110
I...

811
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,510
don't want to

812
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,190
keep turning a blind eye to your actions and tolerating you.

813
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,030
I get it.

814
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,510
You've become independent

815
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,750
and are capable enough now.

816
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,190
Come on.

817
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,870
Yes, I've become capable enough.

818
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,990
Whether it's as a partner

819
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,110
or as a wife,

820
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,670
I think I should be respected.

821
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,830
What are you trying to say? Just be direct.

822
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,910
Let's get a divorce.

823
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,070
Okay?

824
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:51,910
Luo Meijuan.

825
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,950
I've been waiting for half an hour.

826
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,470
Can I leave now?

827
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,270
Girls take a long time to prepare before heading out.

828
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,470
But one still can't be this negligent of the time.

829
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,750
What time is it already?

830
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,390
The longer she's late,

831
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,670
the more she cares about you.

832
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,750
Do you understand?

833
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:15,750
Fine.

834
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,510
Should I be thanking her instead?

835
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,510
Hello, Mom.

836
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,510
Let me ask you.

837
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,470
Before heading out, shouldn't a girl

838
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,950
take a shower first?

839
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,590
After a shower,

840
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,630
doesn't she need to dry her hair?

841
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,190
After drying her hair, doesn't she need to do her makeup?

842
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,270
Every step takes a lot of time.

843
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,750
Do you think it's easy to find a wife?

844
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,670
Be patient, okay?

845
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:46,670
Fine.

846
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,990
Just tell me I have to wait...

847
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,790
That's it.

848
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,390
I made it very clear. Seriously,

849
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,430
I'm just fooling around

850
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,950
outside for fun.

851
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,390
Just some harmless flirting. Or else, how boring would life be?

852
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,270
Why should I accept such a reason?

853
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,270
Why?

854
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,630
Tell me.

855
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,270
If I fool around like this too,

856
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,310
can you accept it?

857
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,030
You're not that kind of person.

858
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,670
Right?

859
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,270
You don't know how to do that.

860
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,270
I can become such a person.

861
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,110
That's what I'm thinking of now.

862
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,470
I want to fool around too.

863
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,990
Let me tell you. It takes a lot of effort

864
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,150
to become such a person.

865
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,390
Not at all.

866
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,870
I'm going out later.

867
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:32,790
I found that you...

868
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:33,270
This...

869
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:33,910
You...

870
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,870
Why are women

871
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,510
no longer cute when they get older?

872
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,390
It's because of men like you.

873
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,510
You only grow older in age

874
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,470
but your mind doesn't mature.

875
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,150
You're old but immature.

876
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,750
You also can't accept

877
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,870
women that are more capable,

878
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,950
smarter,

879
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,470
and more opinionated than you.

880
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,830
It's quite contradictory.

881
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,990
But I don't want to get a divorce.

882
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,550
I can't live without you.

883
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:01,470
Here.

884
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:02,990
Fine.

885
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,950
We can stay together.

886
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,310
Then

887
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,470
promise me three conditions.

888
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:09,950
Go ahead.

889
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,030
Firstly,

890
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,990
from now on,

891
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:20,070
you can't take an interest in young and naive girls.

892
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,070
No flirting with anyone.

893
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,110
Sure.

894
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,990
It's very tough, isn't it?

895
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:25,870
Sure.

896
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,030
Secondly,

897
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,350
let's go on a date once a week.

898
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,470
When we get home,

899
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,310
we can only talk about feelings and not work.

900
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,990
Should I also bring you a bouquet of flowers?

901
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,470
That would be great.

902
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,550
Look at you, you're still

903
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,310
thinking like a young lady.

904
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,510
What's the point of that?

905
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:42,870
No, no, no.

906
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,110
Sure, no problem.

907
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,950
I can definitely do it, okay?

908
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,790
Go on.

909
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,670
Thirdly, about our company's affairs,

910
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,270
you can't interfere in my projects.

911
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,470
You can't tell me what to do.

912
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,030
Of course, you can give suggestions,

913
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,470
but you can't make the decisions.

914
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,950
Wait. What do you mean by this?

915
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,110
This won't do.

916
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,630
Are you trying to split up our company?

917
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,630
No.

918
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,470
When we first established our company,

919
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,750
we'd made it clear

920
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,630
that we need to make mutual achievements, right?

921
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,430
We have to trust each other.

922
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,990
-We've to have each other's backs.
-There you go again.

923
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,030
No matter what happens in the company...

924
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,030
Stop changing the topic.

925
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,870
About the three conditions...

926
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,510
We shouldn't have an internal strife.

927
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,430
that I just mentioned, can you fulfill them?

928
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:17,830
I can.

929
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,150
Ridiculous.

930
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:22,790
You can?

931
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:23,670
I can.

932
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:26,470
You can?

933
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,270
I already know which condition you can't fulfill.

934
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,830
I told you I can do it. Where are you going?

935
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,550
This discussion is over. You can lie about something else.

936
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,630
Where are you going?

937
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,750
Since we're divorced,

938
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,550
you're free

939
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,630
and I'm free too.

940
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,910
Where do you usually go to have fun?

941
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:40,950
I want to have fun outside too.

942
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,550
What divorce?

943
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,750
Can we not do this now?

944
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,470
Are you drunk?

945
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,430
You're brainwashed by those

946
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,990
feminist ideas on the Internet.

947
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,950
Let me tell you.

948
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,750
Splitting up our company is out of the question.

949
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,470
Divorce is even more impossible.

950
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,310
If you leave me,

951
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,310
let me tell you, you won't be able to accomplish anything.

952
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,910
If you leave me,

953
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,630
you won't be happy.

954
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,550
Do you know that?

955
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,150
Someone said that

956
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,630
when you're over 30,

957
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,470
the life you live for yourself is over.

958
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,510
All narcissism and pretension

959
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,270
should be restrained.

960
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,950
All pursuits and ideals

961
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,030
should be for the husband,

962
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,030
children,

963
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,030
and parents.

964
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,990
As long as they are well-fed,

965
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,270
safe, and healthy,

966
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,150
you shouldn't ask for anything else.

967
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,150
I don't know how much

968
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,950
hardship, suffering, and disappointment

969
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,550
have accumulated

970
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,470
for said person

971
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,310
to have come to such a conclusion.

972
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,670
Now I only have one belief in my heart.

973
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,430
In this world,

974
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,550
there's nothing that's the natural course of things.

975
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,510
Is it that when one becomes middle-aged,

976
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:02,990
it's the heart

977
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,430
and not the age that matters?

978
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,550
Youths have the right to be willful.

979
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,350
I do too.

980
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,830
16 8 intermittent fasting.

981
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,910
It's quite delicious indeed.
