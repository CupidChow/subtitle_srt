May I ask

5
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,300
which ward is Mr. Jian in?

6
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,900
His daughter's name is Jian Bing.

7
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,140
The ward over there.

8
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,180
Bed 9.

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,180
Thank you.

Mr. Fang.

Jian Bing.

13
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:54,940
Well,

14
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,580
Junjie told me everything.

15
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,180
You came across

16
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,540
something recently,

17
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,130
so I came to see what I can do.

18
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,100
Thank you.

19
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,260
It's okay now.

20
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,660
His condition is stable.

21
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,500
Don't overthink.

22
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,820
Didn't we

23
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,380
made it clear last time？

24
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,820
Don't worry.

25
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,380
I'm not a clingy person.

26
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,500
I... I just wanted to help.

27
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,579
I think

28
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,660
since we got to know each other,

29
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,500
we are friends after all.

30
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,780
When a friend is in trouble, I have to help, right?

31
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,100
Besides,

32
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,900
Junjie is going to study abroad soon.

33
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,540
I'll be the only one left here.

34
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,180
It's good to have another friend.

35
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,340
Right?

36
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,260
Unless you don't think

37
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:39,100
we can still be friends.

38
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,460
Yes, I'd love to.

39
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,660
Everything is okay now.

40
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,740
We just need to wait for the surgery.

41
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,260
I heard from Junjie that although he's your father,

42
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,140
he hasn't been a good father for one day.

43
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,740
You still need to take care of him.

44
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,100
You must be upset.

45
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,780
It's okay.

46
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,700
I'm obliged to support him anyway.

47
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,780
I've fulfilled my obligation.

48
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,500
Actually,

49
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,060
I came here

50
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,260
for another purpose.

51
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,140
I want to ask you for a favor.

52
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,290
You see.

53
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,780
I was suddenly rejected,

54
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,340
right?

55
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,380
I'm not feeling alright.

56
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,900
I need some buffer time.

57
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,820
Give me a chance.

58
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,340

59
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,460
Really.

No problem.

63

If I'm really busy,

64
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,900
I'll definitely call you.

keep these things.

Message me if you need anything.

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,780
Thank you.

74

Yang,

75
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,940
your mom said there's still a week left.

76
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,340
What's the rush?

77
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,340
You should find a flat first.

78
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,500
After you settle down, you can...

79
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,940
She hides away when she sees me.

80
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,700
She would not leave her room.

81
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,620
If she keeps hiding,

82
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,900
she'll get ill.

83
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,100
Luo Meijuan is always narrow-minded.

84
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,900
She is constantly overthinking.

85
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,060
She'll be fine in a few days.

86
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,940
It's okay, Dad.

87
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,020
If I move out,

88
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,540
you can at least take a break,

89
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,100
and live a normal life, right?

90
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,050
It's okay. I can handle it.

91
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,540
Dad.

92
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,930
Take care of yourself.

93
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,380
Don't quarrel with Mom.

94
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,100
Be nice to her.

95
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,420
Mom.

96
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,900
I'm leaving.

97
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,610
Hello?

98
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,420
Hello?

99
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,900
I've been waiting downstairs for a long time.

100
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,700
Why aren't you out yet?

101
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,300
You're taking too long.

102
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,540
I know you're downstairs. We'll be right down.

103
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,500
Stop urging, okay?

104
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,260
OK.

105
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,620
Have meals on time.

106
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,180
Let me hold it for you.

107
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,100
It's okay. I can do it myself.

108
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,180
Let's hold it together.

109
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,780
Change your shoes.

110
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,380
Alright, Dad.

111
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,250
Don't see me off.

112
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,140
I'll be back soon.

113
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,540
Right.

114
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,140
Let's go.

115
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,900
Call us and message us.

116
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,140
No hugs?

117
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,420
All right.

118
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,580
Remember to miss me.

119
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,980
Of course.

120
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,140
Let's go.

121
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,780
I've found a studio.

122
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,260
5,000 yuan a month.

123
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,260
It is quite a big place.

124
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,180
But the tenant's contract

125
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,900
hasn't expired yet.

126
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,340
You can stay at my place this week.

127
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,340
You got a new roommate?

128
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,700
It's more annoying than the last one.

129
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,500
Sit down and have a rest.

130
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,900
The view is nice here.

131
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,060
Isn't it nice?

132
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,140
Not bad.

133
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,780
It's just a mess.

134
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,180
Why don't you tidy it up?

135
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,780
I'm waiting for you to do the cleaning.

136
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,140
OK.

137
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,100
Fine.

138
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,460
I can tolerant since I'm crashing here.

139
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,300
I'll clean it up for you.

140
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,140
Great.

141
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,060
Where should I sleep tonight?

142
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,340
Let's squeeze in,

143
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:50,980
and sleep on the bed.

144
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,370
Is it enough?

145
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,540
Who wants to sleep with you?

146
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,180
This sofa is nice.

147
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,620
I can sleep on the sofa.

148
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,300
Okay.

149
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,100
Brother,

150
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,940
how long have you worn those socks?

151
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,780
Have you washed them?

152
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,740
Help me wash them.

153
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,180
You're asking me.

154
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,580
You're asking me.

155
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,140
You're asking me. Wash them yourself.

-Do they stink?

00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,130
♫My heart is beating for you♫

194
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:08,760
♫Loving you is making me blue♫

195
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,100
Who put a box here?

196
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,100
Don't you know it's blocking the way?

197
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,460
Sorry.

198
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,140
♫I stand in the wind♫

199
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,260

♫It's a sleepless night again♫

202

♫How can I get you out of my mind?♫

203
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:42,900
Bro.

204
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,910
♫My heart is beating for you♫

205
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,300

♫Loving you is making me blue♫

207
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:04,300
♫Loving you is making me blue♫

208
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,060
Get up.

209
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,660
Song, get up.

210
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,650
Song.

211
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,460
Didn't the contract state

212
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,780
that you can't have overnight guests?

213
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,420
Also,

214
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,140
look at these boxes.

215
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,460
They're taking up the entire living room.

216
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,460
Don't you know this is a public area?

217
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,260
My friend is just staying here for two nights.

218
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,060
Please do us a favor, okay?

219
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,540
And my roommate.

220
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,380
He often brings his girlfriend home.

221
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,290
It was quite noisy at night.

222
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,260
And these boxes.

223
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,980
They are not in your way.

224
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,540
Rules are rules.

225
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,060
Do you think the contract is useless?

226
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,380
No, I don't.

227
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,020
Listen.

228
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,780
You're always the last one

229
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
to pay the rent.

230
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,060
You keep postponing day by day.

231
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,180
Listen.

232
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,420
Stay if you want.

233
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,260
If you don't want to stay,
leave as soon as possible.

234
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,540
Also,

235
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,060
look at the sofa.

236
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,580
It got stained.

237
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,900
I'm not returning the deposit.

238
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,380
But

239
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,060
this sofa was like this before.

240
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,170
I took photos when I moved in.

241
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,140
You can't penalize me.

242
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,060
Are you staying or not?

243
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,500
You have an overnight guest.

244
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,940
According to our contract,

245
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,700
you have to pay the penalty fee first.

246
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,940
Sister.

247
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,380
Well...

248
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,260
I'll move out today.

249
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,380
Before I leave,

250
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,300
I'll make your place squeaky clean.

251
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,010
Get out as soon as possible.

252
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,980
Clean it up.

253
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,060
Hurry up.

254
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,980
I'll come back later.

255
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,660
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,220
I can't stay here anymore.

257
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,540
Where are you going?

258
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,020
You can't sleep in an internet cafe.

259
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,180
Do you feel like returning to the battlefield?

260
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,180
Yes.

261
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,580
The only thing I can help you now

262
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,180
is to be in the same boat.

263
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,220
Are you going to tell sister that you're living

264
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,100
in an internet cafe for her?

265
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,820
Don't let her know

266
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,220
about this.

267
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,820
I'm just kidding.

268
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,770
You have to swear.

269
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,780
I swear.

270
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,010
Get to work.

271
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,690
Here, sir.

272
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,580
Open your mouth. Have some porridge.

273
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,570
No.

274
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,490
You won't recover if you're not eating.

275
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,740
Who asked you to care about me?

276
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,540
Who wants to take care of you?

277
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,660
Look at you.

278
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,740
Leave me alone.

279
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,980
Go away.

280
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,420
Why don't you go in?

281
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,340
I've only met him several times.

282
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,140
I don't know him very well.

283
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,700
You don't know your dad well?

284
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,380
They said he took care of me

285
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,500
for a while when I was young.

286
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,660
But...

287
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,940
-I was too young. I don't remember anything.
-Slow down. Don't worry.

288
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,099
When I grew up, my sister wouldn't let me see him.

289
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,940
Why?

290
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,140
Because my sister hated him.

291
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,730
To my sister,

292
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,820
he is a lousy old man.

293
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,500
But when I saw him this time,

294
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,810
he was no different from an ordinary old man.

295
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,340
Just a little unreasonable.

296
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,230
Which is the patient's ward?

297
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,420
It's the eighth.

298
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,940
He's also your dad.

299
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,140
Since you're here,

300
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,340
you should go in and say hello.

301
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,100
I don't know how to face him yet.

302
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,980
It's hard to describe my feelings now.

303
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,620
Very complicated.

304
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,780
I feel

305
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,900
a bit curious

306
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,700
and a bit disgusted.

307
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,980
Why?

308
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,380
Because my sister told me

309
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,740
he might be just like Xue Yiming.

310
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,980
Besides,

311
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,970
he pissed my mom off, and she died.

312
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,060
How did he have my phone number?

313
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,260
He even set me as his emergency contact.

314
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,620
That's strange.

315
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,460
Have you seen the things you said

316
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,180
that he did with your own eyes?

317
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,780
No.

318
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,380
I've never seen it.

319
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,820
My sister told me.

320
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,780
So I think

321
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,740
I should despise him,

322
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,580
hate him,

323
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,780
loathe him.

324
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,940
But, I...

325
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:17,860
I...

326
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,180
When I saw him, I...

327
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,260
I just

328
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,340
couldn't hate him.

329
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,780
My dad is this kind of person.

330
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,940
Will it affect our relationship?

331
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,700
How can it be possible?

332
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,980
I'm dating you,

333
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,980
not your dad.

334
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,050
Of course.

335
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,540
Now I know

336
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,860
where you got that bad temper from.

337
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,300
Where?

338
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,100

Well,

00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,420
the actress said

342
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,300
she's stuck in traffic. It'll take half an hour.

343
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,300
Isn't she already one hour late?

344
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,500
She's the client's girlfriend.

345
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,340
We dare not rush her.

346
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,740
How about this? I'll wait for her at the gate.

347
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,420
Okay.

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:52,110
[Jian Bing: Yes. How is Mrs. Luo doing?]

352
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,420

Sorry. Sorry.

359

[Jian Bing: OK, but I'll get off work late tonight.]

360
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,820
Bro, watch it.

361
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,740
What are you doing?

362
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,740
You can't smoke in public.

363
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,820
Smoking is harmful to health.

364
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,940
Didn't your mom teach you?

365
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,220
Enough.

366
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,020
Don't cause trouble.

367
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,660
Stop smoking.

368
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,020
It's okay.

369
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,620
Don't worry.

370
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,460
I'm okay.

Well,

00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,980
Jian Zhongde has a real temper.

378
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,580
It's too much for other people to handle.

379
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,100
You are so busy.

380
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,180
I'll take care of him tonight.

381
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,980
Where are you?

382
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,180
-Take medicine on time, and check your blood pressure.
-I...

383
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,340
Tell me.

384
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,860
Are you in the hospital?

385
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,700
I'm here to take a look.

386
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,980
I'm filming now.

387
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,540
I'll go there right after this.

388
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,340
It's none of your business. Leave now.

389
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,380
Sister,

390
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,220
didn't you hate him?

391
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:49,940
You said

392
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,780
he treated us like that before.

393
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,460
Now you still want to take care of him?

394
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,060
Don't you feel unpleasant?

395
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,940
This is my business.

396
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,300
Jian Shuang, let me tell you.

397
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,540
Time in university is very precious.

398
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,140
You should study hard.

399
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,060
When you don't study,

400
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,740
you should have fun and date.

401
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,780
-Okay? This doesn't concern you.
-Sister.

402
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:08,980
Get out of there now.

403
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,860
Sister, I...

404
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,050
What?

405
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,380
Has he ever cared about you?

406
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,140
Why do you have feelings for him?

407
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,140
Why are you caring for him now?

408
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,460
Listen to me. Leave now.

409
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,260
I repeat one more time.

410
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,220
The set is this way.

411
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,540
Watch your step.

412
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,060
Director, the actress is here.

413
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,210
Oh my goodness, finally.

414
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,140
This is our cameraman.

415
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,340
Hello, cameraman.

416
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:43,660
Hello.

417
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,300
Please make me look pretty today.

418
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,340
Don't worry.

419
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,570
You'll look really good.

420
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,780
Our Director is over there.

421
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,060
Hello, Director.

422
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,860
Everything is ready on set.

423
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,260
If you're ready,

424
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,900
we'll start filming.

425
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,290
Iced Americano, thank you.

426
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,460
Okay.

427
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,220
Iced Americano.

428
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,260
OK. OK.

429
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,250
Miss,

430
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,220
later you'll sit on this chair to perform.

431
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,940
And look at this camera.

432
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,890
-Facing here?
-This camera.

433
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:07,340
Yes.

434
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,060
We've been waiting for her for so long.

435
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,780
She didn't say anything to apologize.

436
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,610
You know what to say, right?

437
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,980
Don't worry, Director. I gave her the lines in advance.

438
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,980
Yuan, are you ready?

439
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,060
Director, we're ready.

440
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,380
Okay. Real shot.

441
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,260
Ready.

442
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,050
Rolling.

443
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:31,820
Record.

444
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,540
Start.

445
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,020
Meeting people in a crowd.

446
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,340
Eventually returning to the crowd.

447
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,340
Go on a date

448
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,740
with a better version of myself.

449
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:48,490
Stop.

450
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,700
With the best version of myself.

451
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,220
Do you want to read the lines again?

452
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,460
Sister.

453
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,140
The best version of myself.

454
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,140
But it's a bit of a mouthful.

455
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,900
Come on.

456
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,140
OK. OK.

457
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,700
Come on. Real shot.

458
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:06,860
Record.

459
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,220
Action.

460
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,540
Meeting people in a crowd. Eventually returning to the crowd.

461
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,300
Go on a date

462
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,620
with a better version of myself.

463
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,020
Stop.

464
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,900
With the best version of myself.

465
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,220
There are only three lines in total.

466
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,340
It's better to get that lip synced.

467
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,740
Let me see.

468
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,300
Where did I get wrong?

469
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:34,860
Here.

470
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,100
The best version of myself.

471
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,380
Isn't better and best the same?

472
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,370
It's going to be dubbed later anyway.

473
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,020
You have to lip-sync for the dubbing.

474
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,220
Ready?

475
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:46,940
Record.

476
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,140
Meeting people in a crowd.

477
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,220
Action.

478
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,620
Keep recording.

479
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,220
Action.

480
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,300
Meeting people in a crowd. Eventually returning to the crowd.

481
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,220

483
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,700
With the best version of myself.

484
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,140
Stop.

485
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,940
No problem.

486
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,620
A bigger logo, right?

487
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,300
Okay.

488
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,340
The color is too plain.

489
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,700
We'll change it today.

490
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,720
[Yu Ten Pots]

491
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,660
You need it by tonight?

492
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,380
Are you crazy?

493
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,300
You paid so little for this crap.

494
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:21,860
No.

495
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,340
No.

496
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,260
Sorry, Mr. Qian.

497
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,220
It's a bit noisy over here.

498
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,940
I'm really sorry. I'm too busy.

499
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,620
In the end...

500
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,060
I'm sorry.

501
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,500
It's okay. Keep recording.

502
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,340
Come on. One more time.

503
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,500
Go on a date

504
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,980
with a better version of myself.

505
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,860
Make-up artist.

506
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,380
Tie her hair up.

507
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,180
Tie her hair up.

508
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:42,900
Okay.

509
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,860
Make it into a ponytail.

510
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,020
Okay.

511
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,620
Here's your Americano.

512
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,300
I wanted it iced, thanks.

513
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,660
Miss,

514
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
we should be more energetic.

515
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
Director, it's done.

516
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,540
Come on, Miss.

517
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,980
Put these sunglasses on and let me see.

518
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,580
Okay.

519
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,820
This looks more like a vacation.

520
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,940
Let's do it.

521
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,060
Come on. Real shot.

522
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,260
Meeting people in a crowd. Eventually returning to the crowd.

523
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,330
Go on a date

524
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,340
with a better version of myself.

525
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,460
Stop.

526
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,340
Am I wrong again?

527
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,220
I've never seen someone like you.

528
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,220
Don't you have face?

529
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,380
Mr. Qian. Mr. Qian.

530
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,260
We'll have it ready by today.

531
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,820
Alright, enough.

532
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,020
Delete me. Block me. Ask someone else.

533
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,940
I'm not doing this.

534
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,180
Hello, Mr. Qian.

535
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,580
-Hello?
-So harsh.

536
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,500
Give me only 300 yuan.

537
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,020
Dude.

538
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,900
Dude.

539
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:43,860
What?

540
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,220
What do you do?

541
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,380
I'm a game booster. What?

542
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:46,980
It's okay.

543
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,780
Go on.

544
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,820
Yang.

545
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,460
Yang.

546
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,660
I'm listening. Talk.

547
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,020
Are you clear about the client's request?

548
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,820
Bigger logo.

549
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,010
He thinks the color is too plain,

550
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,220
so he asked us to tweak it.

551
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,660
[Yu Ten Pots]

552
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,140
OK?

553
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,300
Okay.

554
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,460
What do you want for dinner?

555
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,540
The Japanese pork or spicy beef?

556
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,820
Spicy beef.

557
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,420
Never mind.

558
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,980
Spicy food can cause diarrhea.

559
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,060
The toilet is dirty.

560
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,620
How about chicken stewed with mushroom?

561
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,300
Okay?

562
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,580
Okay?

563
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,140
Anything's fine.

564
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,620
Let me make a call.

565
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,180
Make a call!

566
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,490
Is there a prompt board here?

567
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,380
Director, yes.

568
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,260
She's acting like this.

569
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,330
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

570
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,100
Put it in front of her.

571
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,170
You can see it clearly.

572
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,180
Just look at the prompt board.

573
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,300
No need to memorize the lines.

574
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,100
Ready. Rolling.

575
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,220
Action.

576
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:03,090
Meeting people in a crowd. Eventually returning to the crowd.

577
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,100
Go on a date

578
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,980
with the best version of myself.

579
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:14,820
OK.

580
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,700
Keep it as with the best version of myself.

581
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,220
Don't change it.

582
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,250
We're using with the best version of myself.

583
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,780
Let's do it again.

584
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,980
Ready. Rolling.

585
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,050
Record.

586
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,340
Action.

587
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,930
Meeting people in a crowd.

588
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,340
Eventually returning to the crowd.

589
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,260
Go on a date

590
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,700
with the best version of myself.

591
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,700
Oh my god.

592
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,530
Stop.

593
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,870
The subscriber you dialed is busy. Please try again later.

594
00:31:59,460 --> 00:31:59,810
Hello.

595
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,260
Hello, Mr. Qian.

596
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,540
This is Sheng Yang from Moses Design.

597
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,940
I'm in a meeting.

598
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,180
I'm sorry, Mr. Qian.

599
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,980
Here's the thing.

600
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,340
I've already sent

601
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,620
you the logo

602
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,660
that we amended.

603
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,620
You can take a look.

604
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,700
If there is any adjustment,

605
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,770
I'll tweak it right away.

606
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:16,860
So fast?

607
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,060
Did you do it properly?

608
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,980
Don't worry.

609
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,580
We spare no effort in designing.

610
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,500
This version is not bad.

611
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,500
You're quick.

612
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,380
Thank you, Mr. Qian.

613
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,140
Mr. Qian,

614
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,770
if you need,

615
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,340
we also design business cards,

616
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,090
books,

617
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,060
and shops.

618
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:36,770
Well,

619
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,660
we can design posters for short videos.

620
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,980
And it's at a discounted price.

621
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:40,820
OK.

622
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,740
No problem.

623
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,020
I'll refer you for some jobs.

624
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,580
Thank you, Mr. Qian.

625
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,860
Mr. Qian, then...

626
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,180
As for the design fee,

627
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,180
can you...

628
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,540
I'll transfer it to you on WeChat.

629
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,060
Okay, thank you, Mr. Qian.

630
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,180
The instant noodles are ready.

631
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,300
I...

632
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,820
I just called Mr. Qian.

633
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,860
He said he has work for us to do.

634
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,460
Really?

635
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,100
You introduced the client.

636
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,700
Thank you.

637
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,490
No.

638
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,900
Designer Sheng is very competent.

639
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,570
So we don't have to stay in the internet cafe today?

640
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,140
We don't have to eat instant noodles.

641
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,620
Let's have hotpot, okay?

642
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,620
You'll be relieved when receiving the money.

643
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,660
Let's not get carried away.

644
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
2,000 yuan per project.

645
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,740
Five projects equal to 10,000 yuan.

646
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,140
How great is that?

647
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,980
Call Pan Xiaorou.

648
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,770
She doesn't know yet.

649
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,980
Let's celebrate together.

650
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,940
I'll think about it.

651
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,970
Don't think about it. Let's go, okay?

652
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,180
I really need to

653
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,460
think about it seriously.

654
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,780
Think about what?

655
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,330
You'll be relieved when receiving the money.

656
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,380
How many more times do I have to repeat?

657
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,010
Don't you get it?

658
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,660
No, let's eat first.

659
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:46,820
Alright.

660
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,140
Pack up the things.

661
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,260
Song Chen.

662
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,580
Where is my laptop?

663
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,380
What laptop?

664
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,220
My work laptop.

665
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,180
I put it here.

666
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,020
Didn't you see it?

667
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,380
It was here just now.

668
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,340
Dude, did you see my laptop?

669
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,330
No.

670
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:08,980
What should we do?

671
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,139
Call the police!

672
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,139
Call the police!

673
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:12,739
Okay.

674
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,860
Stop! Stop!

675
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,380
Stop!

676
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:29,780
Stop!

677
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,820
Stop!

678
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,540
Run!

679
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,780
Why were you chasing me?

680
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,250
Listen.

681
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,980
I've called the police.

682
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,180
Why?

683
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,530
Give me back my laptop.

684
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,140
I didn't take your laptop.

685
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,740
Why did you run if you didn't take my laptop?

686
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,420
Why were you chasing me?

687
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,780
Cut the crap.

688
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,940
Give it back to me.

689
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,460
Where is it?

690
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,380
My game!

691
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:34,860
Sheng Yang! Sheng Yang!

692
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,340
It's not him!

693
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,580
Not him.

694
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,980
The staff checked the surveillance camera.

695
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,900
The man who stole your computer was wearing a mask and a hat.

696
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,100
He must be a regular thief.

697
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,580
So...

698
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,020
Sorry.

699
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,460
I made a mistake.

700
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,140
Brother.

701
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,420
I'm sorry.

702
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,580
I made a mistake.

703
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,260
You have to be precise next time.

704
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,580
I'm sorry.

705
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,060
I'm sorry.

706
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,460
I'm really sorry.

707
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,780
It's okay.

708
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:24,940
I've uploaded the documents

709
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,460
to the cloud.

710
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,260
It won't affect our work.

711
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,940
There're computers in the internet cafe,

712
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:30,940
right?

713
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,060
At worst,

714
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,140
I'll buy a new laptop.

715
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,690
We're going to be rich soon anyway.

716
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,860
A computer costs nothing, right?

717
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:40,860
Yes.

718
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,460
Don't we have Mr. Qian?

719
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,340
Yes.

720
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,220
I'll ask him.

721
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:00,980
Mr. Qian.

722
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,730
We're ready

723
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,140
to work with you at any time.

724
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,340
When would you have the time?

725
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,540
What's wrong?

726
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,180
He deleted you.

727
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,410
[The message has been sent, but rejected.]

728
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,460
Did he transfer the money?

729
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,620
I already sent him the work.

730
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,940
I didn't get a penny,

731
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,540
and got blocked

732
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,580
Yang, don't be like this.

733
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,860
I'm the one who found him. I'll get him.

734
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,580
It spilled.

735
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,580
Let me do it.

736
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:16,860
Jian Shuang.

737
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,260
This guy seems nice.

738
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,020
Why is he so quiet?

739
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,340
Can't he talk?

740
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,900
Sir, I can talk.

741
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,220
You can talk.

742
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,620
That's good.

743
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,260
Alright, take a break.

744
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,660
It's enough.

745
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,060
Stop wiping.

746
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,620
I said stop.

747
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,610
Who asked you to come?

748
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:41,940
Miss Jian Bing.

749
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,060
The nurse went for dinner.

750
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,460
We're just here to take a look.

751
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,540
Hao Junjie, hurry.

752
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,340
Go back to campus with her.

753
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,220
Okay.

754
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,740
Well, Miss Jian Bing,

755
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,380
why don't I ask my uncle to come and help?

756
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,780
No, no, no. No need.

757
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,500
Thank you.

758
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,010
Go back to school.

759
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:57,940
Where is Sheng Yang?

760
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,260
There's no sign of him after all this.

761
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,180
What does it have to do with you?

762
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,620
Young guys aren't reliable.

763
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,740
Let's go.

764
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,660
Sheng Yang.

765
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,860
Who is Sheng Yang?

766
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,570
Wait.

767
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,620
Are you divorced?

768
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,500
No wonder I haven't seen my son-in-law these days.

769
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,050
Look at your temper.

770
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,940
You probably got dumped by him.

771
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,820
Yes.

772
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,340
You might as well leave.

773
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,140
Stop pretending to be nice.

774
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,100
If I die,

775
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,140
you don't have to worry.

776
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,130
I'm tired.

777
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,020
Just go.

778
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,380
Your heart is not feeling well.

779
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,580
Why did you have faecal incontinence?

780
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,450
Did you do it on purpose?

781
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,980
Why did you wet your bed?

782
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,260
I like to wet my bed, okay?

783
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,220
I like to pee.

784
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,210
Get out of bed. Change the sheet.

785
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,220
Get out of bed.

786
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,540
Did he also block the phone?

787
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,340
It's only worth 2,000 yuan.

788
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,940
It was our first collaboration.

789
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,500
It was fine before.

790
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,140
How could he do this?

791
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,690
Come on. Stop calling.

792
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,420
No, I have to ask him.

793
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,020
Was there any misunderstanding?

794
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,300
Do you think he did it by accident?

795
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,340
By accident?

796
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,300
He accidentally deleted both of us?

797
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,620
We didn't ask for too much.

798
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,690
It's only 2,000 yuan.

799
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,530
Everything was fine before.

800
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,300
Everything was fine before.

801
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,700
Not anymore.

802
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,100
It means he doesn't want to work with us.

803
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,620
Didn't he say

804
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,700
he'd introduce us to partners in the future?

805
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,780
He was being polite. How could you believe him?

806
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,940
Actually, I think we did well.

807
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,570
Yes.

808
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,090
Only we think it's good.

809
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,100
If he doesn't want to work with us,
it means it's not good.

810
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,660
Give me your phone.

811
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,420
Tomorrow morning,

812
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,210
you'll use these chat history,

813
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,340
and find him in his company.

814
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,700
Remember.

815
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,780
Record the whole thing.

816
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,620
Have a good chat.

817
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,580
I don't think

818
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,490
he'll do anything to you in broad daylight.

819
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,250
[Sure. What about the fee?
It's a great deal. 2,000 yuan for a logo of three sizes.
This is my shop address. You can come by and measure the size.]

820
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,020
What about you?

821
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,300
I...

822
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,300
I'll look forward.

823
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,060
When a general has a sword,

824
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,980
he doesn't kill flies.

825
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,540
I can't let this one thing get in the way,

826
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,020
and stop going forward.

827
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,900
Actually, I don't think

828
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,780
it's necessarily a bad thing.

829
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,340
He taught me a lesson.

830
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,300
Think about it.

831
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,500
In July,

832
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,740
we had backing.

833
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,370
But now we only got ourselves.

834
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,420
We really need to think about

835
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,700
how we could be irreplaceable.

836
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,300
We've been bullied like this.

837
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,900
In hindsight,

838
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,940
it's obvious that he wanted to cheat the design.

839
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,820
We have vented our anger.

840
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,100
We really need to think about it.

841
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,340
We have to receive the final payment

842
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,740
for all of our designs

843
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,940
in the future.

844
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,740
No one will

845
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,090
look down on our design anymore.

846
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:45,980
No one will treat us

847
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,340
as if we're small workshops.

848
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,980
We'll be a big company that's treated fairly.
