=Episode 8=

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,760
Your Highness, if you're really fond of
the Palace of Hanning.

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,240
You might as well move in here.

25
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,040
That will save me much time
going back and forth.

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,240
The situation outside the City is pressing.

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,200
Why are you still competing
with His Majesty for a woman?

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,840
Do you dare to say that again?

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,120
What are you waiting for?

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,600
Come here and report to me.

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,280
Your Highness, outside of the City,
troops are gathering from different parties.

32
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
At the camp in the capital suburb,
Duke of Lu alone

33
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,760
holds an army of 200,000 soldiers.

34
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,400
Cao Ruiji of the Northwest Lu'an Army
has also come

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,840
with the son of Prince Yu.

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,040
They have troops of half a million in total.

37
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,600
They have almost half the men
more than we do.

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,880
Troops of half a million.

39
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,280
Concerning the current situation,

40
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,040
how about we just
leave the Palace for Nanchuan?

41
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,320
Are you afraid?

42
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,960
Who's there? Who allows you
to eavesdrop on military intelligence?

43
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,240
I didn't know you were talking about that.

44
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,600
I'll bring you some tea.

45
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,720
How many men are left
in the Imperial Army?

46
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,960
General Meng says there are 8,000 available.

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,720
Do you want to discuss this with him?

48
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,160
No need for that.

49
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,600
Tell Meng Chuang to fortify the City.

50
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,340
Are you going to...

51
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,200
Tell him

52
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,880
I don't need the Imperial Army
to fight outside the City.

53
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,920
Even if the sky falls,
he doesn't need to open the gate.

54
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,600
But if his 8,000 men
fail to defend the Imperial City,

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,800
don't blame me
for executing all of his relatives.

56
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,400
It's a military order.

57
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,120
General Chu.

58
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,360
General Chu, what's the matter?

59
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,080
Why do you care about him?

60
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,440
How would you let him trust you completely?

61
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,600
I will find an opportunity
to keep an eye on him.

62
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,040
Let me help you grind the ink stone.

63
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,820
Your Majesty, why are you fawning over me?

64
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,480
Is there anything else you want from me?

65
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,120
No.

66
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,280
I'll be happy as long as you're not mad at me.

67
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,520
You can focus on your work.

68
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,880
I'm good at grinding.

69
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,520
General Chu says

70
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,520
these record the anti-gunpowder
observation decks inside the City.

71
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,040
There are plenty.

72
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,120
If you want to fortify the City,

73
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,320
you have to review them
as soon as possible before giving orders.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,800
Well.

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,560
I didn't know
you were interested in military affairs.

76
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,960
I happened to hear your conversation
while passing by.

77
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,640
I didn't mean to.

78
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,820
Don't worry about it, Your Highness.

79
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,760
You dare to enslave me?

80
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Then... You could just drop it.

81
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,440
Won't you make the tea for me?

82
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,720
I will.

83
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,480
Does Yuwen Yingren summon you
into the Palace

84
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,320
to serve people?

85
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,160
You're rather good at doing a maid's work.

86
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,640
(Even though he's been temperamental,)

87
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,280
(he's never done anything)

88
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,840
(that hurt me.)

89
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,000
I think...

90
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,120
The amulet by my pillow last night,

91
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,640
I think it's gone.

92
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,480
What do you mean?

93
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,600
Are you taking back a gift
that's been given?

94
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,240
As long as it's not missing.

95
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,880
What would you like to have for dinner?

96
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,920
I'll prepare it for you.

97
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,360
Whatever.

98
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,080
Your Majesty, Her Majesty has someone
to the Palace of Xuyang

99
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,080
to invite His Highness
to have dinner at the Palace of Hanning.

100
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,160
I suppose he's about to arrive at this time.

101
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,560
Please forgive me for the extra words.

102
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,160
I'm afraid His Highness may be wronged

103
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,080
when confronted
with that moody Prince of Nanchuan.

104
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,920
Go ahead.

105
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,760
Also, rumors have been going
around the Palace lately. It is said...

106
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,960
What do they say?

107
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,640
It is said as long as the Nanchuan Army
stays here one more day,

108
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,560
the people in the Palace
can live one day longer.

109
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,800
- Nonsense!
- Please calm down, Your Majesty.

110
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,480
Only Go pieces.

111
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,360
I can just leave them.

112
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
Go outside of the Palace for me.

113
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,360
Set out at night

114
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,120
to get outside of the Palace.
Don't let others see you.

115
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

116
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,740
(Palace of Hanning)

117
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,560
I've invited Cheng to have dinner here.

118
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,280
Please don't go out of your temper.
Is that alright?

119
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,520
Cheng has dinner with me every day.

120
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,360
I hate to see him eat alone

121
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,520
in the Palace of Xuyang.

122
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,880
Your Majesty, you enjoy being a stepmother,

123
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,880
and want me to have dinner with him.

124
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Do you know? I'm fine with doing anything.

125
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,660
But the last thing I'll do
is to be a stepfather.

126
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
That's not what I mean.

127
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,200
Your Majesty.

128
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,480
Mother.

129
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,840
What's wrong? Do you think I'll eat kids?

130
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,360
Cheng.

131
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,240
It is Cheng'an who acted rudely
and misunderstood Uncle Yuan that day.

132
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,360
I am here to apologize to you, Uncle Yuan.

133
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,420
If you want to punish me,

134
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,760
I would love to take the punishment.

135
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,080
In that case,

136
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,840
how about you call me Father?

137
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,400
You're not my father.

138
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,640
I have my own father.

139
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,760
You're never my father.

140
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,200
Cheng.

141
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,480
Uncle Yuan is only kidding.

142
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,840
The dishes are getting cold.

143
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,800
Today we have steamed bass,
Cheng, your favorite.

144
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,520
Take a bite.

145
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,080
Careful. It's hot.

146
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,080
The fish is delicious.

147
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,800
Mother and I can't eat it all.

148
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,360
Uncle Yuan, you can have some too.

149
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,760
If I, Prince of Nanchuan,

150
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,000
want to eat fish,

151
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,800
do I have to eat your leftovers?

152
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,600
Cheng,

153
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,320
Uncle Yuan

154
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,560
prefers to fish stock rather than meat.

155
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,520
But thank you for your sharing, Cheng.

156
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,920
If you like it, you can have more of it.

157
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,920
Are Uncle Yuan and Father really related?

158
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,440
Why are they so different?

159
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Father worries Mother is occupied
taking care of me at dinner,

160
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
so he always lets her eat first.

161
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,680
How much do you know
that you dare to criticize me?

162
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,600
This afternoon,

163
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,320
your mother has had various pastries.

164
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,960
It will be strange

165
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,800
if she can eat more now.

166
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,480
And don't compare me with your father.

167
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,440
Without me,

168
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,680
you will be paying respects
in front of his tomb.

169
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,920
Cheng,

170
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,400
Uncle Yuan is only joking.

171
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,320
What's to cry about?

172
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,960
Aging, diseases, and death are inevitable.
You don't have a choice.

173
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,680
The only choice we have

174
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,880
is how to die for whom.

175
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,920
After your father succeeded to the throne,

176
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,640
having witnessed the regent
hold court behind the scenes,

177
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,720
he fell sick from overworking.
That's incurable.

178
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,800
He's dying for the people and the kingdom.

179
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,800
That's his choice. Even if you cry,
that'll be of no help.

180
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,320
(Now that I realize
you're still the same as before.)

181
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,360
(Although the sword was put to his neck,)

182
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,400
(you still didn't do that.)

183
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,920
(You're still the man
sticking to the right thing,)

184
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,920
(devoting himself to the kingdom,)

185
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,400
(and being loyal to the wise emperor.)

186
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,440
(Is she crying for Yuwen Yingren?)

187
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,800
Why are you so reluctant to see him die?

188
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,640
Let go of my mother!

189
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
Let go of my mother!

190
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,080
Stop crying!

191
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,360
Mother is fine.

192
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,800
Come.

193
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,760
Zhilan.

194
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,600
Take Cheng to rest.

195
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
He's not your blood.

196
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,200
Is it because he's that sick man's son,

197
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,700
you love the boy as you love the man?

198
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,840
He's not only His Majesty's son.

199
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,880
He's also my sister's son.

200
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,400
More than that,

201
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,600
Cheng is still young.

202
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
But he will gradually understand.

203
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,560
Stop saying those horrible things to him.

204
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,520
You'll terrify the kid.

205
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,120
He's even reluctant

206
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
to call me Father.

207
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,960
I'll go to prepare the bathing water for you.

208
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,920
Why are you eavesdropping as a man?

209
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,400
Come out.

210
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,480
A new message from our eyes.

211
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,600
Let's talk outside.

212
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,600
The bathing water is ready.

213
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,160
You can discuss work with General Chu first.

214
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,880
I'll wait for you to come back.
