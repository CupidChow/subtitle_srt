23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,040
Please enjoy it, Your Highness.

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,640
Feed me.

25
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,920
Then, I'll feed you, Your Highness.

26
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Your Highness, since you've tasted it,

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,720
if there's nothing special, I'll leave now.

28
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,320
Did I allow you to leave?

29
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,160
Your Highness, you've been busy
fighting and conquering.

30
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,560
I suppose you haven't got to feel
women's aroma and tenderness.

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,640
Her Majesty is most favored
in the imperial harem.

32
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,920
I think she must possess
some extraordinary features.

33
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,640
Her Majesty is not just extraordinary.

34
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,880
She surpassed the others in every respect.

35
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,040
You should learn from her.

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,040
I heard Her Majesty and His Majesty...

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,120
Oh, I should call him Yuwen Yingren.

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,920
I heard Su Yan was
Yuwen Yingren's sister-in-law.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,680
The two sisters are good at planning.

40
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,160
Before the elder sister died, she let
her husband marry her little sister,

41
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,840
attempting to grasp the ruler of the realm
in their hands.

42
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,080
Unexpectedly,

43
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,880
she falls from the top
and becomes a doormat.

44
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,200
Being able to persuade Yuwen Yingren
to marry her little sister,

45
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm afraid Su Wan has even more
extraordinary features.

46
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,000
How dare you slap me!

47
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,080
Ye Ruyu,

48
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,800
Wan was such a noble person.

49
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,640
But you are only a tool Duke of Lu uses

50
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,880
to ride on the coattails.

51
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,840
How dare you judge her!

52
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,440
You... You're only a nominal empress.

53
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,760
Who allows you to talk to me like that?

54
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,040
You're only a replacement.

55
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,080
A plaything.

56
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,600
You are behaving too impudently
in front of me.

57
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,040
And you.

58
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,200
Do you really think
everything will go as you wish

59
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,800
after you become the ruler of the realm?

60
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,760
Your Highness,
how dare she say that to you!

61
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,960
Your Highness, you're a gallant man
with great talent.

62
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,600
By then, please don't forget
to let me be the empress.

63
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,600
A replacement.

64
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,200
Do you deserve it?

65
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,280
Chu Li.

66
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,320
Your Highness.

67
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,160
Humiliated royal relatives.

68
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,360
Forming a political clique.
Attempting to rebel.

69
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,600
How should she be punished
according to the law?

70
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,360
According to the law,

71
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,080
humiliating royal relatives equals
insubordination.

72
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,080
Her nose should be cut off.

73
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,080
Forming a political clique.
Attempting to rebel.

74
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,400
Her kneecaps should be removed,

75
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,760
collected, and shown
in the market to warn the public.

76
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,320
Your Highness... Your Highness,
it is I who talked recklessly.

77
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,640
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

78
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,200
Pack her and take her back to Duke of Lu.

79
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,600
Tell him this realm

80
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,720
is not up to him to decide.

81
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Your Highness... Your Highness...

82
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,640
How could you do this to me?

83
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,800
I'm the legitimate daughter of Duke of Lu!

84
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,040
I will be the respected empress
in the future!

85
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,840
Let go of me. You let go of me!

86
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,240
Are we being too violent?

87
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,520
Only violence daunts the fools.

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,920
That's clever.

89
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,920
Send a troop of the Nanchuan Army
to watch the Palace of Hanning closely.

90
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,280
Yes.

91
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,480
(Su Yan, you can only be my prey.)

92
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,640
Your Majesty, please allow me
to take care of His Highness.

93
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,920
You could get some rest.

94
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,240
I'm not going back tonight.

95
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,080
Your Majesty, I heard Ye Ruyu

96
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,280
was carried out of the Palace in a sack.

97
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,600
Zhilan, you can go and have a rest.

98
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,720
Your Majesty,

99
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,240
Her Majesty has been staying
in the Palace of Xuyang tonight.

100
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,120
I suppose she must have been distressed,

101
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,480
after Ms. Ye upset her.

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,320
In many things, Yan prefers

103
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,760
to deal with them on her own.

104
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,720
Never mind.

105
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,680
Go with me to meet her.

106
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,400
Yes.

107
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,040
Your Majesty, please take care.

108
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,500
(Palace of Xuyang)

109
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,120
It's you.

110
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,040
Your Majesty,
you're so charming and graceful.

111
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,120
Such a genie
who lures people to wrongdoing.

112
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,400
Let go of me.

113
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,840
Why are you here?

114
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,600
I have protected the entire Imperial City.

115
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Is there any place
that is forbidden for me to go?

116
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,480
What are you doing?

117
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,240
What am I doing?

118
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,880
I'm taking back the reward
that I deserved long ago.

119
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,360
What?

120
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,120
Did you regret it, Your Majesty?

121
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,840
Or, have you forgotten your promise?

122
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,080
Why didn't you talk, Your Majesty?

123
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,280
Your Majesty, you were
so eloquent earlier today.

124
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,400
But why you don't talk now

125
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,520
as if you're dumb?

126
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,360
Not here.

127
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,040
Yuwen Yuan, not in this place.

128
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,080
Where are you looking at?

129
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,920
I am right here.

130
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,720
What are you thinking of?

131
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,640
You're not allowed to cry.

132
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,240
You're not allowed to cry.

133
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,920
Your Majesty, are you awake?

134
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,960
His Majesty has come to meet you.

135
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,600
Yan,

136
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm worried upon hearing the things
between you and the daughter of Duke of Lu.

137
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,880
So I came to visit you.

138
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,040

Yan?

Yan?

Yan.

145
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,280
I'm only worried about you.

Let me just take a look at you.

Tell him to get lost.

148

I'm so disheveled at the moment.

Please excuse me for not meeting you.
