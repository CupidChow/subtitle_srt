I'm here to thank you
for your coming to our rescue.

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,600
Thank you for saving us
for the sake of the ties of brotherhood

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,960
and your care for your nephew.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,520
I've come here to appreciate your help
on behalf of His Majesty and Cheng.

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,240
With your protection,

28
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,920
I believe no one ever
dares to plot a rebellion.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

30
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,040
Didn't you implore me desperately
and make a promise in the letter?

31
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,400
You're being so polite to me.

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,720
Are you going back on your words?

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,200
As long as you don't hurt
His Majesty and Cheng,

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,640
I will keep my word
as written in the letter.

35
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,800
Keep your word?

36
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,760
You wear these layers of clothing.

37
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,000
Is that how you show your sincerity?

38
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,960
Your Majesty, for that brat
and Yuwen Yingren, are you really willing

39
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,160
to do anything for me?

40
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,200
Cheng is my son.

41
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
He's not a brat.

42
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,920
His Majesty is the ruler of the realm,

43
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,880
and your related brother.

44
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,400
I hope you could mind your words.

45
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,080
Your son?

46
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,280
Your Majesty, you're impressive.

47
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,680
Entering the imperial palace less than
five years, you have a son at seven.

48
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,000
How about you give birth
to a son this old for me, Your Majesty?

49
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,680
I happen to dislike crying babies.

50
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,000
That saves much trouble for me.

51
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,440
In terms of Yuwen Yingren,

52
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,040
I'm rather curious

53
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,800
when he's gravely ill,

54
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,560
how would you do in the bedroom?

55
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,920
If you don't tell me,
I'll ask him in person.

56
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,120
If he doesn't know
how to respond just like you do now,

57
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,960
I will cut his tongue.

58
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,120
Tell me, if he loses his tongue,

59
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,720
will he still be the Emperor?

60
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,760
It's a private affair.

61
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,960
It's reasonable I don't tell you.

62
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,640
Private affair?

63
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,680
If he knows

64
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,320
you're also with another man,

65
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,440
will he do those private things with you?

66
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,360
Tell me.

67
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,880
Could you wait a little longer?

68
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,600
Your Majesty,

69
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,000
are you negotiating with me?

70
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,920
I will do

71
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,200
as I have promised you.

72
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,840
Even if you want my life...

73
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,560
Your Majesty, since you dare to die,

74
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,141
you also dare
to be physically close to me, right?

75
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,800
Take them off.

76
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,360
Your Majesty, if you undress yourself,
I'll be the only one to see.

77
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,280
If I help you take them off,

78
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,920
I'll have to let our brothers,
who fought on the battlefield with me,

79
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,160
have a feast for their eyes.

80
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,960
Am I right, Your Majesty?

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,840
After all, it is you
who invite them to come, Your Majesty.

82
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,840
It is not much
to ask for a sweet deal, is it?

83
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,400
Go on.

84
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,640
Yuwen Yuan, I'm begging you...

85
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,200
Disappointing.

86

87
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,440
