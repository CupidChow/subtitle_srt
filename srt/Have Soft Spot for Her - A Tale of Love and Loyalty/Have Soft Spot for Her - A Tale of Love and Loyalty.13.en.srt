=Episode 13=

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,720
You're here, Yuan.

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,720
Since you're here,
why don't you have a meal with us?

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,040
It seems like

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,960
you don't really want me to dine with you.

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,200
I don't see my tableware

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,920
prepared in advance.

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,880
It was my fault

30
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,640
that we never do things together.

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,160
Kid, I just saved you
a couple of days ago.

32
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,640
Why aren't you showing respect now?

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,080
Who taught you manners?

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're so unruly.

35
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
Uncle Yuan.

36
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,120
I haven't seen you in days

37
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,240
and you've gained weight.

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,920
It's time to lose it.

39
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,480
You should follow me
to the army camp and train.

40
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,600
Train?

41
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,600
It means commanding a large army
in battle to regain lost territories

42
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,000
and secure victories in wars.

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,320
Mother, can I go play with Uncle Yuan?

44
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,920
Cheng, don't make trouble.

45
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Cheng.

46
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,600
Cheng is the crown prince.

47
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,040
He has to learn the duties of a monarch.

48
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,880
If he goes with you,

49
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,000
it will affect his studies.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,320
With me around,

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,640
he doesn't need to learn how to rule.

52
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,880
Without me,

53
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,120
the Great Yu Dynasty would be gone.

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,520
He wouldn't even need
to learn theories about war.

55
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,920
You...

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Come.

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Prince of Nanchuan.

58
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,320
What you are doing now is similar

59
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,480
to what our ancestors did

60
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,320
when they used the emperor's authority
to control other fiefdoms.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,560
If you hadn't mentioned it,

62
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,920
I would have forgotten.

63
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,720
Rumors have been spreading
in the palace lately.

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,840
In that case,
I will turn them into truths.

65
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
What are you doing?

66
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,360
I won't do anything.

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,440
I only know

68
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,480
that whatever you want to do,

69
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,040
I will not let you have your way.

70
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Yan.

71
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,880
Are you now satisfied

72
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,520
with how this situation has turned out?

73
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,640
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

74
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,000
What do I mean?

75
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,360
You suspect that I would harm Cheng,

76
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,960
but you let Prince of Nanchuan
take him away.

77
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,240
If something happens to Cheng,

78
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,840
how will you explain it to Wan?

79
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,000
Forget it.

80
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,200
Cheng trusts Yuan.

81
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,520
In that case,

82
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,680
I hope he will not

83
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,160
direct his frustration towards you and me

84
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,720
onto the child.

85
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,640
You're right, Your Majesty.

86
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,080
But I believe

87
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,760
that being exploited by a close relative

88
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,560
is far more unacceptable

89
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
than any harm Yuwen Yuan
will bring upon him.

90
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,840
I'm taking my leave.

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,440
Please don't be angry, Your Majesty.

92
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,520
Get out.

93
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
(After today's incident,)

94
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,480
(Yuwen Yingren and Yuan
have completely turned on each other.)

95
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,000
Without me,

96
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,200
the Great Yu Dynasty would be gone.

97
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,000
You...

98
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,160
What are you doing, Your Highness?

99
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,520
I won't do anything.

100
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,820
I only know

101
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,880
that whatever you want to do,

102
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,080
I will not let you have your way.

103
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,640
Kid,

104
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,400
am I better or your master?

105
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,080
You, of course.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Not bad, kid.

107
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,680
You picked the wooden sword
I carved myself.

108
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,120
I don't deserve your praise.

109
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,160
I really like this sword.

110
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,720
Can you give it to me?

111
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,360
Cheng, what did I tell you?

112
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,520
You will not ask for things from others.

113
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,800
Have you played enough?

114
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,480
Come back with me.

115
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,520
Do you want this sword?

116
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,120
Yes.

117
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,320
If you want this sword,

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,120
defeat me and I'll give it to you.

119
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,320
Mother, I want to play with Uncle Yuan.

120
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,360
Your Highness must be busy.

121
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,680
Don't let Cheng stay here and disturb you.

122
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,920
Your Majesty, are you trying
to burn the bridge again?

123
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,040
(Did he take Cheng away on purpose?)

124
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,400
Cheng.

125
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,760
Cheng, are you hurt?

126
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,280
My bum hurts a little.

127
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,720
He is just a child.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,760
Can't you go easy on him?

129
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,240
When faced with life or death
on the battlefield,

130
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,940
those who want to kill him
will not see him as a child.

131
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,360
He is the heir to the throne,

132
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,760
and you wouldn't let him
endure a little bit of pain.

133
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,040
A loving mother fails a son, indeed.

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,040
Shall we continue?

135
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,800
Yes.

136
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,400
Shall we continue?

137
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,280
Yes.

138
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,120
Mother.

139
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,080
Uncle Yuan, you lost.

140
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,720
Are you hurt?

141
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,360
Are you worried about me, Your Majesty?

142
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,400
A child's strength
can hurt you this badly.

143
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,320
I suppose the god of war isn't
impressive after all.

144
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,840
You brat,

145
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,920
you aimed for my injury.

146
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,240
I'm sorry, Uncle Yuan.

147
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,640
I didn't mean it.

148
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,960
It's fine. Tell me.

149
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,200
How did you find out that I'm injured?

150
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,320
You hardly used
the right side of your body

151
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,880
when you fought me.

152
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,560
So, I guessed.

153
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,080
You're indeed the son of Yuwen Yingren.

154
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,040
You already understand
what it means to win

155
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,600
by attacking the enemy's weakness
with one move.

156
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,000
Let me take a look at your injury.

157
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,520
Chu Li.

158
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,520
Your Highness, your injury is...

159
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,640
Her Majesty and I have
something to discuss.

160
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,480
Take the child away.

161
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,200
Cheng, you go first.

162
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:30,880
Take it easy.

163
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Su Yan.

164
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,360
Did that hurt you?

165
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,360
No.

166
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,040
Your Majesty, you're no longer scared
when dealing with injuries now.

167
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,900
(Eight years ago)

168
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,600
Don't speak if you want to live.

169
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,520
Over there. Go.

170
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,000
Who are you?

171
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,120
Wake up. Hey.

172
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,120
I'm not afraid, so why are you afraid?

173
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,160
If you dare to run,

174
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,880
I will kill you.

175
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,200
(She is such a fool to trust me so easily.)

176
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,960
Stop crying. What is your name?

177
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,320
Su... Su Yan.

178
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,720
You're still injured.
Why are you trying to be a hero?

179
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,240
Are you worried about me, Your Majesty?

180
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,960
Shouldn't you hope

181
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,560
that I die soon,

182
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,920
so that Yuwen Yingren can

183
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,400
take back the military power in Nanchuan

184
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,800
and solve the kingdom's trouble?

185
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,720
Su Yan, have you gone insane?

186
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,880
We need to stop the bleeding.
You should bear with it, Your Highness.

187
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,880
All right, I'll be leaving now.

188
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,720
Su Yan, why wouldn't you trust me?

189
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,520
I know you're being defensive.

190
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,960
Being defensive is the best.

191
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,880
But I'm curious

192
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,360
if you are showing the same defensiveness

193
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,800
towards Yuwen Yingren
as you are towards me.

194
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,920
This has nothing to do with you.

195
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,680
Does what you plan to do

196
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,680
have nothing to do with me?

197
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,600
I merely want to find Cheng

198
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,520
a chance to live in this troubled times.

199
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,800
You can fight for power all you want.

200
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,600
It has nothing to do with me.

201
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,400
What if I am fighting for
more than just the throne?

202
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,280
You...

203
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,520
I'm a very greedy person.

204
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
I want both the throne and the beauty.

205
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,720
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

206
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Beware that you don't suffer a loss,
Your Highness.

207
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,320
I'll gladly endure it.

208
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,120
Uncle Yuan, Mother.

209
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,400
Can't you watch a child?

210
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,360
He wants to find Her Majesty.

211
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,920
Mother, has Uncle Yuan gotten better?

212
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,760
Thanks to you and your mother,

213
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,640
I am still alive.

214
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,440
Does your word hold true?

215
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,080
What?

216
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,880
You can have it.

217
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,040
Thank you, Uncle Yuan.

218
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,200
Cheng, his injury hasn't healed.

219
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,800
It's fine. Come.

220
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,200
How about we go outside
and have a sword practice?

221
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,560
Okay.

222
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,300
(Palace of Jingcheng)

223
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,040
Come.

224
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,120
Cheng.

225
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,480
Yuan, stop it.

226
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,200
Give it to me.

227
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,120
Cheng.

228
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,480
Uncle Yuan.

229
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,000
Cheng, be careful.

230
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,240
All right, stop it.

231
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,000
Meng Chuang, take a look.

232
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,760
Do the three of them
look more like a family of three?

233
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,000
It seems like

234
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,880
I am the extra person here.

235
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,280
Your Majesty, the empress
and crown prince are also helpless.

236
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,040
Helpless?

237
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,440
Right now,
Prince of Nanchuan holds power

238
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,520
and the crown prince is
being held hostage.

239
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,160
Her Majesty is only doing this
to protect the crown prince

240
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,800
and you, Your Majesty.

241
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes, she is also doing this for me.

242
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,680
Go.

243
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,680
Yes, Your Majesty.
