In that case, that's just what I want.

Duke Lu, that person is rather ruthless.

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,920
We're only asking a tiger for its skin.

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,720

Who?

33
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,860
Aging, diseases, and death are inevitable.
You don't have a choice.

34
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,120
The only choice we have

35
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,120
is how to die for whom.

36
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,200
(Although the rebel armies of Prince Yu
and Prince Yun have been swept away,)

37
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,960
(people inside and outside of the City
are peeping wickedly.)

38
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,560
(The Nanchuan Army is rotating day and night.)

39
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,360
A new message from our eyes.

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,320
Let's talk outside.

41
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,040
(Coming to the rescue is easy,)

42
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,040
(while retreating safely will be hard.)

43
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,680
(Why do I brashly think)

44
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,440
(he needs me to wait for him?)

45
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,440
Yan.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,200
This time, it is I who owe you.

47
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,920
I cannot keep you company anymore.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,320
We've already made a deal.

49
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,600
I want you to be my lady of the general.

50
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,760
But now we can't make it.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,400
Don't cry.

52
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,040
Don't cry.

53
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,120
We still have a chance in the next life.

54
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,320
Tell me, you tell me.

55
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,560
What can I do to save you?

56
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,760
What can I do to save you?

57
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,400
How to save you?

58
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,920
In this life,

59
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,920
you could get married to a scholar.

60
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,960
Yan.

61
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,240
I don't want you
to live a life full of frights.

62
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,600
Not a scholar.

63
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,040
He doesn't know martial arts.

64
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,400
He can't protect you.

65
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,120
You should marry a man who knows how to fight.

66
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,440
Yan,

67
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,520
Yan, you should marry
a man who knows how to fight.

68
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,520
Yan,

69
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,120
officials under the administrative office
will be good. They know how to fight.

70
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,640
I don't want any of them.

71
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,600
They don't need to fight on the battlefield.

72
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,320
But their monthly salary is too little.

73
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,160
Do not ever marry a man

74
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,840
who can't buy you rouge, powder,

75
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,760
and beautiful dresses.

76
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,560
Those who can't afford rouge and powder,

77
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,200
don't marry any one of them.

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,880
Tell me, quickly.

79
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,120
Don't marry any one of them.

80
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,560
Just tell me what I should do to save you.

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,840
What should I do?

82
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,920
Don't marry any one of them.

83
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,280
Don't marry any one of them.

84
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,800
Are you going to bed

85
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,320
before I come back?

86
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,720
I thought you wouldn't be back tonight.

87
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,080
If I don't come back, where else could I go?

88
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,800
Where have you been?

89
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,600
Why did you get you in a mess?

90
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,440
This thing keeps falling down.

91
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,840

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,920

Your Highness.

128
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,720
Your Majesty, His Highness
didn't sleep well last night.

Please go back.

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,280

133
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,040

134
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,000
please give this to His Highness.

It doesn't matter.

141
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,300
Your Majesty, you have stayed up all night

142
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,840
to craft dozens of sky lanterns
for the late empress,

143
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
and even hurt yourself.

144
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,640

148

149
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,960
