(They want me to marry someone
I've never met? No way.)

00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,440
(So what if he is the Prince of Nanchuan?)

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,040
Don't speak if you want to live.

27
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,720
Over there. Go.

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,200
Who are you?

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,520
(This was our first meeting.)

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,320
Wake up. Hey.

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,800
I'm not afraid, so why are you afraid?

32
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,840
If you dare to run,

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,560
I will kill you.

34
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,880
(She is such a fool to trust me so easily.)

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,800
Stop crying. What is your name?

36
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,160
Su... Su Yan.

37
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,260
Are you hungry?

38
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,920
Yes.

39
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,680
I'll find something to eat.

40
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,920
This is great. You're alive.

41
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,400
Are you injured?

42
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,260
Can't I survive without you?

43
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,880
That's not what I meant.

44
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,340
There are ambushes and assassins
on the route to the capital.

45
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,200
Someone will try to stop you.

46
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,960
The more dangerous it is,
the more interesting it gets.

47
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,480
- I must go to the capital.
- But...

48
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,680
Do you have food?

49
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,820
Do you have food?

50
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,160
I really can't

51
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,680
take it anymore from our chief.

52
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,000
Where do you think we can find

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,240
a bride out in the middle of nowhere?

54
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,080
We can't even spot a female rat.

55
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,720
Hey, that's...

56
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,520
There's one right there.

57
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,240
- Let's go.
- Hello, pretty girl.

58
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,360
(Where is she?)

59
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,240
Please enjoy, sir.

60
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,640
Sit down.

61
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,040
Please enjoy, lady and gentlemen.

62
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,820
I'm telling you.

63
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,920
After we take her home,

64
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,120
quickly lock her up.

65
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,480
Just lock her in the woodshed.

66
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,800
Behave.

67
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,960
Excuse me.

68
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,840
I want to eat a baked sweet potato.

69
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,680
We're in the middle of nowhere.

70
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
Where do I find a baked sweet potato?

71
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Are you done drinking?
Then, follow me home.

72
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,560
Stop dilly-dallying.

73
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,520
The chief took a fancy to her.

74
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,440
She is going to be our lady boss too.

75
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,360
Let's be more polite to her.

76
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,000
I know.

77
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,920
Madam, enjoy your drink.

78
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,960
You want a baked sweet potato?

79
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,240
I'll bake you one
when we get back to the camp.

80
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,120
- Yes.
- I don't want it anymore.

81
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,160
She doesn't want one.
Then, let's go back to the camp.

82
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,200
Here, come. Back to the camp.

83
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,640
- Let's go.
- Stop.

84
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,040
- Let's go.
- Come.

85
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,600
Not only did you refuse to save me,
you came here with me.

86
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,000
You must up to something bad.

87
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,840
Why can't I come along

88
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,280
to such a fun place?

89
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,520
You!

90
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,200
Can you take me back to the camp too?

91
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,720
I came out here to find
a really dependable backer.

92
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,640
You gentlemen look impressive at a glance,

93
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,520
absolutely outstanding...

94
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,880
With peerless martial arts.

95
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,840
Our camp happens to lack able-bodied men.

96
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,800
Come with us.

97
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,240
Come, take them away.

98
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,440
- Alright.
- Come.

99
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,140
This way.

100
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,240
You!

101
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,520
- Who locked my wife in the woodshed?
- But I...

102
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,760
- Useless fools.
- That's...

103
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,880
Dear.

104
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,520
Dear.

105
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,680
Dear, you suffered.

106
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,240
My lackeys are morons.

107
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,440
They made you suffer.

108
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
You must be tired, dear.

109
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,880
If I die, he won't get to live.

110
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,160
Who are you?

111
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,680
How dare you touch my wife?

112
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,520
If I die, I'll drag you down with me.

113
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,440
Chief.

114
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,760
You see this?

115
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,640
She threw herself onto me first.

116
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,000
- Men!
- Chief, Chief.

117
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,240
A night of spring
is worth a thousand gold.

118
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,200
Don't let me get in your way.

119
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,920
You have a point, boy.

120
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,600
You have a point indeed.

121
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,320
Come.

122
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,280
Save me.

123
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,960
Come now.

124
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,520
If something happens to me,
you're going to pay for it.

125
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,200
Hurry, hurry.

126
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,920
Hurry.

127
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,920
You... You...

128
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,560
You're having an affair with my wife.

129
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,660
She said it?

130
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,360
She hit you?

131
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,140
Tell me.

132
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,080
- What's going on between you and my wife?
- Speak.

133
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,360
Interesting.

134
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,100
You know how to hit others?

135
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,960
Right, what did she say?

136
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,520
Or did you say something to her

137
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,040
and made her hit you?

138
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,200
She never hit me.

139
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,280
You lunatic.

140
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,520
You lunatic.

141
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,680
Men!

142
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,240
Take me away.

143
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,540
(Very well. Everyone is here.)

144
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,640
- I am late, Your Highness.
- His Highness is unharmed, right?

145
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,400
His Highness is doing very well.

146
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,800
He commands us to report back.

147
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,760
Remember me, your savior, Yu Yuan.

148
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,620
I'll come back for you.

149
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,440
So, he is
the Prince of Nanchuan's subordinate.

150
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,920
I heard that the old man
found another match for me.

151
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,760
Refuse it for me.

152
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,080
He has a keen ability to read people.

153
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,880
Are you sure?

154
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,960
I will marry

155
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,200
