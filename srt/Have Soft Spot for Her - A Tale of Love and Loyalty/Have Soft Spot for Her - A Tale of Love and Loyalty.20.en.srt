=Episode 20=

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,080
Wan, you're usually resourceful

24
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,880
but why are you so careless
when it comes to this matter about Yan?

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,600
A marriage concerns Yan's happiness
for the rest of her life.

26
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,600
Forcing her

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,040
to marry a man
she has never met in the south

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,280
will only hurt her.

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,800
(Chancellor Su)
This marriage was decreed by the emperor.

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,720
Why are you, a woman, getting involved?

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,620
Father, I...

32
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,620
Wan.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,080
Father, Wan and Yan share a deep bond.

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,360
Don't blame her anymore.

35
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,720
Wan, tell me.

36
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,800
Where have you hidden Yan?

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,720
I always thought
Your Highness was merciless.

38
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,280
But the mere mention of Yan

39
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,320
will bring out the inferiority
and cowardice you hide in your heart.

40
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,440
This is extremely laughable.

41
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,280
You truly love to jest.

42
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,760
Yan,

43
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,120
I don't want to fight with you.

44
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,640
If you change your mind and leave,

45
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,880
no one will stop you.

46
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,280
Chancellor, someone has seen Miss Su Yan
near Mount Lancheng.

47
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,640
Bring her home.

48
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,280
Oh, of course.

49
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,920
There is one thing I don't understand.

50
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,240
Don't we already have help
from the crown prince?

51
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,800
Why are we roping in a feudal lord?

52
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,440
What do you know?

53
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,920
The Prince of Nanchuan
rarely returns to the capital,

54
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,800
but he has won many battles
at such a young age.

55
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,800
This time, the emperor is critically ill

56
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,120
and has sent a secret edict
requesting his presence.

57
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,160
We can't be sure

58
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,000
who will become the next emperor yet.

59
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,480
You are wise, Chancellor.

60
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Yingren, I've spoken out of turn today.

61
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,360
Yan.

62
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,080
Yan.

63
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,880
(Why do you only have Yan in your heart?)

64
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,240
I heard there is news about Yan.
Is that true?

65
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,260
As a monarch,
you couldn't bear to be merciless.

66
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,320
As a husband, you fail the ones you love.

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,800
Aren't you afraid you will end up alone?

68
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:59,400
(Yingren, why can't I ever
enter your heart?)

69
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,000
- Yan, you're finally...
- Your Highness, where is Wan?

70
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,680
(Yan.)

71
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,200
Wan.

72
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,800
Wan.

73
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,080
You're back.

74
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,080
I missed you, so I came back.

75
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,800
(I wanted to give you
another chance to choose.)

76
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,560
(Why must you come back again?)

77
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,200
I'm glad you're back.

78
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,960
(So, you are the second daughter
of the Su family.)

79
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,480
Yingren, she is the lady
I mentioned in my letter.

80
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,400
I will marry no one but her in this life.

81
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,880
What are you talking about?

82
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,480
Wan, don't...

83
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,660
Wan.

84
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Yuan,

85
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,540
you asked Father
to decline the engagement just days ago

86
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,360
and now you want to marry her.

87
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,040
Such a childish game is an insult

88
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,920
to someone of Chancellor Su's stature.

89
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,520
Yingren, I didn't know

90
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,440
that this marriage
was arranged by our old man.

91
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,040
But it isn't too late to know about this.

92
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,540
I will marry

93
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,400
the one I want to marry

94
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,320
no matter her status.

95
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,800
I will deal

96
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,880
with our old man myself.

97
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,920
Yan,

98
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,440
you ran away from the marriage

99
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,640
because he is the Prince of Nanchuan.

100
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,640
Now, you seem close to him.

101
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,800
What does this mean?

102
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,280
Wan, I ran away from the marriage

103
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,540
because I don't want to marry
someone I don't know.

104
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,720
Later, I met him on the road.

105
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,400
I really didn't know who he is,

106
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,660
and I didn't know
that he is the Prince of Nanchuan.

107
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,940
Do you love him?

108
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,720
Remember me, your savior, Yu Yuan.

109
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,920
I'll come back for you.

110
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,160
I don't hate him.

111
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,840
I love you more, Wan.

112
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,840
Oh, you're such a sweet-talker.

113
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,480
We'll never be apart again.

114
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,520
Okay.

115
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,120
We'll never be apart again.

116
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,000
Your Highness, it sounds like

117
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,540
you are willing to accept
the Duke of Lu's help.

118
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,120
Tell me.

119
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,160
What condition does he have?

120
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,920
It's nothing major.

121
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,160
The Duke of Lu has a daughter.

122
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,800
Her name is Ruyu
and has long adored Your Highness.

123
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,520
If Your Highness is willing

124
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,720
to marry the daughter of the Duke of Lu,

125
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,660
this cooperation
will surely proceed smoothly.

126
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,800
I'm afraid the Duke of Lu is confused.

127
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,540
I am already married.

128
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,240
I heard that your first wife,
Su Wan, has been ill for years.

129
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,200
I'm sure it is normal for her to die

130
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,280
if her illness goes untreated.

131
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,400
You're an intelligent person,
Your Highness.

132
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,640
You should understand what I mean.

133
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Su Wan is my wedded wife.

134
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,440
She wholeheartedly

135
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,240
stood by me through thick and thin,

136
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
and never did anything wrong.

137
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,660
I will never hurt her.

138
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,600
Your Highness,

139
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,520
I'm sure you
can weigh the importance

140
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,760
of a momentary responsibility
against a lifetime of power.

141
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,840
If you insist on this,

142
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,400
I'm afraid the Duke of Lu
will not let this go easily

143
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,320
due to his love for his daughter.

144
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,740
Your Highness should know
that soft-heartedness

145
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,160
stands in the way of great accomplishments.

146
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,600
If you can't hold onto the kingdom,

147
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,000
how could you talk about

148
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,920
protecting your wife
and your infant child?

149
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,240
We await good news from you,
Your Highness.

150
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,040
The Duke of Lu is hard to predict.

151
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
You cannot let him overstep his limits.

152
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,920
Did you think you can rest easy

153
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,760
as the crown prince

154
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,540
after giving up
part of your military's command?

155
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,040
How ridiculous.

156
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,060
The Tiger Talisman of Military Command.

157
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,200
Everyone knows

158
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,320
that he is eyeing the throne.

159
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,960
Tell me.

160
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,600
The Prince of Nanchuan has returned.

161
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,120
If he finds out that you intend

162
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,660
to surrender the kingdom to make peace,

163
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,760
what would he think?

164
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,360
What do you mean?

165
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,040
Your Highness, if you trust me,

166
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,080
then leave the rest to me.

167
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,880
Your health is important.
Rest and recover first.

168
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,920
Wan dislikes bitterness.

169
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,440
Remember to bring
her favorite osmanthus candy

170
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,520
when giving her medicine.

171
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,880
Your Highness,
it's time for your medicine.

172
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,760
It's too bitter.

173
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,520
His Highness knew
you would try to talk your way out,

174
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,280
so he asked me to bring osmanthus candy.

175
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,080
Bring me paper.

176
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,680
Yes, Your Highness.

177
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,500
(For Su Yan Only)

178
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,160
Nanny, when the time is right,

179
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,320
give this letter to Su Yan.

180
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,760
You must personally hand it to her.

181
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,100
Why are you doing this, Your Highness?
His Highness will...

182
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,920
You're the daughter
of Chancellor Su's first wife.

183
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,320
Are you willing to marry me,

184
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,160
a powerless prince?

185
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,120
His Majesty's health

186
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,360
has been deteriorating over the years.

187
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,040
The imperial court
is already divided into factions.

188
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,640
I'm afraid I'll have to marry.

189
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,520
Instead of being forced to marry,

190
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,480
I might as well marry someone I love.

191
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,720
You love me?

192
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,640
(The feelings I gave him)

193
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,680
(cannot be returned
with just a few words.)

194
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,120
(I've spent
more than half my life with him.)

195
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,160
(I don't regret marrying him.)

196
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,160
Your Highness.

197
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,680
Nanny.

198
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,760
I didn't expect

199
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,280
this candy

200
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,400
