=A Tale of Love and Loyalty=

22
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,380
=Episode 10=

23
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,120
They say Prince of Nanchuan is brutal,

24
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,680
quick with his sword to kill,

25
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,920
and defies the laws and disciplines.

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,840
Someone once impeached him at the court,

27
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,420
and before he returned home,
his head was chopped off.

28
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,900
Since then, no one in the court
has dared to bring up

29
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,400
affairs related to the southern region.

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,000
The so-called strict discipline in the army

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,240
is no different from the monopoly of power.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,660
This time, that His Majesty invited him here

33
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,640
is like dancing with the devil.

34
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,980
Lately, Prince of Nanchuan
has been bothering the little prince.

35
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,860
Your Majesty, given your condition,

36
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,280
I'm afraid you have to be on guard.

37
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,440
Cheng is his nephew.

38
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
He won't do that.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,600
Your Highness, are you alright?

40
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,160
Get him.

41
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,140
(Palace of Xuyang)

42
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,520
Where is he?

43
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,560
Is he...

44
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,080
Shut the palace gates.

45
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,680
Yes.

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,560
What brings you here?

47
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,480
That's what I want to ask.

48
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Maids.

49
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,200
Your Majesty.

50
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
Where's Cheng?

51
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,000
His Highness? He was here just now.

52
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,160
Go and find him now.

53
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,320
Yes.

54
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,880
Quickly.

55
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,960
Yan, calm down.

56
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,600
There's no sign of a fight

57
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,680
or a hint of a struggle.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,440
He must have been taken
by someone he knows.

59
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,320
The Palace is tightly guarded
by your Nanchuan Army.

60
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,120
Even a fly won't get out.

61
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,040
Who else

62
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,360
will take Cheng away under your nose?

63
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,960
Su Yan, are you suspecting me?

64
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,920
I don't dare to.

65
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,380
I just need you to give me
a reasonable explanation, Your Highness.

66
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,960
Even if I took away the kid,

67
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,560
what would you do to me?

68
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,920
Did Cheng fall asleep?

69
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,840
Your Majesty, yes.

70
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,320
That's good.

71
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,680
Your Highness, no suspicious figures
are found nearby.

72
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,040
Only a few carriages delivering food
passed through the south gate.

73
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,400
This late at night,

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,160
what food do they need to deliver?

75
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,440
That's bad.

76
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,720
Keep a close eye on the Palace of Hanning.

77
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,120
Yes.

78
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,560
Cheng'an.

79
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,960
Cheng'an.

80
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,900
(Palace of Hanning)

81
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,800
Your Majesty, the little prince
has been missing.

82
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,360
We should inform His Majesty about this.

83
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
No, we can't.

84
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,360
How could His Majesty withstand it
in his current condition?

85
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,800
Will Prince of Nanchuan
go to find the little prince?

86
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
Are you hurt badly?

87
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,560
Is that obvious?

88
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,480
Let me tell you a story.

89
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,760
When I was ill,

90
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,400
Mother would tell me stories.

91
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,520
No.

92
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,240
Once upon a time,

93
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,360
no moon or stars existed in the sky.

94
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,400
After the sunset, the world
would be sunk into darkness.

95
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,320
In the nighttime, there was a thatched cottage.

96
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,440
A boy and a girl were living inside.

97
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,720
They were in love with each other.

98
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,800
Every time the boy went up
to the mountain to hunt,

99
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
the girl would sit by the doorstep
to wait for him.

100
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,160
No matter how long it would take.

101
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,560
She waited for the boy
to come back and kiss her cheek.

102
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,680
One night, the cold wind came along.

103
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,440
The boy didn't come back.

104
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,480
The girl thought the boy
had been in an accident.

105
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,200
She cried sadly, and kept crying.

106
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,240
Her teardrops flew up to the sky,

107
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,600
turning into the stars.

108
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,480
The boy, who was lost in the mountain,

109
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,880
saw these stars.

110
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,580
He found his way home
following the little stars.

111
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,120
But it was too late.

112
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,480
The girl passed away because of sorrow.

113
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,640
After she died, she turned into the moon.

114
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,800
Ever since then, the moon and the stars
have appeared in the sky.

115
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,200
Wherever the boy goes,

116
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,960
the moon and the stars will follow him.

117
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,240
Therefore, the boy
has never lost his way again.

118
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,000
Who told you about that?

119
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,720
Mother told me.

120
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,660
I didn't lose my way.

121
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,120
I'm just tired. I want to get some rest.

122
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,680
You'd better be quiet. Otherwise,

123
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,360
I'll throw you into the mountain
to feed the wolves.

124
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,920
And don't learn from that little girl.

125
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,480
Crying doesn't solve any problems.

126
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,760
In the future, if your lover

127
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,440
can't make it back from the mountain,

128
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,320
you should go
and level the entire mountain.

129
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,080
What? Aren't you afraid of me now?

130
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,160
Mother has said, you're a good man.

131
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,920
Well, let me be a good man once.

132
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,600
Call me Father once.

133
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,960
Get some rest now.

134
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,400
Yan, how long are you going to hide this from me?

135
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,520
Your Majesty.

136
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,880
Yan.

137
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,360
I haven't taken good care of Cheng.

138
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,540
Yan.

139
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,680
I'm not blaming you.

140
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
If someone did it on purpose,

141
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,720
how could you deal with it?

142
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,320
What you've done is good enough.

143
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,440
I'm grateful.

144
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,720
Yan.

145
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,240
I hope you know

146
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,920
we're a family.

147
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,040
Oftentimes, you don't have to

148
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,320
take on all the burden of so many things.

149
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,120
You two are truly in love with each other.

150
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,120
- Mother.
- Cheng.

151
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,680
Cheng.

152
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,080
Cheng.

153
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,720
Cheng. Are you well?

154
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,000
Cheng.

155
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,180
Don't run around ever.

156
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,480
Or Mother will be worried.

157
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,840
Mother, Cheng is fine.

158
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,080
In that case,

159
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,480
I'll leave you to enjoy
the pleasure of a family reunion.

Yuan.

161
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,280
Cheng must have been frightened.

162
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,780
Just stay and keep him company.

163
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,760
(You're no longer my moon eventually.)

164
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,440
Just stay here.
