00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,040
Su Yan, why wouldn't you trust me?

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,480
We've troubled you today, Your Highness.

25
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,600
After Cheng wakes up,

26
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,280
I will take him back
to the Palace of Hanning.

27
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,880
Do you think taking him back
to the Palace of Hanning is

28
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,120
safer than staying here with me?

29
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,400
(He already knew it.)

30
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,720
Or

31
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,080
have you never trusted me?

32
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,960
I just want you to be well.

33
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't want my trust

34
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,640
become the reason you die.

35
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,600
Yuwen Yuan,

36
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,240
don't tempt me again.

37
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,080
Push me away if you dare.

38
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,280
This time,

39
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,040
I will not let you go

40
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,520
no matter what you say.

41
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,740
(Palace of Jingcheng)

42
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,260
How much of Duke of Lu's intention
to defect is

43
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,000
true and false?

44
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,680
Duke of Lu is

45
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,240
an opportunist known for
his eloquence in the court.

46
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,680
We cannot rule out the possibility
that he is testing us.

47
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,360
However...

48
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,520
What is it?

49
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,760
However, there are countless rebels
outside the city.

50
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,640
He has a number of elite soldiers
under his command.

51
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,360
If he allies with us,

52
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,080
the advantages outweigh
the disadvantages.

53
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,680
Besides, it's written in this letter

54
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,480
that he has sent his daughter
to the palace as a hostage

55
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,920
to prove his dedication.

56
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,120
Duke of Lu has made a big move.

57
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
What about his daughter?

58
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,960
Since he wants to set up a stage
for a play,

59
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,080
we'll play along

60
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,960
and see what he has hidden up his sleeve.

61
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,040
Keep an eye on him.

62
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,200
Keep me informed.

63
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,080
Got it.

64
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,120
Your Majesty, she is here.

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
Your Majesty,

66
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,960
it's been a while.

67
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,080
Ruyu,

68
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,880
I never expect your honey trap

69
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,200
would hit a snag one day.

70
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,240
People make mistakes,
just as horses trod into rabbit holes.

71
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,120
Now that I've come back,

72
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,000
I will to take revenge
for the humiliation of that day.

73
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,960
Ruyu,

74
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,120
I think you will

75
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,400
never have the chance again.

76
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,880
At that time,

77
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,560
you shouldn't have bullied Yan.

78
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,400
Yan

79
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,800
is my only empress.

80
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,680
Meng Chuang.

81
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,560
I'm here.

82
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,200
Tell Duke of Lu

83
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,820
that Ye Ruyu was murdered by
the Prince of Nanchuan.

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,640
Send him my condolences.

85
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

86
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
My Ruyu.

87
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,560
My... My Ruyu.

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,680
Yuwen Yuan,

89
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,920
I will make you

90
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,040
pay for this with blood.

91
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,080
Last night,

92
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,760
Meng Chuang met Duke of Lu

93
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,120
and Ye Ruyu is dead.

94
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,640
Is it possible

95
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,960
that Meng Chuang already intends to rebel

96
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,880
and wants to join the rebel army
to assassinate His Majesty?

97
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,240
Chu Li, you're still too young.

98
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,240
Meng Chuang is known in court
for his loyalty.

99
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,200
His family has served the emperors
for generations.

100
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,880
If it weren't for Yuwen Yingren's command,
do you think

101
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,640
he would meet with the Duke of Lu

102
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,560
at this time?

103
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,640
You mean...

104
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,200
He wants others to kill for him.

105
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,400
He's taking advantage of
the Duke of Lu's pain

106
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,640
and drive him to take desperate actions.

107
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,000
Why?

108
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,600
We guarded the southern border for years.

109
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,560
We killed countless enemies.

110
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,000
We led the army to save the imperial city
when it was in trouble.

111
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,000
We gave our all for the Great Yu,

112
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,800
but that hateful emperor

113
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,600
wants to give us death.

114
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,600
This is so unreasonable.

115
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,680
Chu Li.

116
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,760
Chu Li.

117
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,160
Hide the bow after the bird is shot.

118
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,560
Cook the hunting dog
after the rabbit is caught.

119
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,640
No.

120
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,000
This is the way the world works.

121
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
No, it's not.

122
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,920
As a subject

123
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,800
to a monarch,

124
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,120
one thing you shouldn't do is

125
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,760
overshadow your master.

126
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,520
No, that's just unreasonable.

127
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,680
This is illogical.

128
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,640
Your Highness,

129
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,200
are you going to just accept it?

130
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,200
We gave our all for the Great Yu.

131
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,000
How are we inferior

132
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
to that Yuwen Yingren who can only talk?

133
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,880
He is unkind to us.

134
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,600
Why should we care about him
as the monarch?

135
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,320
There is more to this world than just
getting rid of someone useful.

136
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,000
There are also uprisings

137
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,720
and a time for calls to arms.

138
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,800
What did you say?

139
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,760
Your Highness.

140
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,520
What the people once did,

141
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,960
is what everyone will do again.

142
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,480
I am willing to give you
my life in servitude,

143
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,960
not even death can stop me.

144
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,720
Shut up.

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,040
Chu Li.

146
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,920
Who taught you that?

147
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,520
How dare you say something so treacherous
that could get your entire family killed?

148
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,800
I am a member of the Great Yu.

149
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,520
From the moment I hold a sword,

150
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,800
I swore

151
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,920
that I would never

152
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,640
point it at my kingdom.

153
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,880
But you cannot sit by and do nothing,

154
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,280
Your Highness.

155
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,280
This battle

156
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,200
is inevitable.

157
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,880
This dispute is between me
and Yuwen Yingren.

158
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,240
This has nothing to do with Yan
and the others.

159
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,400
They shouldn't get involved.

160
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,440
Tonight, you must send

161
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
Yuwen Cheng'an out of the palace.

162
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,280
Why?

163
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,240
Because the blood of the Yuwen family
also flows in him.
