When you marry, don't pick a scholar.

Oh, you can't marry someone
with a meager income either.

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,080
His Highness said

27
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,640
girls mustn't marry someone
who can't afford rouge,  face powder,

28
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,680
clothes, and dresses.

These are

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,320
Thank you.

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,480
Zhilan,

35
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,960
when you reach the south,

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,280
the Nanchuan Army will meet you.

37
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,800
After everything has settled down,

38
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,080
I'll come pick you up.

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,760
Okay.

40
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,560
The Nanchuan Army has rebelled,
kill on sight.

41
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,000
Chu Li, are you afraid?

42
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,000
Afraid?

43
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,920
What's there to be afraid of?

44
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,560
You know I'm never afraid to die,
Your Highness.

45
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,640
What a reckless man.

46
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,760
When you have someone you want to protect,

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,800
you'll know what fear is.

48
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,960
Are you stopping me, General Chu?

49
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,040
I'll escort you.

50
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,200
(Zhilan, I'm leaving Cheng to you.)

51
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,640

You insolent man.

52
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,320
I will cut off your head today

53
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,960
and grind your bones into ashes

54
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,240
to appease Ruyu's spirit.

Yan.

69
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,160
You came.

70
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,520
Yan,

71
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,600
what are you doing?

72
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,600
Open the palace gate.

73
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,400
Open the palace gate?

74
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,480
Do you know what the consequences will be?

75
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,720
Of course, I do.

76
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,040
Opening the palace gate

77
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,160
means to surrender.

78
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,080
But this could give the Nanchuan Army
outside the palace a chance to rest.

79
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,840
Without Chu Li here,
the Nanchuan Army cannot be transferred.

80
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,960
But if only for just a moment,

81
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,480
whether Yuwen Yuan wants
to desert or retreat,

82
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,600
he would still have a chance to survive
given his abilities.

83
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,760
What if I won't allow it?

84
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,600
You are seriously ill, Your Majesty.

85
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,880
I have the right

86
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,400
to take charge of the palace.

87
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,200
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

88
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,840
The Nanchuan Army
has escorted Cheng out of the palace.

89
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,920
He will be fine.

90
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,840
After the palace gate is opened,

91
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,400
I will stay by your side

92
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,840
no matter the consequences.

93
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,920
Yan.

94
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,160
Are you threatening me with Cheng's life?

95
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,480
I know this is very selfish of me

96
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,640
but I cannot watch him die.

97
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,920
I betrayed him.

98
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,600
I hurt him.

99
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,720
I even provoked him.

100
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,760
I got him involved in this cruel dispute.

101
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,360
But as long as he survives,

102
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,520
he will protect the kingdom.
He will be useful, Your Majesty.

103
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,600
I understand

104
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,400
that once I entered the palace,

105
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,160
things are impossible

106
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,760
between him and me in this life.

107
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,720
I have nothing else

108
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,160
but to use my life

109
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,840
to repay you, my brother-in-law,
for taking care of me,

110
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,600
and to appease my sister's spirit.

111
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,400
When faced with life or death,

112
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,720
I will never let Your Majesty
face it alone.

113
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,280
I only beg

114
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,520
that you spare his life.

115
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,960
Yan,

116
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,920
we've been together for so long.

117
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,520
This is the first time

118
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,480
I realized that you have
such a stubborn personality.

119
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,600
Go fetch the wine from the side chamber.

120
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,280
Let's have a drink

121
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,520
as farewell in this life.

122
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,640
After the wine,

123
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,600
I will order for the palace gate
to be opened.

124
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,840
Will that do?

125
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

126
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,000
Su Yan,

127
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,720
how much do you love him?

128
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,080
Your Majesty.

129
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,560
If you truly loved him,
you should kill me.

130
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Do you know

131
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
that everything you sent me

132
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,440
was never tested for poison?

133
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,240

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,360
Yan,

135
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,840
