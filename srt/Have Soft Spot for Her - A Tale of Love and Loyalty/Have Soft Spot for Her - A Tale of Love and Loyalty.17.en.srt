(Tianyu Gate)
Yuan, you're still alive.

24
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,060
Good, come and read

25
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,820
the edict I've written for you.

26
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,700
You won't read it?

27
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,980
Since you won't read it,

28
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,900
then I will read it for you myself.

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,310
(Imperial Edict)

30
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,420
By the order of the emperor,

31
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,900
the Prince of Nanchuan, Yuwen Yuan,

32
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,860
has quelled the rebellion
in the imperial city

33
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,180
and should be rewarded.

34
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,380
However, he is ambitious,

35
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,420
greedy and arrogant.

36
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,060
He commanded the Nanchuan Army
to besiege the city for days,

37
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,940
snatch the empress,

38
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,260
and disregard the laws.

39
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,660
Therefore, Yuwen Yuan is stripped
of the title of the Prince of Nanchuan

40
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,380
and his military power taken back.
He is to be confined in his palace

41
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,060
to await further punishment.

42
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,460
Prince of Nanchuan.

43
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,220
No...

44
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,300
The convict, Yuwen Yuan.

45
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,660
Kneel

46
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,100
and accept this edict.

47
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,060
Yuwen Yuan.

48
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,780
What are you doing?

49
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,100
Do you want to disobey the edict?

50
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,020
I believe

51
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,460
that is very obvious.

52
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,220
Yuwen Yuan,

53
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,100
you've exerted all your energy

54
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,180
resisting the Duke of Lu's attack.

55
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,100
Do you think

56
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,620
you can survive multiple attacks

57
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,380
in one piece?

58
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,580
Yingren,

59
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,740
did you think I would run away?

60
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,140
Yuwen Yuan,

61
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:34,140
are you really trying
to get yourself convicted for treason?

62
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,060
You knew I wouldn't betray the Great Yu,

63
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,740
or commit regicide to seize power.

64
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,700
If you want me dead,

65
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,740
you could bestow me poisoned wine.

66
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,220
Or command these soldiers
to fire thousands of arrows at once.

67
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,140
But you did nothing at all.

68
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,300
Instead, you used the rebel army
to attack the city without hesitation,

69
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,500
in order to lure me into this game.

70
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,900
You instigated the Duke of Lu

71
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,300
to attack me.

72
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,660
You want my death

73
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,820
to have nothing to do with you.

74
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,740
Now that my army is at your doorstep,

75
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,700
you're doing everything you can

76
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,980
to incite a civil war,

77
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,260
so you can rightfully get rid of me.

78
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,100
If you would grace me with a burial,

79
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,860
perhaps

80
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,500
you will go down in history

81
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,980
as a benevolent and wise emperor.

82
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,740
Yuwen Yingren,

83
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,660
this kingdom of Great Yu
has come to an end

84
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,900
under your rule.

85
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:08,700
Good. Good. Good!

86
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,420
Yuwen Yuan,

87
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,980
so what if you've seen through me?

88
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,580
This stage has been set.

89
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,460
You will have to play along

90
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,140
whether you want to or not.

91
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,900
And if I don't?

92
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,500
Yuwen Yuan,

93
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,380
I've prepared the opening act for you.

94
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,980
I'm sure you will like it.

95
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,820
What are you planning?

96
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,900
Yan.

97
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,220
You seem very satisfied with it.

98
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,940
Yan.

99
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,820
Yan.

100
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:16,420
I'm sorry.
I got you into trouble this time.

101
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,580
When your letter to me
didn't get intercepted,

102
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,460
I knew it would turn out like this.

103
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,340
I just wanted to see you,

104
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,060
so I came.

105
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,540
Actually,

106
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,060
I've sent spies to the south
to gather information on you

107
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,260
over the last five years.

108
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,540
Every time you go into battle,

109
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,300
I'd feel scared but also relieved.

110
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,300
Every time you go on an expedition,

111
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,540
I'd wonder if you're safe.

112
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,580
Fortunately,

113
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:35,180
you finally became the person
you aspired to become.

114
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,300
You're the god of war
who protects your family and kingdom.

115
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,420
You finally brought me reassurance.

116
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,820
I know.

117
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,940
I've always known.

118
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,540
But I wasn't really that reassured.

119
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,620
Talks about impeachment in the court
are difficult to endure.

120
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,460
The lives of those who overshadow
their masters never end well.

121
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,540
I wrote you letters,

122
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,940
(Yuan)
but I don't know how to sign it off.

123
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,140
But if I don't sign it,

124
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,620
you might think

125
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,740
that I'm using my position
to give you orders.

126
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,940
I won't.

127
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,460
But if I sign off as Su Yan,

128
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,420
how can I use my maiden name

129
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,580
to write you letters
after entering the palace

130
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,780
and make you think of me?

131
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,140
If I don't sign anything,

132
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,260
you might not even read it. Am I right?

133
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,420
In the end,
I never send any of the letters.

134
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:22,180
But still, I got you involved.

135
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,740
Do you know how much I love you?

136
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,380
Why have you never asked me?

137
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,180
You would always tell me,

138
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,500
"Su Yan, don't you know
how much I love you?"

139
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,580
It's not too late to tell me now.

140
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,460
When it comes to my love for you...

141
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,420
Yuwen Yuan,

142
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,580
even if you aren't willing,

143
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,220
I want to marry you in our next life.

144
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,020
- Okay.
- The Prince of Nanchuan, Yuwen Yuan,

145
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,900
is stripped of his military power
for raising his own army.

146
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,860
He is to be executed on the spot.

147
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,620
Release the arrows.

148
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,380
Yan,

149
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,580
are you afraid?

150
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,660
With you by my side,

151
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,620
