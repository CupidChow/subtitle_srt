Cheng, are you tired today?

24
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,700
You...

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,360
How could you use Mother's favorite jade cup?

26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,280
Cheng.

27
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,480
If you like it, just use it.

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,520
Did he send this to you as a gift?

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,940
You bad!

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,200
Cheng, all visitors are our guests.
Behave yourself.

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,440
All visitors are guests?

32
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,280
I'd like to see

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,640
how Your Majesty will treat your guest.

34
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,360
It's a little late today.

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,800
Tomorrow, I'll come to visit you in person.

36
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,200
In front of this kid,

37
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,120
do you still want to hold onto
your last decency?

38
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,520
Unfortunately,

39
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,520
I'm not going anywhere today.

40
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,240
I'll sleep here.

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,160
You can't sleep here. Even Father has not...

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,960
Cheng,

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,520
don't be so rude to Uncle Yuan.

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,080
Do you dare to say that again?

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,920
He's just a kid.

46
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,000
You're a generous man.
I believe you'll let that pass.

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,720
Why don't I know that I'm generous?

48
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,520
Your Majesty, do you know me well?

49
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,640
Everyone knows that.

50
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,160
Prince of Nanchuan treats
his subordinates kindly.

51
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,180
So he will also forgive
a child's immature behavior.

52
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
Your Majesty, you're still like
as you were before.

53
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,680
When you need me,
you coax me with sweet words.

54
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,320
When you don't,

55
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,300
you never hesitate to kick me out of the way.

56
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,680
Your Majesty, you've been sleeping
with someone else's son every night.

57
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,720
Aren't you afraid of the gossip?

58
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,720
He's still young. The Palace is volatile.

59
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,480
That's why I keep him by my side.

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,600
The Nanchuan Army of mine
is defending the Palace.

61
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,920
Which part of here is volatile?

62
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,040
Besides, even if he's young, he's still a male.

63
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,040
According to the rites, princes shan't sleep
with their birth mother since three.

64
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,080
Let alone you're not.

65
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,800
Zhilan.

66
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,280
Take Cheng to his palace.

67
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

68
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,840
Mother, I'm not going.

69
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,800
I can't let him bully you.

70
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,280
Go back to your own palace.

71
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,500
Turns out, you like to be
someone else's stepmother, Your Majesty.

72
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,760
Could you tell me

73
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,080
what you would be like

74
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,320
in front of Yuwen Yingren?

75
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,600
A virtuous wife?

76
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,720
How you treated him before,

77
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,180
and you should treat me
the same way tonight.

78
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,720
What's the matter?

79
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,600
Do you want to get in my way, General Chu?

80
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,380
I...

81
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,840
I'll see you out.

82
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,520
What are you waiting for?

83
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,220
Don't you know how to undress me?

84
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,000
Like this.

85
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,440
Untie it.

86
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,400
You're good at feigning, Your Majesty.

87
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,840
It must be your soft and shy look now

88
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,040
that seduces Yuwen Yingren
to make you his empress.

89
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,720
Your Highness, the water might get cold.

90
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,720
I heard today

91
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,080
you went out of the Palace
to execute Prince Yu's remnants.

92
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,320
Having swung the swords many times,

93
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,240
you must feel a little tired.

94
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,280
I remember

95
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,120
bathing hot water

96
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,640
and massaging in a specific way

97
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,280
will help relieve the muscle soreness
you may feel the next day.

98
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,640
You're the one who taught me this method...

99
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,600
Your Majesty, you've got a good memory.

100
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,600
You even remember this kind of trifle.

101
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,120
Go. Ask Chu Li to bring me the drink.

102
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,400
Alright.

103
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,720
Change your clothes.

104
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,240
Alright.

105
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,440
(What took His Highness so long today?)

106
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,520
His Highness cannot sleep
without drinking.

107
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,440
The liquor may harm his health.

108
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,600
Please persuade him to drink less.

109
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,400
I will.

110
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,840
Wait a second.

111
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,760
He doesn't listen to us.

112
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,040
If we talk too much, things never go well.

113
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,560
Your Majesty, you're different
from us apparently.

114
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,120
What were you talking with him?

115
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Chu Li says the liquor
is harmful to your health,

116
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,640
and asks me to let you not drink much.

117
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,160
Your Majesty, you're truly
a benevolent empress.

118
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,440
You even know the name of a small soldier.

119
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,040
This must also be sent by Yuwen Yingren.

120
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,640
Kept underneath your pillow,

121
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,280
sleep with it, and look at it everyday.

122
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,120
No.

123
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,360
It's the amulet my sister gave me
before she passed away.

124
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,800
Looking at it will make me feel relieved.

125
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,400
Will this poor thing keep you safe?

126
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,240
Can it shield you from a blade or a spear?

127
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,600
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

128
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,360
Living in the Palace,

129
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
I suppose I won't get in danger.

130
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,240
But you and the Nanchuan Army

131
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,240
have been involved in fights and war.

132
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,920
Maybe this amulet will help protect you.

133
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,860
Your Majesty, you do know planning well.

134
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,160
Giving me this inferior thing randomly

135
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,680
to make the whole Nanchuan Army
fight for you?

136
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,400
That's not what I mean.

137
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,520
I'm sincerely grateful for your coming.

138
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,420
The drink has been placed there for so long.

139
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
What are you waiting for, Your Majesty?

140
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,240
If you're grateful,

141
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,720
show your gratitude with action.

142
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,720
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

143
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,080
I'm sorry.

144
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,160
What? If you're grateful,
won't you let me touch you once?

145
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,840
Kiss me.

146
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,400
You kiss me now,

147
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,400
or I'll have someone get that brat here

148
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,720
to watch you kissing me.

149
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,400
Which one do you prefer, Your Majesty?

150
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,440
Are you worrying about him again?

151
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,540
You're being such a good stepmother,
Your Majesty.

152
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,360
Without him,

153
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,840
you'll never get to become
the Empress Dowager.

154
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,000
I suppose, for him,

155
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,520
you're willing to do anything. Am I right?
