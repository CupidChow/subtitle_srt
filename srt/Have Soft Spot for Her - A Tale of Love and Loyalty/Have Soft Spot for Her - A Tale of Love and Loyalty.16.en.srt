23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,400
Yan.

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,040
On the day Prince Chen and Prince Yu's
rebel armies besieged the palace,

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,920
the reason you held on

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,080
was not because of that letter for aid

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,720
but rather

28
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,880
because of your trust in that man.

29
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,200
You thought everything would be safe

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,240
once he came.

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,760
However, Yan,

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,400
I'm afraid

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,000
you will not have things
go your way this time.

34
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,440
Yuan?

35
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,600
Yuan.

36
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,720
Yuwen Yingren?

37
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,440
Yan, you're awake.

38
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,000
Yuwen Yingren, why?

39
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,040
He saved you.

40
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,360
On the day the imperial city was breached,

41
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,880
we would have been killed

42
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,920
by the rebels if it hadn't been for him.

43
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,040
But now you're working
with the rebels to kill him.

44
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,080
Yuwen Yingren, have you gone insane?

45
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,600
Gratitude? Brother?

46
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,880
He is my brother,

47
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,320
but he covets my throne.

48
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,040
He is my brother,

49
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,840
but he wants my woman.

50
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,360
He is my brother,

51
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,360
but he insults me in public.

52
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,800
He is my brother,

53
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,520
but now he is holding me hostage
to control others.

54
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,400
Yan.

55
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,680
I am the emperor,

56
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,960
yet I am also a commoner.

57
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,560
Do you know

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
why I didn't go
to the Palace of Xuyang that night?

59
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,920
I know

60
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,240
Yuwen Yuan loves you deeply

61
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,360
but he cannot have you.

62
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,640
He came because of you.

63
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,720
You begged him
to protect the imperial city

64
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,440
and in return,

65
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,480
you allowed him to sleep in your arms.

66
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,040
You're insane.

67
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,280
Yes, I was wrong.

68
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,040
I failed to protect you.

69
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,720
I was wrong.

70
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,880
But it's fine.

71
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,760
Soon, the Duke of Lu

72
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,880
will cut off his head.

73
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,120
And I will cut his corpse into pieces

74
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,260
to make amends for you.

75
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,260
No.

76
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,600
Yuwen Yingren,

77
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,720
it was all my own doing.

78
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,760
I owed it to him.

79
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,260
You cannot kill him.

80
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,320
He came back to protect
the kingdom of Great Yu,

81
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,440
not for me.

82
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,820
Besides, the Duke of Lu

83
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,560
is cunning and treacherous.

84
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,040
Conspiring with him is
just like conspiring with a liar.

85
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,600
With the kingdom being unstable as it is,

86
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,840
everyone in the imperial court
is wary of the Nanchuan Army.

87
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,760
If something happens to Yuwen Yuan,

88
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,520
the Nanchuan Army will rebel.

89
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,080
You cannot kill him.

90
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,560
For the Great Yu?

91
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,680
Yes, for the Great Yu.

92
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,960
He is here to snatch my things.

93
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,640
He is here to snatch you away.

94
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,720
Oh yes, Yan.

95
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,120
When I was still the crown prince,

96
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,440
my heart has fallen for you

97
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,320
but I was still powerless then.

98
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,960
I couldn't marry
the daughter of a concubine.

99
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,040
That's why I married Wan

100
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,200
to rope in Chancellor Su.

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,440
But that was far from enough.

102
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,480
Chancellor Su alone

103
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,760
cannot help me win the throne
from other heirs.

104
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,600
While we were all at a stalemate,

105
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,200
the Duke of Lu approached me

106
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,040
and offered

107
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,360
to help me ascend the throne

108
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,960
but on one condition.

109
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,840
After I ascend the throne,

110
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,720
I will marry his daughter
and she will become my empress.

111
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,400
Your Highness, it sounds like

112
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
you are willing to accept
the Duke of Lu's help.

113
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,440
Tell me.

114
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,480
What condition does he have?

115
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,240
It's nothing major.

116
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,480
The Duke of Lu has a daughter.

117
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,120
Her name is Ruyu
and has long adored Your Highness.

118
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,840
If Your Highness is willing

119
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,040
to marry the daughter of the Duke of Lu,

120
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,000
this cooperation
will surely proceed smoothly.

121
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,120
I'm afraid the Duke of Lu is confused.

122
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,880
I am already married.

123
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,560
I heard that your first wife,
Su Wan, has been ill for years.

124
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,520
I'm sure it is normal for her to die

125
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,600
if her illness goes untreated.

126
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,720
You're an intelligent person,
Your Highness.

127
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,960
You should understand what I mean.

128
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,540
Su Wan is my wedded wife.

129
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,760
She wholeheartedly

130
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,560
stood by me through thick and thin,

131
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
and never did anything wrong.

132
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,000
I will never hurt her.

133
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,920
Your Highness,

134
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,840
I'm sure you
can weigh the importance

135
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,080
of a momentary responsibility
against a lifetime of power.

136
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,160
If you insist on this,

137
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,720
I'm afraid the Duke of Lu
will not let this go easily

138
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,640
due to his love for his daughter.

139
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,480
Your Highness should know that soft-heartedness
stands in the way of great accomplishments.

140
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,920
If you can't hold onto the kingdom,

141
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,320
how could you talk about

142
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,240
protecting your wife
and your infant child?

143
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,560
We await good news from you,
Your Highness.

144
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,720
Wan knew about my plan.

145
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,960
She understood my decision.

146
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,880
She loved me.

147
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,880
In the end,

148
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,920
I did betray her this time.

149
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,920
So,

150
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,480
my sister died
because of your selfish hypocrisy.

151
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,280
Yuwen Yingren, you killed her.

152
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,320
I didn't.

153
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,540
I didn't kill her.

154
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,520
Wan loved me.

155
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,240
She willingly died for me.

156
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,360
I treated her well, too.

157
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,480
I buried her
with the honors of an empress.

158
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,480
The entire city mourned
and paid homage to her.

159
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,920
I am sure

160
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,240
Wan would have no regrets.

161
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,000
My sister

162
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,960
loved you so much.

163
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,960
She did everything for you.

164
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,000
Up until the moment she died,

165
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,000
she never asked for your love.

166
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,860
She only thought
about uniting the kingdom for you.

167
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,660
What about you?

168
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,280
You made use of her love for you.

169
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,540
You used her life
to pave the way for your ambition.

170
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,520
Yuwen Yingren,

171
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,360
you're a lunatic.

172
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,600
I have gone insane.

173
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,120
I am insane.

174
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,280
For you,

175
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,920
I can do whatever it takes.

176
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,280
For me?

177
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,240
You're only doing this
for your own ambition.

178
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,960
No, no. Yan.

179
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,280
That five-year agreement,

180
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,160
I didn't just get to know about it.

181
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,840
What do you mean?

182
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,360
I knew you would eventually leave.

183
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,880
You want to find your sweetheart.

184
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,320
But I...

185
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,240
Must I really let you go?

186
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,640
Incite chaos in the imperial court.

187
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,720
Instigate the rebels.

188
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,480
Provoke the Prince of Nanchuan
to seize the throne for love.

189
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,540
I sent a letter for aid
to the Prince of Nanchuan.

190
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,160
If an army of 8000
cannot defend the imperial city,

191
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,960
then I will not spare his entire family.

192
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,360
The only choice to make is

193
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,960
how to die and for whom.

194
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
So,

195
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,540
you knew he would come.

196
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,320
Did you have all this planned out?

197
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,540
The Prince of Nanchuan

198
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,660
has been coveting my throne
for a long time.

199
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,480
He would commit regicide to seize power.

200
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,180
But I've prepared for this.

201
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,200
I worked with Duke of Lu to capture him,

202
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,660
seize his military power,

203
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,560
and have the Prince of Nanchuan beheaded.

204
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,440
Only then will this dispute
for the throne end.

205
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,240
Yan, Yan.

206
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,720
What do you think
of my performance in this play?

207
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,880
The Prince of Nanchuan commands
a huge army in the south.

208
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,160
I took advantage of the chaos
to lure him here

209
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,720
and solve all my problems.

210
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,540
I made you forget him

211
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,480
and he solved the crisis for me.

212
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,200
I accomplished two things at once.

213
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,360
For your own selfish gain,

214
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,800
you disregarded the lives
of the people and the soldiers.

215
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,360
Yuwen Yingren,

216
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,640
you disgust me.

217
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,080
Disgust?

218
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,000
Everything I've done was for you.

219
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,680
If their blood

220
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,880
is on my hands,

221
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,840
then it's on yours too.

222
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,880
Yan, I love you.

223
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,640
- You've really gone insane. Let me go.
- You're my woman.

224
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,040
You're the only empress of the Great Yu.

225
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,120
Let me go.

226
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,000
Where are you going?

227
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,480
Where will you run off to?

228
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,560
Are you going to find your Yuwen Yuan?

229
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,800
You will stay by my side
for the rest of your life.

230
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,080
You're my woman.

231
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,240
You're not going anywhere.

232
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,080
I'd rather die

233
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,160
than be with you.

234
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,000
Fine.

235
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,880
Yan,

236
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,680
you're not afraid of death.

237
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,080
But aren't you afraid
Yuwen Yuan would die?

238
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,000
Yuwen Yingren,

239
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,880
what are you planning?

240
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,360
I stand in front of you

241
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,680
but you only have him in your mind.

242
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,640
Even though I'm right in front of you,
all you can think about is him.

243
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,000
For five years,

244
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,640
I gave you the best of everything
in this world.

245
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,960
Yuwen Yingren,
what are you planning to do?

246
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,720
I respected your wishes
and never forced myself on you.

247
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,880
But you only have him in your mind,

248
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,800
only Yuwen Yuan, who humiliated you
in every possible way.

249
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,720
Why? Why?

250
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,720
Why?

251
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
No.

252
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,920
Yan.

253
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:58,320
Help me one more time. One last time.
