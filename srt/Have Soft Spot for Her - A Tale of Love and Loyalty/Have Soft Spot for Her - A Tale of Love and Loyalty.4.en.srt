Were you the first person who intruded
on the imperial harem yesterday?

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,680
Fetch me a knife.

25
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,280
Give me a dull one.

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,320
How dare you torture a feudal lord
and slaughter your cousin!

27
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,640
Do you really mean to bend the law
despite losing your reputation?

28
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,360
I'm afraid you forget

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,400
I do not

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,760
have a good reputation.

31
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,640
You really deserve to die.

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,520
My hands get dirty because of you.

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,646
Your Majesty, do you have something
to say to me?

34
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
Yuan says

35
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,200
he wants you.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.
It's all my fault.

37
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,200
Yan, what fault have you done?

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,640
For writing to the Prince of Nanchuan
to put down the rebel army?

39
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,720
Or for protecting the child
who's not your blood?

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,800
Yan, I decreed you entered the Palace

41
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,120
without your permission.

42
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,520
It was my fault.

43
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,880
My birth mother passed away
when I was little,

44
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,040
and I'm the daughter of a concubine.

45
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,320
So my life in the Chancellor's mansion
was like walking a tightrope.

46
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,040
If it weren't for Wan's protection,

47
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,800
I'm afraid
I wouldn't be able to live today.

48
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,200
Wan is also

49
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,280
concerned about me, and that's why...

50
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,880
The imperial doctor said

51
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,240
Wan has been weak
since the beginning.

52
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,880
Yan, do not take all the blame

53
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,480
on yourself alone.

54
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,160
When you decided to enter the Palace,

55
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,080
did you give up on him on your own wish?

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,240
Alright.

57
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
It's about time.

58
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,520
Cheng would be looking for you.

59
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,160
Pray excuse me, Your Majesty.

60
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,440
Your Majesty, Ye Ruyu,
the daughter of Duke of Lu,

61
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,480
has entered the Palace today.

62
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,960
Yan,

63
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
if Ye Ruyu gives you a hard time...

64
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,360
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

65
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,160
I can deal with her.

66
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,360
Your Majesty.

67
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,200
(Imperial Guard. Meng Chuang)
Her Majesty has such a noble character,

68
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,480
never letting you worry about her.

69
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,040
I'd rather

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,560
she throws tantrums
in front of me sometimes.

71
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
Yan, it won't take too long

72
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,240
before everything comes to an end.

73
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,920
Cheng, what do you want to eat today?

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,880
Yes. I will think about it.

75
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,420
(Legitimate Daughter of Duke of Lu.
Ye Ruyu)

76
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,920
Greetings to you, Yan.

77
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,400
Zhilan,

78
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,760
take Cheng back to the Palace of Xuyang.

79
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,320
Ruyu, what brings you
to the Palace of Hanning today?

80
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,640
This is only a humble abode.

81
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,680
It's not as comfortable as the mansion
built for you by Duke of Lu.

82
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,840
Yan, you're as eloquent
as you always are.

83
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,080
Yet, Yan,

84
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,800
except for your title of the empress,

85
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,080
what else do you have?

86
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,640
You're right.

87
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,800
But it's already enough.

88
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,040
You haven't attempted
to send me away today.

89
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,720
This generosity truly makes me nervous.

90
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,600
What?

91
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,160
Have you done anything wrong to me again?

92
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,160
If not,

93
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,160
don't keep talking so ambiguously.

94
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,200
That makes you look low.

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,880
You...

96
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,040
(Why did he come?)

97
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,480
What wind is blowing?

98
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,960
Even the beloved daughter of Duke of Lu
has been blown into the Imperial City.

99
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,760
(Prince of Nanchuan holds sway
in part of the realm,)

100
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,320
(leading a great army in the south.)

101
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,760
(If we can win him over,)

102
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,880
(we'll be able to accomplish
the undertaking.)

103
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,840
Greetings to you, Your Highness.

104
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,800
If I recall it correctly,

105
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,600
Duke of Lu is just like the rebel army,

106
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,800
staring at the vermillion glazed tiles
outside of the Palace.

107
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,840
Father sent me here
to look for a wise ruler

108
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,920
who could secure the prosperity
of the Duke of Lu's mansion.

109
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,480
So?

110
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,440
Now, the realm
is facing a volatile situation.

111
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,100
Feudal lords in every region are plotting,

112
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,760
eyeing the power.

113
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,920
The Nanchuan Army is formidable
on the battlefield.

114
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,520
Your Highness, you're a tactic guru,

115
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,720
while Yuwen Yingren is only a dying person.

116
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,960
The tide has turned.

117
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,080
The new ruler of the realm, of course,
is you, Your Highness.

118
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,200
But with the Nanchuan Army alone,

119
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,440
I'm afraid you'll find it hard
to break out under siege of feudal lords.

120
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,160
In that case, you can just
reap the benefits

121
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,520
until both the Nanchuan Army
and the feudal lords suffer damage

122
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,760
after we fought fiercely against
each other.

123
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,800
Isn't that better?

124
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,760
Taking power means nothing.

125
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,920
Being able to hold power
reveals one's true feats.

126
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,600
So, do you mean,

127
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,440
Duke of Lu is willing to help me
seize the throne,

128
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,560
just for their prosperity?

129
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,360
Is there such a low-hanging fruit
in this world?

130
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,080
Of course not.

131
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,240
I want to be the Empress.

132
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Since Ms. Ye has something important
to discuss with you,

133
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,640
I'll leave now.

134
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,120
Your Majesty, did you hear that?

135
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,840
Turns out, all women are the same.

136
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,920
They all want to be the Empress.

137
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,600
Your Highness, please don't scare Yan.

138
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,640
His Highness must have been busy working.

139
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,920
I'll go to bring him
a plate of osmanthus cake.

140
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

141
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,040
What are you doing, Your Highness?

142
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,280
Don't you want to be the Empress?

143
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,680
What? Did you regret it?

144
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,960
Someone else is here.

145
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,680
I wish your life would be as joyful

146
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,440
and sweet as this plate of osmanthus cake.

147
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,480
Since you're sending it as a gift,

148
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,720
why do you bow your head in the distance

149
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,040
instead of kneeling to my near side?

150
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,240
Are you looking down upon me?

151
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,840
Do you think I don't know
the etiquette for begging,

152
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,760
so you try to muddle along?

153
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,440
In that case,

154
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,640
I think His Highness wants

155
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,840
to see you kneeling down

156
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,320
and walk here on your knees, right?

157
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,720
Ruyu gets me right.

158
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,800
Since you're begging someone,

159
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,160
you should show your attitude of groveling.

160
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,960
Now I'm sitting here,

161
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,920
so you should kneel, Your Majesty.

162
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,360
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

163
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,920
Is there an iron steel
attached to your knees?

164
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,320
Or, have you been
a privileged person for too long?

165
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,600
When you have to be a plaything
at others' disposal,

166
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,800
do you forget
how to kneel to beg for mercy?

167
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,640
Your Highness, she looks so horrible.

168
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,600
Just a panicked rabbit in the cage.

169
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,640
What are you afraid of?

170
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,920
Your Majesty,

171
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,680
do you need someone
to teach you how to kneel?

172
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,040
Su Yan,

173
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,160
you're no longer the respected Empress,

174
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,400
who is placed on a pedestal.

175
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,480
Please enjoy it, Your Highness.
