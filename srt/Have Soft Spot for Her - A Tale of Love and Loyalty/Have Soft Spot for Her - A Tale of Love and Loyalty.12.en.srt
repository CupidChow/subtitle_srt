=Episode 12=

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,720
Your Majesty, the Nanchuan Army
that surrounded Palace of Xuyang

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,880
has withdrawn.

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,960
Yan.

26
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,200
Your Majesty.

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,840
It's just me.

28
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,680
I wasn't made aware of
your sudden arrival.

29
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,680
It's fine. There were too many
trivial things happening lately.

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,960
I apologize for worrying you.

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,320
Oh, yes.

32
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,480
Where is Cheng?

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,720
Cheng suffered a trauma.

34
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,360
He was squirming even in his dreams.

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,840
It's best if you don't summon him
for now, Your Majesty.

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,280
Yan,

37
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,400
why do you speak as such?

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,560
A young child should live carefree

39
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,480
but he was forced into a dispute

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,920
as a pawn in someone else's struggle
for power.

41
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,440
Yan, do you mean to say

42
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,600
that you know who is the mastermind
behind this assassination?

43
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,600
No.

44
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,400
As you see fit,

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,960
can you help the Imperial Guards

46
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,120
find the mastermind
behind this assassination?

47
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,040
If this mastermind is someone
with high rank and ambition,

48
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,320
what will you do, Your Majesty?

49
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,440
Yan,

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,560
do you mean

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,240
that it's the Prince of Nanchuan?

52
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,640
No, it can't be the Prince of Nanchuan.

53
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,480
Cheng is his nephew.

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,320
The Prince of Nanchuan may be bloodthirsty

55
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,520
and brash,

56
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,620
but he would never raise a weapon
against his own family.

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,840
If he really wants to usurp the throne,

58
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,720
he could have killed me

59
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,520
when he entered the city.

60
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,040
Yan, I know

61
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,400
there is a rift between you
and the Prince of Nanchuan.

62
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,640
But...

63
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,440
Your Majesty.

64
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,440
I never said

65
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,720
that the mastermind is
the Prince of Nanchuan.

66
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,880
Why are you so eager to defend him?

67
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,960
Or do you have something to hide?

68
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,840
Yan, what do you mean?

69
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,800
Your Majesty, you shouldn't have
dragged Cheng into this.

70
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,680
Many things

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,040
in the royal family are insignificant.

72
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,920
When compared to the kingdom,

73
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,000
the jade on the emperor's crown
is just like sand.

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,800
The two are incomparable.

75
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,360
Do you still remember Wan's final wish?

76
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,640
Do you still remember
that Cheng is your son?

77
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,240
How could I forget?

78
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,520
But I...

79
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,040
I would never hurt Cheng.

80
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,560
However, Yan...

81
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,200
I have something to ask you.

82
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,320
Please ask, Your Majesty.

83
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,480
I know

84
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,880
that you and the Prince of Nanchuan
have shared a bond since childhood.

85
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,240
If it weren't for Wan's final wish,

86
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,880
would you have left him
and enter the palace?

87
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,320
I want to ask you.

88
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,240
Have you ever regretted it?

89
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,960
For just one moment,

90
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,840
have you ever thought about
leaving everything behind,

91
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,200
all that you have,

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,720
and going back to his side?

93
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,000
What I have between me and Yuwen Yuan

94
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,760
is already in the past.

95
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,480
Yan.

96
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,800
I really want

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,120
to trust you again,

98
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,000
but the rumors have continued to spread

99
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,480
ever since Yuan returned.

100
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,000
I am sick,

101
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,040
not deaf.

102
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,560
Ever since I entered the palace,

103
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,200
I have put you and Cheng first.

104
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,560
No matter what happens in the future,

105
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,400
I will do everything I can

106
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,720
to protect you and Cheng.

107
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,520
My conscience is clear.

108
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,040
Your conscience is clear?

109
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,960
If you truly did as Wan wished,

110
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,960
then you wouldn't suspect me.

111
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,480
During the previous meal,

112
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,800
Cheng told me

113
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,000
that the last person he saw

114
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,800
before waking up next to
the Prince of Nanchuan was Nanny Li.

115
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,200
If I remember correctly,

116
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,600
Nanny Li works for you.

117
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
If the Nanny Li you mentioned is

118
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,080
the same person I speak of,

119
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,760
then I can dispel your suspicion.

120
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,280
What do you mean?

121
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,120
As soon as Cheng went missing,

122
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,760
I sent everyone in the palace

123
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,640
to investigate all the visitors
to the Palace of Xuyang on that day.

124
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,320
Two hours ago, I was informed

125
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,080
that Nanny Li

126
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,480
vanished without a trace
after Cheng went missing

127
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,200
and cannot be found.

128
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,360
What?

129
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,560
I believe

130
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,480
that before the enemy breached the city,

131
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,360
Nanny Li was already
bribed by the traitors

132
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,120
and was lying in hiding

133
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,520
to use Cheng to sow discord
between us brothers,

134
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,000
so we would fight among ourselves.

135
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,360
That way, they can easily

136
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,240
take us down at the same time.

137
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,200
(If that is the explanation,)

138
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,740
(then it would make sense
for the mastermind to kidnap Cheng.)

139
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,440
(But why do I...)

140
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,560
(Yuwen Yingren,
which part of these words you said)

141
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,080
(is true)

142
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,520
(and false?)

143
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,400
Yan.

144
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,160
You and I have been together
for five years.

145
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,720
Why wouldn't you

146
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,040
believe me for once?

147
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,520
That's fine.

148
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,080
A monarch should be heartless.

149
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,920
It's reasonable for you

150
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,880
not to trust me.

151
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,280
But if Wan is still alive,

152
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,400
I believe we wouldn't
have this conversation.

153
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,380
(Palace of Hanning)

154
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,520
Why does Cheng remember
what happened before he left the palace?

155
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,880
I was negligent.

156
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,360
I didn't watch
Nanny Li gave him the medicine.

157
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,760
Nanny Li was loyal throughout her life.

158
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,640
Her family shares her merit.
Bury them all with honors.

159
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,880
Yes, as you command.

160
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,360
Cheng hasn't had a meal
with me in a while.

161
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,540
Bring him to me.

162
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

163
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,780
(Palace of Hanning)

164
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,400
(The palace is no longer safe.)

165
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,520
(If Cheng stays here,)

166
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,520
(he will be in more danger.)

167
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,120
(No matter what Yuwen Yingren
and Yuwen Yuan are plotting,)

168
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,920
(I should make plans in advance.)

169
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,960
Your Majesty.

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,680
Where is Cheng?

171
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,320
His Majesty sent someone here

172
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,440
to pick up His Highness.

173
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,160
Why didn't you go with him?

174
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,800
His Majesty asked me to stay behind

175
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,280
so I can inform you of His Highness's
whereabouts when you arrive here,

176
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,880
to prevent any unnecessary worry.

177
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,280
Your Majesty, is something wrong?

178
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,600
It's nothing.

179
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,040
Your Majesty?

180
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,540
Yuwen Yingren took Cheng'an away.

181
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,200
Her Majesty has gone
to Yangju Palace Hall.

182
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,360
Su Yan, no matter what you want to do,

183
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,640
I won't let you have your way.

184
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,680
Where are you going?

185
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,520
To watch the show.

186
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,000
To watch the show?

187
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,480
Stop.

188
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,720
Yan.

189
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,000
Mother.

190
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,680
What were you doing, Your Majesty?

191
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,240
Look at him.

192
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,520
Cheng is so naughty.

193
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,400
He got rice on his face

194
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,600
and is still unaware of it.

195
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,280
Cheng's ill manners are

196
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,680
a fault of mine.

197
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,520
Your Majesty is too noble.

198
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,560
Please leave things like this
to me next time.

199
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,520
Cheng is at an age where he gets naughty.

200
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,680
He needs you to discipline him.

201
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,720
Otherwise, how can you
become an emperor in the future?

202
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,600
I don't want to become an emperor.
Father, you're the emperor.

203
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,160
Cheng, what are you saying?

204
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,720
Your Majesty is blessed with vigor,

205
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,800
you will surely recover soon.

206
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,160
Yan,

207
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,480
don't coax me like I am a child.

208
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I know my body.

209
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,320
When the time comes, I hope

210
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
that my brother, Yuan,

211
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,720
can properly guide

212
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,360
this young monarch.

213
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,720
Your Majesty, Cheng is still young.

214
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,360
Do not speak such words
in front of him again.

215
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,760
He will grow up.

216
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,360
He will understand

217
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,040
that life and death are destined,

218
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,760
and that the hearts of the people

219
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,200
should be cherished.

220
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,840
When he becomes a monarch,

221
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,960
he will understand my pain.

222
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,720
Cheng, your father needs to rest.

223
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,640
Come back to the Palace of Hanning with me
and continue your meal.

224
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,560
Is that all right?

225
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,120
Okay.

226
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,320
Yan, why don't the three of us

227
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,440
eat here together?

228
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,200
I usually eat alone.

229
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,440
All delicacies look like cold leftovers

230
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,200
in my eyes.

231
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,960
Are you going

232
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,800
to leave me to eat all alone?

233
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,680
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

234
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,280
Cheng hasn't done his homework in days.

235
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,920
This cannot be delayed.

236
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,360
I will bring him over another day

237
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,840
to have a meal with you.

238
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,640
Yan.

239
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,400
If you don't stay today,

240
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,200
Cheng will never eat again.

241
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,640
Cheng, come.

242
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,520
Come to me.

243
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,960
Why don't we

244
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,520
keep your mother company
and have a meal together as a family?

245
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,040
Okay.

246
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,280
Yan? Yan.

247
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,160
Mother?

248
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
Mother.

249
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,640
Yes, of course.

250
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,340
Cheng, we'll eat here first.

251
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,000
Then, come back to the palace with me.

252
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,360
Here, Cheng. It's your favorite shrimp.

253
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,440
Have another tofu.

254
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,520
