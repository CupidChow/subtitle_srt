23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,880
Chancellor Su's second daughter
is obsessed with the Crown Prince indeed.

24
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,400
Her elder sister just passed away,

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,640
but she's so eager
to marry her brother-in-law.

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,480
Why have I heard

27
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,100
Ms. Su had an engagement
with the Prince of Nanchuan?

28
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,780
(Prince of Nanchuan. Yuwen Yuan)
And she was caught

29
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,920
while eloping with some other man,

30
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,080
so the engagement got annulled?

31
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,280
Exactly. Total disregard for sisterhood.

32
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,080
Pity the Crown Prince
has to remarry her sister.

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,240
She is a wanton woman indeed.

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,320
(Marry another man, Yan.)

35
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,480
(Second Daughter of the Su. Su Yan)

36
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,800
(Second Daughter of the Su. Su Yan)
Your Highness, is it you?

37
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,240
Your Highness, this man
dares to ruin your wedding banquet.

38
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,960
We assure you that he will be arrested.

39
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,660
(Crown Prince. Yuwen Yingren)

40
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,960
Yan, are you waiting for me?

41
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,160
Marrying another man.

42
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,280
Wearing a wedding dress
for Yuwen Yingren.

43
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,240
Are you going to the bridal chamber
with him tonight?

44
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,480
Let go of me, Yuan.

45
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,960
Why are you marrying him?

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,720
Didn't you say
you're getting married to me?

47
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,840
Do you mean that doesn't count anymore?

48
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,760
Yuan.

49
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,520
We're at the Crown Prince's mansion.
Wake up.

50
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,280
Let's make a bet.

51
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,360
You will eventually belong to me.

52
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,480
Yan, you look so pretty in this dress.

53
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,260
But when I think of the fact
that you're wearing it for another man,

54
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,720
all I want is to tear it up.

55
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,720
Yuwen Yingren only has eyes for Su Wan.

56
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,760
Don't worry. He won't touch you.

57
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,520
Just wait for me to pick you up.

58
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,680
And...

59
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Happy Wedding, my little bride.

60
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,760
(I'm sorry, Yuan.)

61
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,720
This is my sister's dying wish.

62
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,360
I don't regret it.

63
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,480
I will take good care of Cheng,

64
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,200
not letting my sister down.

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,960
Alright.

66
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,180
(To Su Yan)

67
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,080
(Yingren, we both know)

68
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,160
(Yan is the Achilles' heel
of the Prince of Nanchuan.)

69
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,240
(I ask Yan to stay by your side
for five years.)

70
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,560
(In that case, as long as she's with you,)

71
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,000
(the Nanchuan Royal Army)

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,320
(will be the strongest shield
to solidify your reign.)

73
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,800
(If anything unexpected happens
in the future,)

74
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,040
(I think you will know what to do.)

75
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,180
(Ten Days Later)

76
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,600
(If you're reading this letter,)

77
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,360
(that means my soul has ascended
to the ninth heaven.)

78
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,000
(Aging, disease,
and death are inevitable.)

79
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,680
(Yan, please don't be sad.)

80
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,360
(I've been ailing for long
and become prepared for this.)

81
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,600
(But I'm still concerned about Cheng.)

82
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,400
(He's still young,
and doesn't remember me as his mother.)

83
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,980
(The realm is chaotic,)

84
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,760
(Crown Princess. Su Wan
and the Crown Prince is weak.)

85
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,120
(Yingren must be occupied
with the turbulence,)

86
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,080
(so he may have little time
to take care of Cheng.)

87
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,360
(Yan, since childhood,
I've never asked you for anything.)

88
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,720
(Now, I only ask you
for the only and last time.)

89
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,840
(After I'm gone,
take care of Cheng for me.)

90
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,300
(I don't ask you to do that
for your whole life,)

91
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,520
(but spare five years)

92
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,760
(to protect Cheng as he grows up,
until he can write, read,)

93
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,480
(and call me Mom.
To me, that's already enough.)

94
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,480
(Yan, this is my only wish
before I leave this world.)

95
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,240
(I hope you could fulfill it
for the sake of the joy we had.)

96
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,520
(Farewell.)

97
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,860
(Five Years Later; Five years)

98
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,400
(Five Years Later;
after Yuwen Yingren became the Emperor,)

99
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,900
(Duke of Lu schemes with Prince Yu)

100
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,300
Prince Chen is about
to attack the city.

101
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,660
(and Prince Chen to a coup.)
Run now.

102
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,640
(The Imperial City is at stake.)
What about the Empress?

103
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,620
Your life is the most important.

104
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,520
Did you send the letter?

105
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,080
I've asked a reliable eunuch

106
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,860
to send it to the south
as quickly as possible.

107
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,740
(Su Yan's Maid. Zhilan)

108
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,040
Your Majesty, do you think it will work?

109
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,360
Zhilan, you can go now.

110
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,840
What about you?

111
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,480
I've prepared for the worst.

112
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,520
I don't owe myself, or my sister.

113
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,120
Your Majesty,

114
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,240
your five-year agreement
with the Emperor is about to end.

115
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,160
Why do you have to do this?

116
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,380
(Son of the Late Empress, Su Wan.
Yuwen Cheng'an)

117
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,480
Yan,

118
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,440
you've stayed in the palace for too long.

119
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,400
It's time for you to leave.

120
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,720
I know my condition.

121
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,680
It's just that Cheng is still young.

122
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,200
If I die,

123
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,080
you and he
will be unable to deal with those outside.

124
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,520
They crave the throne madly,

125
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,720
and won't care
about the rightful heir and the law.

126
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,960
If I survive,

127
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,640
I can...

128
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,960
I can still stall them
to buy some time for you.

129
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,080
Let them busy dealing with me.

130
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,600
We're already up against the wall.

131
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,240
Your Majesty, I've sent a letter
to the Prince of Nanchuan for help.

132
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,600
He still has an army of his own.

133
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,560
If he...

134
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,960
When did you send the letter?

135
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,280
Seven days ago.

136
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm afraid the Prince of Nanchuan

137
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,440
has no intention to meddle in this.

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,040
