Where is she?

25
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,760
She went to the Palace of Xuyang
to visit the Prince,

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,760
and then to the Yangju Palace Hall
to serve medicine to the Emperor.

27
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,280
You bad man! I'm going to kill you!

28
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,840
Interesting.

29
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,160
Compared with your father,
you're much more courageous.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,920
Let go of me!

31
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Let go of me!

32
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,320
Let go of me!

33
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,260
Let go of me!

34
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,760
Cheng!

35
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,500
Let go of me!

36
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,120
Cheng.

37
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Cheng. Cheng, are you alright?

38
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,280
I'm going to kill you!

39
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,440
Cheng.

40
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,760
Get out of the way.

41
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,040
Your son wants to kill me.

42
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,160
No one is above the law.
A prince is not an exception.

43
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,980
Do you want to cover it up, Your Majesty?

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,440
Cheng.

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,880
It's you. You bullied my mother.

46
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,360
When she visited me this morning,
her eyes were red and swollen.

47
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,640
She must have cried earlier.

48
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,360
Even my father has never made her cry.

49
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,520
If you want to get back at me for your mother,

50
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,760
why are you hiding behind her?

51
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,120
Kill me if you can.

52
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,600
But if you cannot hurt me a little,

53
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,240
I'll take you apart into pieces,

54
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,580
adding them
to your ailing father's medicine.

55
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,520
Your Majesty.

56
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,920
Your Majesty, Prince of Nanchuan
is utterly disgraceful.

57
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,600
Not only did he stay
in Her Majesty's palace in plain sight,

58
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,000
but, but he also almost killed the Prince.

59
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,280
Go.

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,280
Your Majesty, would you like
to summon Her Majesty?

61
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,240
Cheng, who dares to bully your mother
in the Palace?

62
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,440
It's just that I didn't sleep well last night.

63
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,320
You misunderstood Uncle Yuan.

64
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,440
Really?

65
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,520
Yes.

66
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,680
Zhilan, take Cheng to review his learning.

67
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

68
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,680
This knife is too dangerous.

69
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,920
Don't hold it in your hand.

70
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,360
Well?

71
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,840
Do you want to get rid of me like that,
Your Majesty?

72
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,360
As for this thing, it's Cheng's fault.

73
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,720
Did you hurt, Your Highness?

74
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,360
As the Empress,
staring at another lord like that,

75
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,920
what kind of etiquette is it?

76
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,720
I did not.

77
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,680
I just wanted to check if he scratched you.

78
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,520
Cheng has started learning
since he was little.

79
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,160
Working hard to study
and practice martial arts.

80
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,440
Does that count as martial arts?

81
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,440
What rubbish will he learn
from officials in the Palace?

82
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,120
Without a solid grounding,
he dares to wield a weapon.

83
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,880
If he goes to the battlefield,
he will only be hacked to death.

84
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,440
Thank you for your reminder, Your Highness.

85
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,520
Your Majesty, now you're behaving tactfully.

86
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,160
Your Majesty! Your Majesty.

87
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,880
Something happened. His Majesty...

88
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,200
What happened?

89
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,200
He died?

90
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,240
Wait for me to come back.

91
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,900
Just leave as you wish, Your Majesty.

92
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,380
But why should I wait for you?

93
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,960
Your Majesty, what's the matter?

94
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,560
Did you have a relapse?

95
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,600
It doesn't matter.

96
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,960
It's just that my neck

97
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,880
has been getting red and itchy.

98
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,760
Someone has applied unguent for me.

99
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,040
Don't worry about that.

100
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Why would it get red and itchy
without a reason?

101
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,960
Is it because of the medicine?

102
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,360
It cannot be. I have been there
while decocting the medicine.

103
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,480
I will go and check on it once more.

104
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,840
Yan,

105
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,000
you don't have to go. It doesn't matter.

106
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,800
Is it... A sword cut?

107
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,120
The rebel troops are running amok.

108
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,120
What are the things they don't dare to do?

109
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,840
Prince Yu, Prince Chen, and other generals
who attempted to rebel

110
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,320
were tied up and carried
into the imperial hall.

111
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,960
How could they hurt you, Your Majesty?

112
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,560
(Prince of Nanchuan?)

113
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,960
Your Majesty,

114
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,720
I asked him to come here.

115
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,840
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,240
Yan,

117
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,920
it's fine.

118
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,160
I feel a little tired. You can leave here now.

119
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,200
I will find an opportunity
to keep an eye on him.

120
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,600
For now,

121
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,520
how would you let him trust you completely?

122
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,360
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

123
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,560
I will find a way.

124
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,240
Your Majesty, you have been reluctant
to apply medicine these days.

125
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,120
Now I realize you have been waiting
for Her Majesty to do it for you.

126
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,800
Pray excuse me.

127
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,600
Your Majesty.

128
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,600
Get rid of him.

129
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,520
Your Majesty, he has been serving you
for over a decade.

130
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,840
I hate garrulous people. Go.

131
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

132
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,400
Things have come to this far.

133
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,680
