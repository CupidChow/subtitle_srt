Yan, I'll have someone to leave with you
through the side door.

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,360
Be careful. Quickly.

26
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,560
Cheng.

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Mother.

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,600
Cheng, are you well?

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,640
Your Majesty, before the enemies arrive,

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,960
let's go now.

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,520
The enemies in the Palace of Hanning
have been executed.

32
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,120
Your Majesty, you and the Prince
are safe here.

33
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,840
- Your Majesty.
- Thank you.

34
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,440
Please don't do this.

35
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,920
It's you.

36
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,900
(General of Nanchuan. Chu Li)
I'm the general of Nanchuan, Chu Li.

37
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,960
Under the order of the Prince of Nanchuan,
I've come to the rescue.

38
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,320
(Prince of Nanchuan.)

39
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,120
(He really came.)

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,760
Oh. Quite a shindig.

41
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,220
You cunning Prince of Nanchuan!

42
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,920
You ruined all my plans.
I'm going to kill you!

43
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,480
Prince of Nanchuan,
Yuwen Yuan, has come to the rescue.

44
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Prince Yu, Prince Chen.

45
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,780
You dare to conspire to take the throne.

46
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,640
How about I help you kill them all,
Your Majesty?

47
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,120
It's... It is I who was so blind
that I plotted this.

48
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,760
- Your Majesty, please forgive me.
- Your Majesty, please forgive me.

49
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,000
Everyone knows you are a merciful emperor.

50
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,360
You would be reluctant
to kill your related brothers, right?

51
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

52
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,040
Do you remember we played together
when we were young?

53
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,080
Quick.

54
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,000
Do you have no idea of etiquette?

55
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,000
It's inappropriate to kill
in front of the Emperor.

56
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,760
Go.

57
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,360
Take them to the prison.

58
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,800
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

59
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,680
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

60
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,160
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

61
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,120
Your Majesty, since you know
your days are numbered,

62
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,920
have you prepared an inheritance decree?

63
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,680
I'm so curious

64
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,920
if the succession will pass

65
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,880
to the prince who lost his mom
when he was born.

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,120
I doubt if he can sit
on the throne steadily.

67
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,560
Thank you.

68
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,640
Are you so sure I don't want the throne?

69
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,640
If you want it,

70
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,080
you could've entered here

71
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,040
after they killed me and the prince.

72
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,320
Setting things right
will make you more rightful.

73
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,840
Yuwen Yuan.
What exactly do you want?

74
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,280
Your Majesty, you're getting more funny.

75
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,360
Unfortunately,

76
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,960
I happen to hate the people
who are too funny.

77
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Your Majesty, do you really
not know what I want?

78
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,080
Your Majesty, rest assured.

79
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,600
His Majesty is fine.

80
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,440
The rebellious people
have been executed at the scene.

81
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,640
The Imperial Army is severely hurt.

82
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,880
Now, the defense in the palace
has been taken over by the Nanchuan Army.

83
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,080
It's just...

84
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,400
What?

85
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,160
Your Majesty, the Prince of Nanchuan
is also a royal relative,

86
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,680
and possesses a big army.

87
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,320
Now, the Imperial City
is under his control.

88
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,520
Will the Emperor and the Prince
be in danger?

89
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,640
Does the Prince of Nanchuan
live in the palace?

90
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,280
He lives in the main hall
of the Eastern Palace.

91
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,840
That's where the Crown Prince should live.

92
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,200
He's always like that.

93
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,880
If he likes something, he'll take it,

94
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,760
not asking anyone.

95
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,840
His Highness has saved the Emperor.
But he doesn't lack fortune.

96
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,760
What do you think
the Emperor will award him?

97
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,720
Will the Emperor grant him a lady?

98
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,580
(It was I who wrote the letter
to ask him to come.)

99
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,000
(If I don't go to see him tonight,)

100
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,280
(tomorrow will be totally different.)

101
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,920
(If he gets mad,)

102
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,680
(His Majesty and Cheng will be in danger.)

103
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,720
A beauty has already
come to win his favor.

104
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,000
Your Majesty, you came here
but you don't talk,

105
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,960
making me so nervous.

106
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,320
(Su Yan, if you still
have feelings for me,)

107
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,600
(Five Years Ago)
I will disobey the imperial edict for you.

108
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,400
Yuwen Yingren is the crown prince.

109
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,480
Marrying him, I'll be the crown princess.

110
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,800
After he succeeds to the throne,

111
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,840
I'll become the empress.

112
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,320
That's what I aspire to

113
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,000
and long for.

114
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,320
Since you can't give me what I want,

115
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,520
don't stop me doing that.
