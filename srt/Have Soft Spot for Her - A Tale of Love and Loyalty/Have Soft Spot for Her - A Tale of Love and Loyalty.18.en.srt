You would finally see me.

25
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,280
You're here.

26
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,800
Yan,

27
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,720
have you thought it through?

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,600
What is the point in saying this now,
Your Majesty?

29
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,400
Yan,

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,600
he is dead.

31
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,240
Everything is over now.

32
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,920
Yes.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,920
It's finally going to be over.

34
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,280
Yan,

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,560
I promise to take good care of you.

From now onward,

40
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,920
I will not go anywhere.

41
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,480
I will stay by your side, Your Majesty.

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,840
Yan, do you speak the truth?

43
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,280
The world is under your rule.

44
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,600
