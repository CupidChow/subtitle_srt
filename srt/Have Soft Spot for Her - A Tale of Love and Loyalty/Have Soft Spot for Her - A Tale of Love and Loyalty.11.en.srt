Mother.

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,840
Don't be afraid, Cheng.

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
I'll stay with you all day today.

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,440
I won't go anywhere.

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,440
Okay.

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,200
Yan.

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,160
I am glad

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,280
that I have you.

32
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,120
You're too kind, Your Majesty.

33
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,640
Yuan.

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,960
(You called him Yuan,)

35
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,480
(but always address me as Your Majesty.)

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,440
Your Majesty?

37
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,520
Yan, I still have official business
to attend to.

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll have to trouble you
to look after Cheng.

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,240
(Yan, I know you aren't
very sincere toward me.)

40
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,720
(It's fine. I'm willing
to play along with this pretense)

41
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,200
(and live everyday with you like this.)

42
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,160
Why do you think His Majesty is still

43
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,120
guarding the Palace of Xuyang?

44
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,120
How would I know?

45
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,080
I was nosy.

46
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,720
Come back.

47
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,640
If anything moves in
the Palace of Xuyang,

48
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,720
tear it down.

49
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,720
Tear?

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,000
Go now.

51
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,360
Okay.

52
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,580
(Palace of Xuyang)

53
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,200
Your Majesty, the Nanchuan Army
has surrounded the Palace of Xuyang.

54
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,240
My younger brother is
as impatient as ever.

55
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,680
What about Nanny Li?

56
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,920
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

57
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,360
I got the Shadow Guards to deal with her.

58
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,440
Good.

59
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,440
Say it.

60
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,520
Your Majesty, forgive my ignorance.

61
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,120
May I know the reason for your plan?

62
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,240
Have you ever loved someone?

63
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,520
I do not understand.

64
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,120
If you love someone,

65
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,260
you will have a weakness.

66
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,160
Just like a flag,

67
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,720
a slight breeze will send it
fluttering in the air.

68
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,520
It flies wherever the wind blows.

69
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,120
In that case,

70
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,560
shouldn't you encourage

71
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,320
the relationship between
Her Majesty and the Prince of Nanchuan?

72
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,240
Why would you...

73
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,680
I have overstepped my limits.

74
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,840
Yan is mine, and only mine.

75
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,040
Yuwen Yuan is not worthy of Yan's love.

76
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,160
You've suffered, Cheng.

77
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,320
It's my fault
that I didn't look after you properly.

78
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,160
Mother, I didn't suffer.

79
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,040
Uncle Yuan protected me.

80
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,160
He's a good man.

81
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,160
Uncle Yuan?

82
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,160
They shot arrows from all over the place.

83
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,040
Uncle Yuan shielded me and was injured.

84
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,080
I am fine.

85
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,120
(He was injured?)

86
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,920
Don't be afraid, Mother. I'm fine.

87
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,720
Cheng, you're born blessed

88
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,520
and will always have
someone to protect you.

89
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,040
You will always be safe.

90
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,360
Yes.

91
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,720
Can you now tell me

92
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,120
who took you away that night?

93
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,960
Nanny Li? She worked for my sister.

94
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,600
Why would she?

95
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,400
(If it happened as Cheng said,)

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
(then it wasn't a coincidence
that Yuan appeared in)

97
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,400
(the Palace of Xuyang.)

98
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,800
Mother, what's wrong?

99
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,440
It's nothing.

100
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,920
Cheng, you must be tired. Go to bed early.

101
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,760
I'll come by another day.

102
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,280
Come.

103
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,720
(The Nanchuan Army charged into
the imperial city to quell the rebellion)

104
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,200
(and then besieged the city.)

105
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,480
(There must be rumors)

106
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,480
(that Yuwen Yuan wants to become
the next emperor.)

107
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,640
(If that is the case, His Majesty...)

108
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,840
(But why?)

109
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,920
(Doing this will not lift
the siege on the city)

110
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,120
(or weaken Yuan's power.)

111
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,040
(Place of Jingcheng)
(...The only purpose is...)

112
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,400
(to convict him of a crime
and be punished for it.)

113
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,280
If Your Majesty

114
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,880
wants to know where I was last night,

115
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
please leave.

116
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,400
You and I are

117
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,400
not so close that we can have
a heart-to-heart talk.

118
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,360
Your Majesty,
His Highness isn't in a good mood.

119
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,320
Come another day.

120
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,080
Do you have so little patience for me?

121
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,240
Your Majesty, are you here

122
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,120
to force me

123
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,200
to confess to the kidnapping
of Yuwen Cheng'an?

124
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Has your injuries healed?

125
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,680
What?

126
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,800
I've heard about it from Cheng.

127
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,200
You got injured trying to save him.

128
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,120
So, I'm here to visit you

129
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,280
and to thank you on his behalf.

130
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,000
You must have a lot on your mind,
Your Majesty.

131
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,080
You didn't come here

132
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,040
because you care about my injury,
did you?

133
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,840
I came here to ask for a favor.

134
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,040
Good.

135
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,000
Let's hear it.

136
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,360
But I may not promise you.

137
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,520
Since you have fully recovered,

138
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,000
I request that you withdraw your troops,

139
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,920
leave the imperial city,
and return to your fiefdom.

140
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,400
What did you say?

141
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,320
The crisis in the imperial city is over.

142
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,640
Your troops are no longer needed here,
Prince of Nanchuan.

143
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,400
Your Highness, I request

144
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,800
that you leave the imperial city
and return to your fiefdom.

145
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,360
Su Yan,

146
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,920
have I been giving you
too many privileges lately?

147
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,640
I requested you to come

148
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,840
and rescue the imperial city from crisis.

149
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Now that the imperial city is safe,

150
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,640
there is no reason for you to stay.

151
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,920
Su Yan,

152
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,520
what do you take me for?

153
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,200
Am I a palace servant
at your beck and call?

154
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,920
Or am I just a dog
that only listens to you?

155
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
I am the Prince of Nanchuan.

156
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,200
How could I be ordered around
by another man's wife?

157
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
What makes you think

158
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,520
that I'll come whenever you call

159
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,800
and leave when I'm told?

160
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,120
If you won't withdraw your troops,

161
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,440
then wouldn't that be
just like the rumors?

162
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,320
That you want to murder your brother
to seize power as the emperor.

163
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,040
Su Yan!

164
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,000
Am I that terrible of a person
in your eyes?

165
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,840
You wouldn't even
give me a shred of trust.

166
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,760
I read too much into this.

167
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,440
You are here

168
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,680
to investigate my whereabouts

169
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,440
and prove that I kidnapped Yuwen Cheng'an.

170
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,600
So you can help Yuwen Yingren

171
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,480
get rid of me in a just manner.

172
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,640
Am I right?

173
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,120
The people are talking

174
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,920
that the Prince of Nanchuan,
Yuwen Yuan, is highly ambitious.

175
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,920
He besieged the city intending to force
the emperor to abdicate and take over.

176
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,240
Gossip is a fearful thing,
I have to prevent it.

177
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,600
If I refuse to leave

178
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,440
and want to fight for the throne,

179
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,960
Su Yan, what can you do about it?

180
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,560
You may kill millions in your anger.

181
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,440
Although I may not be as capable as you,

182
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,920
I can still cause bloodshed.

183
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,840
If you do not believe me,

184
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,640
you may try me.

185
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,680
Good.

186
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,360
Well said.

187
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,560
Su Yan,

188
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,720
well said.

189
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,040
I should have thought of this.

190
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,840
A person can change in a matter of days.

191
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,600
What then could be said about five years?

192
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,800
The world is ever changing.

193
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,000
Situations, feelings, and people change.

194
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,160
You've changed, and so have I.

195
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,680
Fine.

196
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,000
If you want me to leave,

197
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,840
then I will.

198
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,200
However, Su Yan,

199
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,040
you've been delaying what you promised me.

200
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,200
I am not willing

201
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,840
to leave just like this.

202
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,640
Su Yan, are you going back on your word?

203
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,560
So what if I am?

204
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,920
Yuwen Yuan,

205
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
you're the one who is too cowardly.

206
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,320
You're the one who wouldn't let it go.

207
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,000
I gave you the chance.

208
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,720
Yes.

209
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,000
I was too soft-hearted.

210
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,400
I kept loving the wrong person
and was willing to be used.

211
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,880
In that case,

212
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,600
would you be willing
to give me another chance,

213
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,560
so I may leave without regrets?

214
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,520
This time, I won't be soft-hearted.

215
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,240
Forget it.
