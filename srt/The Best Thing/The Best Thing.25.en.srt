3
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,759
Pens are hot commodities in hospitals.

4
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,000
This pen is so unique.

5
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,680
I'd like to see

6
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,090
who's been taking them from me all this time.

7
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,230
But this one is so cute.

8
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,510
Are you sure you want this one?

9
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,920
I think it suits me well.

10
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,430
Don't you think so?

11
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,340
I feel it suits you very well.

12
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,030
It's mine now?

13
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:11,770
Okay.

14
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,610
What are these?

15
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
Your lesson plan?

16
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,710
Yes, I'm going to teach next semester.

17
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,960
The principal asked me to come up with a few alternative course options.

18
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,750
So I need to refer to

19
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,150
my senior colleagues' lesson plans recently.

20
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,400
Yes.

21
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,829
You'll be Teacher He in the future.

22
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,120
So you'll be working at the hospital

23
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,560
while going back to teach.

24
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,840
Won't that be too exhausting?

25
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,140
It's better to be busy.

26
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,220
Otherwise, when you go abroad, I'll have nothing to do

27
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,490
except sitting at home and thinking about you.

28
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,780
I'll have holidays, you know.

29
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,530
As soon as I have a break, I'll come back to see you.

30
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,010
Teacher He will be very busy.

31
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,160
You have time to come back

32
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,740
but Teacher He might not have time to see you.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,750
Okay.

34
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,800
I'm just kidding.

35
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,360
Study hard.

36
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,110
I'll see if I can save up some annual leave to visit you abroad.

37
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,680
By the way,

38
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,030
you should quickly prepare

39
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,870
all the materials needed for your visa

40
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,840
and submit your application as soon as possible.

41
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,840
In case there are any issues later,

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,000
you can prepare again.

43
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,870
I got it, Teacher He.

44
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,910
You're so naggy.

45
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,910
Here.

46
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,350
Cheers.

47
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,600
Cherish every bubble tea.

48
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,610
In the future, you can drink the bubble tea I develop.

49
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,110
I think you should make eight-treasure congee in the future.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,470
Sure, I'll develop new products then.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,280
What's wrong?

52
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,320
A regular customer told me

53
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,450
to book a villa for them.

54
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,390
It has to be low-key and secluded.

55
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,910
And then?

56
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,960
Xiangya.

57
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,600
This man

58
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,850
is the male lead of the drama you were watching, right?

59
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,070
He's the one visiting?

60
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,750
Did he say if it's a private trip

61
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,160
or if it's for work?

62
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,240
Probably private.

63
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,430
He only booked one.

64
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,950
Who is it?

65
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,950
Let me have a look too.

66
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,720
Maybe he was too tired from filming his last project.

67
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,920
So he came here to relax and unwind.

68
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,310
Or he might have taken on some mysterious job

69
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,370
that he can't disclose.

70
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,900

71
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,380

He has huge eyes

79
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,140
and long eyelashes.

80
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,550
He even has a tall nose bridge too.

81
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,020
How is his nose bridge so tall?

82
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,430
His lips are so sexy.

I think he

85

really understands good food and understands me.

I should have quit earlier if I had known.

89
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,630
You should have called me then.

90
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,750
I could have taken the photo for you.

91
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,190
I missed it.

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,870
Exactly.

98

100
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,580

101
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,240
Yeah, we're even 190 cm tall.

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,270
I can look at it at home after work.

00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,160
With my conditions, I shouldn't be single.

189
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,700
Could it be because...

190
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,150
If you're not busy, I can come to the hospital to find you.

191
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,170
I think I still

192
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,050
have too much free time, don't I?

193
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,790
How about I introduce someone to you?

194
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,340
I've been waiting for you to say that.

195
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:43,800
Okay.

196
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,780
We've known each other for so long,

197
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,860
you should have introduced someone to me long ago.

198
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,070
What type do you like?

199
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,910
Hurry up.

200
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,390
I forgot my phone.

201
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,340
Have you finished signing?

202
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,850
I... I'm done.

203
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,540
Let's go.

204
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,580
Is Liu Xiaoming here?

205
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,730
Yes.

206
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,810
He.

207
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,270
Auntie, did you take time off to come here?

208
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,980
Yes.

209
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,390
Didn't you tell Professor Yu

210
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,620
that I need a checkup?

211
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,390
I did it, and the results are out. I want to let you have a look.

212
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,580
Alright, I'll take a look.

213
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,190
The other items look pretty good,

214
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,270
except for a breast nodule on the left side.

215
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,580
The doctor,

216
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,310
when doing the ultrasound for me,

217
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,760
had a concerned expression.

218
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,460
It made me quite worried.

219
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,010
This breast nodule of yours,

220
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,540
indeed needs further examination.

221
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,670
Is it very serious

222
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,170
that I need to check further?

223
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,630
Don't worry.

224
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,300
For women in their forties and fifties,

225
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,300
it's indeed crucial to pay close attention to breast health.

226
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,589
So,

227
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,220
we have to do further tests

228
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,060
to provide a definitive diagnosis.

229
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,500
Actually, I've always been in good health,

230
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,220
and I haven't felt any discomfort anywhere.

231
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,660
It surely can't be breast cancer.

232
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,020
Alright,

233
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,260
I'll follow your advice.

234
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,700
What examinations do I need to undergo?

235
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
I'll fully cooperate.

236
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,650
I've already taken a day off anyway.

237
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,580
How about this?

238
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,500
Let's do all the examinations to be at ease.

239
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,350
Okay, I'll write you a prescription.

240
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,980
There will be a few minor examinations shortly.

241
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,300
I'll have a student escort you there.

242
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,650
[Medical Examination for tumor]

243
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,670
Okay.

244
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,980
Please guide Mrs. Shen to her examinations.

245
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,390
Alright.

246
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,740
Sorry for the trouble.

247
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,700
Don't worry.

248
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,430
Okay.

249
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,630
Make sure to get plenty of rest

250
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,950
and cut down on alcohol.

251
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,430
Thank you, doctor.

252
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,110
It's fine.

253
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,500
I found another one of the same kind in the corner of the cabinet.

254
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,820
Your mom came to the hospital.

255
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,880
I have one here too.

256
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:10,910
Come in.

257
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,670
Senior He,

258
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,020
Ms. Liu's test results are out.

259
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,260
Please have a seat, Auntie.

260
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,260
Is it a tumour?

261
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,430
Based on the examination report and ultrasound,

262
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,300
there's a high probability it's a tumour.

263
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,780
So it's breast cancer then.

264
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,650
It's only a high probability,

265
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,590
and it could also be benign.

266
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,140
But it could also be malignant.

267
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,980
Don't worry, Auntie.

268
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,110
Whether it's benign or malignant

269
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,900
can only be determined through a biopsy.

270
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,980
How is it done?

271
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,430
We can do a needle biopsy,

272
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,590
or a surgical biopsy.

273
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,780
The needle biopsy has a smaller incision,

274
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,870
while with the surgical biopsy,

275
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,460
we can remove the lump

276
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,160
and perform a rapid pathology test for a definitive diagnosis.

277
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,670
Then, based on the diagnosis,

278
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,640
decide on the subsequent surgical approach.

279
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,220
If the results are good,

280
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,260
we can directly suture the incision,

281
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,690
avoiding any secondary harm.

282
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,740
When you say removal,

283
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,510
do you mean removing the entire breast?

284
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,710
No.

285
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,430
It's possible to avoid removing the breast.

286
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,060
Needle biopsy

287
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,670
or removal,

288
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,110
I don't understand either.

289
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,210
I don't...

290
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,460
I don't understand all this.

291
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,870
How about this then?

292
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,280
How about you notify Uncle and Xifan first,

293
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,590
so they can discuss it with you?

294
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,870
They're not doctors,

295
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,940
what advice could they give?

296
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,800
He,

297
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,450
you're a doctor.

298
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,430
I'll listen to you.

299
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,220
What do you suggest?

300
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,110
I recommend

301
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,430
surgical treatment.

302
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,760
Surgery.

303
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,830
Okay.

304
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,400
Then I'll arrange it for you directly.

305
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,040
If all goes well, you can be admitted to the hospital tomorrow.

306
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,670
The surgery can be performed the day after tomorrow.

307
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,670
That's so fast.

308
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,210
Auntie,

309
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,060
I still suggest that you

310
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,950
inform Uncle and Xifan first.

311
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,260
After all, before and after the surgery,

312
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,190
you'll need family to take care of you during your hospital stay.

313
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,810
I'll tell Mr. Shen.

314
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,820
As for Ms. Shen,

315
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,460
keep it a secret for me.

316
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,740
That doesn't seem right.

317
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,740
I...

318
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,220
I want to wait until the pathology report comes out before telling her.

319
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,430
What if it's really benign?

320
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,750
Wouldn't she be worrying for nothing?

321
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,970
This morning,

322
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,200
as soon as I got that medical report,

323
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,910
you were the first person I thought of.

324
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,830
I think you're the most reliable,

325
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,460
and trustworthy person.

326
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,220
Promise me,

327
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,390
you won't tell her.

328
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,730
Alright.

329
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,780
He Suye.

330
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,870
What's wrong?

331
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,020
Nothing.

332
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,860
Do you want a drink?

333
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,230
No need, I can just drink this.

334
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,700
Are you okay?

335
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,260
You seem to be in a bad mood.

336
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,460
It's nothing, I'm just thinking about some work-related matters.

337
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,500
Why don't you go sit for a while?

338
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,350
I'll join you in a bit.

339
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,870
You went to the hospital this afternoon?

340
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,190
Why didn't you tell me to go with you?

341
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,690
I originally thought

342
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,510
it was just a slightly larger nodule.

343
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,300
And you had classes,

344
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,430
so I went by myself.

345
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,590
No,

346
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,950
why do they want you to be hospitalized?

347
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,630
He said

348
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,060
it's definitely a tumor,

349
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,630
so they need to perform surgery to remove it

350
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,350
and then do a biopsy

351
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,790
to confirm

352
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,640
whether it's malignant or benign.

353
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,930
No, it's...

354
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,780
That's not what I'm thinking about now.

355
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,950
What I'm thinking is

356
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,950
how to tell our daughter that I have to be hospitalized.

357
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,670
I don't want her to know.

358
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:13,630
No, she...

359
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,280
Then you...

360
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,770
You tell me

361
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,950
how are you going to hide this from her?

362
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,820
We don't know if it's malignant or benign yet.

363
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,260
Why tell her then?

364
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,780
Wouldn't that just make her worry for nothing?

365
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,190
If I'm unlucky,

366
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,220
and it turns out to be malignant,

367
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,630
then it's breast cancer.

368
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,540
No.

369
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,900
It's a sure thing.

370
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,930
We can let her know anytime then, can't we?

371
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,780
No, that's not it.

372
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,460
Don't...

373
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,590
Don't...

374

376

I'll think of something.

377
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,950
I'll figure out how to

378
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,980
talk to her about it.

379
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,590
The key now is

380
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,980
It's not even a holiday now,

381
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,390
so we can't say we're going

382
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,190
on a trip.

383
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,630
No.

384
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,020
Why...

385
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,060
Why is this so sudden?

386
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,700
It's not that sudden actually.

387
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,190
I don't blame anyone.

388
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,910
I only blame myself.

389
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,550
I should have gone for a check-up earlier.

390
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,460
Don't cry, don't cry.

391
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,870
It'll be fine, I'm sure.

392
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,460
Don't worry.

393
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,500
I'm here.

394
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,630
Fortune favors the virtuous.

395
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,700
Everything will be alright.

396
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:56,850
Here.

397
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,210
The medicine is warmed up.

398
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,300
By the way,

399
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:01,950
Ms. Shen,

400
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,780
your mother's team at work

401
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,780
is going to the neighboring city for training tomorrow.

402
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,040
I've rescheduled a few classes,

403
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,700
hoping to tag along with her for a couple of days.

404
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,870
Alright, you two have a good time.

405
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,910
Okay.

406
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,470
Uncle, Auntie.

407
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,670
Have you been waiting long?

408
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,560
-No. 
-Let's go, Auntie.

409
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,150
Let's handle the hospital admission procedures first.

410
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:45,870
Yes, it's right over there.

411
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,390
Okay, okay.

412
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,580

421

I'll leave now.

422

A little lower then.

423
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,360
Okay.

424
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,500

This is Director Zhou from the surgery department.

427

Hello.

428
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,670
I'm the lead surgeon for tomorrow's operation.

429
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,460
My surname is Zhou.

430
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,430
I came to see you today first.

431
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,060
Oh, right.

432
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,020
this is Ms. Liu's Surgical Informed Consent Form.

433
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,250
We need a family member to sign it.

434
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,260
Please take a look.

435

This...

437

Don't worry. Although it's a removal surgery,

438
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,740
the technique is already very mature.

439
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,700
There shouldn't be any problems.

440
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,110
Okay, okay.

00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,570
Here.

442
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,390
Thank you.

443
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,830
I've taken a look.

444
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,830
The tumor is located on the left side.

445
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,110
Can you feel it yourself usually?

446
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,540
Also,

447
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,460
do you usually feel

some discomfort in your armpit?

449
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,020
A little bit, occasionally.

The rapid pathology results are out.

487
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,300
It's malignant.

488
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,790
Fortunately, it hasn't metastasized yet.

489
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,080
So what should we do next?

490
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,340
It hasn't spread to the sentinel lymph nodes yet.

491
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,150
But to prevent spreading,

492
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,870
we need to expand the scope of the surgery a bit,

493
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,980
just to be safe.

494
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,150
So, you can consider

495
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,980
whether to opt for breast-conserving surgery or a full mastectomy?

496
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,410
Let's conserve.

497
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,150
Let's go with breast conservation.

498
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,950
Breast conservation is better

00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,060
They should be fine.

562
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,870
I'm not worried.

563
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,310
I'm just wondering if

564
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,180
those two are having too much fun

565
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,230
and have forgotten about me?

566
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,060
How could that be?

567
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,000
Don't overthink it.

568
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,460
Here you go.

569
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,540
Thank you, sir.

570
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:17,980
Here, take it.

571
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,870
Thank you.

572
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:19,910
Let's go.

573
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,910
That hand.

574
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,750
I'll come back to check your temperature in two hours.

575
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,390
Get some rest.

576
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,180
Caifang,

577
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,790
why do you look so worried after coming back from the ward?

578
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,950
Isn't that Dr. He's

579
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,370
girlfriend's parents?

580
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,790
I need to take extra care of them.

581
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,270
Manager Shen's parents?

582
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,050
You don't know?

583
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,230
Her mother is hospitalized for a removal surgery.

584
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,540
But it's strange.

585
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,090
Why hasn't she shown up even once?

586
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,630
The rapid pathology shows malignancy.

587
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,660
We're still waiting for the full pathology report.

588
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,710
I know.

589
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,620
Once the full pathology report is out,

590
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,580
we'll provide a treatment plan immediately.

591
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:33,980
Okay.

592
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,310
Got it, Grandpa.

593
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,830
Bye-bye.

594
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,880
Thank you.

595
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,540
Suye,

596
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,500
I heard that Manager Shen's mother is sick and hospitalized.

597
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,700
No wonder I've seen you running back and forth these past two days.

598
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,730
With you around, Manager Shen doesn't need to worry at all.

599
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,710
She...

600
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,480
She doesn't know yet.

601
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,020
Before the results come out,

602
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,580
Auntie doesn't want me to tell her.

603
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,980
I have no choice.

604
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,950
That's not good, is it?

605
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:17,790
Her mother is sick,

606
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,910
and they're not telling the daughter?

607
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,620
I know what you mean,

608
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,430
but I can also understand Auntie.

609
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,430
She doesn't want Xifan to worry.

610
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,140
That's still not good.

611
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,060
No matter how understandable it is,

612
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,690
Manager Shen is the one directly involved.

613
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,020
If she knows she's been kept in the dark,

614
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,690
she'll definitely be very upset.

615
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,980
After all, it's her own mother.

616
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,870
What will happen when she finds out later?

617
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,610
She'll surely regret it.

618
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,700
Really?

619
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,830
Are you not going to tell her?
