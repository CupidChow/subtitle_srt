00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,680
What's up? Is something wrong?

4
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,560
No, nothing.

5
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,230
I just wanted to tell you that

6
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,960
I missed you.

7
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,200
Thank you for telling me.

8
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,079
I missed you too.

9
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,660
Bye-bye.

10
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,200
Dr. He. Waiting for your girlfriend again?

11
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,180
Yes, indeed.

12
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,310
Here's your spicy hot pot.

13
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,380
You already gave me your door code.

14
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,850
Why did you still come down to meet me?

15
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,270
Didn't you say you missed me?

16
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,730
So I came down early to meet you.

17
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,520
So nice of you.

18
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,760
Dinner's ready. Let's go.

19
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What are we having today?

20
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,430
We're having...

21
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,190
Guess.

22
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,810
Bamboo shoots?

23
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,910
You want bamboo shoots?

24
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:31,960
Okay.

25
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,240
I'll make another dish for you then.

26
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,240
You're extra supportive of my cooking today.

27
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,029
Got a good appetite?

28
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,650
Today,

29
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,290
I accomplished something big.

30
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,720
Yan Heng checked out.

31
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,390
I always thought

32
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,810
I'd have some kind of argument with him when the time came.

33
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,480
But when it really happened, I was surprisingly calm.

34
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,270
Because...

35
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,550
I've completely moved on.

36
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,400
That indeed

37
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,159
is a big accomplishment.

38
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,880
He Suye.

39
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,830
Thank you for never letting go of my hand.

40
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,830
What are you thanking me for?

41
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,850
Didn't I also get myself a girlfriend?

42
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,380
Alright, let's eat.

43
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's eat.

44
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,720
Oh, right.

45
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,880
I need to make a run home after dinner.

46
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,159
My parents have been worried about me because of this.

47
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,600
I need to go home and tell them.

48
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,390
Sure.

49
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,830
Then eat more.

50
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,740
Don't get hungry later.

51
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,690
Is it not good?

52
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,190
It's really good.

53
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,060
Then eat more.

54
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,630
I want some more soup.

55
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,740
You shouldn't eat rice soaked in soup like this. It's bad for your stomach.

56
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,590
That's pretty good.

57
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,670
What kind of person Yan is

58
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,940
is another matter.

59
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,000
Just think of this as a part of your life journey.

60
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,540
Walking gracefully to the end

61
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,480
should be considered a good thing, right?

62
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,960
Did he make you cry?

63
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,440
No. I'm completely fine. Don't worry.

64
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,590
Have you told He about this?

65
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,260
I have.

66
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,060
As you should.

67
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,580
Otherwise, he might be worried.

68
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,310
You should invite He over for dinner,

69
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,620
so that we can formally meet.

70
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,640
Last time he came to our house, it was a complete mess.

71
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,610
We don't want him to think that

72
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,350
our family is not good.

73
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,620
Okay, no problem.

74
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,900
Well,

75
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,440
I'll talk to him about it later.

76
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,260
Alright.

77
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,320
Are you not coming to see me later?

78
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,230
No. I'm going to spend more time with my parents.

79
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:50,990
By the way,

80
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,500
my parents are asking if you're free this weekend.

81
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,600
They want to invite you over for dinner.

82
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,120
This weekend?

83
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,150
Sure.

84
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,060
Okay, okay.

85
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,730
Ms. Shen.

86
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,310
I remember you haven't taken Chinese medicine for a while.

87
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,990
Why don't you ask Dr. He to check your pulse again

88
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,000
and prescribe some Chinese medicine for you?

89
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,760
Your body still needs conditioning.

90
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,390
I've been doing pretty well lately.

91
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,550
I have a good appetite.

92
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,580
I don't want to take Chinese medicine anymore.

93
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,880
Why not?

94
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,310
Chinese medicine is for long-term health maintenance.

95
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,690
Besides,

96
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,070
who has such easy access to Chinese medicine as you do?

97
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,630
You can just have a date with your boyfriend,

98
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,060
get your pulse checked, and get the medicine prescribed.

99
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,290
And you still don't want to take it?

100
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,500
It's too bitter.

101
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,030
Get up.

102
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,560
-Come downstairs and take a walk with us.
-What?

103
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,970
I'm not going. I just got off work.

104
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,799
I want to rest.

105
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,400
Why are you so lazy?

106
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,260
You just had dinner.

107
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,090
Staying cooped up here isn't good for digestion.

108
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,440
Didn't Dr. He tell you that?

109
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,320
No.

110
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,390
Get up.

111
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,170
Go to your room and put on a coat.

112
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,840
It's cold outside.

113
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,270
Okay.

114
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,850
Tell me quickly that

115
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,470
lying down right after eating doesn't affect digestion.

116
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,960
I don't want to go downstairs for a walk.

117
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,820
Doctors can't lie.

118
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,220
Here you go.

119
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,000
Thank you.

120
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,110
The food is here.

121
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:28,980
I want that fried cake.

122
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,720
That... Fried cake.

123
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,430
Aren't you two taking a walk to aid digestion after dinner?

124
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,550
Why are you eating again?

125
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,050
It's after-dinner dessert.

126
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,670
We got hungry from walking. Got a problem?

127
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,050
Eat up.

128
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,450
My university is organizing a hike this weekend.

129
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,810
Let's go together.

130
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,270
Those women in our research team...

131
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,290
Mrs. Shen. Mr. Shen.

132
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,750
Good evening.

133
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,900
Good evening.

134
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,030
What a coincidence.

135
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,260
Why are you here?

136
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,170
Well, Xifan told me that you two wanted to see me,

137
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,910
so I quickly got ready and came down.

138
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,530
I...

139
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,360
Right.

140
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,510
Yes. We wanted to meet you.

141
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:06,910
Well.

142
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,190
I've been telling Xifan

143
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,620
to ask you over for dinner.

144
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,930
We should meet you formally, right?

145
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,410
I must have misunderstood.

146
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,650
But it's convenient anyway.

147
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,260
We live in the same neighborhood, right?

148
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,580
Xifan can give me a call anytime,

149
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,380
and I'll come right over.

150
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,620
-Yes.
-Right.

151
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,600
We've talked about it several times already.

152
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,440
Come anytime.

153
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:22,960
Okay.

154
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,360
Mr. Shen's cooking is really delicious.

155
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
You're flattering me.

156
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,260
When I have a chance, I'll learn from you, Mr. Shen.

157
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,160
I love cooking too.

158
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,560
How's your cooking?

159
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,630
It's okay.

160
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,410
That's great.

161
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,270
From now on, Ms. Shen

162
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,360
won't have to worry about her meals anymore.

163
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,080
Mom.

164
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,200
Dad.

165
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,750
After having my cooking tonight,

166
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,240
why did you sit down again?

167
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,120
Didn't we agree we'd take a walk to digest?

168
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,840
Let's go, let's go.

169
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,720
We're still continuing that walk?

170
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,050
We two need to walk more. We ate too much tonight.

171
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,410
Let's go, let's go.

172
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,120
But I haven't eaten... This yet.

173
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:52,820
Well,

174
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,570
you guys,

175
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,930
order more yourselves, okay?

176
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,910
-Order yourselves.
-Okay.

177
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,960
See you at home another day.

178
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,390
Let's set a formal date for that meal.

179
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,030
Okay, no problem.

180
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,180
Goodbye. Goodbye.

181
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,080
W-We didn't mean to chase you two away.

182
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,810
I think

183
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,440
your parents like me quite a lot.

184
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,850
You showed up suddenly on purpose, didn't you?

185
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:21,650
No, I didn't.

186
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,100
Didn't you tell me you were taking a walk with your parents?

187
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,150
Wasn't that specifically to call me over?

188
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,840
I did no such thing.

189
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,310
Isn't that so?

190
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,730
He Suye.

191
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,860
I've discovered

192
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,810
you can be quite shameless sometimes.

193
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,720
It's alright, I guess.

194
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,430
What do you want to eat? I'll order it for you.

195
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,830
You're annoying.

196
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,190
Here.

197
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,270
It's iced.

198
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,180
Without ice. Without ice.

199
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,040
What? Are you going through a rebellious phase?

200
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,460
No.

201
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,800
It's just I suddenly realized yesterday that I don't have to take Chinese medicine anymore.

202
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,960
So I can have some cold drinks now.

203
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,870
You're not afraid of being caught, huh?

204
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,740
If I get caught, I'll just deny it.

205
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,210
Besides, he has to take care of me no matter what.

206
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,360
Nice.

207
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,920
Dr. He doesn't want you to have cold drinks

208
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,020
for your own good.

209
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,060
So you're not letting her have this drink or what?

210
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,680
Go ahead.

211
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,510
Xifan.

212
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,480
Now that you're with Dr. He,

213
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,720
when can we have dinner with him

214
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,910
and let him meet your dearest friends?

215
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,800
How about this weekend?

216
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,850
He works at the clinic on Saturdays.

217
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,050
He doesn't work on Sundays.

218
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,140
We're available this Sunday.

219
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,430
Okay. I'll ask him.

220
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,740
What do you usually do on your dates?

221
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,700
I go to his place,

222
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,410
and he cooks or makes medicated diet for me.

223
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,570
So simple?

224
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,990
Alright then.

225
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,560
I'll take care of all the fun stuff.

226
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,990
You just need to be there.

227
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,770
Thank you, Sis.

228
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,090
My girlfriend is so cool.

229
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,870
The scenery is pretty nice, isn't it?

230
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,470
Xifan.

231
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,870
Coming.

232
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,510
It's really comfortable to take a walk here.

233
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,530
And it's not cold at all.

234
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,870
We've just passed the Awakening of Insects in the solar terms,

235
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,930
which marks the time when spring thunder awakens the hibernating insects

236
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,280
and everything comes back to life.

237
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,540
As for people,

238
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,050
we should also be like those hibernating insects,

239
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,050
coming out to exercise a bit.

240
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,720
He's always like this.

241
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,870
Am I wrong?

242
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,300
Isn't the place I picked really nice?

243
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,570
The atmosphere here is great, isn't it?

244
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,180
I really like it here.

245
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,120
Well...

246
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,510
We forgot to bring drinks, right?

247
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,480
I see they're selling drinks over there.

248
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,360
I'll go buy some.

249
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,770
Comrade, I'll leave them in your care.

250
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,830
Good luck.

251
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,580
Come back soon.

252
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,420
Dr. He.

253
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,340
Could you take a couple of nice photos for us?

254
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,130
With my phone.

255
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,850
You want me to take photos for you?

256
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,490
Okay.

257
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,290
Let's go.

258
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,270
Is it heavy?

259
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:26,970
It's all right.

260
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,290
Over there, over there.

261
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,720
Let's go.

262
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,460
Be careful.

263
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,630
Dr. He, please don't feel any pressure.

264
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,270
If you really don't know how,

265
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,910
just keep pressing the button over and over.

266
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,910
Taking photos is such a simple task.

267
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,150
How could I feel pressured?

268
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,120
Just a moment, let me adjust the settings.

269
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,460
I need to adjust the white balance, brightness, and such.

270
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,170
He even knows about settings?

271
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,400
I have no idea.

272
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,440
Done.

273
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,920
Come on, look here.

274
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,890
So pretty.

275
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,240
One more.

276
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,440
Three, two, one.

277
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,720
Xiangya.

278
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,620
His photos on social media are really ugly.

279
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,140
Smile bigger.

280
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,840
With such beautiful models,

281
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,200
it would be hard for him to take ugly photos of us, okay?

282
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,560
You two, look at each other.

283
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,850
Three, two, one.

284
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,170
Look at me, look at me.

285
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,940
Something's not right.

286
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,260
Why do I feel he's getting further and further away from us?

287
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,790
Three, two, one.

288
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,820
I think we should call him.

289
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,840
Dr. He, don't go any further.

290
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,510
Come back for a moment.

291
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,290
Look.

292
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,960
Take a look.

293
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,010
How are they?

294
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,580
Aren't they absolutely pretty?

295
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,920
Aren't they gorgeous?

296
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,810
We asked you to take close-ups.

297
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,860
There are close-ups.

298
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,680
Look at the first few ones.

299
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,600
This one.

300
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,250
Do you see it?

301
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,410
Both your heads are big in this one.

302
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,350
Aren't they?

303
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,320
Are our heads really that big?

304
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,120
Are our legs really that short?

305
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,450
Are we really that fat?

306
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,850
But...

307
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,180
But you do look like this

308
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,400
to me normally.

309
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,240
What?

310
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,630
Is there... Is there any problem?

311
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,210
Don't they look good?

312
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,150
Lin Yishen!

313
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,940
Pretty. Really pretty.

314
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,800
Stand closer.

315
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,080
Right, closer.

316
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,830
Yes, that's right, that's right.

317
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,340
Hug, hug.

318
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,970
Hug.

319
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,360
Got it, got it.

320
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,660
We've got some great shots.

321
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,090
The last few ones.

322
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,660
Show your teeth.

323
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,600
Yes, show your teeth.

324
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,440
Right, right.

325
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,360
"Got some great shots"?

326
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,270
I can take great shots too.

327
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,170
What's...

328
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,960
What's so great about it?

329
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,740
The last two.

330
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,280
Okay.

331
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,720
X-rays count as shots too, you know.

332
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:11,900
Check them.

333
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,240
Wow, these are so pretty.

334
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,440
How are they? Are you satisfied?

335
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,960
They're really well taken.

336
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,440
Comrade.

337
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,640
Let's go, time to go to the next location.

338
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,680
Can you hold this for me?

339
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,000
I'll go to the next location first.

340
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,420
Go ahead.

341
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,040
I'm going.

342
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,920
Can you hold this for me too?

343
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:33,330
Let's go.

344
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,590
Let's go.

345
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,060
Wait.

346
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,620
When you say comrade, you mean these things?

347
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,680
Sacrificing me to help you succeed?

348
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,890
Buddy, you should know that

349
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,070
in the past, all these things were on me.

350
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,590
I used to act as a coat rack

351
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,200
while also taking photos for them.

352
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,620
Now, I finally have you

353
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,090
to help me share the burden.

354
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,670
Of course, you should know that

355
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,120
in the days to come,

356
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,030
there will be many more moments for us to fight together.

357
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,110
That actually makes sense.

358
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,930
It was my fault for not giving it much thought.

359
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,210
I originally thought we were just coming out for a walk today

360
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,030
to enjoy the scenery.

361
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:09,970
Buddy.

362
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,770
Your awareness still needs improvement.

363
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,120
When you go out with your girlfriend,

364
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,420
isn't the most beautiful scenery

365
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,080
your own girlfriend?

366
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,420
I'm off.

367
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,220
Wait a moment.

368
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,400
Can't you help me carry some of these?

369
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,550
Come on, hurry up.

370
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,830
They'll get impatient if we keep them waiting.

371
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,090
Hold on.

372
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,110
Look over there.

373
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,510
Look at the camera.

374
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,970
This is a video,

375
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,650
not a photo.

376
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,430
Videos look more natural.

377
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,350
You can take a screenshot of

378
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,990
the frame you like. It looks much better than a photo.

379
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,200
I didn't know we could do that.

380
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,510
Come on.

381
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,640
Why did you suddenly kiss me?

382
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,040
Didn't you say this way of taking photos is more natural?

383
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,190
You're a quick learner when it comes to this, aren't you?

384
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,410
Of course. Just look at who taught me.

385
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,980
Today,

386
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,440
are you happy?

387
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,900
Today,

388
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,330
I guess I'm pretty happy.

389
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,160
I just didn't expect my girlfriend to complain

390
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,090
about my photography skills.

391
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,840
I didn't complain about your photography skills.

392
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,000
Let me comfort you then.

393
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:36,860
Alright.

394
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,090
How could I really be angry?

395
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,280
Actually, I'm quite happy today.

396
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,860
The last time I saw them

397
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,330
was during the medicated diet project.

398
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,590
We were all in work mode then.

399
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,830
I didn't expect them to be like this in private.

400
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,590
Don't laugh. Don't laugh.

401
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,270
Besides,

402
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,720
I also learned

403
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,830
a new way of taking photos from my girlfriend.

404
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,150
How could I not be happy?

405
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,590
They are my best friends.

406
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,850
Seeing you get along well with them,

407
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,320
it actually makes me really happy.

408
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,040
Senior Lin set up a group chat for us.

409
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,930
He posted today's photos there.

410
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,140
They're pretty, aren't they?

411
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,630
So that's how you take this kind of photo.

412
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,170
Let me try.

413
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,030
You're quite diligent, aren't you?

414
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,490
Come on, there's more to see.

415
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,950
I'm just worried you'll complain about it again.

416
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,860
I didn't complain about it.

417
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,000
You didn't?

418
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,870
Why don't you pick a photo and send it to Grandpa?

419
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,260
He's so envious knowing we're together.

420
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,460
How about you cheer him up a bit?

421
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,670
What about this one?

422
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,500
Okay, this one will do.

423
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,880
I'll send it to you then.

424
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,600
Come to think of it, it's already been a year since we first met.

425
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,150
The cherry blossoms were blooming when we first met.

426
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,130
At that time, I was seeing you for my insomnia.

427
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,330
That's right.

428
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,760
I put in so much effort to pursue you.

429
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,460
I worked hard too, okay?

430
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,650
This is what we call mutual effort.

431
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,900
There's even a video.

432
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,750
Let me show you.

433
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,440
What video?

434
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,530
The video we recorded there.

435
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,470
This is a video.

436
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,580
Look. Look at you.

437
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,000
This video is pretty good too.

438
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,110
Send it to me.

439
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,310
I'll take a screenshot and send it to Grandpa.

440
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:31,960
Sure.

441
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,190
Three, two, one.

442
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,850
Screenshot.

443
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:37,790
How is it?

444
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,270
This one's not bad.

445
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,140
You winked like this.

446
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,600
Right?

447
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,530
Okay, I'll go with this one then.

448
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,550
Okay. Let me crop it a bit.

449
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,150
Wow, so sweet.

450
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,350
Don't you think

451
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,110
they look a bit like a married couple?

452
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,720
Are you serious?

453
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,650
My daughter is better looking than him, okay?

454
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,340
But Dr. He is so handsome.

455
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,480
Remember how he caused a stir

456
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,160
in the residents' group chat back then?

457
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,000
I remember.

458
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:06,880
The vibe of this photo is really great.

459
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,720
The vibe is especially good.

460
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,830
Xiangya and Senior Lin took this.

461
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,500
Right?

462
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,210
It's really pretty.

463
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,760
This is good. It's secretly photographed.

464
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,030
Both the people and the scenery are beautiful.

465
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,540
Happy.

466
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,610
I'm envious.

467
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,250
One day, can we also...

468
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,650
You're so ugly,

469
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,280
how could you achieve that effect?

470
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,270
We'll just take a photo together as a memento.

471
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,790
It's not like we're doing it for some other purpose.

472
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,270
Look how beautiful the scenery is.

473
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,720
I'll have to properly edit your photos then.

474
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,440
That's right.

475
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,750
This is like the iron tree blooming,

476
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,550
and spring coming upon a withered tree.

477
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,560
I'm a little shy.

478
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,540
That's wonderful.

479
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,470
You two are truly a couple destined to be together.

480
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,270
It's wonderful, really wonderful.

481
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,440
Oh, by the way,

482
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,920
Shen,

483
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,740
I'm checking out the day after tomorrow.

484
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,640
Ah, what's the matter?

485
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,290
I'm going back to

486
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,800
live with my kids.

487
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,350
This way, I can hang out with my grandchildren every day.

488
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,270
Why so sudden?

489
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,840
Originally, due to the side effects of radiotherapy,

490
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,360
I was worried that I'd trouble them

491
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,920
and they'd be concerned.

492
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,050
So I thought I'd come back to China for a trip.

493
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,490
But during this time,

494
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,690
Dr. He has treated me very well.

495
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,560
I rarely cough now,

496
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,030
and my mental state has improved a lot.

497
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,580
Also, seeing you like this

498
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,550
makes me want to see my kids too.

499
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,230
Xifan.

500
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,600
During this time, really,

501
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
thank you so much for your care.

502
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,800
Not at all.

503
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,350
I'm actually really happy to chat with you.

504
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,380
When are you going to Switzerland?

505
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,310
In October, I guess.

506
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,430
October...

507
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:13,400
If my health condition allows,

508
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,920
I'll go to Switzerland to visit you.

509
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,830
Really?

510
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,170
That'll be great.

511
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,050
I'll send you my location when I get to Switzerland then.

512
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,830
Okay.

513
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,120
There's one more thing.

514
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,670
Could you arrange for me

515
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,810
to see Dr. He one more time?

516
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,870
Preferably

517
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,990
at a time when you can be there too.

518
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,040
Is that okay?

519
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,750
No problem.

520
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,620
Great.

521
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,480
Your lungs and throat have improved a lot now.

522
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,990
You should keep warm in daily life,

523
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,820
and avoid catching cold.

524
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,180
Eat more moisturizing foods,

525
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,040
such as lilies and pears.

526
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,280
Okay.

527
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,360
But most importantly,

528
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,300
you still need to have regular tumor check-ups.

529
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,270
Thank you for your trouble.

530
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,110
Dr. He.

531
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,660
Thank you and Xifan for taking care of me during this time.

532
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,300
I want to give you two

533
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,620
a gift.

534
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,380
Paeonia lactiflora,

535
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,020
also known as "Jiangli" (about to leave).

536
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,990
I'm about to leave,

537
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,400
but I want to leave this affection and blessing with you.

538
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,090
I hope you'll be happy and blessed.

539
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,960
Thank you both.

540
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,630
How's it?

541
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,330
Looks good?

542
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,410
It feels like this wall isn't so empty anymore.

543
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,250
Alright, I'll go wash my hands first.

544
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,480
I'll cook for you in a bit.

545
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:42,980
♫Love love love love, is right in front of me♫

546
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,280
Dr. He, let me do you a favor.

547
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:51,350
♫Ooh love, ooh love, I've seen your face♫

548
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,380
Doesn't it look like a ring?

549
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,400
It's yours now.

550
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,920
I lost that thing you gave me at noon.

551
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:59,170
♫Love love love love, is talking right at me♫

552
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,130
It disappeared right when I got off work.

553
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,570
How about I buy you another one?

554
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:06,420
♫Loving you, loving you, is the best thing I'll ever do♫

555
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,700
He Suye.

556
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,810
What is this?

557
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,710
This... What is this?

558
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,190
I found it on your tool shelf.

559
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,080
Tell me.

560
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,930
Oh, right.

561
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,650
Isn't this the metal ring from your key chain?

562
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,640
I lost it at the time.

563
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,570
Later, I found it under the sofa,

564
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,750
so I just put it away casually.

565
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,110
Wait a minute, casually?

566
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,650
You first casually put it on the tray by the door.

567
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,550
Now you say you casually put it on the tool rack.

568
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,160
Keeping such a small thing for so long.

569
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:52,660
Tell me.

570
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,520
Did you like me from the very beginning?

571
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,320
That makes sense.

572
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,440
I've finally found

573
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,070
the reason why I hid it.

574
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,040
So that's it.

575
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,920
You...

576
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,400
It's obvious you were the one who fell for me first,

577
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,000
yet you're claiming I made a move on you first.

578
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,760
Get back here.

579
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,380
Me liking you and you making a move on me

580
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,750
aren't contradictory.

581
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,350
When you gave this to me as a wedding ring

582
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,110
at that time,

583
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,000
weren't you making a move on me?

584
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,400
Who gave it to you as a wedding ring?

585
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,000
I was just helping you out of a tight spot.

586
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,680
So you admit it.

587
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,860
You did give it to me as a gift.

588
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,700
You made a move on me first.

589
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,410
I'm a man in my thirties.

590
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,640
How could I have resisted such a hint?

591
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,310
So as soon as you gave me a hint, I took the bait, didn't I?

592
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,310
No one was giving you a hint, okay?

593
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,170
Alright, stop talking.

594
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,620
As for this thing,

595
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,090
I've always treasured it.

596
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,350
Now,

597
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,590
I'm going to keep it somewhere else.

598
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,640
He Suye, come here.

599
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,430
I...

600
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,450
Made a move on him first?

601
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,570
What are you carrying?

602
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,440
I brought some medicinal herbs from the clinic.

603
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,810
It's currently the change of seasons, right?

604
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,010
I'm planning to make some new medicated diet for you.

605
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:17,100
Are there any Chinese herbs that can be steeped in water?

606
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,670
I'd like to make tea of it at the hotel.

607
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,170
Licorice root.

608
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,400
That works.

609
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,250
Alright, I'll get you some in a bit.

610
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,480
Licorice root

611
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,800
has a sweet taste and neutral nature.

612
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,870
It clears heat and detoxifies,

613
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,080
tonifies the spleen and boosts qi.

614
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,380
You can take a few slices and steep them in water to drink.

615
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,110
It probably tastes as good as bubble tea.

616
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,750
At 11:45 PM,

617
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,690
he asked, "Still not sleeping?"

618
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,920
Do you think a guy would care

619
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,290
when a woman he's not interested in goes to sleep?

620
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,650
He barely posts on WeChat Moments.

621
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,230
Look.

622
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,940
He posted one about licorice root.

623
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,710
This handsome TCM physician is quite calculating.

624
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,880
He clearly posted it on Moments on purpose

625
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,830
to make you like it, so that he could chat with you.

626
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,590
And what happened?

627
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,890
You're only liking his post from months ago now.

628
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,690
He Suye.

629
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,300
That post on Moments about licorice root from before.

630
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,990
You posted it on purpose, didn't you?

631
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,390
I didn't.

632
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,200
I was having dinner at Grandpa's.

633
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,620
I happened to have some licorice root water,

634
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,210
so I casually posted about it.

635
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,670
Is that so?

636
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:33,090
But Senior Lin said you did it on purpose.

637
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,550
So you listened to him

638
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,790
and started to make a move on me?

639
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,660
I...

640
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,610
In that case,

641
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,600
we should thank Senior Lin.

642
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:52,790
I...

643
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,030
Didn't...

644
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,400
Let's go.

645
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,750
When we get home,

646
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,270
let's give him a call to thank him.

647
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,950
Without him, we wouldn't be together.

648
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,370
I... Made a move on you?

649
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,320
[Honganmen Clinic]

650
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,080
Wait for me a moment.

651
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,510
I have a document to sign.

652
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,429
Okay.

653
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,230
The pharmacy closes at 5 PM.

654
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,960
Pharmacy decoction

655
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,889
takes about four hours.

656
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,810
So,

657
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,280
you can come pick it up at around 2 PM.

658
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,190
I'll leave it here.

659
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,320
-Take care.
-Thank you.

660
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,710
Miss Shen.

661
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,780
Our pharmacy closes at 5 PM.

662
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,880
Pharmacy decoction

663
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,090
takes about four hours.

664
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,230
So,

665
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,940
you can come pick it up at around 2 PM.

666
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,810
Miss Shen, I forgot to remind you.

667
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,520
The pharmacy closes at 5 PM.

668
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,360
Pharmacy decoction

669
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,020
takes four hours.

670
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,350
So,

671
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,739
you can come pick it up at around 2 PM.

672
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,610
Let's go.

673
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,210
What's wrong?

674
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,290
He Suye.

675
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,960
Every time a patient collects medicine,

676
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,030
the pharmacy gives them a reminder, right?

677
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,440
Then that time,

678
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,960
why did you specially come out

679
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,360
to remind me?

680
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,810
I always remind my patients.

681
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,020
Really?

682
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:12,910
Yes.

683
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,730
Really?

684
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,710
Come on, let's go.

685
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,740
Why are you standing here?

686
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:16,960
Really?

687
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,670
Are you lying to me?

688
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,970
What would you like to eat?

689
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,250
Quail eggs, noodles,

690
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
shrimp paste,

691
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,440
fresh tripe, and squid tentacles.

692
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,230
A bit of everything.

693
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,230
And make it two.

694
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,670
Two portions.

695
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,360
And one...

696
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,070
One with spice,

697
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,110
and the other without.

698
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,030
Okay, got it.

699
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,590
Please wait a moment.

700
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,710
Still thinking about it?

701
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,030
Under normal circumstances,

702
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,360
I would remind my patients,

703
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,320
in case Ms. Wu at the pharmacy forgets.

704
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,680
But you left so quickly that day.

705
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,750
I didn't have a chance to remind you before you left.

706
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,130
So I had to

707
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,910
hurry out to remind you.

708
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,030
What if you went there too early

709
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,360
and couldn't get your medicine?

710
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,260
That's not right.

711
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,620
You were wearing a mask when you examined me.

712
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,640
Why did you take it off when you came out?

713
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,320
You don't think I took off my mask on purpose, do you?

714
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,260
Come on.

715
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,070
Doctors in hospitals take off their masks

716
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,150
to get some fresh air too, you know.

717
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,230
I just happened to run into you.

718
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,330
What could I do about it?

719
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,880
Is that so?

720
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,890
What else could it be?

721
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,880
You don't think I took off my mask and came out

722
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,840
to see you out of some ulterior motive, do you?

723
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,350
I think

724
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:54,120
you had ulterior motives from the first time you saw me.

725
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,940
Who's the one with ulterior motives here?

726
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,800
The first time you saw me,

727
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,510
you looked me up and down from head to toe.

728
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,800
Don't think I didn't notice.

729
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,610
Also, the way you looked at me,

730
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,650
it was like this.

731
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,720
Correction. I didn't look at you like that.

732
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,150
I'm a TCM physician.

733
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,320
I was taking your pulse.

734
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,400
I could tell from your pulse.

735
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,510
Besides, I did remind you

736
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,550
to stay calm during pulse taking.

737
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,390
Did you manage to do that?

738
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,300
Alright, let's not say anything more.

739
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Thank you, Boss.

740
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
Chopsticks.

741
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,140
Here.

742
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:32,740
Okay.

743
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,490
Not bad.

744
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,190
Don't eat the spicy one. Eat the one with broth.

745
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,260
He Suye, I need to clarify something.

746
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,800
The first time I saw you,

747
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,280
I didn't have any feelings for you.

748
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,230
Besides, at that time, Yan Heng and I hadn't...

749
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,090
In short,

750
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,110
I had no feelings for you at that time.

751
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,700
I'm a very loyal person. Don't worry.

752
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,400
Okay.

753
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,520
I didn't say you weren't loyal.

754
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,470
I was just joking.

755
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:17,800
Alright, we're done eating.

756
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,990
Let's go home now that we're full.

757
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,500
Let's go.

758
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,080
Boss,

759
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,930
we're leaving.

760
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:23,980
Okay.

761
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,640
Goodbye.

762
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,920
I've finished washing the dishes.

763
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,560
Let me wipe this.

764
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,320
I'll do it.

765
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,550
It's okay. Go play with your phone for a bit.

766
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,890
Go wash your hands,

767
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,350
and apply some hand cream.

768
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,280
What are you up to?

769
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,320
Go.

770
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,190
Why should I wash my hands?

771
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:02,860
Just go.

772
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,370
They're clean now.

773
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:14,990
Feel them.

774
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,970
Feel what?

775
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,150
What do you want to do then?

776
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,110
What's this?

777
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,360
So sudden.

778
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,670
He Suye.

779
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,300
Now that I've got you,

780
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,120
I should take responsibility for you.

781
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,010
That metal ring from before doesn't count.

782
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,170
This time I bought you a real ring.

783
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,540
You put it on the wrong finger.

784
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,670
What are you thinking?

785
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,280
It's too early to put it on that finger, okay?

786
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,360
I thought you were proposing to me.

787
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,060
I got my hopes up for nothing.

788
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,490
No fun.

789
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,350
He Suye.

790
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,590
Even if the ring is on your middle finger,

791
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,150
you

792
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,510
are still mine, Shen Xifan's.

793
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,200
I'll take responsibility for you for the rest of my life.

794
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,300
Are you satisfied now?

795
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,080
I am.

796
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,110
Is it pretty?

797
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,090
Sure it is.

798
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,580
Since I've given you such a beautiful ring,

799
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,850
what reward do you have for me?

800
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,210
What do you want?

801
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,360
How about you go out with me on a trip in a few days when the holiday comes?

802
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,730
Sure.

803
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,500
Wait, no.

804
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,930
It's Qingming Festival in a couple of days.

805
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,290
I need to go visit

806
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,270
my mom's grave.

807
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,420
I'll go early in the morning with my grandpa,

808
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,910
but I'll be back by evening.

809
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,140
Spend some quality time with Professor Yu then.

810
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,870
Let's put this on the tab for now.

811
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,620
Remember to pay me back.
