00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,220

Alright then.

14
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,850
I was thinking about

Hello.

30
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,240
Is there anything I can help you with?

31
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,750
No. I'm just going to have breakfast.

32
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,510
Alright. This way, please.

33
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,700
I want to ask you something.

34
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,370
Are you and He Suye

35
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,240
very close?

36
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,480
He's my boyfriend.

37
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,400
I see.

38
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,390
Good.

39
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,000
So, you...

40
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,690
you haven't been together for long, have you?

41
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,600
He was with me during the Spring Festival.

42
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,720
I never heard him mention you.

43
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,910
Yeah, we started dating after the Spring Festival.

44
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,990
I see.

45
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,130
Well, I'm quite curious.

46
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,230
You two are in completely different professions.

47
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,870
Do you have much to talk about?

48
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,630
Are you saying that

49
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,720
people in different professions

50
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,870
can't be together?

51
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,820
That's not what I mean.

52
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,640
We actually have a lot in common.

53
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,870
For example, this sachet in your hand—

54
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,150
he made it.

55
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,960
It's an anise sachet

56
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,240
that dispels cold and regulates qi.

57
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,040
And the medicated diet in this restaurant,

58
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,430
he and his team designed it.

59
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,400
How do you like it?

60
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,180
It's good, right?

61
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,090
It's excellent.

62
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,720
It's fate

63
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,630
that brought you together.

64
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,850
He Suye

65
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,170
works in oncology.

66
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,360
I'm a physician too,

67
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,560
so I know he has to

68
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,830
deal with life-and-death situations every day.

69
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,750
I'm worried that it might weigh on him.

70
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,190
So, if you can,

71
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,360
please take good care of him.

72
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,180
Don't worry.

73
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,800
Your concern is unnecessary.

74
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,320
Actually, He Suye is a really positive person.

75
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,680
He knows exactly what he wants.

76
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:12,750
Really?

77
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,010
I don't believe it.

78
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,610
I don't

79
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,560
talk to him much,

80
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,410
so I don't really know how he's doing these days.

81
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,790
He's giving a research presentation tomorrow afternoon.

82
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,600
If you can attend it,

83
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,050
he'd be really happy.

84
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,050
Alright.

85
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,030
I'll go eat first.

86
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,420
Okay. Enjoy your breakfast.

87
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,670
By the way,

88
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,300
I found out Mr. He's room number

89
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,800
and told the housekeeping staff

90
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,720
to take extra care of him.

91
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,050
Thanks.

92
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,900
But…

93
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,640
why don't you visit him yourself?

94
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,170
That's not necessary.

95
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,260
I don't have much

96
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,650
to say to him.

97
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,800
As long as he's comfortable staying there, it's enough.

98
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,190
The tension between you and him…

99
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,790
isn't just because you chose TCM, is it?

100
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,390
Does it

101
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,010
have something to do with Mrs. Shen too?

102
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,410
When my mom was fighting cancer,

103
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,020
he was too engrossed in his studies to be around.

104
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,180
Even in her final days,

105
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,970
he barely showed up.

106
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,510
They were college classmates.

107
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,070
My mom was well protected by my grandpa since childhood.

108
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,950
She was naive and innocent.

109
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,560
After he won my mom over,

110
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,060
they got married

111
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,040
and had me.

112
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,310
But he was never ready to take responsibility.

113
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,690
After getting accepted into a master's program in Bei City,

114
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,680
he made my mom leave Hang City to be with him.

115
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,160
But once they got there,

116
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,720
he threw himself into his studies and research,

117
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,000
leaving my mom to fend for herself.

118
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,780
Not only did she have to finish her own studies,

119
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,880
but she also had to take care of me.

120
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,510
Day after day, the exhaustion and stress piled up,

121
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,430
and she developed breast cancer.

122
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,120
She passed away before she even turned 40.

123
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,250
It's been so many years.

124
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,200
I've gotten used to this kind of relationship with him.

125
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,720

There's no need to be dressy.

133
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,630
I'll just throw on something casual.

134
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,280
No way! You have to look sharp.

135
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,010
Hurry up and finish this.

136
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,110
Then I'll help you pick an outfit.

163
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,870
Nowadays, for most

164
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,360
breast cancer patients,

165
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,320
various clinical symptoms

166
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,600
significantly impact their quality of life.

167
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,840
However,

168
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,480
current medical efforts tend to

169
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,630
prioritize tumor control

170
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,840
and extending lifespan,

171
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,750
while the improvement of patients' overall well-being…

172
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,790
You startled me.

173
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,480
You came just in time. It just began.

174
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,000
From this chart, we can see that

175
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
TCM has distinct advantages

176
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,150
in symptom management.

177
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,840
Therefore, this time,

178
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,120
my team and I

179
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,910
chose to explore the use of TCM therapies

180
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,440
for late-stage breast cancer patients

181
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,750

182
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,670
As shown

183
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,270
in the table,

184
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,790
there is a significant improvement

185
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,630
in symptom scores for TCM treatments

186
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,910
and in alleviating cancer-related fatigue.

187
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,820
Therefore, our study concludes that

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,550
not only extends the lifespan

191
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,080
of late-stage breast cancer patients

192
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,670
and helps control

193
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,840
tumor progression

194
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,130
-but also enhances their quality of life.
-I gotta go.

195
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,940
It effectively alleviates clinical symptoms

196
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,030
and mitigates treatment-related

197
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,480
adverse effects.

198
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,790
At last, I sincerely thank

199
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,630
all my colleagues and patients who participated in this study.

200
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,360
That concludes my presentation.

201
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,630
I look forward to

202
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,120
your critiques and guidance.

203
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,830
Thank you.

204
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,050
Thank you, Dr. He Suye,

205
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,240
for this insightful

206
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,550
presentation.

207
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,720
I'm sure

208
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,840
everyone has noticed

209
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,270
how outstanding Dr. He Suye is.

210
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,030
He's a true role model for young doctors.

211
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,720
We should all learn from him.

212
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,030
It's from a fan of yours.

213
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,600
Alright. Next,

214
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,390
let's move on

215
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,210
to the next physician

216
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,910
in the TCM session

217
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,210
who will share his insights with us.

218
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,400
I bet you've all heard about him.

219
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,180
With a strong foundation in clinical practice…

220
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,170
Grandpa, I have to go out for a moment.

221
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,320
He's also the youngest doctoral advisor

222
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,120
in cardiology in the country.

223
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,630
Let's welcome him with applause.

224
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,200
The conference is almost over.

225
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Have Food & Beverage come over

226
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,870
to deal with the leftover food.

227
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,220
And once the event ends tonight, clear out the venue.

228
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,250
Don't leave anything behind.

229
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
I'll get back to work.

230
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,200
Bye-bye.

231
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,720
Xifan.

232
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,480
You're already here.

233
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,060
Why are you leaving without telling me?

234
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,710
He Suye.

235
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,930
He Suye.

236
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,530
There are too many people here.

237
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,230
I just wanted to see your presentation.

238
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,000
If I had stayed,

239
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,640
I might have gotten in the way of your work.

240
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,119
So, how do you think I did?

241
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,730
I think

242
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:25,510
you totally did justice to the outfit I picked for you.

243
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,390
My boyfriend looks super handsome today.

244
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,320
Of course. Who do you think picked this outfit for me?

245
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,510
By the way,

246
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,320
did you see

247
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,590
Mr. Shen in there?

248
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,030
You invited him?

249
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,670
I ran into him last night.

250
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,200
We talked for a bit.

251
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,170
He's really concerned about your work and your life.

252
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,840
How about this?

253
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,800
Tonight,

254
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,430
let's have dinner together.

255
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,800
I'd love to get to know Mr. Shen.

256
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:05,730
What do you say?

257
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,920
What do you say?

258
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,880
Dinner?

259
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,110
Maybe next time.

260
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,550
Mr. He.

261
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,590
Your research topic is great.

262
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,320
It has great academic value.

263
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,080
Thank you.

264
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,480
Actually, in the future,

265
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,330
combining cardiac surgery with TCM

266
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,140
could also be a promising direction.

267
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,260
Alright, you two chat.

268
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,170
I won't disturb you anymore.

269
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,840
He Suye.

270
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,650
Dad.

271
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,600
Are you free tonight?

272
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,400
How about

273
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,010
we have dinner together?

274
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,350
Sure.

275
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,360
I happen to be free tonight.

276
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,450
I'll make the arrangements.

277
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,570
Okay.

278
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,030
Come on.

279
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,860
Thank you.

280
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,680
This restaurant has been around for a long time.

281
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,080
The flavors are on the lighter side.

282
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,010
I'm not sure if you all will like it.

283
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,350
These dishes are good.

284
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,550
They adjust their menu according to the seasons,

285
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,440
offering medicinal dishes that clear heat and eliminate dampness.

286
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,750
Given what you said,

287
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,270
Shen,

288
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,480
you seem to know quite a bit about TCM.

289
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,480
Not really, just the basics.

290
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,920
I took Chinese medicine for a while before,

291
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,490
and I also worked on

292
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,210
a medicated diet project with He Suye.

293
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,150
You took Chinese medicine?

294
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,480
You were dealing with some health issues?

295
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,240
I had insomnia at the time.

296
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,280
She had trouble sleeping for over half a year.

297
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,680
I helped her with it,

298
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,850
and she's much better now.

299
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,000
The two of them

300
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,150
met when she was seeking treatment.

301
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:02,810
Really?

302
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,270
It must be fate.

303
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,350
One day,

304
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,400
Suye came back all excited,

305
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,850
telling me about a strange patient he met.

306
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,740
This patient

307
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,320
knew a lot about medicinal herbs

308
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,410
and even bargained with Suye,

309
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,200
insisting on writing her own prescription.

310
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,430
What kind of patient was that?

311
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,900
So I told him, "Don't treat her.

312
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,170
Let her find another doctor."

313
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,120
But Suye wouldn't listen.

314
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,000
Instead, he told me it was a young lady

315
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,240
and went on and on about

316
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,400
how beautiful and elegant she was.

317
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,700
Then I realized—

318
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,130
this wasn't about treating a patient.

319
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,460
He had other intentions.

320
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,420
He was interested in the girl.

321
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,810
Enough, Grandpa.

322
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,240
Here. Let's not talk about that.

323
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,700
Here.

324
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,080
Interesting.

325
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,160
Your desserts are here.

326
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,370
Here come the desserts.

327
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,840
Thank you.

328
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,200
Alright.

329
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,110
Please enjoy.

330
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,200
What kind of soup is this?

331
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,650
It's a soup made with lily bulbs, lotus seeds, and fox nuts.

332
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,370
He Suye specifically ordered it.

333
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,170
Fox nut soup?

334
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,550
Yes.

335
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,600
I had this soup a lot as a kid.

336
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,270
Your mom loved

337
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,240
making this for us.

338
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,480
Back when we first moved to Bei City,

339
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,200
she really loved fox nuts,

340
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,440
but it was hard to find fresh ones at the market.

341
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,050
So she bought dried fox nuts to make soup for us instead.

342
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,140
This is authentic.

343
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,330
Try it.

344
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,150
Does it taste like it did when you were young?

345
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,790
Delicious?

346
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,270
Shen, how old are you?

347
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,070
I'm 28.

348
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,680
You're not very young.

349
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,660
I want to ask—

350
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,060
do you two plan to get married?

351
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,640
There's no rush.

352
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,900
Xifan is going to study abroad in October.

353
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,180
We'll think about marriage after she comes back.

354
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,440
Every generation

355
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,610
has its own way of life.

356
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,550
For young people these days,

357
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,060
falling in love is simply about following their hearts.

358
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,280
As for marriage,

359
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,980
it's more of a contractual agreement between two people.

360
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,270
It's an important life decision.

361
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,240
At my age…

362
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:06,960
Well…

363
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,440
I…

364
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,310
Have some soup.

365
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,350
Okay, okay.

366
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,000
While it's hot.

367
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,770
So sweet.

368
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,920
No hard feelings.

369
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,230
I was just asking.

370
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,640
It's fine.

371
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,850
I'll be back soon.

372
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,640
Okay.

373
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,500
Dad.

374
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,450
You came at the right time.

375
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,000
This is my first time having dinner with her.

376
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,220
I shouldn't have pushed you for marriage.

377
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,250
Can you explain it to her for me?

378
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,850
It's okay. She's very understanding.

379
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,590
She won't mind.

380
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,790
That's good.

381
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,390
I really think she's a great girl.

382
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,670
Don't let her slip away.

383
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:56,940
I know.

384
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,770
How are things between you two?

385
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,230
Pretty good.

386
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,410
Well,

387
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,130
we haven't been together for very long,

388
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,740
so we still need more time

389
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,180
to get to know each other better.

390
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,900
I don't want her to

391
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,380
regret being with me.

392
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,110
That's right.

393
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,490
It's a big life decision, after all.

394
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,120
You have to think it through

395
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,120
and consider every aspect.

396
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,420
It's being responsible to yourself and to her.

397
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,160
Don't end up like your mom and me.

398
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,590
Dad.

399
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,580
Let's not

400
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,570
bring up the past.

401
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,440
Well,

402
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,020
let's stay in touch.

403
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,510
I'll keep you updated if anything comes up.

404
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,350
Thank you.

405
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,950
When's your flight tomorrow?

406
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,170
Do you want to

407
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,710
visit Mom with me?

408
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,000
I'm leaving in the afternoon.

409
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,880
Don't worry about it.

410
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,450
I'll go see her by myself in the morning.

411
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,350
Alright.

412
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,310
Also, I found some papers

413
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,070
on combining cardiac surgery with TCM.

414
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,280
I'll send them to you later.

415
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,440
If you have time,

416
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,240
take a look.

417
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,300
If you're interested,

418
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,830
maybe we can study

419
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,770
and discuss it together

420
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,900
in the future.

421
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,000
Thank you.

422
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,170
He Suye.

423
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,610
When Mr. Shen was drinking the fox nut soup,

424
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,700
it seemed like you wanted to say something.

425
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,060
I just thought of my mom.

426
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,590
When she made this soup,

427
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,640
she always set aside a bowl of it for my dad,

428
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,310
saying he loved it very much.

429
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,960
Turns out,

430
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,960
they always cared for each other.

431
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,000
Xifan.

432
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,480
I have something for you.

433
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,310
This bracelet

434
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,750
was left to me by my mom.

435
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,100
Let me put it on you.

436
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,960
Why are you suddenly giving this to me?

437
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,320
I just suddenly feel…

438
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,440
that I love you so much.

439
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,510
♫Watching the snow fall, flake by flake♫

440
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,020
♫Slowly melting away my thoughts♫

441
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,200
I love you too.

442
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,500
♫Smiling, I wave goodbye as you head home♫

443
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,260
♫But I never said those words♫

444
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,810
♫Watching the snow fall, flake by flake♫

445
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:34,730
♫When will love bloom into a flower?♫

446
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:40,440
♫You wander the world, forgetting to reply♫

447
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,220
♫When you turn around, I'll be right there♫

448
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:55,820
Thank you.

449
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,680
Give me more of those little rice balls.

450
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,200
Okay.

451
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,350
As you wish.

452
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,310
That's delicious.

453
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,500
Try it.

454
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,150
Did you add sugar?

455
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,740
Yeah.

456
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,150
It's hot.

457
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:25,980
What are you doing?

458
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,500
It's hot.

459
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,060
Give it to me.

460
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,590
It's hot.

461
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,460
It's not sweet enough.

462
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,950
It's really not sweet enough.

463
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,630
Add more sugar.

464
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,060
It's…

465
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,500
It's too sweet!

466
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,220
It doesn't taste good.

467
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,020
Stop. No more sugar.

468
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,590
I mean it.

469
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,430
Enough, enough.

470
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,920
Add more sugar.

471
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,780
Come on.

472
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,150
Enough, enough.

473
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,480
You're back.

474
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,620
I didn't hear you come in.

475
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,870
Oh my goodness.

476
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,220
It's from Dr. He?

477
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,740
He's so sweet.

478
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,700
He really knows how to pick gifts.

479
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,190
Look how perfectly this bracelet suits

480
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,520
our daughter's temperament.

481
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,670
Ms. Shen, your mom thinks it's not sweet enough.

482
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,260
Try a sip.

483
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,670
Is it good?

484
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,430
It's just right.

485
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,780
Because I added sugar just now.

486
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,830
She agrees with me.

487
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,670
I've already added a spoonful of sugar.

488
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,740
Try it again.

489
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,430
It has more sugar now.

490
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,630
I want a little rice ball.

491
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:17,890
Okay.

492
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,630
Good?

493
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:21,980
Here.

494
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,140
This bowl

495
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,430
is for your mom.

496
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,910
Let me get a bowl of it for you.

497
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,980
Alright. Just leave me here.

498
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,870
Give it to me.

499
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,300
You've taken such good care of me.

500
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,830
Thank you.

501
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,060
Not at all. It's my job.

502
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,290
Please, look out for Suye.

503
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,430
Don't worry.

504
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,450
If you have time, you should visit more often.

505
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,090
He Suye really cares about you.

506
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,900
Anyway, I'm really glad

507
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,010
to see you two together.

508
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:16,930
Oh, right,

509
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,150
I suddenly brought up marriage yesterday.

510
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,190
I didn't scare you, did I?

511
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,750
It's alright.

512
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,130
Good. I'll be going now.

513
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:26,940
Goodbye.

514
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:38,930
Alright.

515
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,100
Mr. He has checked out and left for the airport.

516
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,950
I want to see you.

517
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,070
Where's the bracelet?

518
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,230
The hotel has a dress code—

519
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,270
no jewelry during work hours.

520
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:22,980
Okay.

521
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,429
Dr. He,

522
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,060
you're smiling.

523
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,659
Are you texting your girlfriend?

524
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,909
You look so happy.

525
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,460
He, He.

526
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,179
Look.

527
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,620
Your photo from yesterday's presentation

528
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,980
was posted on the hospital's official account.

529
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,540
Not bad. You look pretty sharp.

530
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,350
My girlfriend picked that outfit for me.

531
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,040
Dr. He, that's too much.

532
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,090
I talked to you about work,

533
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,810
and you answered something about your outfit.

534
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,340
Did I ask about your outfit?

535
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,810
Did I?

536
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,660
Dr. Song,

537
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,500
what's bothering you isn't his outfit

538
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,380
but the fact that he has a girlfriend.

539
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,880
Head Nurse, it's a bit rude of you to say that.

540
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,060
I used to worry about his love life.

541
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,130
Now it's your turn.

542
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,230
Look how happy he is now,

543
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,840
and look at you.

544
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,860
You really need to step it up.

545
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,480
What more can I do to step it up?

546
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,540
I've done everything I could.

547
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,880
You know what?

548
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,170
I dream about getting into a relationship.

549
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,270
I can't even imagine

550
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,350
how well I'd treat my girlfriend

551
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,660
if I ever got one.

552
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,350
Why is it that someone as outstanding as me

553
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,980
doesn't have a girlfriend?

554
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,830
Here. It's done.

555
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,670
I'm off duty.

556
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,230
You stay here and reflect on that.

557
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,090
Keep me company for a bit.

558
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,430
Remember the girl I introduced you to last time?

559
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,140
How do you like her?

560
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,660
Don't you start.

561
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,390
She blocked me.

562
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,020
See for yourself.

563
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,350
I have no idea why.

564
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,520
No way!

565
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,890
She really blocked me.

566
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,810
Look.

567
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,880
You're just unreliable.

568
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,980
What did you say to her?

569
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,660
It's your fault. This is on you.

570
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,950
You owe me a meal.

571
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,060
Come on. Stop wasting time.

572
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,100
Let's go, let's go.

573
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,910
We're heading out!

574
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,020
Where are you going?

575
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,950
Didn't you tell her?

576
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,140
Weren't you supposed to tell her?

577
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,350
I forgot.

578
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,580
We're going to a farm stay with my colleagues.

579
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,750
We'll be back tomorrow evening.

580
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,620
Okay.

581
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,140
What are you doing?

582
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,360
Just crunching some numbers.

583
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,550
I did the math.

584
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,230
If I work for two more months,

585
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,800
I'll have enough for my living expenses.

586
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,310
And with some commission,

587
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,100
I can quit my job next month.

588
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,180
No need to calculate.

589
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,140
If you're short on money,

590
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,660
your dad has a secret stash. Ask him for help.

591
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,060
No secret stash.

592
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,180
He'd be more than happy to help.

593
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,980
He said it himself.

594
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,350
No secret stash.

595
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,140
While we're not at home,

596
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,430
what do you plan to do?

597
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,480
I'm gonna go out to eat something nice

598
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,130
and then ask He Suye out for a date.

599
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,270
A date is fine,

600
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,620
but come home early

601
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,950
and get enough rest.

602
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,750
Got it, got it.

603
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,540
Don't worry.

604
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,910
You two have fun.

605
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,750
Alright!

606
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,910
Bye-bye.

607
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,290
Let's go.

608
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,500
Bring a gift back for me.

609
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,270
Sure!

610
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,320
What gift? What's there to buy at a farm stay?

611
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,150
Cornbread, maybe.

612
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,310
This place

613
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,390
was recommended by Xifan.

614
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,270
Try the food.

615
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,950
It's not bad, right?

616
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,060
How is it?

617
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,020
Delicious.

618
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,830
Let's have a toast.

619
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,220
Here is to another successfully completed major event!

620
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,200
Congratulations!

621
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,180
Are you sure there are no more big events coming up?

622
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,000
Absolutely sure.

623
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,280
Then I can finally relax and wait to resign.

624
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,830
Xifan,

625
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,310
when are you resigning?

626
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,540
I can't wait.

627
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,660
I'm planning to resign next month.

628
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,020
After I wrap up the OA system and the handover,

629
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,230
it'll be around August.

630
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,820
Then I can properly prepare for studying abroad.

631
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,950
Sounds like a solid plan.

632
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,500
Well,

633
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,870
Dr. He, I want to ask you something.

634
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:17,710
If…

635
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,100
If I were to open

636
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,750
a medicinal cuisine restaurant,

637
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,090
would you be willing to be my consultant?

638
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,390
And about the ingredient supply.

639
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,790
That herbal farm we visited last time,

640
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,310
do you think they could be my supplier?

641
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,980
Of course, no problem at all.

642
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,270
But what made you suddenly want to do that?

643
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,580
She just wants to take on a challenging business.

644
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,270
Well, a client of mine

645
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,140
owns a restaurant,

646
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,460
but it isn't doing well.

647
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,870
So he wants me to take over as the general manager,

648
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,980
basically meaning

649
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,980
I'll run the restaurant for him.

650
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,310
That way, I don't have to worry about rent,

651
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,980
and I get a lot of decision-making power.

652
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,780
Isn't that great?

653
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,240
I've already secured a professional consultant.

654
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,910
Aren't I super reliable?

655
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,270
Yeah, absolutely.

656
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,100
Super reliable.

657
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:02,930
Come on.

658
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,300
Let's raise a toast to our handsome Dr. He.

659
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,500
What for?

660
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,350
About the consulting fee

661
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,660
and the prices of medicinal ingredients,

662
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,310
can you maybe…

663
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,060
give her a little discount?

664
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,410
Of course. It's my family's business.

665
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,500
I should be thanking you instead.

666
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,910
Your family's business?

667
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,020
Yep.

668
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,420
It's his family's business.

669
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,870
When he invited us to that herbal farm,

670
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,790
he actually meant to show off.

671
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,910
I just didn't catch on.

672
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,350
No. My grandpa wanted to show off.

673
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:29,910
Fine, fine,

674
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,750
it was your grandpa's idea.

675
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,710
Alright.

676
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,310
A toast to you all!

677
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:32,950
Cheers!

678
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,750
So the herbal farm belongs to you.

679
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,100
To my grandpa.

680
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,310
Why not get married on the mountain?

681
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,750
Your family owns three mountains.

682
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,310
Thank you for using WeChat Pay.

683
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,950
That's done. I'll get you the receipt in a moment.

684
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,660
Thank you very much.

685
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,430
Let me pay. Let me pay.

686
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,450
I already paid.

687
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,020
You should've let me pay.

688
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,440
I didn't make it last time you went drinking,

689
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,620
so I should pay for it this time.

690
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,630
Next time it's on me.

691
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,170
Okay.

692
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,850
Are you worrying about Xiangya's business?

693
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,770
Yeah, a little.

694
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,020
You know how she is—

695
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,390
impulsive,

696
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,140
and…

697
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,980
she doesn't always think things through.

698
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,660
I'm just worried that if she runs into problems,

699
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,710
she'll be stressed out.

700
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,880
Isn't that exactly

701
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,430
where you come in?

702
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,830
That's true.

703
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,690
What do you think about Xifan studying abroad?

704
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,870
I'm not too worried.

705
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,180
I don't want her to have regrets.

706
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:47,000
So whatever she wants to do,

707
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,470
whether it's studying abroad or anything else, I'll fully support her.

708
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,820
Alright, don't overthink it.

709
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:56,650
They're waiting for us.

710
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:57,760
Let's go.

711
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,140
What are you thinking about?

712
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,490
Even though I've planned for a while

713
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,650
that Xiangya and I would resign after the medical summit,

714
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,950
today is the first time it feels real.

715
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,050
We're really going to part ways.

716
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,770
After graduating from university,

717
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,790
we started working at the hotel together.

718
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,980
And now, maybe as Senior Lin said,

719
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,460
he's going to work all alone at Gunan Huating.

720
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,610
Sticking to the same job

721
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,140
for seven years

722
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,780
right out of college—

723
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,640
that's not easy.

724
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:42,730
And through all these years,

725
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,500
you've looked after each other

726
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,710
and accompanied each other.

727
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,950
These years are indeed memorable.

728
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:56,100
Seven years, a full seven years.

729
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,460
I guess I can say my career at Gunan Huating

730
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,870
has come to a perfect close.

731
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,390
What do you mean?

732
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,700
Think about it. I achieved my career goals.

733
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,340
I got to see you give a presentation

734
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,820
at a major event.

735
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,710
And I even witnessed you making peace with Mr. He.

736
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,450
I genuinely feel happy

737
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:21,950
and content.

738
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,390
Yeah.

739
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,450
I genuinely…

740
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,770
feel content too.
