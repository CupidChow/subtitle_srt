00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,979
[The Best Thing]

2
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,750
[Episode 15: Red beans are sweet and sour in taste and neutral in nature. They promote urination, reduce swelling, clear toxins, and expel pus.]

3
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,079
What's wrong? You're scared to see me?

4
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,590
Why are you scared?

5
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,210
Because my mom told me

6
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,680
to behave well my first time here

7
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,280
and not to be a nuisance.

8
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,070
I have something for you.

9
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,510
Take it.

10
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,160
When I came back,

11
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,570
I forgot to buy you a gift.

12
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
So take this lucky money

13
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,240
and buy yourself something you like.

14
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,640
Consider it my gift to you.

15
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,280
Thank you, Dr. He.

16
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:23,920
You're such a good boy.

17
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,880
Everyone likes you.

18
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,360
How long are you staying?

19
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,150
About three more days.

20
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,590
Are you leaving?

21
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,730
I need to go back to work.

22
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,510
So I'll be leaving.

23
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,470
Have fun here with the other kids.

24
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,230
I'm leaving.

25
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,590
Bye-bye, Dr. He.

26
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,770
Bye-bye.

27
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,170
Go.

28
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,280
Go.

29
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,710
Everything's packed?

30
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,200
Be safe on the road.

31
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,990
I drank a bit too much last night.

32
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,750
Don't take what I said to heart.

33
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,270
I know.

34
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,400
People are honest when they're drunk.

35
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,430
Alright.

36
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,530
I'll be going then.

37
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,630
Okay.

38
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,100
I'm back. I have something for you.

39
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,330
I was just about to go downstairs for a walk.

40
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,990
Let's meet at the park, shall we?

41
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,860
These are for you.

42
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,670
Oh, right.

43
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:10,910
And this too.

44
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,640
Xiangya told me everything.

45
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,530
I think you really need this right now.

46
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,270
Actually, Xifan's love life

47
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,570
is pretty simple.

48
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,300
She only had a seven-year relationship with her first love.

49
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,800
They broke up last year.

50
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,240
They lived in different cities for a long time.

51
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,510
Towards the end, she was in a really bad state.

52
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,140
She's scared of getting hurt again.

53
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,720
All blockages build up over time.

54
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,280
When there's stagnation, there's pain.

55
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,260
Red beans help

56
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,360
clear stagnation and heal sores.

57
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,510
They can also help improve your mood.

58
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,310
What's wrong?

59
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,120
I'm just thinking…

60
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,780
Why aren't you angry?

61
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,750
Maybe because

62
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,950
I've been through something similar.

63
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,830
So I can relate.

64
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,760
After I was dumped,

65
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,680
I was self-destructive for a while.

66
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,510
During that period, I ate medicinal food every day

67
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,750
for more than a year.

68
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,920
It worked pretty well.

69
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,830
But later, I realized that

70
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,950
while medicinal food does help,

71
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,630
the most important thing

72
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,159
is to get back

73
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,130
to a normal routine with regular meals.

74
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,160
So it's the same for you.

75
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,170
Don't think you're not good enough.

76
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,040
Don't think you have no value.

77
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,480
You're just hurt

78
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,600
by a bad relationship.

79
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,510
Love yourself

80
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,100
and live well. That's the most important thing.

81
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,560
You can take your time with everything else.

82
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,850
That said,

83
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,600
if possible,

84
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,150
I do hope

85
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,960
you can heal a little faster.

86
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:02,820
♫Loving you is the best thing I've ever done♫

87
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,160
♫Among the vast sea of people, you and I understand each other♫

88
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,660
♫Missing you is the most beautiful thing in my life♫

89
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,320
Next time you have red beans,

90
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,390
send me a photo.

91
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:24,340
♫Write it down in your heart and never disappear♫

92
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,630
Here, have some tea.

93
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,630
You didn't argue with him when you went back for the Spring Festival, did you?

94
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,240
No. He barely had time for me.

95
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,750
He found himself a girlfriend.

96
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,750
She seems nice,

97
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,380
and they get along fine.

98
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,270
Your mom's been gone for so long.

99
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,630
Some things are better left in the past.

100
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,440
I've let it go.

101
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,060
Why can't you?

102
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,600
At your dad's age,

103
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,790
it's understandable for him to find someone to share his life with.

104
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,450
Just let him be.

105
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,840
I know.

106
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,030
How about this?

107
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,700
I'll come here every year

108
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,960
to celebrate the Spring Festival with you two.

109
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,480
It's not like he needs me there anyway.

110
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,830
Alright, suit yourself.

111
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,720
By the way,

112
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,360
Fang

113
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,510
told me she wants to change her field of study for her PhD.

114
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,080
Do you know why?

115
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,150
That's what she told you?

116
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,510
Did you not mentor her properly during her internship?

117
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,790
She's dedicated and hardworking.

118
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,510
She has a promising future.

119
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,840
Did you not guide her well?

120
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,870
I…

121
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,360
Look at you.

122
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,910
You haven't even asked her yourself,

123
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,030
and you don't know the reason,

124
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,320
yet you're already blaming me.

125
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,870
I'm not blaming you.

126
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,550
I just don't want

127
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,550
her talent to be wasted.

128
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,960
Don't worry. It won't be.

129
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,910
She must have

130
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,630
her own reasons for this decision.

131
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,080
But since it concerns her future,

132
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,200
you should think it over for her.

133
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,330
You don't need to remind me of that.

134
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,080
Cheers!

135
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,790
Today, we're gathered here

136
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,030
to celebrate

137
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,540
that my supplementary application materials

138
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,500
have been approved.

139
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,480
Congratulations.

140
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,960
Congratulations on your dream coming true.

141
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,910
Thank you.

142
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,630
By the way,

143
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,910
when does the semester start?

144
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,480
I remember overseas programs usually begin in February.

145
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,630
February or October.

146
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,550
If it's February, that's coming up soon.

147
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,360
You better start preparing now,

148
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,910
or you might not have time to get your visa.

149
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,840
Actually, today,

150
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,910
I want to ask you two for advice on something.

151
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,530
Go ahead.

152
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,510
I want to go in October.

153
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,960
The college allows students to secure their admission

154
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,410
as long as they pay the tuition in advance.

155
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,890
So I have two options now:

156
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,840
February or October.

157
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,270
Why wait until October?

158
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,240
Go early and come back early.

159
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,390
There are two reasons.

160
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,270
First,

161
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,390
I've only just saved enough for tuition.

162
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,720
I'm still a bit short on living expenses,

163
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,440
so I think I'll work a little longer and save up more.

164
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,120
Can't your parents help out a bit?

165
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,510
I don't want to ask them for help.

166
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,790
They're both in their fifties now

167
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,870
and will retire soon.

168
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,630
Besides, studying abroad

169
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,270
was my decision in the first place.

170
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,150
And the other reason?

171
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,550
Well,

172
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,550
it's been six and a half years since I joined Gunan Huating Hotel.

173
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,510
If I leave in October,

174
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,540
it'll be seven years,

175
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,750
and I'll have worked for exactly one year

176
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,000
as the front office manager.

177
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,270
That way,

178
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,960
my resume will look more complete.

179
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,720
After all that explanation,

180
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,320
it doesn't seem

181
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,030
to have anything to do with Dr. He.

182
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,200
Are you sure it has nothing to do with Dr. He?

183
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,870
Congratulations on getting your offer!

184
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,360
Cheers!

185
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,720
It tastes so good.

186
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,600
Eat up.

187
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,530
Oh, right.

188
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,360
I want to run something by you two.

189
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,120
Go ahead.

190
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,630
I want to go abroad in October,

191
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,200
which means I'll leave in October

192
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,240
and come back next August.

193
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:11,960
Is that okay?

194
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,480
Of course.

195
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,440
I have no objections.

196
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,630
That way,

197
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,760
you'll have plenty of time

198
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,480
and won't have to worry about your visa and such.

199
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,710
Right. But

200
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,150
when you come back from abroad,

201
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,600
you'll be 29.

202
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,670
I'll be 29 sooner or later anyway.

203
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,730
We're celebrating.

204
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,750
I'll have another drink.

205
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,150
Come on.

206
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,390
Let's have another toast.

207
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,580
Let's clink glasses again.

208
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,720
Cheers!

209
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,370
Congratulations.

210
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,520
It's so good.

211
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,240
-I'd like a little more.
-Eat up.

212
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,550
Great news.

213
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,320
My parents have agreed

214
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
to my going abroad in October.

215
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,510
That's great. Everything is going smoothly.

216
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,750
It's a good sign.

217
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,270
By the way,

218
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,590
make sure to inform everyone who needs to know.

219
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,440
Got it.

220
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,720
That's it.

221
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,600
Don't drag it out.

222
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,440
Bye-bye.

223
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,390
Bye-bye.

224
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,630
How should I tell him?

225
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,720
If I say I won't leave until October,

226
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,270
will it sound like I'm implying something?

227
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,870
Dr. He.

228
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,790
I…

229
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,650
Dr. He,

230
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,150
I got my offer.

231
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,900
This October, I will...

232
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,710
How do I even bring this up?

233
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,790
No.

234
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,520
[Typing…]

235
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,270
What does he want to say?

236
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,250
Thank you for today.

237
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,000
If anything else comes up, I'll contact you again.

238
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,540
Alright.

239
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,070
Thank you.

240
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,600
Ms. Liu.

241
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,020
Why don't we go to the hospital for a check-up?

242
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,310
The staff happened to be cleaning the courtyard today.

243
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,200
What if next time

244
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,850
you're alone in the room?

245
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,510
I'm quite worried.

246
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,400
My cough and chest tightness

247
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,510
are the after-effects

248
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,440
of my lung cancer treatment overseas years ago.

249
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,400
Going to the hospital again

250
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,070
means a whole ordeal—

251
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,440
blood transfusions, hospital stays, and surgery.

252
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,880
I really don't want

253
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,820
to go through all that again.

254
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,560
Ms. Liu, I know a TCM physician

255
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,960
who specializes in oncology.

256
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,710
Maybe he can help you.

257
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,590
He once told me

258
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,510
that TCM treatments are mostly

259
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,360
herbal medicine, acupuncture, moxibustion, and cupping.

260
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,200
They don't sound too overwhelming.

261
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,300
You could at least check it out.

262
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,710
Even if he can't cure you,

263
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,880
if he can ease the symptoms,

264
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,960
wouldn't that still be a good thing?

265
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,110
Does TCM help with the after-effects of radiation therapy?

266
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,630
I'm not sure,

267
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,270
but I can ask him for you.

268
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,160
Alright, please do.

269
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
No problem.

270
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,480
Dr. He,

271
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,160
can I ask you some questions?

272
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,880
Take your medicine on time.

273
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,680
Thank you.

274
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,680
Sure, go ahead.

275
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,440
There's a guest at our hotel

276
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,220
who's in her seventies and had lung cancer before.

277
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,040
She should be fully recovered now,

278
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,480
but she often coughs and experiences chest tightness.

279
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,920
Are they the after-effects of the surgery?

280
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,790
It's possible.

281
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,160
But since she had lung cancer before,

282
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,480
the situation is quite complex.

283
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,550
I need to see her in person

284
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,540
to make a more specific assessment.

285
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,640
Okay.

286
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,240
But she's not willing

287
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,440
to be hospitalized or undergo surgery.

288
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,310
Would TCM be an option?

289
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,000
Yes.

290
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,140
Bring her to the hospital to see me.

291
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,550
I see patients in the afternoon.

292
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,920
Try to come early.

293
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,960
Okay.

294
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,600
I'll set up a time with her and let you know.

295
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,640
Your medical records?

296
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,080
♫Never know what to do♫

297
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,580
♫In the times, I'm with you♫

298
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,590
♫Never know what to say♫

299
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,970
♫In the hours, I'm with you♫

300
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,880
Wait outside for a moment.

301
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,070
Alright.

302
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,540
♫All I know, that it's true♫

303
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,290
♫That it's true♫

304
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,880
Alright, thank you.

305
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,110
Ms. Liu, you're staying in Gunan Huating?

306
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,350
Yes, it's been quite a while.

307
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,580
Almost half a year now.

308
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,510
From your medical records,

309
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,400
you had radiation therapy the year before last.

310
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,770
After your discharge, you've been having chest tightness, shortness of breath,

311
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,280
and a cough, right?

312
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,440
Is it serious?

313
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,310
Not very.

314
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,830
The cough gets worse

315
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,200
when I don't get enough rest.

316
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,880
Do you have a CT scan I can look at?

317
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,600
I have it.

318
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,310
This isn't a digital copy.

319
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,480
It's just a photo of the scan.

320
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,110
This won't do. It's not clear enough.

321
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,700
Ms. Liu, I'll need you to get another CT scan.

322
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,250
Another one?

323
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,010
Since we're already here,

324
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,410
we might as well get everything done in one go.

325
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,420
Okay.

326
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,270
I'll accompany you.

327
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:05,990
No need.

328
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Fang, take Ms. Liu

329
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
to get her CT scan done.

330
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,640
No, no.

331
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,750
I can go with her.

332
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,400
No need. I'm worried you and Ms. Liu might get lost.

333
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:15,850
Fang,

334
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,480
go with Ms. Liu.

335
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,590
Okay.

336
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,680
Thank you.

337
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,840
Ms. Liu, this way, please.

338
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,590
It's been several weeks since your last follow-up visit.

339
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,640
How have you been feeling lately?

340
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,200
Pretty good.

341
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,110
Let me check your pulse.

342
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,640
How's your plan to study abroad coming along?

343
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,440
The Spring Festival is over.

344
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,790
Have you received your offer?

345
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,000
I've received the offer.

346
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,790
That's great news.

347
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,350
Why didn't you tell me?

348
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,240
What about your visa? Have you got it?

349
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,590
Actually…

350
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,880
I'm not leaving until October.

351
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,110
You said February before.

352
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,510
Why the sudden change?

353
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,640
At that time…

354
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,400
I didn't know I could choose the semester,

355
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
so I…

356
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,310
Dr. He.

357
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,160
Is there anything else wrong with my health?

358
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,640
Nothing major.

359
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,270
It's just…

360
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,030
Just what?

361
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,790
Just that you're a bit heartless.

362
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,000
Don't worry.

363
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,750
Just drink some tangerine peel tea.

364
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,440
Look, this is your medical record,

365
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,590
and this is the prescription.

366
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,160
Once the decoction is ready,

367
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,350
it'll be delivered to the hotel.

368
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,480
Okay.

369
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,830
You'll take this decoction for a week

370
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,400
and then come back for a follow-up visit.

371
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,960
Next time you come,

372
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,680
I suggest you try acupuncture.

373
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,070
Based on my experience with TCM,

374
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,680
acupuncture tends to work faster.

375
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,790
I suggest you give it a try.

376
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,070
Alright.

377
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,160
Thanks for coming to the hospital with me today.

378
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,640
Not at all. I'll call us a car.

379
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,480
Okay.

380
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,550
Shen.

381
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,880
What's your relationship with Dr. He?

382
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,830
We're just friends.

383
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,200
I don't think so.

384
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,790
I can tell—

385
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,110
he's the "unhappy decision" you mentioned,

386
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,750
right?

387
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,400
I'm not trying to pry into your privacy.

388
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,480
I just feel that

389
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,240
he cares about you a lot.

390
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,640
If you were truly certain about your decision,

391
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,000
you wouldn't be so concerned about his feelings.

392
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,750
There are things

393
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,000
you don't have to admit,

394
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,200
but your heart always knows the truth.

395
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,110
Don't think you're not good enough.

396
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,920
Don't think you have no value.

397
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,310
You're just hurt

398
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,590
by a bad relationship.

399
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,200
If possible,

400
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,400
I do hope you can heal a little faster.

401
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,980
The red beans…

402
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,200
Isn't it too early?

403
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,160
Did you eat the red beans?

404
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,770
[Message: Jiangzhou Local Food. Red beans…]

405
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,920
She's still not up?

406
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,510
I wonder if she ate them or not.

407
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,030
I can tell you slept well last night.

408
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,720
You look much better than you did the past couple of days.

409
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,670
I made it according to your recipe.

410
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,350
Black rice porridge with red beans and tangerine peels.

411
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,670
It smells so good.

412
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,480
Look at these red beans. They're really good.

413
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,550
All plump.

414
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,030
No impurities at all.

415
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,710
And the best part? They come with

416
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,710
cooking recipes.

417
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,400
Yeah.

418
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,320
That's great.

419
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,880
Where is the shop? I'll check it out someday.

420
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,280
I ran into the seller just outside our complex.

421
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,150
He was a vendor

422
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,000
wearing a white top

423
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,400
and carrying a plastic bag.

424
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,360
A street vendor?

425
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,449
I'll take a walk outside the complex someday.

426
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,719
Who knows? I might run into him.

427
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,800
I plan to try every one

428
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,670
of these recipes for you.

429
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,960
Sounds good.

430
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,880
Aren't you having some?

431
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,800
I am, I am.

432
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,360
Only half is left.

433
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,440
A bit more sugar?

434
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,110
Okay.

435
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,190
It tastes better with some sugar.

436
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,070
Homework.

437
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,070
Full marks?

438
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,400
Is this an exam?

439
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,100
Alright. We have to say goodbye here.

440
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,960
If anything comes up, contact me anytime.

441
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,290
Remember to get a check-up every six months

442
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,510
to prevent recurrence and metastasis.

443
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,840
Don't skip it just because it's troublesome.

444
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,150
Early detection, early treatment.

445
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,840
Okay.

446
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,810
Also,

447
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,300
encourage him to do light exercise,

448
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,680
but avoid intense workouts.

449
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,030
My decoction formula strengthens the body, expels pathogens,

450
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,910
and boosts immunity.

451
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
Make sure to take it on time.

452
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,480
Be good.

453
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,550
Eat more vegetables and fruits.

454
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,630
Don't just eat meat.

455
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,480
Thank you, Dr. He.

456
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,480
I don't know how to thank you enough.

457
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,880
It's just my job.

458
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,800
Congratulations.

459
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,510
You got discharged so soon.

460
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,760
When your hair grows back,

461
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,190
take a photo

462
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,320
and send it to me.

463
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,590
Can you tell the lady who gave me this

464
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,170
that I've been discharged?

465
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,660
I'll let her know if I get the chance.

466
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,710
Dr. He, we'll be going now.

467
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,550
Thank you for everything you've done for us.

468
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
I just did what I should.

469
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,400
Say goodbye to Dr. He.

470
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,070
Keep up the good work.

471
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:03,700
You too, keep it up.

472
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:06,990
Let's go.
