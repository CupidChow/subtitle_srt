00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:40,930
[The Best Thing]

2
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:45,680
[Episode 7: Osmanthus is sweet and sour in taste and warm in nature. It warms the middle, dispels cold, harmonizes the stomach, and regulates qi.]

3
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,520
Hello, Mom.

4
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:55,870
Ms. Shen.

5
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,590
Don't make any plans for this weekend, okay?

6
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,870
Why?

7
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,830
I'll tell you when you get home tonight.

8
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,690
You're already on the phone, so just say it now.

9
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
I'll tell you tonight.

10
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,910
I'm afraid you might make plans

11
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,009
with Xiangya and Lin again,

12
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,540
so I'm telling you in advance.

13
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,850
No plans for this weekend.

14
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,520
I'm hanging up now.

15
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,870
No plans for this weekend.

16
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,590
Then I'll make some tomorrow.

17
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,060
I made it according to your recipe.

18
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,680
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

19
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,690
I'm not going.

20
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,700
Why not?

21
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,880
That guy

22
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,790
looks good.

23
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,560
He's also tall

24
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,670
and well-educated.

25
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,840
He was recommended

26
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,630
by Mr. Shen's classmate from Normal University, right?

27
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,400
Yes.

28
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,630
So at least we know his background.

29
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,470
I don't care. I'm not going.

30
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,750
Haven't you heard what people say?

31
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,460
The ones introduced by family and friends are all leftovers.

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,470
Ms. Shen, you've got it backward.

33
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,400
You're not being set up.

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,430
The two of us have chosen someone for you.

35
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,840
The advantage is on our side.

36
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,360
Yes.

37
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,960
We've gone through several rounds of screening.

38
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,280
These are the ones left.

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,910
I don't care.

40
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,910
I'm not going.

41
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,190
Isn't the key point here

42
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,960
whether I want to or not?

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't want to.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,080
It's already September.

45
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,630
I'm about to study abroad.

46
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,750
He can wait for you.

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,560
Did you even ask if he's willing to wait?

48
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,000
Fine, so I should fall in love again,

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,840
break up again,

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,430
and then be heartbroken once more?

51
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,870
It's not that serious.

52
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,079
You're overthinking it.

53
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,520
Yeah. Besides, he's a TCM physician.

54
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,560
A TCM physician.

55
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,820
That profession

56
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,910
has so many perks.

57
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,000
Exactly.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,400
A guy studying TCM…

59
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,680
He understands traditional culture.

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,800
He's reserved and calm.

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,280
That's right.

62
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,680
Good.

63
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,030
Speaking of TCM,

64
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,630
I think this medicinal dish Dad made

65
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,930
is quite good.

66
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,760
It's perfect for autumn nourishment.

67
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,110
What a coincidence.

68
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,640
Look at her now.

69
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,550
She knows a lot about TCM.

70
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,270
Yeah, yeah.

71
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,240
You've seen TCM physicians a few times,

72
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,360
and now you're interested in TCM, huh?

73
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,670
I'm not interested.

74
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,710
I just drank too many decoctions.

75
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,360
It doesn't matter.

76
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,640
The key is—

77
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,550
you two have something in common.

78
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,150
How is that something in common?

79
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,200
Come on, Ms. Shen.

80
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,640
Just go meet him.

81
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,800
Let him take your pulse.

82
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,710
Have a check-up.

83
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,320
You two can have a chat.

84
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,030
He'll think I have issues.

85
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,360
You don't have any major issues.

86
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,520
Just insomnia.

87
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,870
Insomnia is still an issue.

88
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,640
It's not a real illness.

89
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,240
It is.

90
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,640
Well...

91
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,150
You two just eat.

92
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,070
Are you going or not?

93
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,810
No.

94
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,710
Just go.

95
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,339
No.

96
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,590
I sent you the info

97
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,150
on that TCM physician. Did you see it?

98
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,560
Yeah, I saw it.

99
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,270
Where are you going?

100
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,440
I'm going for a follow-up visit.

101
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,880
Perfect.

102
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,760
While you're there, ask your physician

103
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,470
if he knows the guy you'll meet tomorrow.

104
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,520
That would be so awkward.

105
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,440
I'd die of embarrassment.

106
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,270
What's there to be embarrassed about?

107
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,320
Make up an excuse.

108
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,790
What kind of excuse?

109
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,520
That's too hard.

110
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:43,909
I won't do it.

111
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,880
Just say

112
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,150
this guy

113
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,590
is my friend's son.

114
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,980
If he knows him,

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,970
ask about his character

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,120
and personality;

117
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,470
ask if he's filial

118
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,909
and if he treats girls well.

119
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,540
I won't do it.

120
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,350
You have to.

121
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,520
Why are you so shy?

122
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,060
Just ask. I'll be waiting for your update.

123
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,350
No way.

124
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,150
Your washed shirt.

125
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,630
Thanks for your help the other day.

126
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,840
Thank you.

127
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,790
Sorry…

128
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,630
about that night.

129
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,830
I didn't scare you, did I?

130
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
It's okay.

131
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,820
That's what friends are for.

132
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,750
You were feeling down, and I comforted you.

133
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,030
Thank you for your comfort.

134
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,370
Come on, let me take your pulse.

135
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,640
Okay.

136
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,120
How have you been lately?

137
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,600
Pretty good.

138
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,830
Okay.

139
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,270
Dr. He,

140
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
how do you treat menopause?

141
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,210
What? Did you have a fight with your mom?

142
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,080
Not exactly a fight.

143
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,560
Just a little disagreement.

144
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,710
Disagreement?

145
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,030
About studying abroad?

146
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,320
You know,

147
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,680
at our age,

148
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,710
our family loves to nag.

149
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,350
Especially my mom.

150
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,830
She nags nonstop.

151
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,230
At home, she keeps saying

152
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:21,760
things like,

153
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,910
"You're already 27.

154
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,150
Aren't you anxious?"

155
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,270
What's there to be anxious about?

156
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,390
Why should I be anxious?

157
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,280
And it's not just her.

158
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,150
My dad nags me with her.

159
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,940
It's like the two of them are doing a sketch.

160
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,180
It's not about studying abroad,

161
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,909
so it's about…

162
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,760
marriage?

163
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:41,210
Dr. He.

164
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,470
Dr. He.

165
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,830
Sorry.

166
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,320
Was I talking too much?

167
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,640
Guess I've been influenced by my parents.

168
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,150
No, I was just checking your pulse.

169
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,390
Give me your other hand.

170
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:55,510
Okay.

171
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,000
Is there an acupuncture technique

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,390
that can make me

173
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,320
instantly tune them out?

174
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,200
Nope.

175
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,790
I'm a physician, not a magician.

176
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,120
Alright.

177
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,080
Then let's

178
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,030
do moxibustion?

179
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,960
Moxibustion?

180
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,270
Okay.

181
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,430
I'll get things ready for you.

182
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,860
This is the prescription.

183
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,080
Pharmacy decoction.

184
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,230
Come pick it up in four hours.

185
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,320
Thanks a lot.

186
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,909
See you.

187
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,910
Here.

188
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,290
Have some snacks.

189
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,790
I just saw Shen Xifan.

190
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,930
How are things between her and her boyfriend?

191
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,030
They're probably thinking about marriage

192
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,680
and will get married soon.

193
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,830
That fast?

194
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,440
You should just get over her.

195
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,350
I never expected anything to begin with.

196
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,559
I'm just her physician.

197
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,710
Your tone doesn't sound as indifferent as you claim.

198
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,590
What else

199
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,710
am I supposed to do?

200
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,280
But there's one thing I don't quite get.

201
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,510
Her boyfriend doesn't seem

202
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,000
to treat her very well.

203
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,630
So why is she marrying him?

204
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,630
Matters of the heart

205
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,200
can't be forced.

206
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,130
No matter how smart

207
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,790
or outstanding someone is,

208
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,610
they can still make foolish choices

209
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,770
in love.

210
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,440
That's true.

211
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,830
For a while,

212
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,470
she didn't mention her boyfriend at all.

213
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,360
I almost forgot about him.

214
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,320
I even started

215
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,420
getting the wrong idea.

216
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,440
At my age,

217
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,440
I was still reading into things.

218
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,110
I really should move on.

219
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,590
You're a hopeless romantic, huh?

220
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,980
That's tragic.

221
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,400
Hey, old man,

222
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,280
I'm your grandson.

223
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,750
Can't you show me a little sympathy?

224
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,200
Alright, I feel bad for you.

225
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,870
But seriously,

226
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,070
in the past,

227
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,530
you were too focused on work and studies.

228
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,980
So I

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,760
never pushed you to go on blind dates.

230
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,080
But now that you're thinking about it,

231
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,990
maybe it's time to meet someone?

232
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,870
There are plenty of outstanding female doctors

233
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,230
and beautiful nurses in major hospitals.

234
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,320
Here we go again.

235
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,510
If you don't want someone from the same field,

236
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,330
there are plenty of excellent women in other professions.

237
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,320
"The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon"

238
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,560
says something about this

239
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,560
in On Art of Health Cultivation in Ancient Times.

240
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,920
"For a man

241
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,200
at 24,

242
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,110
his kidney energy is balanced,

243
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,750
and his tendons and bones are strong,

244
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,920
so wisdom teeth come in, and his body reaches its peak.

245
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,750
At 32, tendons and bones are at their prime,

246
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,540
and muscles are strong."

247
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,740
That's exactly your current age.

248
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,920
And after that…

249
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,040
I know—

250
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,080
"Liver energy weakens, and tendons lose their flexibility."

251
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,070
Are you talking about me?

252
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,940
No matter what,

253
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,790
this is the natural law of human physical development.

254
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,200
You can't go against it.

255
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,510
Don't waste the prime years of your life.

256
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,280
Alright, I got it.

257
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,800
Don't worry about this.

258
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,510
I'll handle it as I see fit.

259
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,630
Every time we get to the key part,

260
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,110
you brush me off.

261
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,400
Have some tea.

262
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,920
Stop worrying about my affairs.

263
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,080
Hello.

264
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,460
I have an appointment with the oncology department at 1 p.m.

265
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,020
Can I go in now?

266
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,040
It's not office hours yet.

267
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,000
You can wait in the rest area for a while.

268
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,960
Okay.

269
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,090
[Guidance Station]

270
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,200
Overall, the paper is fine,

271
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
but for the section

272
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,830
on post-mastectomy complications,

273
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,920
you could add some clinical cases

274
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,080
as supporting evidence.

275
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,990
It would make the paper more convincing.

276
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,870
Got it.

277
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,510
Actually,

278
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,590
if you want to publish your paper

279
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,080
in a journal,

280
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,080
you could ask my grandfather to be your advisor.

281
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,040
He's more authoritative.

282
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,530
I feel like my questions are too basic,

283
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,560
so I'd feel awkward asking Professor Yu.

284
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,520
I feel more comfortable…

285
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,650
discussing them with you.

286
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,920
My grandfather is quite kind to you all, isn't he?

287
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,230
He loves it when students ask him questions.

288
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,960
You can talk to him more when you have time.

289
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,990
Okay.

290
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,110
Well,

291
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,660
Senior He,

292
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,490
I keep coming to you with questions,

293
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,150
and I feel a bit bad about it.

294
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,860
Let me treat you to dinner tonight.

295
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,030
No need.

296
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,800
It's my duty to offer you guidance.

297
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,990
This is part of my job.

298
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:34,860
Look,

299
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
this is exactly…

300
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,670
Suye.

301
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,510
I need to talk to you about something personal.

302
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,190
Whenever you talk like that, it's never good news.

303
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,160
It's definitely good news this time.

304
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,990
Fang,

305
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
could you…

306
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,530
Take your paper back and revise it.

307
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,870
If you have any questions, ask me anytime.

308
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,440
Alright.

309
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,910
Or you can ask my grandfather directly.

310
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,600
Okay.

311
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,640
Suye,

312
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,400
are you free this weekend?

313
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,080
No.

314
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,590
I have clinic duty on Saturday.

315
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,230
And on Sunday…

316
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,070
There's a seminar on Sunday.

317
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,630
Stop trying to fool me.

318
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,470
It's blank.

319
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,690
There's no seminar.

320
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,870
You're free on Sunday.

321
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,960
I've checked.

322
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,510
Just get to the point.

323
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,420
Help me with a blind date.

324
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,320
Hey, Suye,

325
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,040
don't leave!

326
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,400
Suye.

327
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,490
Suye.

328
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,800
Help me out.

329
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,490
You know

330
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,240
that I like…

331
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,160
I like Fang Kexin.

332
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,710
So if I go on this blind date,

333
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,320
I'll be wasting that girl's time.

334
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,730
Then you shouldn't have agreed in the first place.

335
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,790
My dad suddenly called and told me about it.

336
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,440
I refused,

337
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,110
and he scolded me for quite a while.

338
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,230
How could I say no?

339
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,110
Help me out.

340
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,350
Look at me,

341
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,590
I'm still a kid.

342
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,590
How can I go on a blind date?

343
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,400
You?

344
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,920
You're 25.

345
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,920
Still calling yourself a kid?

346
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,280
Grow up.

347
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,200
Besides,

348
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,250
the girl wants to meet you.

349
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,920
If I show up, that's straight-up deception.

350
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,280
Aren't you better than me anyway?

351
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,890
Look at you,

352
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,580
you have a PhD and a good job.

353
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,990
You became an attending physician in our department at just 30.

354
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,400
And let's not forget—

355
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,830
you're good-looking too.

356
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,560
Enough.

357
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,230
Stop flattering me.

358
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,400
Have you finished all your work?

359
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,680
Do you have nothing better to do?

360
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,920
Please help me out.

361
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,750
No.

362
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,470
Please, please.

363
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,440
I said no.

364
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,040
Just this once.

365
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,060
Just this once.

366
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,830
Hello, do you have a reservation?

367
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,370
Yes, my friend is at Table 3.

368
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,680
Table 3 is over there.

369
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,750
He's already waiting for you.

370
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
Thank you.

371
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,329
Miss Shen, right?

372
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,270
Yes, that's me.

373
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,000
Please, have a seat.

374
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,270
Thank you.

375
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,980
How about I introduce myself first?

376
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,550
Okay.

377
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,600
My name is Li Jie.

378
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,360
I'm a graduate student at Jiang University Medical School.

379
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,440
I'm Shen Xifan,

380
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,230
currently working as the front office manager at Gunan Huating Hotel.

381
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,510
So, here's the thing.

382
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,460
I'm currently pursuing my master's degree

383
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,490
and don't plan to focus on anything

384
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,430
outside of my studies for now.

385
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,790
So…

386
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,200
Actually, same here.

387
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,840
I'm planning to go abroad next year.

388
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,030
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

389
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,500
So you're also forced into this by your family?

390
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,110
I spent two days thinking about how to reject you

391
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,570
in a polite way without embarrassing you.

392
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,200
I didn't expect it to be this easy.

393
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,360
Yeah.

394
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,550
So you spent two days at school thinking

395
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,840
and came up with what you just said?

396
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,470
I…

397
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,310
I'm not great with words.

398
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,030
And it's my first blind date, so I'm inexperienced.

399
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,750
Actually, I don't have much experience either.

400
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,270
So we'll just go back and tell our family

401
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,640
that we don't like each other

402
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,120
and won't see each other again.

403
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,120
Works for me.

404
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,380
Alright.

405
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,200
Come on.

406
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:54,780
Let's order.

407
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,560
I'll do it, I'll do it.

408
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,500
It's okay, it's okay.

409
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,960
What do you want to eat

410
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,120
or drink?

411
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,230
Since you're studying TCM,

412
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,430
what's your focus?

413
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,030
I specialize in oncology.

414
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,680
Sounds scary, huh?

415
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,810
No, not at all.

416
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,100
I've been seeing a TCM physician recently.

417
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,310
He's also in oncology.

418
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,120
What's his name?

419
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
Maybe I know him.

420
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
I can't remember.

421
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,050
But he works at a clinic

422
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,510
near my neighborhood.

423
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,640
I went to him for insomnia.

424
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,990
That's pretty common.

425
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,160
The government encourages

426
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,360
TCM physicians

427
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,310
to work in clinics

428
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,510
to serve the public.

429
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,680
I'll probably do the same after I graduate.

430
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,600
That sounds nice.

431
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,070
I'm actually curious.

432
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,440
What do you guys study

433
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,990
in TCM?

434
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,160
In undergraduate years, we learn theories.

435
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,750
A lot of memorization,

436
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,550
exams, and some hands-on practice too.

437
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,600
They keep us pretty busy.

438
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,640
As a grad student now,

439
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,230
I'm interning at a hospital.

440
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,400
I have a senior who guides me.

441
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,120
So there are actually a lot of young TCM physicians.

442
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,360
I thought they were all old men.

443
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,790
My TCM physician is similar.

444
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,070
He has a really funny way of speaking.

445
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,070
I was really surprised when I first met him.

446
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,030
Right? Many people think that we TCM physicians

447
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,680
are all old and boring.

448
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,160
But that's not true.

449
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,600
Let me give you an example.

450
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,230
Like the senior who's guiding me during my internship.

451
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,840
Usually,

452
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,600
he wears a white coat

453
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
and glasses.

454
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,310
Patients all think he's very gentle,

455
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,550
stable, and reliable.

456
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,790
But in reality,

457
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,200
that's just the clothes doing the work.

458
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,600
As a kid, he was so mischievous.

459
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,440
He messed with me a lot and took me to climb trees

460
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,810
and break windows and such.

461
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,790
He even tricked me into eating a lot of raw medicinal herbs,

462
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,870
claiming I should learn from Shennong and taste all the herbs.

463
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,990
Mischievous, wasn't he?

464
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,640
He hasn't changed much.

465
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,330
He doesn't mess with me anymore,

466
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,800
but the way he speaks…

467
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,790
He's got a sharp tongue.

468
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,640
Sometimes he roasts me so smoothly

469
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,710
that I don't even realize it until later.

470
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,120
Sounds just like my physician.

471
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,030
Really?

472
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,360
What's your physician like?

473
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,400
You're back.

474
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,710
Yes.

475
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
How did the blind date go?

476
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,380
It was okay.

477
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,790
He's still in college.

478
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,880
Just a kid.

479
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,470
What do you mean?

480
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,400
I mean, he's not interested in me.

481
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,360
How can he not be interested?

482
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,880
Well, I'm not interested in him either.

483
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,230
We are not into each other.

484
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,550
Mopping the floor?

485
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:54,960
Dad,

486
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,160
I want to have glutinous rice balls in osmanthus sweet soup tonight.

487
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,470
Okay. You really don't like him?

488
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,230
No.

489
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,640
Dad, I'm hungry.

490
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:07,160
If they aren't into each other, there's nothing we can do.

491
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,090
She said he's just a kid.

492
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,100
So she doesn't like younger guys.

493
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,990
Does that mean she likes older ones?

494
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,750
Older guys are sleazy.

495
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,960
I wouldn't be interested in them either.

496
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,680
I'm not that bad, am I?

497
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,600
He was treated at another hospital before,

498
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,750
and the results were pretty good.

499
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,120
Why do you want to transfer hospitals?

500
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,550
For his treatment,

501
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,110
I've been working nonstop to make money.

502
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,790
But I realized

503
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,730
chemo was too painful for him.

504
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,550
So I thought I'd try TCM.

505
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,920
Mom, I'm not in pain.

506
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,510
Good boy.

507
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,400
I heard about it from others,

508
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,680
so I came to check it out.

509
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,950
Doctor,

510
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,960
can TCM really treat leukemia?

511
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,070
The main treatment for leukemia

512
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,920
is chemotherapy.

513
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,550
TCM treatments

514
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,510
can reduce the side effects of chemo,

515
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,190
making it less painful for the child

516
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,400
and helping with a faster recovery.

517
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,420
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

518
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,470
A bit of diarrhea?

519
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,440
It feels like I could live in the bathroom.

520
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,200
Alright.

521
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,310
Based on his previous medical records and pulse diagnosis,

522
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,310
this doesn't seem like chemo-induced enteritis.

523
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,230
Now that it's autumn,

524
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,550
it's likely viral-induced pediatric diarrhea.

525
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,070
We may need to check the skin around his anus.

526
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,270
If it's just pediatric diarrhea,

527
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,200
applying some herbal medicine on the navel should be enough.

528
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,360
But if not,

529
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,680
further tests might be needed.

530
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,550
Okay.

531
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,780
Come on, let me check your anus.

532
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,660
Take off your pants.

533
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,070
No, Mom!

534
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,440
If I don't eat, I won't have diarrhea. Is that okay?

535
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,270
No.

536
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,070
He's a doctor.

537
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,030
Just let him take a quick look.

538
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:02,840
Come on.

539
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,360
Be good.

540
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,120
No.

541
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,750
If you're reluctant, you can let your mom check it for me.

542
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,880
Better let the doctor do it.

543
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,550
I don't know anything about it.

544
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,510
Will the additional exams

545
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,160
be expensive?

546
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,940
Don't worry. This exam is free.

547
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,980
But if you don't get properly examined,

548
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,580
you might end up spending more money later.

549
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,200
Alright then.

550
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,640
Let's go. Be a good boy.

551
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,550
Fortunately, it's just pediatric diarrhea.

552
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,600
A herbal navel application

553
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,460
will fix it quickly.

554
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,200
It's raining outside today.

555
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,990
Make sure to stay warm.

556
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,200
He's not officially transferred yet.

557
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,790
How do we go about the paperwork?

558
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,680
I'll give you a form.

559
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,750
After you go out, find the head nurse at the nurse station.

560
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,640
As for the expenses…

561
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,840
Doctor, don't worry.

562
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,030
I'll pay whatever it takes,

563
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,470
as long as my son gets better.

564
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,550
What I mean is,

565
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,880
if you're facing financial difficulties,

566
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,790
I can help you get in touch with a charity fund

567
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,360
to ease your burden a bit.

568
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,500
Well...

569
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,810
that's not necessary for now.

570
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,640
I can still manage for a while.

571
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,530
Alright.

572
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,510
If you need anything, come to me anytime.

573
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,360
You hear that?

574
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,550
Be strong, okay?

575
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,160
If I transfer to this hospital,

576
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,320
will you be my attending doctor?

577
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,070
You want me to be your attending doctor?

578
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,600
Otherwise,

579
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,070
another doctor will have to look at my butt.

580
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,840
That's too embarrassing.

581
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,110
You think we want to look at your butt?

582
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
You little brat.

583
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,320
Alright.

584
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,990
Thank you, Doctor.

585
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,620
The medical records.

586
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,510
[Doctor's Lounge]

587
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,680
Working hard, huh?

588
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,210
You know, I was forced to go on a blind date yesterday,

589
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,600
so I didn't have time to finish the bid proposal.

590
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,270
Fang Kexin is going to scold me again.

591
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,310
How was the blind date yesterday?

592
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,310
Why?

593
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,430
Maybe you can share some tips with me.

594
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,360
Sorry to disappoint you.

595
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,600
I have no tips to share.

596
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,030
Both that girl and I were forced into it,

597
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,120
so we just laid it all out

598
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,360
and chatted casually.

599
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,070
She's been seeing a TCM physician lately,

600
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,030
so we talked about

601
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,990
some TCM-related stuff

602
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,360
and then went our separate ways.

603
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,790
That's it?

604
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,840
So boring.

605
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,510
But that girl is quite interesting.

606
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,470
She knows a lot about medicine after being sick for too long.

607
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,300
She said she hated how bitter the decoction was,

608
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,310
so she looked up all kinds of herbs online

609
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,790
and even got her physician to change her prescription.

610
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,030
Isn't that hilarious?

611
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,710
I randomly asked her about a few herbs,

612
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,630
and she actually got their properties

613
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,510
and effects mostly right.

614
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,550
Dr. He,

615
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,470
can we remove goldthread from this formula?

616
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,360
No.

617
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,040
Alright.

618
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,120
Then can we remove the processed gardenia?

619
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,010
No.

620
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,070
She's talented

621
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,790
and so into TCM.

622
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,160
It's a pity that she doesn't study it.

623
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,920
Well,

624
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,070
what does she do for a living?

625
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,200
I think she's a hotel manager.

626
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,840
Which hotel?

627
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,560
The most famous resort hotel in our city.

628
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,360
The one next to our herbal farm.

629
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,550
What's it called again?

630
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,040
Gunan Huating.

631
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:59,360
♫Love love love love, is right in front of me♫

632
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,030
Gunan Huating.

633
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,360
No more chatting.

634
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,270
I need to focus on writing this.

635
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,550
Or I won't be able to finish it.

636
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,150
You know, at our age,

637
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:07,730
♫Ooh love, ooh love, I've seen your face♫

638
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,030
our family loves to nag.

639
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,450
Especially my mom.

640
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,310
She nags nonstop.

641
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,790
At home, she keeps saying,

642
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,400
"You're already 27.

643
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:15,550
♫Love love love love, is talking right at me♫

644
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,510
Aren't you anxious?"

645
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,440
What's there to be anxious about?

646
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,640
Why should I be anxious?

647
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,160
And it's not just her.

648
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,200
My dad nags me too.

649
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,030
It's like the two of them are doing a sketch.

650
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:22,800
♫Loving you, loving you, is the best thing I'll ever do♫

651
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,920
It's totally...

652
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,580
So it wasn't about getting married.

653
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,660
They've already broken up.

654
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,140
Why are you suddenly smiling?

655
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,590
It's kind of scary.

656
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,150
♫A gentle breeze begins to rise♫

657
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,070
Nothing.

658
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:31,980
♫You'll see a rainbow♫

659
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,960
I'll teach you how to write it after work.

660
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,180
You don't need to write it now.

661
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,210
♫Hovering in mid-air♫

662
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,930
♫This sweet dream♫

663
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm nice, aren't I?

664
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,200
Why is it so scary?

665
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:44,930
♫All our days are filled with♫

666
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,230
I haven't done anything wrong, have I?

667
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,540
♫Lololove and sunshine♫

668
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,670
♫Loving you, loving you, is the best thing I'll ever do♫

669
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,650
Sorry.

670
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,160
I suddenly remembered—

671
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,790
Ms. Gu, who's staying in this room,

672
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,520
loves wearing yellow in her casual outfits.

673
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,360
How about we add some sunflowers

674
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,990
to the floral arrangement?

675
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,990
Of course.

676
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,990
I'll redo it then.

677
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,920
Thank you.

678
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,200
Then this...

679
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,470
Let me hold it for you.

680
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,030
Alright.

681
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,070
Thank you.

682
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,750
Thank you for your hard work.

683
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,840
By the way,

684
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,810
I've finished setting up the rooms for the Goddess Day.

685
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,440
Does the floral arrangement

686
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,310
look good like this?

687
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,160
Yeah.

688
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,600
They have an evening flight.

689
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,660
They'll arrive at the hotel around 10 p.m.

690
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,820
So have them clean the rooms again before you leave work.

691
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
Got it.

692
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,640
Can I take

693
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,030
some of these flowers?

694
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,200
Sure, we won't need this many anyway.

695
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,270
Thank you.

696
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,680
Work hard.

697
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,550
This is for you.

698
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,440
This is for you.

699
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,440
Mr. Chen,

700
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,030
my champagne

701
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,640
needs to be here by 6 p.m. sharp,

702
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,160
or it'll be too late.

703
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,200
Help me out.

704
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,880
Make the arrangements.

705
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,790
Thanks.

706
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,790
What do you need?

707
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,310
I'm busy. Make it quick.

708
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,510
Looks like I came at a bad time.

709
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,960
When you give someone flowers,

710
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,200
you don't just give them one.

711
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,980
It's an extra from the room decorations.

712
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,900
Just take it.

713
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,640
I overheard just now.

714
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,270
Need my help?

715
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,920
No. You can go.

716
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,410
Alright.

717
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,320
Go!

718
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,990
Dr. He.

719
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,340
Just got off work?

720
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,120
We received a tour group today,

721
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,310
so I worked overtime.

722
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,200
Why do you look so happy?

723
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,660
Something good happened?

724
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,780
You could say that.

725
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,340
I don't have much to congratulate you with,

726
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
so take these flowers.

727
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,040
Hope you can be happier.

728
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,070
I didn't expect to get a bouquet when I was skateboarding.

729
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,310
Thank you.

730
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,710
You're welcome. Enjoy yourself.

731
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,230
I'm heading home.

732
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,300
Okay.

733
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,640
Wait.

734
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,300
I'm free next week.

735
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,800
If you get off work early one day,

736
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,700
come see me for moxibustion.

737
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,310
I need more moxibustion?

738
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,440
As a responsible doctor,

739
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,900
I need to help you fully recover.

740
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Alright, I'll come to you when I have time.

741
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,310
I'm really leaving.

742
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,840
Okay.

743
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,710
Bye-bye.

744
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,030
Bye-bye.

745
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,620
Why is he so happy?

746
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,990
Hello, Manager Xu.

747
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:53,730
Mom.

748
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,130
Go ahead. What's it?

749
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,070
Yes, I've eaten.

750
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,710
Come back?

751
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,460
At least wait until after the New Year, okay?

752
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,030
After I get my year-end bonus.

753
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,469
Whether it's a lot or a little,

754
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:11,440
it's the money I worked hard to earn.

755
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,190
You and Dad are still so young.

756
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,130
You two can run it for a few more years.

757
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,800
Why do you want me to take over so soon?

758
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:21,840
Thank you.

759
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,630
Mom, what are you thinking?

760
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,989
They're all guests.

761
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,469
I can't contact them privately.

762
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,909
Alright, alright.

763
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,790
I'll let you arrange blind dates for me when I'm back.

764
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,030
I'm busy here.

765
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,840
I have to go.

766
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,719
Bye, Mom.

767
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:36,800
Thank you, madam.

768
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,550
You're welcome.

769
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,470
Xiangya,

770
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,240
it's past lunchtime already.

771
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,630
Why are there still so many people?

772
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:15,840
Haven't you noticed?

773
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,030
They're all taking pictures,

774
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,700
barely eating.

775
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,070
Then what about my bubble tea?

776
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,800
I don't think you can have it.

777
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,320
I'll make you one later.

778
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,280
Forget it.

779
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,400
Dr. He doesn't let me drink bubble tea anyway.

780
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,630
Handsome,

781
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,070
let's take a photo together.

782
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,990
Sorry,

783
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,110
but the hotel has a rule.

784
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,240
We're not allowed to take photos with guests.

785
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:38,840
How about this?

786
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,400
I'll take a group photo for you guys instead.

787
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,720
Men know how to take pictures?

788
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,150
I doubt that.

789
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,440
As it happens,

790
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,470
back in college, I took photography as an elective.

791
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,070
Why don't you let me give it a try?

792
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,510
Smile, smile.

793
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,840
Be happy, be happy!

794
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,070
Three.

795
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,590
Two.

796
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,150
One.

797
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,920
Senior Lin fits right in

798
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,590
at a place like this.

799
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,360
Such a social butterfly.

800
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,470
You all look good.

801
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,290
Three, two, one.

802
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,990
We just landed another big order.

803
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:16,040
[Conference Room]

804
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,990
In two weeks,

805
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,960
a tour group from the neighboring province is coming.

806
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,530
They're all well-off, elderly people,

807
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,990
coming here for hot springs and physical therapy.

808
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,070
What they want

809
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,190
is relaxation and refreshment.

810
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,500
They'll be staying for a week,

811
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,370
with around 30 people in total.

812
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,800
I've handed out the files.

813
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,630
Take a look.

814
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,880
Since they're all elderly people,

815
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,550
most of them have health issues,

816
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,240
so they've made special accommodation requests.

817
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,400
Front Office, take note.

818
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,720
And since this is a wellness trip,

819
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,240
they've also made dietary requirements.

820
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,470
The food needs to be light, nutritious,

821
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,880
and also special.

822
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,110
Isn't this the perfect chance for our Food & Beverage manager

823
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,320
to showcase her abilities?

824
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,400
Manager Lin, great job landing this order!

825
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,510
You flatter me.

826
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,630
Ah, right.

827
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,440
Manager Lin, get in touch with the hospital.

828
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,280
Since they're elderly people,

829
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,990
medical needs might come up anytime.

830
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,550
See if the hospital can provide some kind of collaboration.

831
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,960
Also, arrange a training session for housekeeping staff

832
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,440
on first aid for common elderly conditions.

833
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,550
No problem. I'll reach out

834
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,320
to the Municipal Third Hospital that's closest to us.

835
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,240
Once I confirm the collaboration details, I'll update you.

836
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,190
Alright, that's it.

837
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,670
Everyone, go over the details…

838
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,110
What's wrong?

839
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,900
General Manager, I have a suggestion.

840
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,720
Since this is a wellness trip

841
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,110
for the elderly,

842
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:21,960
I think we can incorporate

843
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,720
some traditional Chinese medicine elements.

844
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,600
Food & Beverage

845
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,630
could offer medicinal cuisine and herbal tea.

846
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,440
For example, licorice slices can be used to make tea.

847
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:29,420
And Housekeeping

848
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,800
could replace normal pillows with buckwheat pillows.

849
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,430
For aromatherapy,

850
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,760
we could use herbal scents.

851
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,990
For a wellness trip,

852
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,400
TCM would be a perfect fit.

853
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,470
What do you all think?

854
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,090
Sounds good. I think it works.

855
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,190
I think it's doable.

856
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
If we can do it well this time,

857
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,670
we could turn the TCM wellness trip

858
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,800
into a signature service of our hotel.

859
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,630
I also think it's a great idea,

860
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,840
but I've never had medicinal cuisine before,

861
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,920
so I'm not very familiar with it.

862
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,550
Wouldn't it be too bland?

863
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,360
I've been seeing a TCM physician lately.

864
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,670
He recommended a few medicinal dishes to me.

865
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,510
The one that stuck with me the most was

866
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,670
adding Chinese yam to the soup base of spicy hotpot.

867
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,960
I think it's pretty interesting.

868
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,800
But after all, medicinal cuisine contains medicinal ingredients,

869
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,150
so we have to be careful

870
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,590
and figure out

871
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,240
the potential conflicts between different medicinal ingredients.

872
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,320
And more importantly,

873
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,240
these elderly guests

874
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,590
already have health conditions.

875
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,280
We need to make sure that the medicinal cuisine doesn't interfere

876
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,070
with the medication they're already taking.

877
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,960
Manager Shen, you sure know a lot about TCM now.

878
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:28,960
Manager Xu,

879
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,990
do you think this dining plan is feasible?

880
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,550
I think it is.

881
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,390
But since medicinal cuisine

882
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,160
may involve conflicting herbal properties,

883
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:43,070
we should probably have a TCM consultant, right?

884
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,120
A consultant?

885
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,460
Manager Shen,

886
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,110
you've been seeing a TCM physician lately, right?

887
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,240
Do you think your physician

888
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,840
would be willing to be our consultant?

889
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,000
I can ask him.

890
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,550
He works at the municipal TCM hospital,

891
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,590
so I think he's definitely qualified.

892
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,150
No doubt about that.

893
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,280
Alright, then it's settled.

894
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,590
Manager Shen, Manager Xu,

895
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,990
you two draft a proposal for the medicinal cuisine

896
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,850
and herbal tea.

897
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:06,920
If it gets approved,

898
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,280
we'll allocate some funds as the consulting fee.

899
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,540
Got it.

900
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,250
Alright, that's it.

901
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,790
Keep me updated if anything comes up.

902
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,280
You may leave for dinner.

903
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,270
No problem. I'm off.

904
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,550
Bye-bye.

905
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,510
What's going on?

906
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,590
Didn't you say it's better to just be friends

907
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,960
with that handsome TCM physician?

908
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,030
Tell me the truth.

909
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,030
Is there any progress?

910
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,440
What progress?

911
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,070
What are you saying?

912
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,800
Then why are you out here helping him make money?

913
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,320
Xiangya,

914
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,360
the entire TCM wellness project

915
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,840
is resting on your shoulders now.

916
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,590
I've just

917
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,880
offered you a great idea.

918
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:49,840
If you keep this up,

919
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,550
I won't contact my physician for you.

920
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,880
You'll have to develop medicinal cuisine all by yourself.

921
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,400
Fine, fine.

922
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,590
I won't say that again.

923
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,070
Hurry up and ask him for me.

924
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,440
If he's willing to come, that's perfect.

925
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,280
If not,

926
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,630
I need to start looking for other options.

927
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:04,470
Why don't we discuss it with Senior Lin?

928
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,600
No need.

929
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,760
He's busy coordinating

930
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,320
with the medical team.

931
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,670
Did you two have a fight?

932
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,550
No.

933
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,590
Just ask him for me.

934
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,590
If he agrees,

935
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,320
I need to include his profile

936
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,670
in the presentation slides.

937
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,390
[He Suye]

938
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,520
Dr. He,

939
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,270
are you free after work today?

940
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,360
Yeah.

941
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,920
I'll treat you to dinner

942
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,720
and talk to you about something.

943
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:04,690
Sure.

944
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
See you tonight.

945
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,150
See you tonight.

946
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,400
I'm leaving.

947
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,720
What is he planning?

948
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,130
He's definitely up to no good.

949
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,670
I'm meeting Dr. He for dinner tonight.

950
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,740
I'll bring up our needs then.

951
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,320
Okay.

952
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,710
Did you upset Xiangya again?

953
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:03,920
No.

954
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,720
She always finds me annoying.

955
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,360
Let me analyze this for you.

956
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,510
I think

957
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,800
you must have upset her.

958
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,430
Look,

959
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,700
you flirted with girls in her restaurant

960
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,510
and even extended her restaurant's business hours.

961
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:20,990
That?

962
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,760
Wasn't I just helping her out?

963
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:25,360
How would she know that?

964
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,800
Just try to appease her later.

965
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,670
I'm leaving, bye-bye.

966
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,360
Bye-bye.

967
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:10,900
♫Love love love love, is right in front of me♫

968
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:19,270
♫Ooh love, ooh love, I've seen your face♫

969
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:15,990
Ms. Wu.

970
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,070
Hi, Dr. He.

971
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:27,090
♫Love love love love, is talking right at me♫

972
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,760
Ms. Wu, I'd like some angelica

973
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,190
and lily bulbs.

974
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,030
Oh, Dr. He, you've been feeling unwell lately?

975
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,880
You keep coming for herbs.

976
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:34,340
♫Loving you, loving you, is the best thing I'll ever do♫

977
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,030
Angelica and lily bulbs, right? Just a moment.

978
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:31,670
Okay.
