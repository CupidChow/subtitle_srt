3
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,890
I quite like this girl.

4
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,070
She's quite good-looking.

5
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,759
She has a nice temperament, elegant and refined,

6
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,400
matching my taste.

7
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,570
She's four years younger than you.

8
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,240
Age-wise, it's also a good match.

9
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,210
Are you listening?

10
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,610
I'm listening.

11
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,170
But you don't have to push me like that.

12
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,840
I'm just asking you to get her phone number.

13
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,460
You know, you could greet her daily,

14
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,360
check in, and show care.

15
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,010
Otherwise, you will only be able to see her

16
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,490
once a week during the follow-up visit.

17
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,730
How would she ever notice you?

18
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,360
I mean, come on.

19
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,680
You're not even worried about it.

20
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,079
You're already 31

21
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,290
and still don't have a girlfriend.

22
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,120
You...

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,329
It's precisely because I'm 31

24
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,680
that I'm being stricter with myself

25
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,960
and more cautious.

26
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,640
This is being responsible

27
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,290
to both myself and others.

28
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,940
I can't be like my dad,

29
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,960

30
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,450
Your mother...

31
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,360
Indeed, we were too hasty back then.

32
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,840
But you're being too cautious, aren't you?

33
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,170
If you want to be a lifelong bachelor, then go ahead.

34
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,210
I won't say more. Do as you please.

35
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,360
Don't worry.

36
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,930
I'll handle

37
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,400
this matter myself.

38
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,520
What do you mean by "handle it"?

39
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,540

40
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,210
I think she's quite pretty too.

41
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,610
And she's also my type.

43

I'm shallow.

45
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,800
You're not shallow.

00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,240

You made me miss my rounds yesterday.

51
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,490
I slept well.

52
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:58,890
Thank you, Auntie.

53
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:59,510
You're welcome.

54
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,130
This patient has laryngeal cancer,

55
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,680
experiencing difficulty swallowing after radiotherapy.

56
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,240
From the X-ray,

57
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,410
there's local stenosis.

58
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,290
I think putting in a stent would fix it.

59
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,440
No.

60
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,320
The upper part of the esophagus is narrowed.

61
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,170
If we insert a stent,

62
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,240
the patient will feel a foreign body sensation.

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,970
It'd be very uncomfortable.

64
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,760
Also, considering the patient's advanced age,

65
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,410
we need to first determine if it's tumor recurrence

66
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,650
or post-radiation local scarring and contraction

67
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,730
before deciding on treatment.

68
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,760
If the patient's physical condition allows,

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,409
we can first use phlegm-dissolving medication,

70
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,880
then combine it with cupping and bloodletting on back pressure points.

71
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,200
You want to use acupuncture to alleviate the patient's symptoms?

72
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,970
More or less.

73
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,560
That could work.

74
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,880
I think it could work.

75
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,800
It's feasible.

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,120

do you still want to continue in this industry?

161
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,410
It's ultimately just a service industry.

162
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,930
When my future business partners

163
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,130
stay at your hotel,

164
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,400
you'll have to cater to them like a servant, right?

165
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,560
Let's do this.

166
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,930
Quit your job tomorrow.

167
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,440
And forget about studying abroad.

168
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,760
After all, you're putting in all this effort to study abroad

169
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,710
just to learn about hotel services, right?

170
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,400
I...

171
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,060
have always had this plan to study abroad.

172

It's just that when we graduated from college,

173
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,320
you said Switzerland was too far away

174

178
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,120
is hindering you from becoming a hotel tycoon, huh?

179
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,770
That's not what I meant.

180
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,320

00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,560
Yes, it's me.

189
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,860
Let me go to a quieter place to talk with you.

190
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,360
The barbecue is here.

191
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,970
Quick, eat it while it's hot.

192
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,510
Besides barbecue, I want to eat something else.

193
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,430
All this barbecue isn't enough for you?

194
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,050
I want to have Cantonese cuisine.

195
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:03,800
I want shrimp dumplings.

196
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,650
Rock, paper, scissors.

197
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,410
If you win, I'll buy it for you.

198
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,600
Impressive.

199
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,480
One more time.

200
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,010
Rock, paper, scissors.

201
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,560
Two baskets.

202
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,170
Rock, paper, scissors!

203
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,130
Ms. Shen?

204
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,530
Didn't you go out on a date with Yan?

205
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,800
Why are you back so early?

206
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,960
We just had a simple meal.

207
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,290
He had something to do, so he left to take care of it first.

208
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,130
He finally came back for once

209
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:31,960
and still has things to do?

210
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,640
Yeah.

211
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,890
You must not have eaten enough then.

212
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,010
Sit down and have some more.

213
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,530
Come on.

214
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,240
No, no, it's fine.

215
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm full.

216
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,010
I'll put the flowers over there.

217
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,840
Your traditional Chinese medicine decoction is warm in the pot.

218
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,940
Drink it while it's hot.

219
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,330
Okay, got it.

220
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,250
You know, that kid Yan

221
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,530
is quite thoughtful.

222
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,720
He always brings flowers.

223
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,890
It's just that those flowers are too ugly.

224
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,610
Why do I feel that

225
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,930
when Ms. Shen's back, her mood is a bit...

226
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,700
Did she get upset because Yan had something to do?

227
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,520
Never mind.

228
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,650
They've all grown up now.

229
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,770
Let them solve some things on their own.

230
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,600
There's no use in us worrying so much.

231
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,320
Let them talk more when they have the time.

232
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,840
Right, they're about to get married.

233
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,010
What's there that can't be gotten over?"

234
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,010
Exactly.

235
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,800
How about...

236
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,110
I break up with Yan Heng?

237
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,250
Why?

238
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,770
No, did Yan

239
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,410
do something while on his business trip?

240
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,010
No, no, nothing like that.

241
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,080
You've been together for so long.

242
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,370
How can you just break up like that?

243
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:29,770
That's right.

244
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,770
Who brought it up?

245
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,600
No one did.

246
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,560
What exactly happened...

247
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,370
You call Yan now and ask him about it.

248
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,320
How can I call him?

249
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,600
You're a man.

250
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,960
You should be the one to talk to him.

251
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,600
I can't talk to him about this.

252
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,290
If you can't talk to him,

253
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,370
then I definitely can't...

254
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,720
Yan Heng,

255
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,080
I've been working at the hotel for nearly seven years.

256
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,960
You never thought my work was bad before.

257
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,650
Why do you now think

258
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,270
my job embarrasses you?

259
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,480
Yan Heng,

260
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,630
please don't be angry anymore, okay?

261
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,040
I didn't consider your feelings.

262
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,080
It's freezing.

263
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,490
Shen Xifan, it's exhausting being your boyfriend.

264
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,480
You know how busy I am at work.

265
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,050
Can't you be more considerate of me?

266
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,770
You don't care about me at all.

267
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,290
You only care about yourself.

268
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,200
You're too selfish.

269
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,480
I just love you too much.

270
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,410
That's why I didn't realize you've always been this selfish.

271
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,290
Whatever, I have nothing more to say.

272
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,250
You don't appreciate my good intentions at all.

273
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,170
You're too selfish!

274
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,890
Why are you so selfish?

275
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,890
Shen Xifan?

276
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,569
Why are you sitting here all by yourself?

277
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,610
I wanted to come down

278
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,330
and be alone for a while.

279
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,440
Didn't I tell you

280
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,680
not to eat cold foods?

281
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Yet you're still eating this?

282
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,090
Alright.

283
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,610
Since you've already eaten so much,

284
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,070
you might as well finish it all.

285
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,930
It's already past eleven.

286
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,330
Aren't you going to sleep yet?

287
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,340
What?

288
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,940
Isn't the medicine I prescribed for you working?

289
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,000
It's working.

290
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,040
I've been sleeping longer these past couple of days.

291
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,130
Looks like the medicine I prescribed isn't the issue.

292
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,810
It's you who hasn't been following the instructions.

293
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,200
Have you encountered

294
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,370
any troubles at work?

295
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,410
No.

296
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,520
Did you have a fight with someone?

297
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,410
Your boyfriend?

298
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,030
Actually...

299
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,760
it's not really a fight.

300
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,420
There are just some things

301
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,960
that I can't figure out myself.

302
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,560
It's my fault.

303
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,460
Are you feeling...

304
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,170
tight in the chest, upset,

305
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,390
and in a bad mood right now?

306
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,810
Come on, follow my lead.

307
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,650
Hold out your right hand.

308
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,720
Hold it out.

309
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,330
Use the knuckle of your thumb

310
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,240
to press

311
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,850
the Danzhong acupoint in the middle of your chest.

312
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,330
You're not pressing hard enough.

313
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:56,930
Press harder.

314
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,650
Otherwise, it won't be effective.

315
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,240
It hurts.

316
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,880
Does it hurt a lot?

317
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,890
There's a saying in TCM that it hurts when it doesn't work.

318
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,890
You're in pain because you have a troubled heart.

319
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,200
So if I keep rubbing like this,

320
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,040
will the pain go away?

321
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,960
Pressing the Danzhong acupoint can only relieve symptoms.

322
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,280
A troubled heart needs

323
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,540
to be treated with heart medicine.

324
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,270
Either clear the blockage,

325
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,850
or remove the root cause of the illness.

326
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,610
Remove the root cause?

327
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,370
It's getting late.

328
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,600
It's chilly outside at night.

329
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,540
Don't catch a cold.

330
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,430
Go home early.

331
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,810
I won't bother you anymore then.

332
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,130
I'll be going now.

333
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,480
Okay.

334
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,620
Oh, by the way,

335
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,160
if you still can't sleep at night,

336
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,850
put an apple by your bedside.

337
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,310
The fragrance of the apple can help you sleep.

338
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,300
Okay, thank you.

339
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,960
Do you have apples at home?

340
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,410
I think so.

341
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,170
Alright.

342
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,370
Well,

343
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,400
see you at the next follow-up visit.

344
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,000
See you at the follow-up.

345
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,440
Good night.

346
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,610
Good night.

347
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,600
I'm leaving.

348
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,960
I was just talking nonsense earlier.

349
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,140
There's nothing going on.

350
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,520
Really?

351
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,350
You didn't have a fight, did you?

352
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,370
No.

353
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,170
I'm just too tired from work lately.

354
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,810
Don't worry.

355
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,810
Go to bed early, okay?

356
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:42,930
Good night.

357
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,330
Yan Heng,

358
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,720
when will you be available?

359
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,370
Let's have a talk.

360
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,090
Whether it's through WeChat

361
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,200
or talking face to face

362
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,680
when you come back next time,

363
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,330
When you see this WeChat message,

364
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,810
please remember to reply to me.

365
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:28,550

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,550

don't keep any worries to yourself.

371
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,930
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

Yesterday, I was secretly eating ice cream downstairs in the neighborhood,

385
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,200
and Dr. He caught me red-handed.

386

He specifically reminded me to watch my diet.

In the neighborhood? At night?

388
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,280
He works at a clinic near our neighborhood,

389
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,960
so he lives in our neighborhood.

390
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,130
That's pretty normal, isn't it?

391
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,040
By the way,

I don't know.

called Danzhong acupoint.

If you massage it more,

402
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,650
you can disperse the qi.

403
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,520
This way, you won't feel so blocked up.

00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,460
Is this how you press it?

405
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,600

are here to suffer.

524

It's all your Marketing Department's fault.

525

Why do you have to come up with so many fancy ideas?

526
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,080
Can you stop being so smug when you're already getting the benefits?

527

If our Marketing Department doesn't take on more big events,

528
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,980
where would all those year-end bonuses come from?

529
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:56,960
That's true.

530
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,290
My study abroad agent told me today

531
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,050
that my practical experience is still a bit thin.

532
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,510
So I need experience with a large-scale event.

533
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,210
If I can successfully complete

534
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,440
this IT summit,

535
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:07,850
then

536
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,640
my chances of getting an offer

537
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,480
will

538
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,730
increase significantly.

539
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,250
You're setting your standards too high.

540
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,210
You insist on going to those

541
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,410
top 3 schools.

542
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,810
With so many competitors from all over the world,

543
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:18,730
it's very difficult.

544
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,850
I think

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
if I'm going to spend money to study abroad,

546
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,560
I should go to the best schools.

547
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:26,850
Otherwise, it's meaningless.

548
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,600
I agree.

549
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,730
Are you planning to apply for

550
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,410
the hospital's research funding this time?

551
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,660
I'll definitely apply.

I'm preparing the materials now.

553
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,170
But I might not be able to apply for it.

554
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,370
I did get it last year,

555
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,690
but the hospital didn't pay much attention to it,

556
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,960
so they didn't allocate much funding.

557
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,400
Your main research direction is too niche.

558
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,960
Palliative care in TCM oncology,

559
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,440
isn't it just end-of-life care, to put it bluntly?

560
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,640
It's hard to see immediate results.

561
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,770
Only someone with great compassion like you

562
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,040
can persist for so many years.

563
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,850
I truly admire you from the bottom of my heart.

564
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,640
And our hospital's funding is limited,

565
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,290
so the management can only allocate it this way, right?

566
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,410
Yes, indeed.

567
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,840
You could ask Professor Yu to endorse your application.

568
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,150
You'll definitely get the funding then,

569
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,930
and probably more of it too.

570
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,510
Forget it.

571
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,080
Professor Yu has so many teaching tasks that he can't finish them all.

572
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,480
I won't bother him.

573
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:29,740
Alright.

574
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,440
Why are you asking me about all this today?

575
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,090
I care about you.

576
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,080
Speak up.

577
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,600
What do you really want to say?

578
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,040
It's like this.

579
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,040
There's a blind date event tonight.

580
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,930
It's all doctors and nurses from the First Hospital.

581
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,080
They're short two men.

582
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,440
I want you to come with me

583
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,890
to give me some courage.

584
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,250
I'm not going.

585
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,750
I haven't even finished writing my research proposal.

586
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,640
When can't you write that proposal?

587
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,040
You're not getting any younger, you know.

588
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,520
It's time to start thinking about your personal issues.

589
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,210
You should find...

590
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,080
I think

591
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,520
you should find someone from our hospital.

592
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,600
Then you can go to work and leave work together.

593
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
It's so convenient. Why bother with blind dates?

594
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,290
Ah, you're no fun.

595
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,890
How can you pour cold water on me like that?

596
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,440
I really want to stop being single.

597
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,970
Xifan,

598
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,690
I've been thinking for a long time.

599
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,230
We should break up.

600
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,130
[The other party has rejected.]

601
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:44,250
[Yan Heng]

602
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,520
Why don't you just delete me?

603
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,540
♫Even if we're destined to meet and miss each other♫

604
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,730
Did she have another fight with her boyfriend?

605
00:41:54,750 --> 00:42:00,800
♫Life is finally complete♫
