You're really something, Shen Xifan.

5
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,100
You can't sleep well,

6
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,620
yet you came to sleep on the yoga mat

7
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,280
instead of sleeping in bed.

8
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,930
I thought since I couldn't sleep anyway,

9
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,350
I should get up and exercise.

10
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,010
It's healthier this way.

11
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:10,789
Alright.

12
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:12,230
Just sleep here then.

00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,350
Well, I don't know how to cook.

Mr. Shen.

Last night...

21
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,870
From 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.,

22
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,070
and then from 5 a.m. to 6 a.m.

23
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:39,960
Only a few hours.

24
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,789
Come on, eat this.

26
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:43,039
You only slept for less than five hours.

27
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:43,960
Give me the bowl.

28
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,200
Did you take melatonin?

29
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,229
Yes.

30
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:46,920
It didn't work.

31
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,120
What should we do?

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,509
We've tried everything, including sleep aid spray

33
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,400
and fragrance.

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,350

Do you have to work so hard?

You have trouble sleeping every day.

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,920
How about

42
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,480
I go get some sleeping pills?

43
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Sleeping pills won't do.

44
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,790
They'll cause damage to your brain.

45
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,229
But chronic sleep deprivation will also cause damage to my brain.

46
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,070

47
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,920
My legs are short.

48
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,390
I kicked the wrong person.

49

You did it on purpose, didn't you?

No. No.

Ms. Shen, why don't you

52
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,000
go see a TCM physician

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,670
and let him or her prescribe some traditional Chinese medicine for you to recuperate?

54
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,480
TCM is good.

55
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,829
I remember they said

56
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:23,950
in the neighborhood group chat that

57
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,630
there's a TCM clinic nearby.

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,829
There's an expert

00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,120
How did it go?

193
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,880
Did you see his face?

194
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,920
I didn't see his face. Sad.

195
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,310
Miss Shen.

196
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,190
I forgot to remind you.

197
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,670
The pharmacy closes at 5 p.m.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,830
Pharmacy decoction

199
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,600
takes four hours.

200
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,160
So,

201
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,590
you can come and collect your medicine

202
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,550
at 2 p.m.

203
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,790
Okay.

204
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,000
Miss Shen.

205
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,280
Our pharmacy closes at 5 p.m.

206
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,550
Pharmacy decoction

207
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,580
takes four hours.

208
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,590
So,

209
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,430
you can come

210
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,310
and collect your medicine at about 2 p.m.

211
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,550
Thank you.

212
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,720
-Take care.
-Thank you.

213
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,670
If you encounter any trouble

214
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,790
at work,

215
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,400
don't take it to heart.

216
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,760
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

217
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,470
You're going to study abroad?

218
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,360
You didn't even discuss such an important matter with me.

219
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,040
You've really changed.

220
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,360
I didn't have time to answer the phone,

221
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,640
so you just stopped talking to me?

222
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,250
Are you going to accuse me of not replying to your messages again?

223
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,470
Shen Xifan.

224
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,740
Being your boyfriend is too tiring.

225
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,430
You know how busy I am at work.

226
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,040
Can't you be more considerate of me?

227
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,590
Yan Heng.

228
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,120
Let's

229
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,550
not talk about this today, okay?

230
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,420
We haven't seen each other

231
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,380
for quite a long time.

232
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,540
What are you doing?

233
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,670
Go pay at the information desk later.

234
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,520
-Remember to use your medical insurance.
-Thank you.

235
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:25,950
It's nothing.

236
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,830
Thank you, doctor.

237
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,470
You're welcome.

238
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,520
Go.

239
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,760
Look, it's over there.

240
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,280
Thank you.

241
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,940
Take care.

242
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,390
Okay.

243
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,790
Remember to come and collect it before 5 p.m.

244
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,430
Otherwise, the pharmacy will close.

245
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,920
Dr. He.

246
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,180
Why are you here?

247
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,920
Anything wrong?

248
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,570
I have no appointment at the moment,

249
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,500
so I came out for a walk.

250
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,640
Dr. He.

251
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,310
You seem to be quite free all day.

252
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,760
It's time for me to get off work.

253
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,390
I'm leaving then.

254
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,910
Okay, see you next week.

255
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,590
Time to get off work,

256
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,640
Dr. Sun.

257
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,430
Okay.

258
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,670
Ms. Shen?

259
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,070
Here.

260
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,710
I got your medicine back for you.

261
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,360
Drink it.

262
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
What's wrong?

263
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,400
It's too bitter.

264
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:11,950
I don't want to drink it.

265
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,550
Bitter medicine is good for the disease.

266
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,760
Haven't you heard of this saying?

267
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,400
Drink it.

268
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,880
Can I really trust the doctor at my neighborhood clinic?

269
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,190
Suye.

270
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,070
Come and save me.

271
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,130
[Jiangzhou Medical University 
Affiliated TCM Hospital]

272
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,550
Dr. He, you're finally here.

273
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,280
Come on.

274
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,010
The patient's family was about to scold Li Jie to tears.

275
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,000
Are you good for nothing?

276
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,190
So you're saying,

277
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,520
you have to insert the tube

278
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,640
into his lungs again,

279
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,760
or he'll suffocate to death?

280
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,470
Do you believe

281
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,590
I'll report it to your director and dean?

282
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,360
That's not what I meant.

283
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:29,640
Dr. He.

284
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,190
Senior He.

285
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:30,670
Do something.

286
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,310
Calm down.

287
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,070
He can't even breathe now.

288
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,590
Medical record.

289
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,070
Lung cancer.

290
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,430
Tongue.

291
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,520
His tongue coating is thick and greasy, and his tongue is red.

292
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,470
Did you use needles?

293
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,760
Li Jie.

294
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:52,920
I did.

295
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,640
I inserted a needle into each of

296
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,980
the three acupoints: Feishu, Neiguan, and Fenglong.

297
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,120
The patient has lung cancer combined with infection,

298
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,120
and his respiratory secretions increased and turned into sputum.

299
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,710
The patient is in poor general condition.

300
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,240
Sputum is blocking his airways,

301
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,670
causing breathing difficulties for the patient.

302
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,000
Did he cough up sputum?

303
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,240
A little,

304
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,550
but he still couldn't breathe.

305
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,590
So I suggested using a sputum suction machine.

306
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,920
I'm worried if we delay it any longer...

307
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,550
If I had known that we would have to use a sputum suction machine,

308
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,670
we might as well have gone to a Western hospital.

309
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,710
Why would we have chosen a TCM hospital?

310
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,920
Hey.

311
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,190
What are you waiting for?

312
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,400
The machine is ready, isn't it?

313
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:20,900
Alright.

314
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,760
Li Jie.

315
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,400
Get ready for cupping.

316
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,310
I said, get ready for cupping.

317
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:24,760
Okay.

318
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,070
Go get the needle cart.

319
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:27,870
Okay.

320
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,240
Help the patient up.

321
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,360
Take off his shirt.

322
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,160
Sir.

323
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,120
Are you breathing better now?

324
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,360
Much better.

325
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,600
Thank you.

326
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,510
Fortunately, you coughed up the sputum.

327
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,320
Please take a rest.

328
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,510
Thank you, Dr. He.

329
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,800
It's all thanks to you, who came here in the middle of the night.

330
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,670
I was almost scared to death.

331
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,470
I thought he was going to be like my dad,

332
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,600
who had difficulty breathing

333
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,030
and suffocated to death.

334
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,120
Dr. Li also did the right thing inserting the needles.

335
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,430
He bought time for us.

336
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,570
He didn't dare to use the sputum suction machine

337
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,630
because the patient is aged.

338
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,810
[The patient needs to be observed for a while longer. I'll be on duty tonight. Don't worry.]

339
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,810
[What happened today is common. Don't take it to heart.]

340
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,130
[Okay, thank you, Suye.]

341
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,750
I wonder if she'll come

342
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,850
next week for the follow-up visit.

343
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,320
Shen Xifan.

344
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,540
Being your boyfriend is too tiring.

345
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,950
You don't care about me at all.

346
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,360
You only care about yourself.

347
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,370
Only I can put up with you.

348
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,120
Think about it yourself.

349
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,400
A rice ball,

350
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,990
and an egg.

351
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,500
How much is this soy milk?

352
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,470
I'll have one.

353
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:12,880
Okay.

354
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:13,710
Thank you.

355
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,430
What would you like to eat?

356
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,640
Boss.

357
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,750
I want a bowl of meat wonton,

358
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,920
one rice ball,

359
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,430
three tea eggs,

360
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,430
a pot of steamed buns,

361
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,750
and three fried dough sticks.

362
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:25,710
Okay.

363
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,560
Just a moment.

364
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,540
It'll be ready soon.

365
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,320
Where are you?

366
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,470
Ms. Liu. I couldn't sleep,

367
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,950
so I came down to buy breakfast.

368
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,670
I don't know why,

369
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,430
but that traditional Chinese medicine didn't work at all.

370
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,320
I couldn't sleep until three o'clock last night.

371
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,670
How about

372
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,320
you throw it away for me?

373
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,470
What a waste that would be.

374
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,430
Oh my god.

375
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,340
Dr. He.

376
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,230
Traditional Chinese medicine conditioning takes time.

377
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,600
You've only taken one pack.

378
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,880
How could it take effect so quickly?

569
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,950
We might as well let it go to waste, okay?

570
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,840
Besides,

571
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,190
I came here to see the handsome guy

572
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,030
and flirt with him.

573
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,670
Do you really think I came here to get TCM treatment?

574
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,990
Go get your medicine. I'll wait for you outside.

575
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,160
Wang Li.

576
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,600
Right.

577
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,910
Why did he stand me up?

578
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,800
Okay, take care.

579
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,470
Here's my prescription.

580
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,630
Let me see.

581
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,990
Did you tell Yan Heng that you were going abroad?

582
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,030
I told him.

583
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,560
He got really mad because of this.

584
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,670
Since then,

585
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,750
he has seldom replied

586
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,950
to my WeChat messages.

587
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,840
And I never had a chance to say it.

588
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,990
Actually, I've always wanted to ask you.

589
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,950
Are you really happy with him?

590
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,160
I don't know.

591
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,400
Maybe

592
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,340
I'm just used to it.

593
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,640
I’ve been together with Yan Heng for too long.

594
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,840
It's been seven whole years.

595
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
The two of us

596
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,430
know each other well,

597
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,160
and we're familiar with each other.

598
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,360
It's just I don't know why,

599
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,710
but over the past six months,

600
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,160
we've had fewer and fewer

601
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,230
common topics,

602
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,320
and there's been less and less to talk about.

603
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,270
Did he tell you how many days he'd be away for the business trip?

604
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,710
I told you, I couldn't reach him.

605
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,640
Ling.

606
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:24,880
Please throw

607
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,470
these flowers and the ones left by the door

608
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,600
away for me.

609
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,800
Okay.

610
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,280
He didn't go to the clinic.

611
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,230
I didn't expect he'd be here.

612
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:50,160
♫It became brighter because of you♫

613
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,230
♫The world suddenly became so cute♫

614
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,970
♫Maybe I'm too slow to understand♫

615
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,640
Shen Xifan?

616
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:01,730
♫I can't confess my passionate love to you♫

617
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,730
♫Love is an admiration for beauty♫

618
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,650
♫I've decided to only love you♫

619
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,080
Dr. He.

620
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,670
♫My foolishness♫

621
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,920
You live in this neighborhood too?

622
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,540
♫My sincerity♫

623
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,670
Yes.

624
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,190
This neighborhood is close to the clinic.

625
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,560
♫Only for one person♫

626
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,030
I moved here

627
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,840
for the convenience of seeing patients.

628
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,540
For the convenience of seeing patients...

629
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,330
I did ask you to come to the clinic for a follow-up visit,

630
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,990
but something urgent came up,

631
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,120
so I couldn't make it.

632
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,920
I'm sorry.

633
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,920
Did you

634
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,160
see another doctor?

635
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,670
I did.

636
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,270
That's good.

637
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,150
How about this?

638
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:39,600
I...

639
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,160
I'll go there again for another follow-up visit next weekend.

640
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,230
Don't stand me up again.

641
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,560
I'm leaving. Enjoy yourself.

642
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:44,940
Bye.

643
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,640
I...

644
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,750
Next week...

645
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:14,900
[Sunday]

646
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:45,949
What wine is this?

647
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,540
This is Professor Yu's favorite.

648
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,239
Grandpa.

649
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,070
I'm back.

650
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:54,360
Good timing.

651
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,510
Wash your hands and get ready for dinner.

652
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,840
Okay, you guys eat first.

653
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,630
I'll put these on the plate.

654
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,630
Suye.

655
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,950
Can you not tell Grandpa Yu that

656
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,550
I asked you to come to the City Hospital from the clinic

657
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,240
to help me out again yesterday?

658
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,550
I'm worried he'll tell my parents about it,

659
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,940
and my living expenses will be deducted again.

660
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,360
I'll be even poorer.

661
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,110
Don't worry.

662
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:20,800
Even if I tell him,

663
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,240
I'll be the one to be scolded.

664
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,030
Take it to the table.

665
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,070
Don't tell him.

666
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:31,510
Here.

667
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,430
The dish is ready.

668
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,760
Let's eat.

669
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,630
Wait.

670
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,320
Fill your glasses first.

671
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,240
Okay.

672
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,470
Here.

673
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,400
Help yourselves.

674
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,630
That's enough.

675
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,760
Thank you.

676
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,140
Raise your glasses.

677
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,630
Wish you all success in your studies.

678
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,740
-Thank you, Professor.
-Thank you, Grandpa Yu.

679
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,030
Take it slow.

680
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,070
Let's eat.

681
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,680
What have you learned

682
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,510
from this internship?

683
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,710
Feel free to talk about it.

684
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,630
Li Jie.

685
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,470
Don't just eat.

686
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,950
Tell me what you learned.

687
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,950
What I learned recently is that

688
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,950
when I'm facing

689
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,680
a patient's critical situation alone,

690
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,590
I need to be calm and decisive.

691
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,160
I shouldn't...

692
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,990
Alone?

693
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,880
He Suye.

694
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,070
You let an intern

695
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,470
face the critical situation alone?

696
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,360
He was on duty in the hospital that day. I...

697
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,680
Don't tell me any objective reasons.

698
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,530
Right, I left them to you.

699
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,070
It wasn't just to let you teach them theoretical knowledge.

700
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,550
What's more important is practice,

701
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,500
especially front-line practice.

702
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,750
Right.

703
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,430
But you can't

704
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,680
let him handle it alone.

705
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,550
Got it.

706
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,130
I'll be more careful in the future.

707
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,800
Have some wine.

708
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,530
Let's not talk about this now.

709
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,570
Come on.

710
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,770
Let's eat.

711
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,360
Let's eat.

712
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,920
Yesterday, I went to the clinic on your behalf,

713
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,800
and two young ladies came in for a follow-up visit.

714
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,630
When they saw it was me,

715
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,760
they looked

716
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,200
really disappointed.

717
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,560
So the doctor she saw was you.

718
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,720
One of them is surnamed Shen.

719
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,990
What's her name again...

720
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:51,760
Shen Xifan.

721
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,990
She has insomnia.

722
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,800
how's her situation this week?

723
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,240
I checked her pulse.

724
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,550
Her liver and kidneys are weak.

725
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,990
But

726
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,890
her sleep and complexion have improved.

727
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,070
I adjusted the amount of some ingredients according to your previous prescription

728
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,280
for another week.

729
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,110
That's good.

730
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,680
In the future, when you have to be absent,

731
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,550
inform the patients in advance.

732
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,300
Don't let them come for nothing.

733
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,110
It's also bad for your medical ethics.

734
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,720
I don't have her contact information.

735
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,950
How should I inform her in advance?

736
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,430
Patients are required to leave their phone numbers when making an appointment.

737
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,470
You can inquire about it at the front desk.

738
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,070
That won't do.

739
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,800
Then when she comes for the follow-up visit next time,

740
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,510
ask for

741
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,470
her phone number.

742
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,280
I like the look

743
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,110
of this girl.

744
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,360
She's pretty good-looking.

745
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,880
She has good temperament,

746
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,840
and she's quite elegant.

747
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,530
I liked her at first sight.

748
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,680
She's four years younger than you.

749
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,320
You're also suitable for each other in age.

750
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,240
That traditional Chinese medicine didn't work at all.

751
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,090
How about you

752
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,370
throw it away for me?

753
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
What a waste that would be.

754
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,320
Oh my god.

755
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:17,780

Dr. He.

757
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,880
I'll go there again for another follow-up visit next weekend.

758
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,510
Don't stand me up again.

759
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:35,570
♫No matter how much longer it is in the dark♫

760
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,480
♫Your voice is always gentle♫
