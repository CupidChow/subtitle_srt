What's wrong?

4
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,200
Don't you want to come back?

5
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,039
You're not enjoying it too much to come back, are you?

6
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,810
I'm not enjoying it too much to come back.

7
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,750
I still miss you a lot.

8
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,910
It's just...

00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,650
Shen Xifan,

10
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
we have a seven-hour time difference.

11
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,650
If you don't tell me, no one will.

12
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,590
Don't worry.

13
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,900
Here's the thing.

14
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,960
As you know,

15
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,400
my global internship ends next week.

16
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,100
But I got a new opportunity.

17
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,400
A two-month internship at a six-star hotel.

18
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,230
There are only five spots available.

19
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,280
I think it's a rare opportunity,

20
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,620
so I applied.

21
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,640
Already?

22
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,650
No, just now.

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,800
It was just this noon.

24
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,290
He Suye, are you angry?

25
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,160
Don't be mad.

26
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,250
I didn't mean to not discuss it with you.

27
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,340
I just thought it was a rare opportunity,

28
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,710
so I wanted to apply and give it a try.

29
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,620
I might not even be able to go, really.

30
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,040
It seems you don't want to come back

31
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,460
or see me at all.

32
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,690
No, I miss you very much.

33
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,550
I want to go back and see you right away.

34
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,560
It's just two months, right?

35
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:06,980
Alright then.

36
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,570
After all, I was the one who encouraged you to study abroad.

37
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,230
But let me tell you,

38
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,910
you'll have to tell Mr. and Mrs. Shen yourself.

39
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,720
I'm not going to say anything.

40
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,180
Don't worry.

41
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,530
I'll definitely tell them.

42
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,920
What about the visa? Has it come through?

43
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,300
I've been looking into third-country visas these days.

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,150
There shouldn't be any problems.

45
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,950
It should be approved.

46
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,680
Alright.

157
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,870

I just wanted to ask...

173
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,000
Has the area where you had surgery gotten better?

174
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,270
Does it still hurt?

175
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,690
Of course it's better.

176
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,850
Look at how energetic I am. Does it look like I haven't recovered?

177
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,070
Since I had that surgery,

178
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,970
He has been making me drink Chinese medicine every day.

179
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,090
Your dad prepares the medicine.

180
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,210
I also have to go for a check-up every three months.

181
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,840
I'm incredibly healthy now.

182
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,460
Alright.

183
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,550
Then,

184
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,630
I'll have to nicely coax him later.

185
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,080
Why do you need to do that?

186
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,390
In our family, your dad is the one who coaxes me.

187
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,580
Then you...

188
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,340
It's time to cook the fish!

189
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,150
Let's see.

190
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,850
I eat dinner because I'm overweight.

191
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,880
If you're overweight, shouldn't you eat less dinner

192
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,340
to lose weight?

193
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,670
As a doctor, you know...

194
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,150
High basal metabolism.

195
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,540
Food is the most important thing for the people.

196
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,410
If you don't eat, you...

197
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,460
♫When I see you♫

198
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,670
♫Flowers bloom♫

199
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,230
♫When I see you♫

200
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,520
Isn't she your precious girlfriend?

201
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,070
She's back in the country, huh?

202
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,010
Yes, she just got back a couple of days ago.

203
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,670
♫Flowers bloom♫

204
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,400
It's really true that absence makes the heart grow fonder.

205
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,520
You have to meet up even just for lunch.

206
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,720
It really is.

207
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,710
What do you know?

208
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,730
♫And I don't even know where else to go♫

209
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,940
I know.

210
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,000
Disappear immediately.

211
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,390
Let's go.

212
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,510
It's not that I don't know.

213
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,080
He disappears, I haven't eaten.

214
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:55,600
I'll treat you.

215
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,670
You disappear on your own, what does that have to do with me?

216
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,320
♫And I don't even know where else to go♫

217
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,440
♫When I see you♫

218
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,620
♫Flowers bloom♫

219
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:20,480
♫Nothing in this world can take me away from you♫

220
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,220
♫When I'm with you♫

221
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,240
♫When I'm with you♫

222
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,650
This... This is the hospital.

223
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,980
It's not good if people see us.

224
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,790
Look, there are people over there.

225
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,880
Alright.

226
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,710
Tell me why you're here.

227
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,020
To have a meal with you, of course.

228
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,240
Can't you wait until I'm off work to eat?

229
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,180
No.

230
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,150
That's not right.

231
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,220
What exactly do you want to do?

232
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,040
Me?

233
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,790
I just want to take advantage of when your girlfriend isn't around

234
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,940
to swoop in

235
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:21,600
and invade your life.

236
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,070
L-Lower your voice.

237
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,210
What nonsense are you talking about?

238
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,120
There are so many people here.

239
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,500
It'll be bad if people hear it.

240
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,890
How would it be bad?

241
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,990
I didn't register for your appointment

242
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,280
or go to your clinic.

243
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,030
I'm not affecting your work at all.

244
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,040
What do you think? Am I a good girl?

245
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,500
Fine.

246
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,540
You win.

247
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:58,840
Welcome.

248
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:07,589
Come.

249
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,190
Thank you.

250
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:10,910
You're welcome.

251
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,240
Eat the cherries.

252
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,079
Rose.

253
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,030
New products have arrived.

254
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,160
-It’s not sold yet.
-It’s beautiful.

255
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,890
It’s so fancy.

256
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,510
Boss Xu is personally serving us.

257
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,240
This is my supplier after all.

258
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,680
Of course, I have to treat you well.

259
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,590
Indeed, they look good.

260
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,330
Look how nice this photo is.

261
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,270
Please, don't send it out.

262
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,240
Don't affect my new product launch, okay?

263
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
It seems Boss Xu wants to

264
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,960
raise the supply prices, huh?

265
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,680
No, no, no.

266
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,310
Don't do this.

267
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,440
My small shop hasn't broken even yet.

268
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,270
Please be merciful.

269
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,880
No, it depends on Boss Xu's attitude.

270
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,920
Please, please, please.

271
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,680
Alright, alright.

272
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,880
Today, I've called everyone here

273
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,110
because there's something I want to announce.

274
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,840
Xiangya and I have decided to run this business together.

275
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,920
That's so sudden.

276
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,590
It's not sudden. We've been considering it for a long time.

277
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,460
So you're not going back to the hotel?

278
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,830
No.

279
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,830
During my study abroad,

280
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,350
I also studied many business cases.

281
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,000
I have

282
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,590
always wanted to create

283
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,440
a brand with its own unique characteristics.

284
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,310
Xiangya's business happens to have it.

285
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,540
That is, traditional Chinese medicine.

286
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,630
But it lacks systematic management.

287
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,720
So I plan to come and apply what I've learned.

288
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,020
The two of us hit it off immediately.

289
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,710
We specifically studied

290
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,070
the current online trends.

291
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,270
We already have a preliminary plan.

292
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,860
You two have been up to quite a lot behind my back.

293
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,950
Did you know about this?

294
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,590
I didn't know.

295
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,640
It's my first time hearing it too.

296
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,560
But we can indeed give it a try.

297
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,960
After all, it's not like studying hotel management

298
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
means you have to go back to a hotel.

299
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,480
Look.

300
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,510
This time,

301
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
hasn't my girlfriend changed a lot?

302
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,350
What makes you say that?

303
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:50,960
What?

304
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,310
She's become prettier.

305
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,240
Prettier?

306
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,400
Pretty. Really pretty.

307
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,440
Pretty. Really pretty.

308
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,640
This tea is really good.

309
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,510
Try this.

310
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,240
Here.

311
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,160
Drink something hot.

312
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,170
Wow, chocolate!

313
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,760
He Suye,

314
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,200
it’s snowing.

315
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,650
Really?

316
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,610
It's so beautiful.

317
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,870
Last winter,

318
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,590
it didn't seem to snow.

319
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,080
That's because I wasn't here last winter.

320
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,630
Look, I'm back this year and it's snowing.

321
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,370
It's the first snow of the year.

322
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,150
Then let me ask you.

323
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,000
How is the snow in Hang City

324
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,310
different from the snow in Switzerland?

325
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,960
Of course it's different.

326
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,190
The snow in Switzerland doesn't have you in it,

327
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,860
so it's especially cold.

328
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,410
But in the snow of Hang City,

329
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,370
you're here with me.

330
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,990
♫Your face♫

331
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,550

He Suye,

354
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,420
let's get married.

355
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,370
When spring comes next year,

356
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,040
let us

357
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,250
get married.

358
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:11,730
Wait.

359
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,440
During this year you've been studying abroad,

360
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,170
I've thought about so many things.

361
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:27,500
♫The moment I see you, all my worries turn transparent♫

362
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,800
Every day,

363
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,740
I want to wake up with you in the sunlight,

364
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:35,600
♫In the silence, the sound of my heartbeat grows clearer♫

365
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,860
fall asleep to the sound of rain,

366
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,530
run with you in the sunset,

367
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,160
and chat under the moonlight.

368
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:41,010
♫The entire world reflects in your eyes♫

369
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:49,660
♫Make a wish, can the snow fall slowly?♫

370
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,570
Just like this honeysuckle flower,

371
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,230
after this winter passes,

372
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,770
♫Even if we're destined to meet and miss each other♫

373
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,680
we will

374
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,910
be like two flowers on one stem,

375
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:59,920
♫Life is finally complete♫

376
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,080
with all my heart.

377
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,910
♫Watching the snow fall, flake by flake♫

378
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,650
Give me your life's time,

379
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,420
♫Slowly melting away my thoughts♫

380
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,090
and I'll give you

381
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,890
♫Smiling, I wave goodbye as you head home♫

382
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,200
my life's love.

383
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,650
♫But I never said those words♫

384
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:18,210
♫Watching the snow fall, flake by flake♫

385
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,120
♫When will love bloom into a flower?♫

386
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,880
Will you marry me?

387
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:27,840
♫You wander the world, forgetting to reply♫

388
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,910
I do.

389
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:31,610
♫When you turn around, I'll be right there♫

390
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,650
♫Flake by flake, the snow melts♫

391
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,160
♫When each other's thoughts are exchanged♫

392
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,630
♫The warm light takes away all the noise♫

393
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:01,390
♫Only the two of us remain in the world♫

394
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,950
♫Flake by flake, the snow melts♫

395
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,860
♫Love blooms quietly♫

396
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,930
♫Hold you close with a deep kiss♫

397
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,540
♫White lovers are answering♫

398
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:42,330
[Spring]

399
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,770
Let's take a photo.

400
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,440
It looks good.

401
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,900
Do you see how enthusiastically they were chatting?

402
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,790
Hello.

403
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,980
Xifan's uncle.

404
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,030
Actually, Dr. He and the bride

405
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,070
met while eating my spicy hot pot.

406
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,070
Really?

407
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,750
I'm not exaggerating.

408
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,960
So if I eat it, can I find a partner?

409
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,000
Don't worry. As long as you eat my spicy hot pot,

410
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,400
your love will come soon.

411
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Really?

412
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,350
The weather is quite nice today.

413
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,130
Oh, indeed.

414
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,510
You've arrived early.

415
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,410
We'll have to change how we address each other now.

416
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,000
We're in-laws now.

417
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,550
In-law.

418
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,370
Mother-in-law.

419
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,660
You haven't met before, have you?

420
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
This is Wang.

421
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,710
Hello.

422
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,440
This is Wang's son, Chang.

423
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,160
Hello.

424
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:47,830
Call him Uncle.

425
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,920
Call him Uncle.

426
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,550
Hello, Uncle.

427
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,880
You should call her Aunt.

428
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,070
Hello, Aunt.

429
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,960
Hello.

430
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,910
Ze, slow down.

431
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,070
Thank you.

432
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,640
Li.

433
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,000
Zhao Ze?

434
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,880
You have hair!

435
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,160
I told you last time.

436
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,400
How have you been feeling lately?

437
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
I've recovered very well.

438
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,550
My mom said

439
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:13,270
I should be able to participate in the sports meet next semester.

440
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,640
You're even participating in sports meets?

441
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,350
What's wrong?

442
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,790
I'm very strong, you know.

443
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,110
It's so hot, but keep up the good work.

444
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,270
Win a gold medal for me, okay?

445
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:20,750
Okay.

446
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,920
Let me see.

447
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:23,880
Boss.

448
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,510
Give me another one of those...

449
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,110
Boss.

450
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,310
Get me a spicy hot pot with instant noodles.

451
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,590
Extra spicy and numbing, thank you.

452
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,440
Hey.

453
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,610
Don't you know it's first come, first...

454
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,830
You,

455
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,850
quickly make a bowl of spicy hot pot for this young lady.

456
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,840
Extra spicy and numbing.

457
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,350
Okay.

458
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,510
Wow, 188.

459
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:48,950
Hello.

460
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
My name is Song Feng.

461
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,590
Today's groom is my junior.

462
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,020
Miss.

463
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,270
Do you

464
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,250
dare to

465
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,360
add me on WeChat?

466
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,360
Sure.

467
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,160
Thank you.

468
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,330
Am I handsome?

469
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,000
You take after me.

470
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,850
The bride is coming.

471
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,310
The bride is coming.

472
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,130
The bride is coming.

473
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,000
The bride is coming.

474
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,950
The bride is coming.

475
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,160
Groom,

476
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,960
Mr. He Suye,

477
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,030
please calm down.

478
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,840
We know you're anxious,

479
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,790
but don't be anxious.

480
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,930
I want to ask you something.

481
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,130
Do you want to see how beautiful

482
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,190
your bride is?

483
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,180
I do.

484
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,880
Alright,

485
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,460
then let me take a look for you first.

486
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,060
She's truly beautiful.

487
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,510
Absolutely stunning.

488
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,240
I know you must be feeling overwhelmed.

489
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,530
You must have a lot to say to her.

490
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,380
Then...

491
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,220
Let me give you one more piece of advice.

492
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,270
If

493
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,890
what you say isn't satisfactory enough,

494
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,290
not sincere enough,

495
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,440
not genuine enough,

496
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,440
she'll just stand there,

497
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,550
or

498
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,790
take a taxi home.

499
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,310
So,

500
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,830
are you ready?

501
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,860
The microphone is yours.

502
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,160
I have...

503
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,830
Dreamed countless times

504
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,430
of you in a wedding dress,

505
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,880
holding a bouquet,

506
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,530
walking towards me step by step.

507
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,650
And today,

508
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,290
my dream

509
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,550
has finally come true.

510
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,710
In our days together,

511
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,800
we've walked many, many streets together.

512
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,410
Together,

513
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,350
we've passed through rainy forests

514
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,950
and we've also seen

515
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,130
the sea of flowers on the mountains.

516
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,470
You told me

517
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,940
that in the days to come,

518
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,600
we have to see

519
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,400
even more

520
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,480
beautiful sceneries together.

521
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,610
But in my heart,

522
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,270
you

523
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,990
are the most beautiful scenery

524
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,170
in this world.

525
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:35,850
Great!

526
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,429
Xifan,

527
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,880
falling in love with you

528
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,520
is the luckiest thing I've ever done.

529
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,870
Loving you

530
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,580
is the best thing

531
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:25,889
I've ever done.

532
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,820
He Suye,

533
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,770
me too.

534
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:57,240
Great!

535
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:32,430

We met at a not-so-good time.

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,730
At that time,

553
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,920
I never even thought

554
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,290

suddenly be full of color.

559
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,430
♫Watching the snow fall, flake by flake♫

560
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,940
♫Slowly melting away my thoughts♫

561
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,410
♫Smiling, I wave goodbye as you head home♫

562
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:08,170
♫But I never said those words♫

563
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,730
♫Watching the snow fall, flake by flake♫

564
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,640
♫When will love bloom into a flower?♫

565
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:21,360
♫You wander the world, forgetting to reply♫

566
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,990
Back then,

567
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,220
I was lost and helpless,

568
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,440
letting myself slowly fall into an abyss.

569
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,140
♫When you turn around, I'll be right there♫

570
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,460
It was you who grabbed my hand

571
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,880
and never let go,

572
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,800
letting me struggle back to the surface

573
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,710
and be able to breathe again.

574
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,490
It was like waking up from a nightmare

575
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,520
♫If missing someone is the stars hanging by the horizon♫

576
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,710
and seeing

577
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,320
that golden sunlight of redemption in the sky.

578
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:56,900
♫I'll remember the scenery with you every time the stars dazzle♫

579
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:02,100
♫Keep flying along our memories♫

580
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:11,250
♫When the snow stops, time will prove everything♫

581
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,030
From now on,

582
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,510
let me love you as I love myself,

583
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,410
and love myself as I love you.

584
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,990
♫Even if we're destined to meet and miss each other♫

585
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:21,250
♫Life is finally complete♫

586
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,960
Loving you

587
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,320
is the best thing

588
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,090
I've ever done.

589
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:23,790
[Hope everyone with a good heart can find a long-lasting love in the gaps of life.]

590
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:38,440
[it's okay. Learn to love yourself first, more than anyone else in the world.]

591
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:38,440
[If you can't find that person yet, or you've lost the courage to search,]

592
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:49,500
[And someone will appear in the light shining through the crack.]

593
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:59,210
[The End]
