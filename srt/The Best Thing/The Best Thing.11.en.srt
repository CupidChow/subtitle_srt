[The Best Thing]

2
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:48,440
[Episode 11: Dragon bones are astringent and sweet in taste and neutral in nature. They calm the mind, pacify the liver, subdue yang, and stabilize bodily functions.]

3
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,210
Do you eat pepper?

4
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,030
Dr. He.

5
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,710
What's this?

6
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,930
This keychain…

7
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,860
I...

8
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,000
What's this?

9
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,840
The white item.

10
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,630
It's a dragon bone.

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Dragon bone?

12
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,360
Like an actual dragon's bone?

13
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,030
Not a real dragon's bone.

14
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,670
In TCM,

15
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,710
ancient mammal fossils are referred to

16
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,840
as dragon bones.

17
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:49,880
Look,

18
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,430
this piece is from a joint,

19
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,490
so it has all these honeycomb-like holes.

20
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,630
It can be used as a keychain.

21
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,960
Dr. He.

22
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,180
Isn't it illegal for you to possess a fossil?

23
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,740
This isn't a real fossil.

24
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,530
How could I possibly buy a real one?

25
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,510
It's just a cow bone buried underground by farmers.

26
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,300
It's also used as medicine.

27
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,820
It calms the liver, subdues yang,

28
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,770
soothes the mind, and promotes blood circulation.

29
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,400
Alright.

30
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,480
Go wash your hands for dinner.

31
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,190
It's almost ready.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,800
Restroom's to the left.

33
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,560
What's wrong? Does it taste bad?

34
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,360
No, it's delicious.

35
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,400
Let me get you a bowl of soup.

36
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,870
Thank you.

37
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,590
Give me your bowl.

38
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,350
Oh, Dr. He,

39
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,750
did you see the group photo

40
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,750
I sent you?

41
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,820
Let me show you again.

42
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,740
Okay.

43
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,150
Here.

44
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,700
What's wrong?

45
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,430
This photo...

46
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,360
is not very good.

47
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,730
Not very good?

48
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,120
But I think you look quite handsome in it.

49
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,000
What don't you like about it?

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,730
I can edit it for you.

51
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,240
It's not about editing.

52
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,960
I look too serious.

53
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,210
Looking serious is good.

54
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,090
It shows that our consultant

55
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,040
is dedicated

56
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,159
and professional.

57
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,260
I mean, I look so serious

58
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,310
that it doesn't reflect my mood that day.

59
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,750
Mood?

60
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,580
That day…

61
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,630
I was really happy.

62
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,140
It's hot.

63
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,350
Here.

64
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:35,990
Thank you.

65
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,380
Dr. He,

66
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,460
my parents just messaged me, asking me to go home.

67
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,900
I'll be leaving now.

68
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,260
Well, wait for me a moment.

69
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,900
I need to take the trash downstairs.

70
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,710
Let's go down together.

71
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,420
Okay.

72
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,070
Well, I'm heading home.

73
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,340
Okay.

74
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,630
Bye-bye.

75
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,780
Bye-bye.

76
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,110
Dr. He,

77
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,380
look at this.

78
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,930
Doesn't it look like a ring?

79
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,630
Keep it. No need to thank me.

80
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,680
The thing you gave me at noon…

81
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,120
I lost it.

82
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,380
It was gone when I got off work.

83
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,190
Dr. He.

84
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,160
What is this?

85
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,490
It wasn't the same ring, was it?

86
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,770
Manager Shen,

87
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,240
are you there?

88
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,230
Received. I'm here.

89
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,610
The guest in Room 8252 isn't feeling well,

90
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,280
but she refuses to go to the hospital.

91
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,510
Come check on her quickly.

92
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,030
Alright, I'm on my way.

93
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,860
Thank you.

94
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,220
Manager,

95
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,680
should we call an ambulance?

96
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,030
That's not necessary.

97
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,860
But what if something happens?

98
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,070
I'm just in a bit of pain.

99
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,400
I'll be fine after taking some medicine.

100
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,790
Thank you both.

101
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,610
How about this? You go back.

102
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,830
I'll call you if anything comes up.

103
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,310
Okay.

104
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,990
Senior Lin,

105
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,070
Room 8252 might need medical assistance.

106
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,570
Should I call an ambulance?

107
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,170
Keep it on standby for now.

108
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,700
I'll let you know if she needs it.

109
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,750
Alright.

110
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,010
Okay.

111
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,070
Thank you for today.

112
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,310
I ran out of painkillers

113
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,580
and didn't have time to buy more.

114
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,390
It's okay.

115
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,950
But…

116
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,030
where does it hurt exactly?

117
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,150
We work with a medical team

118
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,590
that can offer you a free consultation.

119
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,470
No need.

120
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,070
This happens to me occasionally.

121
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,070
Once I take painkillers, I'll be fine.

122
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,910
I've noticed

123
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,170
you don't hang out with your tour group much.

124
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,190
I don't have the energy or stamina

125
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,030
to wander around

126
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,220
like the others.

127
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,980
Besides,

128
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,150
I'm not really familiar with them.

129
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,390
Didn't you

130
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,930
sign up for the trip with them?

131
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,980
While traveling in another city,

132
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,580
I learned about this tour group

133
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,100
and just decided to join.

134
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
I've been traveling like this for over a year.

135
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,540
It's quite freeing.

136
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,050
Hope you don't mind me asking—

137
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,600
where's your family?

138
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,390
My husband passed away.

139
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,910
And my children

140
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,150
are all abroad,

141
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,740
too busy to take care of me.

142
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,500
While I still have the energy,

143
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,620
I want to see the beautiful landscapes of my country.

144
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,430
So I sold my house

145
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,670
and started traveling

146
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,030
all around the country.

147
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,620
I send them photos now and then

148
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,020
to let them know I'm alright.

149
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,910
Thank you so much for today, dear.

150
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,310
Not at all. This is part of my job.

151
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,360
I packed some freshly made soup for you.

152
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,580
Thank you.

153
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,150
Take it home for your parents.

154
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,790
Okay.

155
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,860
The medicinal cuisine combo was a huge success.

156
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,150
We gained 10,000 followers on Weibo.

157
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,860
Really?

158
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,580
That many?

159
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,030
Look for yourself.

160
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,670
Amazing!

161
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,620
I'm the biggest contributor here.

162
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,170
This whole TCM wellness plan was my idea.

163
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,500
Once this is over, I'll treat you to a fancy meal and a spa.

164
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,190
Deal.

165
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,950
Xiangya,

166
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,030
you're not really interested in Li Jie, are you?

167
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,150
Who doesn't like a cute young boy?

168
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,250
I'm serious.

169
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,980
What's going on between you and Senior Lin?

170
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,570
You know he's going back to his hometown, right?

171
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,310
If he's going back to start a family and build a career,

172
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,430
I can't stop him.

173
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,950
Well,

174
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,310
maybe he hasn't made up his mind yet.

175
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,310
Yeah,

176
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,860
maybe he hasn't,

177
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,980
but I'm not going to put my life on hold for his "maybe."

178
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,500
You've only been in one relationship.

179
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,980
You can't even figure out your own love life,

180
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,070
yet you're giving me advice?

181
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,550
Don't be so harsh.

182
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,950
But seriously,

183
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,220
go easy on Li Jie.

184
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,890
He's been in school all this time.

185
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,880
Don't mess with the poor boy.

186
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,220
I told you, stay out of it.

187
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,980
Can't you tell I'm not into him?

188
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,550
He is

189
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,830
a little goofy and kind of adorable.

190
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,400
But I don't like him like that.

191
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,210
That's what I thought.

192
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,470
Your taste changed way too fast.

193
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,860
You went from spicy hotpot to bland soup.

194
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,780
Spot on.

195
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,430
But don't tell Lin Yishen about it.

196
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,200
Why?

197
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,810
You're playing hard to get?

198
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,340
It's not like that.

199
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,100
I just think…

200
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,030
there must be a reason why the stars have never aligned

201
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,030
for us all these years.

202
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,860
From college until now,

203
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,500
when I was in a relationship, he was single;

204
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,660
when I was single, he was in a relationship.

205
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:23,950
I admit,

206
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,670
I've dated a lot of guys,

207
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,340
but

208
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,580
if two people…

209
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,700
keep missing the opportunities to be together,

210
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,830
is it possible that they just

211
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,130
don't like each other enough?

212
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,270
Alright.

213
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,500
Let's not talk about this anymore.

214
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,450
We'll solve our problems ourselves.

215
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,170
And your problems—

216
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,880
you need to figure them out on your own too.

217
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,790
I'm leaving.

218
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,610
Here it is.

219
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,400
What's it?

220
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,860
Try the medicinal dish from the grand hotel.

221
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,650
Let me see what's in it.

222
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,710
Red dates, goji berries, pork ribs,

223
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,820
taro,

224
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,650
and… What's that small thing?

225
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,640
That should be the Codonopsis root.

226
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,970
Yep, that's right.

227
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,420
Wait, wait!

228
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,500
I need to take a photo first.

229
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,270
I'll share it in the group chat

230
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,260
so everyone can learn how to make this medicinal dish.

231
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,350
Okay.

232
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,220
Done?

233
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,340
It smells amazing.

234
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,290
By the way, Mom and Dad,

235
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,290
you guys get annual health checkups, right?

236
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,190
Of course.

237
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,580
Are they comprehensive?

238
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,490
Is anything wrong?

239
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,420
Everything's fine.

240
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,050
Your mom and I are very healthy.

241
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,400
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

242
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,620
I just realized

243
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,910
I've never really paid attention

244
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,310
to your health before.

245
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,100
Finally having a conscience.

246
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,090
We'll take good care of ourselves.

247
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,280
You don't need to worry.

248
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,620
I got a reply.

249
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,330
They said this medicinal dish looks great…

250
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,500
And that it was made by Li,

251
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,190
the guy I set you up with on a blind date.

252
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,860
They also said his mentor

253
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,510
went to your hotel as a consultant with him.

254
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,110
Really?

255
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,390
Is that true?

256
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,210
We invited him and his senior to be consultants.

257
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,730
His senior brought him along.

258
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,130
Then why don't you reach out to him directly?

259
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,860
Why go in such a roundabout way?

260
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,100
It's not like you don't know him.

261
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,820
Just contact him directly.

262
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,390
Why would I contact him?

263
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,500
Didn't I already say it last time?

264
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,020
I don't have feelings for him.

265
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,950
Yeah, yeah,

266
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,650
that same line again.

267
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,260
You're brushing me off again.

268
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,950
Every time I set you up on a blind date,

269
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,430
you come back saying the exact same thing—

270
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,589
"no feelings."

271
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,430
You're just like your dad,

272
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,460
always brushing me off.

273
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,349
Why am I suddenly involved in this?

274
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,950
When did I ever brush you off?

275
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,200
There are only three people in this family,

276
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,800
and you always play the peacemaker,

277
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:29,290
always acting like the good guy.

278
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,590
What's that saying again?

279
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,190
Is the good guy the red face or the white face?

280
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,350
No idea.

281
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,430
I have no idea.

282
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,700
Whatever it is, you always play the good guy

283
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,780
and leave me to be the bad guy.

284
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,600
I'm the only bad person in this family.

285
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,020
How could Mom be a bad person?

286
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,890
Yeah.

287
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,370
Look, she's so agitated.

288
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,460
It's all the Codonopsis root's fault!

289
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,020
Exactly. From now on,

290
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,540
no more Codonopsis roots in her soup.

291
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,060
Right.

292
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,910
We won't even mention those two words.

293
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,670
Right.

294
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,910
-Don't drink it anymore.
-Not anymore.

295
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,300
Yeah, yeah.

296
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:53,910
Move it away.

297
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,300
I'll drink it instead.

298
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,700
This soup tastes really good.

299
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,830
You need to learn how to make it

300
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,870
and make it for us often.

301
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,260
You drink some more.

302
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,700
You can't drink it!

303
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,790
It makes you irritable.

304
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,900
You can't drink it!

305
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,190
It's spilled!

306
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,780
Remind the elderly guests

307
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,870
to take all their luggage.

308
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,870
Make sure they check out smoothly.

309
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,500
Alright, that's it.

310
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,120
Madam,

311
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,740
you haven't checked out?

312
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,700
I'm staying a bit longer.

313
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,980
Your hotel is very comfortable,

314
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,940
and the service is great.

315
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,460
I'd like to extend my stay.

316
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,140
Okay.

317
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,540
I'll let the front desk know

318
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,630
and have them arrange your extension.

319
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,340
I'd like to change rooms.

320
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,410
The villas here look really nice.

321
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,700
Can I switch to one of them?

322
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,650
No problem. I'll apply for a discount for you.

323
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,310
That's even better.

324
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,190
Also, could you get me some of that incense from last time?

325
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,060
I really liked it.

326
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,830
Sure thing.

327
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,260
Thank you so much.

328
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,020
You're welcome.

329
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,830
Thanks for your hard work.

330
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,150
Okay.

331
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:53,830
I'll let you get back to work.

332
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Take care, madam.

333
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,260
Alright, goodbye.

334
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,350
Ms. Shen,

335
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,090
dry your hair before going to bed.

336
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,980
Got it.

337
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,930
I'm so tired.

338
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,900
I slept for 10 hours.

339
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,150
Bliss.

340
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,660
Wait a moment.

341
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,690
It hurts.

342
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,150
Ms. Liu,

343
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,670
Mr. Shen,

344
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,010
help me!

345
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,640
[Honganmen Clinic]

346
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,250
What's wrong with you?

347
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,300
I slept funny last night.

348
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,300
When I woke up, I couldn't move.

349
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,610
A stiff neck, huh?

350
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,360
Alright, let me check on you.

351
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,900
Be gentle, please.

352
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,190
I know. I'm always gentle.

353
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,950
Here?

354
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,700
Relax.

355
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,220
Relax.

356
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,110
It's okay.

357
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,260
It hurts.

358
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:42,830
How do you feel?

359
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,740
A little better?

360
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,590
Yeah.

361
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:46,700
Alright.

362
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,020
Here.

363
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,350
Put your chin in my palm.

364
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:51,340
Relax.

365
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,350
Now, slowly turn your head to the right.

366
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,080
Turn.

367
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,110
Turn.

368
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,950
Turn.

369
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,780
Can you turn any further?

370
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,760
No.

371
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,500
Okay.

372
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,980
Don't strain your neck.

373
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,300
Relax.

374
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,540
Relax.

375
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,690
I...

376
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:16,960
How is it?

377
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,350
Try moving your neck.

378
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,700
Is it much better?

379
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,460
Much better.

380
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,460
Does it hurt anywhere else?

381
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,540
My back hurts.

382
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,020
Your back hurts too?

383
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,020
Yes, this side.

384
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:31,980
Alright.

385
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,190
Relax.

386
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,500
Don't move.

387
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,950
Does it hurt here?

388
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,150
It hurts. It hurts.

389
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,500
Here?

390
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,260
A little.

391
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,110
It feels sore.

392
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,620
Alright, get up.

393
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,190
Careful, slow down.

394
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,500
Okay.

395
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,110
Cross your arms

396
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,300
around your shoulders.

397
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,810
Hold tight.

398
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,660
Like this?

399
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
Yes, hold tight.

400
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,110
Okay.

401
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,150
Now,

402
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,390
relax slowly

403
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,780
and lean on my shoulder.

404
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,630
Relax.

405
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,780
Relax.

406
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:30,490
How is it?

407
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,990
How do you feel now?

408
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,350
Much better?

409
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,250
Sit down.

410
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,190
It's important to have a good sleeping posture.

411
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,500
Otherwise, you might get a stiff neck.

412
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,870
I'll prescribe you some medicine.

413
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,260
Here's your prescription.

414
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,700
Take this to get your meds later.

415
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,570
If you're still feeling unwell,

416
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,750
I can get them for you.

417
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,980
Thank you.

418
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,260
What's that face?

419
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,590
I didn't even charge you for the massage.

420
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,310
Thank you so much.

421
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,620
I'm heading out.

422
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,430
Please help me with my meds. Bye-bye.

423
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,350
What's going on?

424
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,870
Hello?

425
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,070
Hey, Xu Xiangya.

426
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,040
You know what? I went to Dr. He for a massage today.

427
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,220
He used so much force

428
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,540
that he literally lifted me off the ground!

429
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,830
Xiangya?

430
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,400
Shen Xifan!

431
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,150
Did you seriously wake me up early

432
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,150
just to tell me

433
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,670
that he's not gentle with women?

434
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,670
[Pharmacy]

435
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,420
Ms. Wu.

436
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,440
Dr. He.

437
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,080
Has Shen Xifan picked up her medicine?

438
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,580
Not yet. Only hers is left.

439
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,500
They're all hers, right?

440
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,740
I'll take them to her.

441
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,670
You'll take them to her?

442
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,870
She lives right across the street.

443
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,950
It's just a few steps away.

444
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,340
Does she really need you to deliver them?

445
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,700
I'm off.

446
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,140
Alright.

447
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,160
Chinese characteristics…

448
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,550
How do I write this?

449
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:05,940
Shen Xifan.

450
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,110
What a coincidence.

451
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,680
I picked up your medicine.

452
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:11,850
Thank you.

453
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,020
What's wrong?

454
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,190
Nothing.

455
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,430
I was going to look for you at the clinic.

456
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,630
What for?

457
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,110
I want to ask you about

458
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,390
some professional details on aromatherapy and sachets.

459
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,220
Perfect. Let's talk at my place.

460
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,910
What's wrong?

461
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:34,940
Let's go.

462
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,700
Okay.

463
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,480
Let me carry this for you.

464
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:40,980
Thank you.

465
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,500
Let's go.

466
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,730
Come in. Change into these.

467
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,500
Thank you.

468
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,740
I'll put the medicine in the fridge.

469
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,540
Make yourself comfortable.

470
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,560
Have a seat.

471
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,460
I'll get you a drink.

472
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,440
Okay.

473
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,350
Sorry about the mess.

474
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,950
I haven't tidied up in a while.

475
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,850
It's fine.

476
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,350
Why don't you

477
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,780
sit here?

478
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,670
Okay.

479
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,150
Thank you.

480
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,550
So, what do you need me to do?

481
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,740
I want to use this TCM wellness trip

482
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,700
as my practical project

483
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,110
and submit it along with my application

484
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,300
to the school in Switzerland,

485
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,430
but I feel like I still need to polish it up.

486
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,870
How can I help?

487
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,700
I've already finished

488
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,820
the overall project plan,

489
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,520
but I'm still missing an introduction.

490
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,700
Do you have any ideas?

491
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,740
How do you want to write it?

492
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,670
I want to write about the stories behind aromatherapy and sachets

493
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,540
and their historical development.

494
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,740
The earliest records

495
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,950
about sachets

496
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,740
actually date back to the Shang and Zhou dynasties.

497
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:50,910
I have some materials

498
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,020
that might help.

499
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,480
Wait a moment.

500
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,980
This is an essay I wrote in university

501
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,780
about the culture of sachets.

502
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,870
You can use it as a reference.

503
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,950
Thank you.

504
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,980
Can I take a look?

505
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,110
Of course.

506
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,210
♫A light scent♫

507
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,920

♫The elusive little mist appears and disappears♫

509
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,110
Do you think I can quote this part?

510
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,460
"Fragrant flowers and herbs

512

over 2,000 years ago as symbols of ritual and sentiment.

514
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,950
The culture of fragrance reached its peak during the Song dynasty."

about creative sachets?

521
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,390
Sounds good.

522
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,670
You could also reference the studies of

523
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,670
Hua Tuo,

524
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,780
Sun Simiao,

525
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,740
and Li Shizhen

526
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,260
on the medicinal properties of sachets.

527
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,870
Great idea! That would

528
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,910
tie in even better with the wellness trip theme.

529
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,260
I'll write it here now.

530
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,300
Can you check it for me later?

531
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,430
Sure, no problem.

532
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,790
Do you want to write here or in the study?

533
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,250
Here will do.

534
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,220
Okay.

535
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,930
I'll go do my thing.

536
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:45,610
Thank you.

537
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,290
Dr. He,

538
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,390
I'm done writing.

539
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,390
Take a look at it.

540
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,350
So quickly?

541
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,410
Let me see.

542
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,540
What's wrong?

543
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,290
I...

544
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:04,870
I was just thinking

545
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,300
if I didn't write it well,

546
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,190
please don't be too harsh on me.

547
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,660
You are not my student.

548
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,060
Why would I be harsh on you?

549
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,700
Besides,

550
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,740
from what I've read so far, it's really well done.

551
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,340
Really?

552
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,270
Really.

553
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,670
There's no problem with it.

554
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,630
Then, I'll send it to my agent

555
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,590
so he can forward it to the school.

556
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,470
Okay.

557
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,010
Okay.

558
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,010
Your phone's ringing.

559
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,910
It's the overseas education agency.

560
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,940
I'll take it.

561
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,130
Use the study.

562
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:51,910
It's quiet there.

563
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,800
Okay.

564
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,490
I'll be back soon.

565
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,270
Hello?

566
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Is there a problem with the application materials?

567
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,920
Go ahead.

Coming.

578
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,950
Manager Shen?

579
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,340
What are you doing here?

580
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,310
I'm here to discuss something

581
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,820
with Dr. He.

582
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,090
I didn't interrupt anything, did I?

583
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,960
No.

584
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,830
Not at all.

585
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,790
Why are you here?

586
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,580
I'm meeting

587
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,710
Professor Yu tomorrow to discuss my research report.

588
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,580
I brought it over for you to check it for me first.

589
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,400
I brought some food too.

590
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,800
Since you two have serious business to handle,

591
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,270
I'll get going.

592
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,010
I'm done with my thing anyway.

593
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,510
I'll get your medicine for you.

594
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,100
Your glasses.

595
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,020
Your medicine.

596
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:10,700
Well,

597
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,460
thank you.

598
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,120
I'll leave you two to it.

599
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:15,740
Bye-bye.

600
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,010
You're working hard tonight.

601
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,390
Is that a bad thing?

602
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,660
Working hard

603
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,540
is good.

604
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,380
But tonight isn't the best time.

605
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,650
Tonight?

606
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,190
You like Manager Shen, don't you?

607
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,050
I knew it.

608
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,730
Last time at the hotel,

609
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,460
there were sparks between the two of you.

610
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,460
What stage are you at now?

611
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,430
Tell me!

612
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,010
How is that any of your business?

613
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,720
You talk too much.
