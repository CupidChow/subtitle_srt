As long as it's your prescription.

5
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,400
I'll pack the donkey-hide gelatin for her separately.

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,580
One week's dosage.

7
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,910
Okay, no problem.

8
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,840
Then that's it for now.

9
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,070
I've confirmed it. It's all good.

Okay, thank you.

See you.

13
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,920
See you.

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,150
Was that Miss Shen? She came again?

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,080
What's wrong?

18
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,190
Dr. He asked me for her phone number.

19
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,430
Really?

20
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,000
I didn't even notice that.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,150
Shh, keep it down...

Nice handwriting, Dr. He.

27
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,190
This medicine's way too bitter.

28
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,680
What does it include this time?

29
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,220
It literally starts with the bitter goldthread.

30

33
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,310
It appears dark brown...

34
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,630
Gosh, I can tell it's bitter just by looking at it.

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,120

40
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,829
Stop scrolling on your phone before bed.

41
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,310
Ease your mind. It helps with sleep.

How can I reply to you if I don't scroll on my phone?

45
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,240
Fine.

Well.

56
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,190
Ms. Shen, you're amazing.

57
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,310
Can't believe you actually napped all the way until now.

58
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,070
I'm back from school already.

59
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,950
I woke up once,

60
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,000
went to the bathroom and fell asleep again.

61

Are you hungry?

62
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,070
If you're hungry, let your dad heat the food for you.

63
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,950
The dishes have gone cold.

64
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,370
I have no appetite.

65

Do you two want to come with me?

69
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,510
I can't go.

70

74
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,640
just got updated today.

75

Alright then.

76
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,210

78
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,240

79
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay.

80
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,790
Okay.

81
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,600
Does the medicine taste that bad?

82
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,470
There's still some left.

83
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,240
Take a sip, huh?

84
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,159
Why would I?

85
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,120
I don't have insomnia.

86
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,360
Why are you out skateboarding

87
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,240
at this hour today?

88
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,010
I'm feeling groggy

89
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,920
after a day's work.

90
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,430
So I'm out to get some fresh air and unwind.

91
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,890
What's that look?

92
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,310
I can't skateboard?

93
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,310
I think Tai Chi suits you better.

94
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,430
Then, should I wear

95
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,190
a traditional suit

96
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:05,870
for Tai Chi?

97
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,430
Yes.

98
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,070
With a pair of plain cloth shoes.

99
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,750
Are you really unbiased like you said?

100
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,510
Do you think TCM physicians are all old men?

101
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,000
They're always respectfully referred to as "Old TCM Physicians."

102
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,430
If they're not old, why are they addressed as  "Old TCM Physicians?"

103
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,650
You seem to be in good spirits today.

104
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,020
I'm not mocking you.

105
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,740
"Old" doesn't only refer to age.

106
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,130
It's also about experience and professional capabilities.

107
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,680
I'm complimenting you.

108
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,830
After taking your medicine yesterday,

109
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,360
I slept for four hours in the afternoon.

110
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,040
It's very effective.

111
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,740
Now we're talking.

112
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,920
I'll go grab something at the convenience store ahead.

113
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,510
Are you coming with me?

114
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,830
Sure.

115
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,650
I'll go buy some snacks.

116
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,080
Let's go.

117
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,550
What do you want to buy?

118
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,870
I haven't decided yet.

119
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,600
I'll just browse around.

120
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,270
What about you?

121
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,010
If I'm taking TCM medicine,

122
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,190
can I drink cold Coke?

123
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,240
Of course not.

124
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,920
What about Sprite?

125
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,550
No.

126
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,870
Then can I eat spicy strips?

127
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,000
Do you need anything else?

128
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,909
I'll add on this too.

It's really good!

137
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,130
C'mon, give it a try.

138
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,200

139

Nothing.

140

141
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,210
It's alright.

142
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,430
I prefer the mint flavor.

143

This is for you.

144

145
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,980
Didn't you complain about TCM's bitterness?

146
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,320
You can have a piece of mint candy

147
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,550
each time you drink the medicine.

148
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,710
The mint candy

149
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,790
can help clear heat and detoxify.

150
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,200
It won't mess with the medicine you're taking.

151
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,750
Okay.

Why are you smiling?

153
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,940
I think you're too much of a workaholic.

154
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,600
Even to give me some candies, you had to justify it with the TCM theory.

155
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,240
What else should I say?

156

00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,050
Why would I go to a Western medicine seminar?

190
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,770
Indeed...

191
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,240
Professor He got transferred to North City two years ago, didn't he?

192
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,360
During that time, did he...

193
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,650
Do you have

194
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,720
many appointments today?

195
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,150
Yep.

196
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,900
There are tons.

197
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,300
That's why I'm here to eat so late.

198
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,320
Then quickly grab a bite

199
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,200
and get back to work.

200
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,150
Yes, yes. I'm starving.

201
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,490
Should quickly eat up and work.

202
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,960
Senior He,

203
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:48,910
the patient

204
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,870
in bed number three just had surgery yesterday.

205
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,910
Is he allowed to drink water today?

206
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,570
Yes, keep a close eye on them.

[He Sheng]

208
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,510
I need to take this call.

209
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,270
Sure.

210
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,050
It's me.

211
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,840
Uhm, are you busy this afternoon?

212
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,360
Not really.

213
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,080
I'm here in Hang City for an exchange event.

214
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,150
I don't have any plans for tonight.

215
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,850
I want to

216
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,560
invite you and Li Jie's family out for dinner.

217
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,510
I'm not available tonight.

218
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,680
Okay.

219
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,910
Next time then.

220

You go ahead with your work.

221

for an exchange activity.

225

During this activity, Mr. He Sheng will

226
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,550
have an in-depth discussion with the leaders and doctors

227
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,120
from all major hospitals across our city

228
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,910
on setting up new surgical departments

229
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,630

230
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,000
and transferring patients,

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,790

232
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,670

233
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,200

You're too tall.

253

You mean these?

260

No, I bought them myself.

261

I've been too busy to go to the florist lately,

262
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,560

I don't think you can make it today

377
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,610
as you came so late.

378
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,030
Just a second.

379
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,860
Come by around twelve.

380
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,930
No need to book an appointment.

381
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,330
Just knock on the door and come in.

382
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,070
Okay.

383
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,030
There's no need to book an appointment today.

384
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,520
But why did it end up like this?

385
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,550
They're not here to see the doctor.

386
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,720
Dr. He was caught on camera yesterday

387
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,460
when he came to the clinic without wearing a mask.

388
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,240
The video is all over the place now.

389
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,500
A security guard in the adjacent neighborhood has been spreading the word,

390
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,140
saying that Dr. He works at our clinic.

391
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,470
Oh, my God...

392
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,680
Do you know why Dr. He always wears a mask?

393
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,110
No.

394
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,160
Because

395
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,000
this has happened so many times before.

396
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,040
The family members of some patients saw Dr. He's handsome face.

397
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,210
They all tried to set him up with someone

398
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,170
and arrange blind dates.

399
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,040
We don't even dare to post his photo.

400
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,720
Please wait here.

401
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,350
I'll get back to work.

402
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,020
Okay.

403
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,030
Madam,

404
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,880
excuse me...

405
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,720
OK.

406
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,690
Sir,

407
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,120
what seems to be bothering you?

408
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,620
Doctor, my daughter's been single for too long.

409
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,890
I feel really uncomfortable.

410
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,680
Doctor, look at my daughter. Please take a look.

411
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,970
Please take a closer look.

412
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Good...

413
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,350
Good, right?

414
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,590
Yeah...

415
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,920
P-Please take a closer look.

416
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,480
I've seen it clearly. She's good.

417
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,010
[TCM Clinic No. 3]

418
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,510
Thank you.

419
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,590
Here he comes, here he comes.

420
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,240
It's him...

421
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,400
Could you take off your mask?

422
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,270
No need.

423
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,400
You can tell his good genes

424
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,790
just from his eyes and hair.

425
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,530
Doctor, this is my daughter's resume.

426
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,240
My genes are not that good, actually.

427
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,180
I have genetic hair loss.

428
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,270
Look, this is a wig!

429
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,720
I have no hair if I take it off.

430
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,360
Do you want to see it?

431
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,880
Sirs and madams!

432
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,070
it's twelve o'clock now.

433
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,750
We don't start work until one in the afternoon.

434
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,550
Let's go have lunch!

435
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,570
Lin, Lin! Come and help!

436
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,120
Madam!

437
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,290
1 PM, yes, 1 PM.

438
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,840
The doctors need to eat too.

439
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,920
The doctors need to rest too.

440
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,410
Come in the afternoon...

441
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:21,960
We'll come in the afternoon.

442
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,150
OK, see you this afternoon.

443
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:23,750
1 PM, remember.

444
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,880
The doctors need to rest too.

445
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,350
We'll come in the afternoon.

446
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,550
Goodbye...

447
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,270
Okay...

448
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,800
They've left.

449
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,210
You can go now.

450
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,680
Okay.

451
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,720
Bye-bye.

452
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,680
Dr. He, I'm at the entrance of the clinic.

453
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,000
The nurse said

454
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,230
you've stopped seeing patients?

455
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,150
Ask Nurse Sun to bring you to the back door.

456
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:18,930
Okay.

457
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,720
Dr. He.

458
00:25:59,370 --> 00:25:59,890
Take a seat.

459
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,200
Thank you.

460
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,000
Oh, by the way,

461
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,480
why are you here?

462
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,350
Didn't you go for lunch?

463
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,550
Not yet.

464
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,940
There was a large crowd of people in the morning.

465
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
Now I can finally get some fresh air in the backyard

466
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,880
while

467
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:21,880
waiting for you.

468
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,790
Oh, sorry,

469
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,640
If you haven't eaten,

470
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,270
I just bought a sandwich.

471
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,750
You can have it.

472
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,750
Do you want some water?

473
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,680
I can go buy you a bottle.

474
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,070
Don't bother. The sandwich is enough.

475
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,400
Thank you.

476
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,280
You're welcome.

477
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,170
I'll eat it later.

478
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,750
Why did you go shopping so early in the morning?

479
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,920
I failed to book an appointment in the morning.

480
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,110
And I didn't wanna home either.

481
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,400
So I went to watch a movie.

482
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,540
It ended at 11:40.

483
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,750
It took me 20 minutes to get here.

484
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,100
It was exactly twelve o'clock when I arrived.

485
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,750
If I had this time like you did,

486
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,110
I'd go home for a nap.

487
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,270
I don't wanna go home.

488
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,550
Since my mom knew I came to see the doctor at your clinic,

489
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,070
she kept asking me if I knew you.

490
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,880
What did you say?

491
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,620
I said I don't know you, of course.

492
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,000
Otherwise, she'd definitely ask me for your WeChat.

493
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,550
And then,

494
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,830
everyone in my neighborhood

495
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,110
will know your WeChat.

496
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,310
That's horrifying.

497
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,160
Right?

498
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,110
Thank you.

499
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,030
You're welcome.

500
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,470
Dr. He.

501
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,610
How do you feel about the mass match-making thing today?

502
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,450
Don't even mention it. Today, I've finally come to realize

503
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,610
how scary match-making and marriage pressure can be.

504
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,070
Sometimes I feel like I'm a horse.

505
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,000
People who buy horses

506
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,640
need to check your quality,

507
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,270
fur, and teeth.

508
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,240
Sometimes

509
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,720
I feel like I'm a chunk of pork

510
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,310
being judged and picked by purchasers,

511
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,270
yet no one thinks of me

512
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,110
as a person with emotions and thoughts.

513
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,550
Dr. He.

514
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,240
May I ask

515
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,960
how old you are?

516
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,110
31.

517
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,400
You're already 31,

518
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,510
yet you didn't have such a feeling until now?

519
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,750
Doesn't your family give you marriage pressure?

520
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,720
My grandpa pushes me sometimes.

521
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,160
But I was busy with work.

522
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,880
So I didn't pay much attention to it.

523
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,770
It's also possible

524
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,400
that the right person

525
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,430
hasn't appeared yet.

526
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,310
Let's start.

527
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,720
I'll close my eyes and take a rest.

528
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,350
Is the IT Summit over?

529
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,830
You're in a good mood now.

530
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,490
Don't move.

531
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,720
How did you know

532
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,830
I was at the IT summit?

533
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,590
I saw it on the news.

534
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,240
I was on TV?

535
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,960
I wonder if I looked good on camera.

536
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,910
You looked pretty good.

537
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,550
Okay.

538
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,270
What do you work as in the hotel?

539
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,240
I'm the manager of the Front Office.

540
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,800
What does the manager of the Front Office do?

541
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,160
Like, doing reception work in the lobby?

542
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,020
No, The one you're talking about

543
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,890
is the hotel lobby manager.

544
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,110
Our job mainly includes

545
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,960
checking room reservations,

546
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,440
arranging rooms,

547
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,900
and attending events and meetings

548
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,960
during holidays

549
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,550
with the Marketing Department.

550
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,240
For example, we were pretty busy

551
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,560
during the IT Summit this time.

552
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,270
We needed to gather the participants

553
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,030
in the same area

554
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,880
for better service and management.

555
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,200
Besides,

556
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,790
we had plenty of other work to handle.

557
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,550
Like

558
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,830
changing their sheets and quilt covers

559
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,740
or setting up the mini wine party they wanted

560
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,410
in the room.

561
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,960
So you know what?

562
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,550
I've been swamped with work lately.

563
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,640
I saw it.

564
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,790
It was pretty tiring.

565
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:03,320
♫You're like a gentle wind♫

566
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:09,330
♫After early summer afternoon, it blows past my heart♫

567
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:16,830
♫When your fingers touch my hands♫

568
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,180
♫So you're also here for me♫

569
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:30,180
♫I hear you say, red beans grow in the southern lands♫

570
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,020
♫When spring comes, a few branches begin to sprout♫

571
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:38,020
♫Cherish the youth♫

572
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,780
♫Loving you is the best thing I've ever done♫

573
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:51,630
♫Among the vast sea of people, you and I understand each other♫

574
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,400
♫Missing you is the most beautiful thing in my life♫

575
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,550
♫Write it down in your heart and never disappear♫

576
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,160
Wake up.

577
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,750
What's this scent?

578
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,960
It's so good. I fell asleep after smelling it.

579
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,790
You're sharp-nosed.

580
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,550
Alright.

581
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,880
put on your shoes and get up.

582
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,440
Your sachet's scent must have worn off by now, huh?

583
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,060
I made you a new one.

584
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,620
Thank you.

585
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,310
And the prescription is also done.

586
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,230
Thanks.

587
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,250
What's that look on your face?

588
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,200
What's wrong?

589
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,680
Are you afraid I'll poison you?

590
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,680
Nope.

591
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,020
Well, Dr. He,

592
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,410
can we

593
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,110
remove the goldthread?

594
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,010
No.

595
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,720
Fine.

596
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,030
Then can we

597
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,510
remove this charred gardenia?

598
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,200
No.

599
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,590
Alright.

600
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,110
Can we...

601
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,920
Are you questioning my medical skills?

602
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,120
No, I didn't mean that.

603
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,640
It's just...

604
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,110
After taking the medicine,

605
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,880
I did a quick research.

606
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,230
I found that the goldthread and charred gardenia have the same medicinal properties.

607
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,630
They both help clear heat and reduce dampness.

608
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,900
It's unnecessary to have two sorts of herbs

609
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,250
with the same medicinal properties

610
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,909
in one prescription, right?

611
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,920
You did a quick research?

612
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,590
I think you're just afraid of extra expenses if I prescribe

613
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,550
extra medicinal materials.

614
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,590
No.

615
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,710
So why?

616
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,250
Dr. He,

617
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,060
the medicine last time

618
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,060
was way too bitter.

619
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,760
Someone

620
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,219
can endure either hardships at work

621
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,199
or pain in life.

622
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,510
Yet she can't bear to take a small pack of bitter herbal medicine.

623
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,850
They're not the same.

624
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,510
TCM offers real bitterness

625
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,230
that I need to swallow.

626
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,970
So you studied TCM to avoid

627
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,340
this bit of bitterness?

628
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,220
What a hardworking girl.

629
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,080
Thank you.

630
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:06,880
Tell me

631
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,440
if there's anything else you wanna remove.

632
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:10,960
No more.

633
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,840
Are you sure?

634
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,800
Dr. He, let me do you a favor.

635
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,920
What?

636
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,570
Check this out.

637
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,980
Does it look like a ring?

638
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,280
Gimme your hand.

639
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,510
C'mon!

640
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,580
Take it.

641
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,480
You're welcome.

642
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,920
Are you asking me to

643
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
pretend to be married?

644
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,190
This is all I can do to help you.

645
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,400
As for the rest,

646
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,590
it depends on your acting skills.

647
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,960
Thank you for the medicine

648
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,840
and your sachet.

649
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,840
Bye.

650
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,640
♫So clearly♫

651
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,910
♫Between us♫

652
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,020
♫Each heartbeat becomes a prophecy♫

653
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,970
♫Foreseeing the beginning of love♫

654
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:03,940
♫I still miss it♫

655
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,870
♫I'm starting to fall in love♫

656
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,170
♫It's the light in your eyes♫

657
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,350
♫Illuminating my world♫

658
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:15,970
♫Warming my loneliness♫

659
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,380
♫The understanding we've gathered♫

660
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:24,810
♫Turns the pages of our future♫

661
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,830
♫Before we reach the end♫

662
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,550
Auntie.

663
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,860
♫A long, drifting line remains♫

664
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,210
Are you feeling unwell somewhere?

665
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,040
♫Filled with thoughts of loving you♫

666
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,070
Wait a second.

667
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:39,960
You...

668
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,510
It's a wedding ring.

669
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,780
You're already married?

670
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,710
Then why are you looking at my daughter's information?

671
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:46,960
I thought

672
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,150
you wanted me to see

673
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,040
her complexion.

674
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,750
Auntie,

675
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,360
your daughter's complexion

676
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,630
shows that she has a deficiency in qi and blood.

677
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,660
What's wrong with the people in the group?

678
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,290
They didn't even bother to check the situation clearly.

679
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,000
He's clearly already married.

680
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,920
Seriously.

681
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,750
Auntie, tell your daughter to make an appointment with me.

682
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,880
Who posted this in the group?

683
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,070
This doctor is already married. Who posted this?

684
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,210
Isn't it just messing with us?

685
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,390
Exactly, exactly.

686
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,400
How unlucky. I thought this doctor was quite suitable.

687
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,130
Dr. He, I have dinner plans with friends tonight.

688
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,440
I won't have time to pick up the medicine.

689
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,480
Could you please help me pick it up?

690
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,070
Okay.

691
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,000
Dr. He, I've arrived at the park near my home.

692
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,920
Please enjoy your meal.

693
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,000
Ms. Shen,

694
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,920
come here.

695
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,920
What a coincidence!

696
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,700
Your dad just ordered.

697
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:12,310
Come quickly.

698
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,340
Change meeting location, change meeting location.

699
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,290
Reply if you received.

700
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:17,950
Fine.

701
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,220
Give it to me.

702
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,150
How did you end up here?

703
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:21,800
Sit down quickly.

704
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,920
The buns are still hot.

705
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,610
How did you all end up here?

706
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,200
Your dad insisted on eating buns today.

707
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,400
I don't want to cook anymore.

708
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,710
Have some vinegar.

709
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,060
Okay.

710
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,930
Is it okay if I pour your vinegar here?

711
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,550
That's fine.

712
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:40,930
It's pork.

713
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,030
There's also some bamboo shoots inside.

714
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,030
What are you doing?

715
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,670
Mosquito.

716
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,590
Why would there be mosquitoes this season?

717
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,400
There are no mosquitoes.

718
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,230
Stop messing around, stop it.

719
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:51,800
Hurry up.

720
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Quickly, eat up.

721
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,000
Don't fool around.

722
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,250
Stop shaking it.

723
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,550
You'll drop your phone again.

724
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,360
Eat quickly.

725
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,330
I suddenly got a message.

726
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,110
The clinic is asking me

727
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,670
to go pick up the medicine quickly.

728
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,630
They're waiting for me.

729
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:22,710
Don't go.

730
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,880
I'll pick it up for you later, won't that do?

731
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,400
No need, no need.

732
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,110
I'm finished eating.

733
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,070
I'll go over in a bit, okay?

734
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:26,630
It's so late.

735
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,070
Let your dad go with you.

736
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,890
No need. My dad should stay with you.

737
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,280
I can't break up the couple.

738
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,280
Dr. He,

739
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,920
you just scared me to death.

740
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:55,590
What's wrong?

741
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,800
You just appeared in front of my parents like that.

742
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,760
Aren't you afraid they'll recognize you?

743
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,510
What's wrong with that?

744
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,960
What's the need to be so mysterious?

745
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,930
If they recognize you,

746
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,760
they'll definitely ask for your contact information.

747
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,880
Then all the elderly in our neighborhood

748
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,880
will have your WeChat.

749
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,960
That's true.

750
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,630
I forgot about that.

751
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,350
Yes.

752
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,110
Your medicine.

753
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,150
Take it, it's a bit heavy.

754
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,070
Be careful.

755
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:25,760
Thank you.

756
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,880
Um,

757
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,800
this thing that you gave me at noon

758
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,370
is gone.

759
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,240
I lost it.

760
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,330
It disappeared right when I got off work.

761
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:36,850
How about

762
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,760
I buy you another one?

763
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,280
It's okay, no need.

764
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,360
It wasn't expensive anyway.

765
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,610
I'm glad it could help you.

766
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,140
Okay.

767
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,520
Well, I'm heading home then.

768
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,340
Good night.

769
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:50,880
Good night.

770
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,920
By the way.

771
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,450
Don't rush.

772
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,790
Go in after a while.

773
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,560
Don't let my parents see us together.

774
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,800
Okay.

775
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,030
Good night.

776
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:10,960
Bye.

777
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,870
Why so mysterious?
