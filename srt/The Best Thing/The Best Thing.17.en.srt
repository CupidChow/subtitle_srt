Have a good dream.

Let me give you a ride.

11
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,079
Since you flirted with me first,

12
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,390
you should be responsible for me.

13
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,400
You can't just walk away.

00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,000

Proceeding normally.

27

I'll go have a look in the park this afternoon.

do you really think your company can run normally?

38
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,080
We'll see.

Alright, I'm hanging up.

Mr. Yan, the flowers you asked for are ready.

44
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,880
But there's a traffic jam.

45
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,030
We need to leave as soon as possible.

Did you buy it outside?

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,560
Come to my place tonight for a remedial session.

58

Luckily, Mr. Yan went out to work today.

65
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,470
Does it still have any smell?

66
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,800
A little.

67
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,440
What kind of smell?

68
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,400
Let me smell it.

69
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,990
Why don't you ask him for a new one?

70
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,680
I haven't had time to see him lately.

71
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,870

Mr. Yan, don't you need to work?

74
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,590
You are so free.

75
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,470
I just rushed back from a meeting.

76
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,330
Let's have dinner together.

77
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,300
No need.

78
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,590
I heard

79
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,800
you were punished for what happened yesterday.

80
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,080
It's all my fault.

81
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,350
Give me a chance to make it up.

82
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,930
What good is an apology?

83
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,960
Why don't you reimburse her

84
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,830
deducted bonus first?

85
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,710
Have dinner, right?

86
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,000
I'll go with you.

87
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,950
Staying here will only complicate things.

88
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,200
Don't worry.

89
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,040
Let's go.

90
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,090
You haven't been back to the campus for a long time, right?

91
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,750
I've never come back

92
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,870
since you graduated.

93
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,750
Didn't you ask me to eat with you?

94
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,560
Isn't it good to revisit an old place?

95
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,560
But things have changed.

96
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,280
Mr. Yan, Manager Shen, here is your food.

97
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,660
Eat.

98
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,810
It's the grilled meat we used to eat.

99
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
I'll eat then.

100
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,800
How time flies.

101
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,960
When we first met,

102
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,910
you were only 19.

103
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,510
I was 21.

104
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,860
You're here. Let's go.

105
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,560
What's wrong?

106
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,400
Why are you covering your face?

107
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,100
I had Thai curry shrimps tonight.

108
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,400
I was allergic to the mango in the meat.

109
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,680
You're so ugly.

110
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,980
You think I'm ugly, huh?

111
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,710
No!

112

[Dad]

113
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,680
You're not gonna answer it?

114
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,920
It's from my dad. No need to answer it.

115
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,160
Actually, Mr. Yan never really likes me.

116
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,540
You knew that, right?

117
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,830
So you knew.

118
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,470
Then why did you come to me?

119
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,540
I want to marry you.

120
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,710
I understand my dad.

121
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,400
He's a businessman.

122
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,590
He wants me to marry a lady

123
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,460
from a rich family.

124
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
But I don't want to.

125
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,950
Xifan, in this matter,

126
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,730
you can completely ignore what he said.

127
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,450
I'm independent now.

128
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,570
I have my own voice.

129
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,590
He can't decide my life anymore.

130
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,230
My robot company has applied for many patents

131
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,350
and won many awards.

132
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,140
It's been acquired by Zhongyu,

133
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,200
but I retain full control.

134
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
I can contend against him.

135
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,280
So?

136
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,230
So he has no right

137
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,470
to object to our marriage.

138
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,320
But I don't want to marry you.

139
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,290
Why?

140
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,400
There's no why.

141
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,400
Because I don't want to.

142
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,470
I don't want to marry you.

143
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,870

144
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,080
I know you are still mad at me.

145
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,350
But I already explained to you.

146
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,440
At that time, I was too busy

147
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,320
and too stressed

148
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,680
to focus on us.

149
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,280
And I'm not saying we should

150
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,080
get married immediately.

151
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,560
I just...

152
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,350
You just want to get back together,

153
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,230

155
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,250
you never care about what I want.

156
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,280
You always ask me to cooperate with you.

157
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,870
Whether it's our breakup

158
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,470
or your sudden appearance this time,

159
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,140
you've never cared about my feelings,

160
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,250
even just a little.

161
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,870
I really don't want to marry you.

162
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,110
And I don't want to see you anymore.

163
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,480

Since college,

167

I've never liked grilled meat.

168
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,140
Where's the sachet?

169
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,120

170
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,120
Don't think you're not good.

171
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,750
And don't think you're worthless.

172
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,290

00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,750
Go lie down.

191
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,010
I'll give you acupuncture.

192
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,350
Have a good sleep tonight.

193
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,710
Okay.

194
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,740
Hello.

195
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,400
We're closing.

196
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,160
Are you here for medicine or treatment?

197
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,210
I'm looking for someone.

198
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,340
Are you feeling better?

199
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
Much better.

200
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,740
My head doesn't hurt that much.

201
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,750
Then...

202
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,700
can you tell me

203
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,430
what on earth happened tonight?

204
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,550
He Suye.

205
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,690
I...

206
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,120
It's okay.

207
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,520
Lie down.

208
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,120
Mr. Yan, are you here for treatment?

209
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,380
Let me take your pulse.

210
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,380
It's free.

211
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:37,930
No need.

212
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,430
I'd never seek treatment in a place like this.

213
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,470
I'm here to accompany her.

214
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,850
She's throwing a tantrum at me.

215
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,820
The acupuncture treatment takes 15 minutes.

216
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,220
Mr. Yan, you should

217
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,070
have a seat and wait for her.

218
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,920
Fifteen minutes. I'll wait.

219
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,960
Xifan, I'll be waiting for you outside.

220
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,160
Be patient.

221
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,720
Patients need quiet.

222
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,580
Otherwise,

223
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,960
blood might spurt from the needles.

224
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,640
Fifteen minutes.

225
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,970
It's done, right?

226
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,440
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

227
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,700
She still needs moxibustion.

228
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,680
Why don't you go to the toilet first?

229
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,410
Moxibustion will take more than 20 minutes.

230
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,630
Okay, I'll listen to you.

231
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,970
Mr. Yan, you don't need to go with her.

232
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,390
It's not proper to go to the toilet with a woman.

233
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,970
You're being so nosy.

234
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,860
Dr. He, right?

235
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,760
Let me remind you.

236
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,030
Stop wasting your effort.

237
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,200
She won't fall for your tricks.

238
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,360
You must have pursued her for a long time.

239
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,050
If she fell for your tricks,

240
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,920
she would have been your girlfriend long ago, right?

241
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,330
We were lovers for seven years.

242
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,160
We were about to get married.

243
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,470
I know her too well.

244
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,160
It's just like artemisia capillaris in April.

245
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,710
What does that mean?

246
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,960
Are you cursing me?

247
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,230
No.

248
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,260
You can google it.

249
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,470
You are just a back-up,

250
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,960
but you've been trying so hard.

251
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,270
That's because you're not good enough.

252
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,710
I'm still in the game.

253
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,560
You won't have a chance.

254
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,060
Really? I thought she dumped you long ago.

255
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,910
Mr. Yan, you still won't leave?

256
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,360
I'm getting off work.

257
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,200
Xifan has left.

258
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:42,900
Mr. Yan.

259
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,890
Have you seen Shen Xifan?

260
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,030
No.

261
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,570
Why are you sitting on the ground?

262
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,560
Get up.

263
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,050
Your hands are so cold.

264
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,050
Come on. Put on my coat.

265
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:37,550
♫The moment I see you, all my worries turn transparent♫

266
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,200
Are you cold?

267
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:45,680
♫In the silence, the sound of my heartbeat grows clearer♫

268
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,980
♫The entire world reflects in your eyes♫

269
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:59,970
♫Make a wish, can the snow fall slowly?♫

270
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,980
♫Even if we're destined to meet and miss each other♫

271
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,160
♫Life is finally complete♫

272
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
Xifan.

273
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,920
Why can't you let him go?

274
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,190
It's not that I can't let him go.

275
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,980
I'm just mad at my past self.

276
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,200
No matter what happened in the past,

277
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,650
good or bad,

278
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,010
it's part of who you are.

279
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,270
Accept the past,

280
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,400
and focus on the present and the future.

281
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,620
Besides,

282
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,400
think from this perspective:

283
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,430
without him,

284
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,530
you wouldn't have come to the clinic

285
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,120
because of insomnia.

286
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,400
Right?

287
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,740
Good.

288
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,400
Stop crying.

289
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Unknowingly,

290
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,730
I've treated you for so long.

291
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,360
You're finally healing.

292
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,680
♫Watching the snow fall, flake by flake♫

293
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,320
♫Slowly melting away my thoughts♫

294
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,440
You're not cold now, right?

295
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,600
♫Smiling, I wave goodbye as you head home♫

296
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
Go back now.

297
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,120
It's a bit cold beside the river.

298
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,710
Don't catch a cold.

299
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,440
♫But I never said those words♫

300
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:56,050
♫Flake by flake, the snow melts♫

301
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,930
♫Love blooms quietly♫

302
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,070
♫Hold you close with a kiss♫

303
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,930
♫White lovers are whispering♫

304
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,840
Keep your wrist steady, and press hard.

305
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,040
She's back. Our daughter is back.

306
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:17,960
You're back.

307
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,130
Why are you back so late?

308
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,470
I worked overtime today.

309
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,470
Are you hungry?

310
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,330
I made Red Bean Soup with Tangerine Peel.

311
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,190
Do you want me to heat it up for you?

312
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,830
I'm not hungry.

313
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,470
I want to take a shower and go to bed.

314
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,510
That tired?

315
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,200
Why did you work overtime?

316
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,790
There was a big event?

317
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,360
No.

318
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,960
I just...

319
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,310
met a difficult VIP client.

320
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,070
Who is that difficult?

321
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,840
I think you should go to a TCM physician again.

322
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,190
You don't have to go to He.

323
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,760
You can get another doctor.

324
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,070
Maybe later.

325
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:00,750
Dad.

326
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,070
Help me hang the keys.

327
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,030
I'm going back to my room.

328
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,160
Do you think she looks weird

329
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,360
whenever we mention He?

330
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
A little.

331
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,000
A little?

332
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,400
It's so obvious.

333
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,200
Shen,

334
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,030
you should resolve the situation

335
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,370
with Mr. Yan as soon as possible.

336
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,920
He came to you frequently and publicly.

337
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,920
It's really not good.

338
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,400
After all, gossip is a fearful thing.

339
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,470
In our industry, we're already walking on thin ice.

340
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,510
Every hotel has staff

341
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,620
fired for being involved with guests.

342
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,530
If you're dismissed over something like this,

343
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,370
it'll be hard for you to continue your career

344
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,660
in the hotel industry.

345
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,120
I understand.

346
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,440
[Meeting Hall]

347
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,570
You're still young.

348
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,140
You have a brilliant future.

349
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,220
Don't let this ruin it.

350
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,640
General Manager, thank you for your advice.

351
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,770
I will solve it as soon as possible.

352
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,470
My apologies

353
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,470
for the trouble.

354
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,840
That's all.

355
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,850
Go back to work.

356
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,200
Thank you, General Manager.

357
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,670
I'll ask my dad to pick it up after work.

358
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:30,960
Hello.

359
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:31,750
Hello.

360
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,130
Did you sleep well last night?

361
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,080
Yes, pretty well.

362
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,960
The guy last night...

363
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,890
When will he check out?

364
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,680
Perhaps in a week or two.

365
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,070
If you have any issues,

366
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,510
feel free to call me anytime.

367
00:33:59,230 --> 00:33:59,960
No problem.

368
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,400
They need me for a meeting.

369
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,360
I'm hanging up.

370
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,050
Okay.

371
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,719
Then... keep in touch.

372
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:10,570
Okay.

373
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,440
Bye bye.

374
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:13,520
See you.

375
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,830
Make sure the rest area's tea

376
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,090
and refreshments are enough.

377
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,480
Okay. Got it.

Okay.

382
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,700
Are you looking for me?

383
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,720
Manager Shen.

384
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,150
Mr. Yan has been busy

385
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,780
negotiating the economic park collaboration these days.

386
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,730
He's been in and out at all hours,

387
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,110
so he asked me to deliver these flowers.

388
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,470
No need to deliver flowers anymore in the future.

389
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,990
I've thrown away the previous ones.

390
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,740
You don't have to accept them,

391
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,120
but I have to fulfill Mr. Yan's instructions.

392
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,980
Then please tell Mr. Yan

393
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,340
to stop delivering flowers.

394
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,580
Why don't you tell Mr. Yan yourself?

395
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,580
I no longer have his contact information.

396
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,960
Thank you.

397
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:01,880
It's not spring yet.

The lingering chill is a bit strong.

00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,560
I've prescribed two warming tonics for you

Okay.

Auntie,

00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,110
the most important thing is to stay in a good mood.

405
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,510
Don't let anything weigh on your mind.

00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,400
I happen to have something weighing on my mind these days.

407
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,110
Dr. He,

408
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,150
you know what?

409
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,560
A terrible person showed up in the hotel.

410
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,550
It has made Xifan

411
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,030
very passive

412
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,920
and uncomfortable.

413
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,360
I know that person.

414
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,880
I saw him last night.

415
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,320
And today, Xifan suddenly asked me

416
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,790
if he came to me.

417
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,890
It's strange.

418
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,570
Did he do something in the hotel?

419
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,640
Once, I saw him

420
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,080
forcing Xifan to meet him.

421
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,760
It was quite a scene.

422
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:02,670
I heard Xifan got punished because of it.

423
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,060
He came again yesterday,

424
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,520
and forced her to go with him.

425
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,590
I think Xifan

426
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,910
has been in a bad mood these days.

427
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,730
She looks very haggard.

428
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,070
Auntie, don't worry.

429
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,470
I understand what you mean.

430
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,470
Xifan

431
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,070
is not a girl

432
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,990
who easily opens her heart.

433
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,240
So I don't really dare to interfere

434
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,030
too much in her personal matters.

435
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,590
Besides, she's a smart person.

436
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,360
She's just been a little lost recently.

437
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,630
I think things will be fine soon.

00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,770

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,070

00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,440
Thank you.

442
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,110
No big deal.

443
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,110

will you take on this research project again this year?

464
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,670
Of course.

465
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,880
I spent half a year on it last year.

the palliative care topic for over two years.

Hard work pays off.

471

Why does that sound like a backhanded compliment?

472
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,970
How so?

And I've seen your research project.

It's new,

483
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
but it's very valuable in this era.

484
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,720
It's got potential.

485
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,800
It's better than the common research projects

487
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,150

488
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,660
I think it's very likely that it'll get approved.

Treat me to five meals, okay?

497
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,070
You shouldn't be a doctor.

498
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,070
You should be a wedding emcee.

499
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,760
To be honest,

500
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,030

Take me with you. I'm a bit hungry.

507
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,840
Of course you should be
