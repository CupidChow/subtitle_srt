00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,150
Come and take a look.

4
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,070
This is the greenhouse,

5
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,890
ahead of which is the farm.

6
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,080
When we were at college,

7
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,420
we usually came here to do research.

8
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,120
The air here is so fresh.

9
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,070
This greenhouse

10
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,840
is where we introduce,

11
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,080
protect and cultivate endangered medicinal plants.

12
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,120
For example, dendrobium candidum like this

13
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,430
brings great benefits to the stomach and cardiovascular system.

14
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,890
It also helps to suppress tumor growth.

15
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,800
But in the past,

16
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,850
wild dendrobium candidum was scarce

17
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,970
and very precious.

18
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,410
It would be a shame

19
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,470
if patients couldn't have access

20
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,500
to such a good medicinal material.

21
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,970
With the nowadays improved greenhouse technology,

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,040
high-quality dendrobium candidum can be put into mass production.

23
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,600
It is a great ingredient for tea or cooking in daily life.

24
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,520
Do we get to use it this time?

25
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,520
Sure.

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,970
It is a nice choice to make tea

27
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,480
with dendrobium candidum.

28
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,640
Look how tall it has grown.

29
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,010
Do you remember what this is?

30
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:54,850
The leaves have withered.

31
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,450
The leaves....

32
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,290
With jagged edges.

33
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,520

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,550

36
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,010
and they can be used as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine.

37
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,600
Did you plant all of this?

38
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,690
Can I pluck some?

39
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:12,850
Yes.

40
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,040
It wasn't that hard.

41
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,600

43
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,800
It's delicious.

44
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,170
It tastes sweet and sour.

45
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,780
What is this?

46
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,570
Five-flavor fruit.

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,690

71
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,750
You took traditional Chinese medicine twice,

72
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,210
and now you've learned to prank me with it.

73

I'll take that as a compliment.

74
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,680
It tastes good.

75
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,690
What is it?

76
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,250
It consists of five-flavor fruit.

77
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,370
We added some honey to it,

78
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,570
so it tastes better.

79
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,990
Is it a kind of drink that doctors like you usually fix for yourselves?

80
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Not really.

81
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,440
I prefer coke.

82
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,570
You're pretty funny, handsome.

83
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,690

Why don't you go find him?

86
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,520
I'll go find Dr. He.

87
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,060
These medicinal herbs are products of the plantation.

88
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,250
I've brought those that are commonly used for medicinal cuisine

89
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,200
and aromatherapy.

90
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,610
TCM is particular about the specific health-keeping tactics in each season,

91
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,159
so we would choose different regimens

92
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:41,960
according to seasonal changes

93
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,720
and the 24 solar terms.

94
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,370
Now, our goal here

95
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,560
is to nourish kidneys and increase moisture in the human body.

96
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,390
The recipes tend to be mild.

97
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,450
That being said,

considering the elderly's health conditions,

99
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,520
I suggest you differentiate the effects

100
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,960
and choose appropriate recipes

101
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,450
for different individuals.

102
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,050
How do we do that?

103
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,690
The medicinal cuisine here has five effects.

104

It is good for sleep,

105
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,570
the circulation of energy and blood, and kidneys.

106
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,720
It also helps to clear fat, lower blood pressure and reduce dryness.

107
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,760
It smells amazing.

108
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,490
Here are the recipes.

109
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,200
Pass them around and read them.

110

Here you are.

112
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,050
You can also create new recipes on your own.

Thank you for all the hard work.

116

You're welcome.

117
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,159
There is boiled water outside.

118
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,200
If you're interested,

119
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,720
make some tea and have a taste.

120
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:35,810
Okay.

121
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,430
Can we make tea with these?

122
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,930
Yeah, sure.

123
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,200
These are dried lily bulbs.

124
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,890
They reinforce lungs, relieve cough

125
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,200
and soothe nerves.

126
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,840
Then they're a good ingredient for medicinal cuisine in autumn.

127
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,890
I've seen porridge with lily bulbs and lotus seeds being sold in supermarkets.

128
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,690
This combination is a safe and convenient option, right?

129
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,520
It being commonly seen

130
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,200
means it is not special at all.

131
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,810
We're not going for that option now.

132
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,820
Many classic recipes involve lily bulbs.

133
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
If we don't use lily bulbs,

134
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,810
our workload might get too heavy.

135
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,580
Cutie pie,

136
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,010
why don't we befriend each other on Wechat?

137
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,450
Maybe you can answer my questions if I have any.

138
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,370
Sure.

139
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,130
Let me scan your code.

140
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,010
Done.

141
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,130
What are you doing here alone?

142
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,680
They're all studying medicinal cuisine.

143
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,010
I'd like to find out what I can use for aromatherapy.

144
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,160
We can save some time in this way.

145
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,930
Which would you like to make, incense or sachets?

146
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,130
Sachets.

147
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,490
It's more convenient when I send them to the elderly.

148
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,250
They can hang the sachets at the bedside.

149
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,540
What's your recommendation?

150
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,960
All of these are incense ingredients.

151
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,660
Patchouli.

152
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,930
Agarwood.

153
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,930
Nutmeg.

154
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,620
Sandalwood.

155
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,610
Clove.

156
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,520
And that is...

157
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,490
Cinnamon.

158
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,400
I know it's often used to make mulled wine.

159
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,130
That is actually cassia.

160
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,730
Cassia?

161
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,440
What's the difference between cassia and cinnamon?

162
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,090
Cinnamon seems to be more often used abroad.

163
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,800
It's not about that.

164
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,280
Cinnamon derives from the bark of the Cinnamomum verum tree,

165
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
whereas cassia

166
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,160
is sourced from the bark of the Cinnamomum cassia tree.

167
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,340
Cassia is spicier

168
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,440
while cinnamon is lighter and softer.

169
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,130
So, cassia is often used for cooking,

170
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,890
and cinnamon for aromatherapy.

171
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,920
It's no wonder that many perfumes contain cinnamon.

172
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,090
Let's go somewhere else.

173
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,370
Where to?

174
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,860
A place with more materials for aromatherapy.

175
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,440
Let's go.

176
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,640
Come on.

177
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,330
Here it is.

178
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,010
This is

179
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,250
an agarwood tree.

180
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,250
The resin formed

181
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,490
and cut off from these places

182
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,610
is what we call agarwood.

183
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,630
Sniff it.

184
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,010
It does smell nice.

185
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,330
It gives out...

186
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,130
a very familiar scent.

187
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,330
Familiar?

188
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,970
Like the perfume you wear?

189
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,490
No.

190
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
It smells like you.

191
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,800
Me?

192
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,040
I don't wear perfume.

193
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,040
The scent is gone.

194
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,990
As I said,

195
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,400
I never wear perfume.

196
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,370
Then maybe one day,

197
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,450
the scent of agarwood got on you,

198
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,010
and I just happened to be around.

199
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,130
Or perhaps,

200
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,400
this scent

201
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,730
resembles you.

202
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,040
It resembles me?

203
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,520
In what way?

204
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,490
It is very gentle and mild.

205
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,330
It smells pleasant and not bland at all.

206
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,110
So this is what you think of me.

207
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,370
An agarwood tree without resin

208
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,900
is just an ordinary piece of timber.

209
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,680
But once it forms resin, it becomes true agarwood,

210
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,220
and a top-grade medicinal material that helps with the circulation of energy.

211
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,970
You think highly of me.

212
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,210
I shouldn't have said that sentence.

213
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,560
Don't worry about that.

214
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,000
I've received all your compliments.

215
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,250
It has come to my notice

216
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,280
that you do have a lot in common with this scent.

217
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,640
It is a complicated kind of smell,

218
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,160
somewhat like

219
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,850
a toxic substance.

220
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,640
Is it the smell of garbage?

221
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,730
You got drunk that night

222
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,040
and called me garbage.

223
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,250
You know I was drunk.

224
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,760
What I said was nonsense.

225
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,400
People tell the truth when they're drunk.

226
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,250
Suppose I did tell the truth,

227
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,490
that might not be directed at you.

228
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,540
Not me, indeed.

229
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,370
I am a top-grade medicine that helps with energy circulation.

230
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,950
For frustrated and depressed people

231
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,530
like you,

232
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,050
I am the best cure.

233
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,970
You're talking nonsense.

234
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,800
The prescription you made for me

235
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,960
does not include agarwood.

236
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,580
Someday it will.

237
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,040
What are you going to do with that toy?

238
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,560
You should dispose of it.

239
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,550
I won't play with it anyway.

240
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,560
Okay.

241
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,380
Well,

242
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,410
thank you. I said that for my son.

243
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,540
Let's go.

244
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,690
Okay.

245
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,280
When we get back,

246
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,870
I'll give you a present.

247
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,220
What is it?

248
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,640
You'll know when we're back.

249
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,760
I've arrived at your department building.

250
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,330
Coming right up.

251
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,710
The photo has been edited. Send it to Dr. He.

252
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,640
You could've sent it to him yourself.

253
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,130
I'm asking you to do it.

254
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,040
Sorry for the long wait.

255
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,780
No worries. It wasn't that long.

256
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,750
What's up? Why are you smiling?

257
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,910
I'm thinking

258
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,250
that this is the exact place

259
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,250
where you sat

260
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,850
and cursed me that night.

261
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,610
I was drunk at that time, wasn't I?

262
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,160
-Sorry.
-I'm just kidding.

263
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,400
Here,

264
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,610
I made you a sachet.

265
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,800
Thank you.

266
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,400
Take a sniff.

267
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,560
I smell agarwood.

268
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,290
You have a keen nose.

269
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:24,930
By the way,

270
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,400
you didn't show up for a follow-up visit yesterday.

271
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,700
What about next week's medicine?

272
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,490
Oh, I'm feeling much better.

273
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,280
Don't you think the medication can stop now?

274
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,280
Okay.

275
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Come over for moxibustion when you have time.

276
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,460
What now?

277
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,370
Do you mean I can't come meet you unless I'm sick?

278
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,640
No, you can come and dine with me.

279
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,170
It's up to you.

280
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,710
Well,

281
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:10,290
I'll see about that later.

282
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,500
You're back.

283
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,440
Yeah.

284
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,530
Good timing.

285
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,050
What's that?

286
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:48,850
A gift from the clinic.

287
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,610
Come on, take a sniff.

288
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,450
It smells nice.

289
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,270
It does, right?

290
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,730
Don't you think you're overjoyed at a free sachet?

291
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,530
Am I?

292
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,930
I doubt it.

293
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,770
I'll go change.

294
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,160
That sachet from the clinic

295
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,240
has a scent of agarwood.

296
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,200
It smells quite nice.

297
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,920
Shall we go get one too?

298
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,680
Sure. Sure. Sure.

299
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:17,870
Today...

300
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,060
where can I get breakfast?

371
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,330
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

372
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,330
I'll take you there.

373
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,440
Breakfast will start in an hour.

374
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,090
Okay, okay, okay.

00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:08,920

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,810
Let's take one more photo.

380
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,050
Three, two, one, cheese!

381
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,650
[Yuncong All Day Dining Restaurant]

382
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,680
Uncles and aunties,

383
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,710
we've designed new dishes

384
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,330
for the hotel restaurant.

385
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,530
They're special in their own way. Please have a try.

386
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,640
Manager Xu,

387
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,000
all of these are traditional Chinese medicinal herbs.

388
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,090
Good stuff!

389
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,920
Yes, you're right.

390
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,480
Uncles and aunties,

391
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,530
let me give you a brief introduction.

392
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,290
This is the area

393
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,850
where we prepare medicinal cuisine.

394
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,050
All the materials we use

395
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,050
are the freshest seasonal herbs.

396
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,160
Not bad, not bad.

397
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,440
Is this donkey-hide gelatin?

398
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,310
Uncles and aunties,

399
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,770
here is some porridge made with red dates, white jelly mushroom and lotus seeds.

400
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,090
It reduces dryness and is good for blood.

401
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,470
This porridge is proper food

402
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,610
for autumn days like these.

403
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,050
Sounds good.

404
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,610
Each of us should get one bowl later.

405
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,330
Good. One bowl for each of us.

406
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:04,850
Right.

407
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,770
We gotta taste it.

408
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,090
We've also prepared crucian carp soup.

409
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:07,850
There is

410
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,720
ginger, spring onions,

411
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,420
astragalus

412
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,160
and red dates.

413
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
They help lower cholesterol levels.

414
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,960
lower cholesterol levels?

415
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,930
I want a bowl of this porridge too.

416
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,920
Give me a bowl of it.

417
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,050
A bowl of porridge, sir.

418
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:16,770
Miss,

419
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,010
is there a suitable drink for the elderly like us?

420
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,140
In the past few days,

421
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,040
we've been on planes and buses.

422
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,050
We feel pain in the legs and knees.

423
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:24,770
We're exhausted.

424
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,440
We will serve some soup made with eucommia, chestnuts, and chicken feet tonight.

425
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,850
It's good for the kidneys and spleen.

426
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,920
Maybe you can give it a try.

427
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,770
-It's perfect for you.
-I've never tasted it.

428
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,920
But I'm like to give it a try.

429
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,290
We've placed aromatic materials

430
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,530
under your pillows as a sleep aid.

431
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,570
If you don't like the smell,

432
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,800
I'll change it for you at any time.

433
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,610
Just contact me.

434
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay, thank you.

435
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,160
Come this way to see your room.

436
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,090
Mm, okay.

437
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,050
This way, please.

438
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,570
Hello. Since you just informed the reception of your sleeplessness,

439
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,720
we've prepared a pillow filled with Chinese senna for you.

440
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,060
It is good for your liver and eyes,

441
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,380
and it also helps to calm your nerves.

442
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,290
Please come in.

443
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,010
Thank you.

444
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,480
Hello!

445
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,200
Hello.

446
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,050
How may I help you?

447
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:19,850
Well,

448
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,610
could you change the aroma

449
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,040
in my room?

450
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,590
I don't like the smell of grass.

451
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,700
I'm sorry.

452
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:31,000
8252.

453
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,960
Are you Ms. Liu Yunci?

454
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,290
Yes, I am.

455
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,010
Let me see.

456
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,200
Before checking in,

457
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,260
you didn't specify any special requirements.

458
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,480
So we prepared an aroma of mugwort,

459
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,970
sandalwood, magnolia, and camphor for you.

460
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:45,870
This mainly

461
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,180
inhibits bacterial activity and cleans the air.

462
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,390
That said,

463
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,160
it's fine if you don't like it.

464
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,050
May I ask what efficacy do you wish

465
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,810
the new aroma will bring?

466
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,290
I don't care for the efficacy.

467
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:59,520
I just want something mellow and warm.

468
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,890
Let me see what I can get for you.

469
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,850
Here is another type of aroma we offer.

470
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,090
It smells agarwood, fragrant rosewood, fructus amomi and styrax benzoin.

471
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,920
It mainly improves blood circulation and relieves pain.

472
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,850
Do you like it?

473
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,960
It relieves pain...

474
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,370
I'd like to give it a try.

475
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,680
Okay, no problem.

476
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,720
I'll bring it to you right away.

477
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,570
Okay, thank you.

478
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,270
You're welcome.

479
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,890
Housekeeping Dept., agarwood aroma for Room 8252.

480
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,050
Please send the supplies up here now.

481
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,000
Congratulations.

482
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,810
You've completed another session of chemotherapy.

483
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,720
Are you feeling any discomfort?

484
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm not having diarrhea

485
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
or vomitting.

486
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,960
But I do have a lot of burps.

487
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,030
Those are not burps.

488
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,910
They're hiccups

489
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,830
caused by the stomach injury induced by the chemotherapy.

490
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,480
Starting from tonight,

491
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
you need to take some stomach medicine

492
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,000
and have millet porridge, et cetera.

493
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,920
You will soon feel better.

494
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,290
That's great. Thank you, Dr. He.

495
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,720
You care a lot about Ze.

496
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,330
I'm just doing my job.

497
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,200
Oh, right.

498
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,540
A lady has sent you a present

499
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,450
to reward your positive attitude towards receiving treatment.

500
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:10,370
Take it.

501
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,290
This is too much.

502
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,530
It's alright. Just keep it.

503
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,530
As long as Ze continues the treatment, takes it seriously,

504
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,370
and recovers soon,

505
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,680
that lady will be very pleased.

506
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:21,850
Just take it.

507
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,240
Take it out. Have a look.

508
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:30,400
What do you think?

509
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,500
Do you like it?

510
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,200
What a huge Transformer!

511
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,770
Mom, I've never received

512
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,050
a Transformer as big as this one.

513
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,820
Be gentle with it. Don't break it.

514
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,030
Dr. He, who is this kind lady?

515
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,800
I must thank her in person.

516
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,240
It's such an expensive toy.

517
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,330
No worries.

518
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,050
I'll tell her about your gratitude.

519
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:14,890
She...

520
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,570
She's just a friend of mine.

521
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,680
She heard about what happened

522
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,640
to you and Zhao Ze by chance,

523
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,090
and was impressed by your toughness,

524
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,440
so she'd like to give Ze a present.

525
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,290
Let's keep up the good work.

526
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,530
Perhaps you can be discharged before Chinese New Year.

527
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,880
Thank you, Dr. He.

528
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,440
Tell your friend I appreciate her kindness.

529
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,710
You're welcome.

530
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,480
May I take a photo of you

531
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,580
and send it to her?

532
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,770
Then she'll know her best wishes have reached you.

533
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,480
Okay.

534
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,980
Can I take the photo with Mom?

535
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,160
Sure thing.

536
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,330
Wait, let me put on a hat.

537
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,770
Alright,

538
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,000
look at the camera.

539
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,130
Three,

540
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,890
two,

541
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:00,220
one.

542
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,750
Smile!

543
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,960
Let's take one more.

544
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,670
Three,

545
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,720
two,

546
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,290
one.

547
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,160
Done.

548
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,340
What a nice photo.

549
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,910
It can be opened up.

550
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,720
This...

551
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
This wheel.

552
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,480
You're very smart.

553
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,400
This wheel...

554
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,640
Your gift has been delivered.

555
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,290
The kid loves it.

556
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,810
He asked me to thank you on his behalf.

557
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,850
Glad he received it. I was worried that you might keep it for yourself

558
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,050
and play with it at home.

559
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,050
The kid looks spirited.

560
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,850
Will he be discharged soon?

561
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,050
He is diagnosed with pediatric leukemia,

562
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,490
and has just finished a session of chemotherapy.

563
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,750
I hope he will get well enough to be discharged before Chinese New Year.

564
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,090
Then I wish him to be healthy

565
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,810
and even stronger than the Transformer.

566
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,430
If you had come here that day,

567
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,090
you could've given him your best regards in person.

568
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,960
The kind lady wishes you to be healthy

569
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,680
and grow stronger than the Transformer.

570
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,290
Please tell her I say "thank you."

571
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,290
It's very courteous of you.

572
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,440
I got it. See you around.

573
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,440
Senior He.

574
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,630
Suye.

575
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,720
Suye looks cheerful.

576
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,640
That's rare.

577
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,640
Huh? What?

578
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,420
You're so silly.

579
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,200
Isn't it obvious?

580
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,960
Look at him.

581
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,240
He must be texting Manager Shen.

582
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,680
Have you ever seen him smile like this before?

583
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,090
Last time when he smiled like this,

584
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,130
he was still a college student.

585
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,890
At that time, I...

586
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,950
I was either in elementary or middle school.

587
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,890
I can't recall.

588
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,770
Anyway, it was many years ago.

589
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,810
This is fun.

590
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,130
When he was a college student...

591
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,980
I'd like to ask you a question.

592
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:45,930
Have a seat.

593
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,390
What question?

594
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
This has been on my mind for a long time.

595
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,440
I think it's time I asked you.

596
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,320
About the lady who sent me the Transformer,

597
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,570
what does she mean to you?

598
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,200
Just a friend?

599
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,530
I don't think so.

600
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,570
Is she your girlfriend or what?

601
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,940
Aren't you a clever little boy?

602
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,440
I can't believe I guessed it right.

603
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,570
My plan is a failure now.

604
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,020
What plan?

605
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,640
A plan to find myself a father

606
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,440
with my own efforts.

607
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,640
Father?

608
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,370
You seem like a decent guy to me.

609
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,140
You treat me nicely.

610
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,230
You treat my mom nicely too.

611
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,000
I am your doctor.

612
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,330
You are my patient.

613
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,610
Certainly, I need to be nice to you,

614
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,090
take good care of you,

615
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:55,810
and help you recover.

616
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,090
It is my responsibility to do so.

617
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,480
When my father was alive,

618
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,090
he always abused my mom

619
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,570
and yelled at her.

620
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,290
No one has talked to her as gently as you do.

621
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,010
Mom has suffered a lot

622
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,000
to get me medical treatment.

623
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,720
I want to find her a man that will treat her right.

624
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,480
But I can't be your father.

625
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:20,890
Forget it.

626
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,850
You have a girlfriend now.

627
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,440
I might as well give up my plan.

628
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,290
I've accepted her present after all.

629
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,050
I wish you and that kind lady happiness.

630
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,730
Message received.

631
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,510
Come on, let me walk you back.

632
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,090
We're finally getting a break.

633
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,610
When the elderly visitors come back from the scenic spots,

634
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,370
we'll be busy again.

635
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,480
You're drinking hot bubble tea now.

636
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,370
The weather is getting cooler. You should quit cold drinks too.

637
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,370
I'm fine. The cold doesn't bother me.

638
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,330
If you say so.

639
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,290
Without Xiangya,

640
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,730
I can't think of snarky words to say about you.

641
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,890
I'll probably resign next year.

642
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,610
You know my family runs a small company, right?

643
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,960
My parents want to retire and have me take it over.

644
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,850
So they can travel the world.

645
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,240
Where does that sudden thought come from?

646
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,810
They did talk to me about it some time ago,

647
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,000
but I could never make up my mind.

648
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,050
That's why I didn't tell you guys.

649
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,000
Is Xiangya not aware of it?

650
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,770
She overheard me and my mom talking on the phone.

651
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,920
That explains

652
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,130
why she was upset that day.

653
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:47,980
I'm just wondering

654
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,520
if she was upset

655
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,770
because I am not that good a friend

656
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,400
or what.

657
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,760
Why don't I ask her for you?

658
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,640
Please don't.

659
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,960
She's interested

660
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,540
in that young man now, isn't she?

661
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,920
She is not really into Li Jie.

662
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,520
You know how many

663
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,080
younger boys pursued her in college,

664
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,400
but she took interest in no one, right?

665
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,000
Could it be possible

666
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,770
that she likes younger men

667
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,040
as she gets older now?

668
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,520
You're the one getting old!

669
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,730
I don't wanna

670
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:28,600
talk about that now.

671
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,199
Well,

672
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,920
I have a question for you.

673
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,199
Do you think I still stand a chance with her

674
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,440
after being friends with her for such a long time?

675
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,250
Please get a quiet room

676
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,940
for the elder gentleman in Room 203.

677
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,650
Remember, it must not be a room at the end of the hallway.

678
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,950
Are you working late today?

679
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,120
No. Why?

680
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,000
The kid asked me to treat you to dinner

681
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,600
so I could thank you for giving him a present.

682
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,000
Okay. Will he join us?

683
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,020
No. He has to stay in the hospital.

684
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,100
Come to my place after work.

685
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,590
His place again?

686
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,810
Put on the slippers.

687
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:15,700
Dinner will be ready soon.

688
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,350
It'll just take a moment.

689
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,080
There is freshly made five-flavor fruit tea on the table.

690
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,150
Help yourself to it.

691
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:20,780
Thank you.

692
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,480
What's wrong?

693
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,440
My arm is sore.

694
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,920
I guess I pulled a muscle when I moved stuff.

695
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,600
What did you move

696
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,890
that could cause a muscle strain?

697
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:03,600
A large number

698
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,370
of elderly visitors are staying at my hotel, right?

699
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:05,920
I'm telling you,

700
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,520
these people are amazing.

701
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,810
They buy local specialties,

702
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,770
souvenirs from gift shops,

703
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,370
and fruit from roadside stands.

704
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,850
They are unbelievable.

705
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,400
At 4 AM, they set out to watch the sunrise.

706
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,330
When they come back in the afternoon, they are still energetic.

707
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,920
They put us young people to shame.

708
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,400
Now I can't take a few steps without panting.

709
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,400
Nowadays,

710
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,170
many elderly people

711
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,770
know a lot about how to stay healthy.

712
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,520
The elderly guests you're catering now

713
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,560
are financially comfortable

714
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,040
and healthy.

715
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,290
Fragile young people like you

716
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,690
who spend every day in air-conditioned offices

717
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,730
with enormous stress

718
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,770
are no match for them.

719
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,690
Dr. He, you're so mean.

720
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,560
How am I being mean?

721
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,290
I'm just reminding you

722
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,350
that you should take care

723
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,050
of your body before making money.

724
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,810
I got it.

725
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,890
Everything you say is centered on your profession.

726
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,520
Do you mind if I put pepper in this?

727
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,900
Dr. He,

728
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,890
this is...

729
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,310
Dr. He, let me do you a favor.

730
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,660
Check this out.

731
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,110
Does it look like a ring to you?

732
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,010
It's yours now. You're welcome.

733
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,430
You gave me a ring in the afternoon,

734
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,180
but I lost it.

735
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,440
It went missing when I got off work.

736
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,320
How about I buy you a new one?

737
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,210
This is...
