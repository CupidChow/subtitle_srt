[The Best Thing]

2
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,600
[Episode 22: Kudzu Flower] 
[Sweet in taste and cold in nature.
It's good for your spleen and stomach, relieving hangovers and bleeding.]

3
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,780
Cheers.

4
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,280
You're just taking a tiny sip?

5
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,090
I'll just drink a little.

6
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,310
If I drink too much,

7
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,290
He Suye might take advantage of it again.

8
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,430
You two better just have a small drink.

9
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,420
Time flies so fast though.

10
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,960
At this time last year,

11
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,860
I was still anxious about the IT summit.

12
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,000
That was the first major event

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,180
after I became the Front Office manager.

14
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,079
I had no clue what to do back then.

15
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,420
Now you've got it figured out.

16
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,000
You're already experienced.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,690
You even dare to come out for a drink.

18
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,190
Back then, you were still

19
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,870
anxious about that Mr. Yan.

20
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,160
Don’t mention it.

21
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,590
It's over. Let's move past it.

22
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,500
When are you going to resign?

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,920
Probably in June or July.

24
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:37,680
But when I go back,

25
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
I need to check my study abroad fund.

26
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,380
If it's not enough for living expenses,

27
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,829
I might need a few more big events.

28
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,600
I need the bonuses.

29
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,450
No problem.

30
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,800
No, no, no.

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,870
Please, no more big events.

32
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,870
I hate big events the most.

33
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,030
I have to have meetings with the Finance Department every day.

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,270
I just want to

35
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,250
coast through these few months and resign with you.

36
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,240
That new job of yours,

37
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,080
the MCN company

38
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,310
you mentioned last time,

39
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,630
I think it's a bit unreliable.

40
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,790
If you want to be a food blogger,

41
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,950
I think you should find a more established company.

42
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,940
I know, okay? Many companies want me.

43
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,080
I'm still choosing.

44
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,340
I'll shut up, then.

45
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,710
In the blink of an eye, we've been working together for seven years.

46
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,030
Time really flies.

47
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,990
Once you two leave,

48
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll be left alone at Gunan Huating Hotel.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,450
Isn't that a bit too miserable for me?

50
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,890
Why don't you resign too?

51
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,400
If I resign, we'll both be broke.

52
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,710
Your new job isn't confirmed yet.

53
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,050
I have to earn money to support the family.

54
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm still here,

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,750
you two.

56
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,430
So what if you're here?

57
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,870
We're family anyway.

58
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,310
Right, right, right.

59
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,030
You're right.

60
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,960
I'm the third wheel, aren't I?

61
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,680
How's your guy doing?

62
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,960
Probably working overtime.

63
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
Are you finished?

64
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,220
Do you want me to pick you up?

65
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,110
Why are you still here?

66
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,810
I'm revising the report.

67
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:10,950
Revising the report?

68
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,750
Why do you have to do it here?

69
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,870
Can't you do it at home?

70
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,240
You don't understand, do you?

71
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,920
After work,

72
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,000
I just want to date.

73
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,910
How can I focus on revising the report?

74
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:21,910
He,

75
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,220
please get lost.

76
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,020
Alright.

77
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,000
Then...

78
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,740
I'll get lost.

79
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,720
Have a good shift.

80
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,280
Get lost quickly.

81
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,230
How can you be like this?

82
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,820
Hey, Comrade.

83
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,650
Hello, Senior Lin.

84
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,520
Are you guys done?

85
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you want me to come and find you?

86
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,190
Xifan has already gone home.

87
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:06,950
She said she was tired.

88
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,080
Why didn't she reply to my message?

89
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,520
She just sent a WeChat message saying she's home.

90
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,890
Maybe she fell asleep.

91
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,380
Oh, okay.

92
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,010
She didn't drink too much, did she?

93
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,120
She didn't drink much, saying she was afraid you'd trick her.

94
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,830
She didn't even drink half a bottle of beer tonight.

95
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,790
She tells you guys everything.

96
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,900
Alright, let's meet up next time we're free.

97
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,870
Okay, let's meet up next time. Bye.

98
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,340
Okay.

99
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,300
Bye-bye.

100
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,720
Xifan?

101
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,780
Why are you here?

102
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,530
You came to my place without telling me?

103
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,820
I could have come back earlier.

104
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,390
I thought you were working overtime,

105
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,460
so I just waited for you at home.

106
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,330
I had something come up suddenly.

107
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
I'll drink with you guys next time.

108
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,520
What was it?

109
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,610
I can't say yet.

110
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,280
I'll tell you when the result comes out next week.

111
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,510
Alright.

112
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,750
Did you draw this?

113
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,500
What did you draw?

114
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,080
You.

115
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,190
Me?

116
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,960
Cute.

117
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,870
Isn't it?

118
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,330
What about these leaves?

119
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,330
What do the leaves mean?

120
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,030
I'm not telling you.

121
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,700
♫Never know what to do♫

122
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,240
Keeping me in suspense.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,680
Tell me.

124
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,510
I won't.

125
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,200
♫In the times, I'm with you♫

126
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,000
Tell me.

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,560
I won't.

128
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,270
Are you going to tell me or not?

129
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,750
I won't tell.

130
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,360
Are you going to tell me or not?

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,830
I won't tell.

132
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,480
If you don't tell, I'll bite you.

133
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,160
Then bite me.

134
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,270
I won't tell, I won't tell.

135
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,220
♫Never know what to say♫

136
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,870
Are you going to tell me or not?

137
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,430
I won't tell.

138
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,050
I won't tell.

139
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,590

Suye.

144
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,490
I need you so much.

145
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,290
Did you know?

146
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,770
Fang Kexin ran off with another man.

147
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,820
If you don't want me,

148
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,310
then no one will.

149
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,540
He Suye.

150
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,580
Get me some water.

151
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,100
How does he have your house's password?

152
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,040
Well,

153
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,310
once...

154
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,600
I'll change the password tonight.

155
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,720
Alright, take care of him tonight.

156
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,240
I'm leaving.

157
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,270
It's okay, I'll just...

158
00:09:59,270 --> 00:09:59,960
Okay.

159
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,010
Change the password.

160
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,910
Take care of him.

161
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,600
Go on.

162
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,920
I'm off.

163
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,320
He Suye,

164
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,880
where's the water?

165
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,790
Good morning.

166
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,570
You're having breakfast?

167
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,550
Is there any for me?

168
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,010
I changed the password to the door.

169
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,440
Don't come to my house again.

170
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,510
You can't do this.

171
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,620
When you asked me to game with you before,

172
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,490
I was always there for you.

173
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,080
Was Manager Shen here yesterday?

174
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,470
Eat up, eat up.

175
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,960
Tell me about it.

176
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,910
Why did you get so drunk last night?

177
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,420
What happened between you and Fang?

178
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,490
How did you know?

179
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,890
You told me yourself. How else would I know?

180
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,890
She's dating a senior from school now.

181
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,030
Did she tell you?

182
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,940
No.

183
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,860
I saw them leaving work and going home together.

184
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,840
She didn't even tell you.

185
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,200
How do you know it's true?

186
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,080
They even took a cab together. How can it not be true?

187
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,410
What did I tell you before?

Are you done staring?

374
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,270
I was just thinking...

375
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,500
When you're at the summit with those old TCM doctors,

376
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,030
if others ask me,

377
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,290
"Which one is your boyfriend?",

378
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,670
I'll point and say, "Look.

379
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,300
He's the most handsome one there."

380
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,250
That's it?

381
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,960
Why don't you compliment my academic level?

382
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,830
This event is a top-notch academic exchange.

383
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,050
Alright.

384
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,020
Actually, I've seen

385
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,610
the list of attendees staying at the hotel for this summit.

386
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,810
They're all very senior doctors in Chinese and Western medicine.

387
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,680
The fact that your report was selected for presentation

388
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,220
shows that your professional level

389
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,730
is undoubtedly high.

390
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,340
I can compliment you now—

391
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,230
you're like an old TCM physician.

392
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,990
Do you have to add the word "old"?

393
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,120
But honestly,

394
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,720
thank you for

395
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,400
being understanding during this time.

396
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,200
Of course. I know

397
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,640
this opportunity is really important to you.

398
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,870
Actually, I'm quite surprised.

399
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,840
After all, this topic before...

400
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,390
Stop.

401
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,340
How can you call this a surprise?

402
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,700
You've been working on this topic since last year, right?

403
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,230
Exactly. This shows it's the result of your hard work.

404
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,850
You don't know,

405
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,350
but when your project was suspended before,

406
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,780
I was struggling,

407
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,680
not knowing how to comfort you.

408
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,790
So your success this time

409
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,240
actually makes me happier than you.

410
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,750
Cheers!

411
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,930
We can't do bottoms up with this.

412
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,560
Will you be here for the entire event?

413
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,400
Besides presenting my topic,

414
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,240
I'll also participate in several

415
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,180
academic exchanges and specialized forums.

416
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,140
Oh, my grandpa will be coming too.

417
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,450
He'll be speaking as a TCM representative

418
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,650
at the opening ceremony.

419
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,600
So,

420
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,370
will you be staying at our hotel?

421
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,560
I probably won't.

422
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,020
Our association doesn't have that much budget.

423
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,570
Local doctors

424
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,610
will all stay at home

425
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,220
to ease the pressure on the association.

426
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:16,930
Fine.

427
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:17,860
What?

428
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,370
Do you want me to stay at your hotel?

429
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,280
I didn't say that.

430
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,160
One less guest means less pressure for me.

431
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,660
Besides, our hotel has a rule

432
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,650
that guests and staff must maintain a safe distance.

433
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,920
With our relationship,

434
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,940
do we also need to keep a safe distance?

435
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,000
Of course, I'm very professional.

436
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,150
In the hotel,

437
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:37,850
you have to stay

438
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,400
10 meters away from me.

439
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,310
Alright.

440
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,920
Well, I'd like to see

441
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,880
if our Manager Shen

442
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,110
can really manage to

443
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,800
keep a 10-meter safe distance from me.

444
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,960
Of course I can.

445
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,380
Have you had breakfast?

446
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,660
It'll take an hour to get there.

447
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,800
I've eaten. Let's go.

448
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,150
By the way,

449
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,640
your father will also attend as a representative

450
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,950
of cardiac surgery experts.

451
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,840
He'll be giving a special report at the meeting.

452
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,680
If you're free,

453
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,300
why don't you chat with him?

454
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,400
We'll see.

455
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,120
Let's go now.

456
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,030
The guests for today's Chinese Medical Association Summit

457
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,110
are about to enter.

458
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,650
All departments, please prepare accordingly.

459
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,100
Food & Beverage, assist with the food supply.

460
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,470
Pay special attention to the sanitation of the dining area.

461
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,470
No problem.

462
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,280
Add salt and pepper.

463
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,290
Wipe it first.

464
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,610
Marketing Department, help manage the order in the venue.

465
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,830
Be proactive in preventing and responding to any emergencies.

466
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,270
Mr. Lin, please take extra care during the summit.

467
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,300
Understood.

468
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,440
Those arriving on the first day of the summit

469
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,780
are all VIP guests.

470
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,190
Everyone needs to pay special attention.

471
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,020
[The 8th Summer Summit of the Chinese Medical Association]

472
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,720
[Marketing Department] [Food & Beverage Department] [Front Office Department]

473
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,880
Manager Shen from the Front Office, please ensure proper guest guidance

474
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,910
and handle any room-related issues for the staying guests.

475
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,830
Received.

476
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,610
Alright, let's get moving.

477
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,640
Thank you for your trouble.

478
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,450
I'll ask them to confirm again.

479
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,380
This way, please.

480
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,220
Hello.

481
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,240
Hello, hello.

482
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,110
Welcome, welcome.

483
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,160
Hello, hello, hello.

484
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,830
Welcome.

485
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,380
The elevators are over there. Please watch your step.

486
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,090
Where's Shen?

487
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,150
She shouldn't be here, right?

488
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,290
Didn't you say she's the Front Office Manager?

489
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,400
The Front Office Manager has a wide range of responsibilities.

490
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,550
It's not just about the lobby.

491
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,160
Right.

492
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,030
Three, two.

493
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,830
Okay, thank you.

494
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,200
Look at the camera.

495
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,790
Alright, let's go.

496
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,830
We need to add a standard room now.

497
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,300
Just put it in 8602.

498
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,270
If there's anything else,

499
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,160
just call me directly.

500
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,030
Alright, understood, Manager.

501
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:22,680
I'll go attend to my duties now.

502
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,380
Thank you for your hard work.

504

Welcome.

506
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:42,430

509
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,440
Professor Yu.

510
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,640
Hello, Shen.

511
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,510
Hello.

512
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,560
You must be busy.

513
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,470
It's not too bad.

514
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,780
This is much more relaxed compared to large commercial events.

515
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,270
Where are you two heading?

516
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,540
We're going to the opening ceremony.

517
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,040
The main venue is over here.

518
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,949
I'll take you there.

519
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:14,699
No need.

520
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,590
We're family.

521
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,580
Don't trouble yourself.

522
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,560
Feel free to contact us when you're not busy.

523
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,980
That's enough, Grandpa.

524
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,040
No problem.

525
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,010
Then, this way, please.

526
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,760
Alright, alright.

527
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,760
Today,

528
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,210
you look really nice.

529
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,699
Go away.

530
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,210
Hello.

531
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,760
Hello.

532
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,110
Are you here for the summit?

533
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,510
I need to go to the main venue.

534
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,690
The main venue is this way.

535
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,400
I'll take you there.

536
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,630
No, just tell me where it is.

537
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,720
I can go by myself.

538
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,430
It's no trouble. It's our job.

539
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,250
Let me carry your suitcase for you.

540
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,350
You're too kind.

541
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,120
This way, please.

542
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,920
Thank you.

543
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,270
It's alright.

544
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,370
We still have five minutes. We'll make it.

545
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,460
It is a bit rushed, isn't it?

546
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,400
Professor He.

547
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,470
You've come too.

548
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,710
I've heard so much about you.

549
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,640
Long time no see.

550
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,190
Long time no see.

551
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,210
How are things on your end?

552
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,150
Quite busy now.

553
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,000
Things are going well, right?

554
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,710
Not bad.

555
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,760
Your report is really good.

556
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,940
That was just a rush job.

557
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,100
I'm sorry.

558
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,560
Sorry, Professor He.

559
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,440
It's almost time.

560
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,320
You need to go in now.

561
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,710
Let's chat another day then.

562
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:51,880
Alright.

563
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,400
Let's talk another day.

564
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:52,760
You go ahead.

565
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,960
Let's find time to have a good chat.

566
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,990
Sure, sure.

567
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
This is the check-in area.

568
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,720
Thank you.

569
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,590
Thank you, young lady.

570
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,800
Sorry for the trouble.

571
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,500
It's our job.

572
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,440
I wish you all the best.

573
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:10,960
Okay.

574
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,500
Distinguished leaders,

575
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,100
[The 8th Summer Summit of the Chinese Medical Association]

576
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,390
experts,

577
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,080
and colleagues,

578
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,460
good morning.

579
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,850
I'm very happy

580
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,190
to be invited

581
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,400
to participate in

582
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,600
the 8th Summer Summit of

583
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,900
the Chinese Medical Association.

584
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,590
As an

585
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:45,110
elderly practitioner who has been engaged in TCM clinical work for a long time,

586
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,050
I'm very excited and happy.

587
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,400
Through the summit agenda,

588
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,550
I see that

589
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,000
TCM has made

590
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,990
significant contributions in disease treatment.

591
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,550
I've also noticed at the venue that…

592
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,550
What's the plan for lunch?

593
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,760
There's a considerable number of young people.

594
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,510
What does this indicate?

595
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,230
It shows that the TCM cause is being passed down continuously.

596
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,880
Meeting a few TCM professors with Grandpa

597
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,920
and having a meal together.

598
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,140
So I sincerely hope

599
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,590
that those in the TCM field

600
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,800
-Okay.
-will work together

601
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,400
to forge ahead

602
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:29,880
and strive to carry forward the TCM cause.

603
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,320
Wish the summit a success. Thank you.

604
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,430
Thank you, Professor Yu Liren, for your excellent speech.

605
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,030
As a leading figure in the field of TCM,

606
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,830
Professor Yu has made outstanding contributions

607
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,420
to the development of TCM.

608
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,440
Alright,

609
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,840
next, let's welcome

610
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,840
Professor Li from Jiangzhou University of TCM to give a speech.

611
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,190
Madam, this contains lavender,

612
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,410
which is especially good for women.

613
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,460
Please enjoy, both of you.

614
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,460
Mr. He.

615
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,630
This is a special gift prepared by our hotel for you,

616
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,320
a small sachet.

617
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,250
What's inside it?

618
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,180
Yours contains fennel.

619
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,110
I just tried your medicated diet.

620
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,430
It is quite good.

621
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,480
This porridge especially

622
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,050
has a very special taste.

623
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,990
I'm glad you like it.

624
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,130
It was specially designed by our TCM consultant.

625
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,850
The herbs inside are very carefully chosen.

626
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,090
Good, good, good.

627
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:30,960
Please enjoy your meal.

628
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:31,560
Alright.

629
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,700
Dr. He.

630
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,010
Is everyone here for lunch?

631
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,630
Please, come this way.

632
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,190
Grandpa,

633
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,930
this is a friend of mine and Shen's.

634
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,190
I know Xu.

635
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,210
I've taken her pulse before.

636
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,040
Don't you remember?

637
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,590
Yes, yes.

638
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
She also led the medicated diet project last time.

639
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,570
There are seats over here.

640
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,930
Alright, thank you.

641
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,900
These two are TCM experts from Su City.

642
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,480
Well, since you're all experts,

643
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,440
I'll refrain from showing off.

644
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,480
I won't introduce the medicated diet.

645
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,990
Just tell me what you'd like to eat

646
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:03,820
and I'll get it for you.

647
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:04,810
Okay, sure.

648
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,550
Welcome.

649
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,870
He Suye, turn around.

650
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,060
Grandpa,

651
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,140
Shen is looking for me.

652
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,930
I'll step out for a moment.

653
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,880
Go ahead.

654
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,450
Just a moment.

655
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,820
Why are you here?

656
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,060
Come with me for a moment.

657
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,950
Why did you come now?

658
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,500
Have you eaten?

659
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,290
I've already eaten.

660
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,710
I missed you.

661
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,770
What are your plans later?

662
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,300
I'll attend a few lectures later,

663
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,560
have tea with the old TCM practitioners,

664
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:06,800
and wait for you to get off work.

665
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,000
You probably won't be able to wait until I get off work today.

666
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,040
I have to work overtime tonight.

667
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,610
You should go back and keep Professor Yu company.

668
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,500
Wait for me at home tonight.

669
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,180
Alright, see you at home.

670
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,320
By the way,

671
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,580
well,

672
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,070
my father is here too.

673
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,270
Could you take care of him for me?

674
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,580
Sure, no problem.

675
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,220
Which room is he staying in?

676
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,160
I don't know.

677
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,760
His name is He Sheng.

678
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,740
Okay.

679
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,930
I'll go check discreetly.

680
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,020
Manager Shen,

681
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,510
can you come to the venue now?

682
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:46,820
Okay.

683
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,120
Got it, I'm coming now.

684
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,470
I need to go now.

685
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:52,860
I'm leaving then.

686
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,260
Wait.

687
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:57,960
What?

688
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,430
Go ahead.

689
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,370
I'm going then.

690
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,990
Think of me.

691
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,940
I'm leaving.

692
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,020
Hello.

693
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:48,670
Hello.

694
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,030
Are you here for the summit?

695
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,270
I need to go to the main venue.

696
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,740
The main venue is this way.

697
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,480
I'll take you there.

698
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:53,940
No need.

699
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,810
Just tell me where it is.

700
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,880
I can find it myself.
