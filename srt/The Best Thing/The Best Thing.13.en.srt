00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,640
Previously, I...

4
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,039
I felt it wasn't the right time yet,

5
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,870
so I didn't tell you explicitly.

6
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,840
There were also too many people last night.

7
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,039
I was afraid you'd be embarrassed

8
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,620
so didn't express myself clearly either.

9
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,040
But,

10
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,640
I can say it again more formally.

11
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,270
Shen Xifan,

12
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,660
I like you.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,760
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,030
I don't have any plans to be in a relationship right now.

15
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,910
So, I'm sorry.

16
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,310
Wait.

17
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,780
I thought we were getting along well.

18
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,590
I'm about to study abroad.

19
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,910
I've said before,

20
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,140
I don't plan to be in a relationship before going abroad.

21
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,960
It's fine. While you study abroad, I can stay here...

22
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,170
I might have given you the wrong impression.

23
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,920
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,400

26
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,170
Thank you for liking me.

27
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,830
I'm sorry.

Did Dr. He prescribed you Chinese medicine again?

52

you were drinking with Dr. He.

56

He was the one who sent you back.

Dr. He looks so gentle and polite.

62
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,630

63

64

We don't have any stage.

69
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,270
Last night, when Dr. He

70
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,560
sent you back,

71
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,390
I could feel he has feelings for you.

72
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,460
He took such good care of you.

73
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,750
I turned him down.

74
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,600
Why?

75
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,510
Because I'm going to study abroad.

76
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,520
I don't want to be in a relationship before I go study abroad.

77
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,310
It's not even certain if you can go yet.

78
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,070
Besides, it doesn't matter if you go abroad.

79
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,000
You know, long-distance relationships, online relationships,

80
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,070
and all kinds of relationships are possible now.

81
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,830
Relationships and studying abroad are two separate things.

82
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,800
They don't interfere with each other.

83
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,000
They do interfere.

84
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,630
I've already been through a long-distance relationship before.

85
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,870
Before I go abroad,

86
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,890
I don't want to be in a relationship.

87

Remember to take your medicine on time.

91
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,290
I heard that

92
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,370
during dinner on Friday,

93
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,070
that handsome TCM doctor confessed his feelings to you.

94
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,270
He said you drank too much,

95
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,840
so that handsome TCM doctor even sent you home.

96
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,720
So, what happened afterwards?

97
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,130
Didn't he tell you that

98
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,900
I turned down Dr. He?

99
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,840
Why?

100
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,910
Because before I go abroad to study,

101
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,030
I don't plan to be in a relationship in the first place.

102
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,270
So when he confessed to me,

103
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
I rejected him.

104
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,610
I'm already 27 years old.

105
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,720
Before making any decision,

106
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,960
I should be a bit more rational.

107
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,430
Moreover,

108
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,660
it's been proven

109
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,790
that I really can't handle a long-distance relationship.

110
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,920
Just like what happened with Yan Heng before.

111
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,010
I'm afraid that one day he might regret it

112
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,510
and realize

113
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,630
that I'm not as good as he imagined.

114
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,390
There's no major issues.

115
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,850
Just the format of the table of contents could be optimized a bit more.

117
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,120
What's wrong?

118
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,120
Manager Shen rejected Suye.

119
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,920
It's true.

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,150
I couldn't tell during the morning rounds.

121
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,960
His confession got rejected,

122
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,390
yet he still has to focus on work.

123
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,670
If it were me, I wouldn't even be able to even eat.

124
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,640
But

125
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,790
why did Manager Shen reject Senior He?

126
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,440
I don't know.

127

I even saw Manager Shen at Senior He's place.

129
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,960
I thought they

130
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,520
were just a step away from getting together.

131
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,710
Who knew

132
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,510
things would take such a sudden turn for the worse?

How is it?

00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,870
It's actually quite good.

Brown sugar ginger milk tea?

149
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,080
You girls all like to drink these

150
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,750
so-called ginger-infused hot drinks, huh?

151
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,440
The weather has been getting cooler lately,

152
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,840
so I just wanted to drink something hot.

153
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,000
Actually, whether there's ginger in it to ward off the cold

154
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,070
isn't really that important.

155
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,440
What we're drinking is the mood.

156
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,870
The mood?

157
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
To put it bluntly,

158
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,550
we need the sugar in the bubble tea

159
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,200
to stimulate dopamine secretion in the brain

160
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,550
to make ourselves feel a bit better.

161
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
That's quite interesting.

162
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,980
Drinking too much bubble tea can make you gain weight.

163
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,840
When you want to lose weight, you'll be in a bad mood.

164
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,030
But usually,

165
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,320
you like to drink bubble tea

166
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,670
to switch up your mood.

167
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,870
Don't you find that contradictory?

168
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,480
Now you can order bubble tea with sugar substitutes,

169
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,470
so it's not that bad.

170
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,410
Sugar substitutes are...

171
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,510
They're considered

172
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,670
a substitutionary satisfaction.

173
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,250
It means you're not actually consuming sugar,

174
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
but you get psychological satisfaction.

175
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,310
And it tastes much better than sugar-free options.

176
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,260
Substitutionary satisfaction.

177
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,080

178
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,840
After repeated discussions and studies within the institute,

179

182
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,240

183
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,370
allowing you to lead students in research for a while, then suspended.

184
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,590
It's a waste of your effort.

185
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,830
I tried my best to advocate for you too,

186
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,930
but there's nothing we can do.

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,390
As you know,

188
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,700
the institute's annual research funding is limited.

189
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,920
The amount allocated to oncology is also limited.

190
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,330
The institute certainly hopes that this funding

191
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,610
can be used on projects

192
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,710
that are more likely to yield results.

193
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,270
I understand.

194
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,280
For the past three years, you've been persisting

195
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,700
in researching palliative care

196
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,070
and I admire you for that.

197
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,480
But this direction is indeed too niche

198
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,390
and it's not easy to produce results.

199
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,850
I hope you can

200
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,720
understand the institute's decision.

201
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,010
Next year.

202
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,540
Next year, I will do my utmost

203
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,060
to keep your research project.

204
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,390
Alright.

205
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,620
Thank you, Director.

206
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,870
If there's nothing else,

207
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,960
I'll head back to the outpatient clinic.

208
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,270
Heat up the Chinese medicine yourself, okay?

209
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,360
I'll drink it in a couple of days.

210
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,730
Why won't you drink it?

211
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,000
It's already been prescribed, hasn't it?

212
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,240
That's He's heartfelt gesture.

213
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,260
I get it.

214
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,780
I want to go downstairs for a walk.

215
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,200
After you two are done cleaning up, get some rest early.

216
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,510
Come back early, okay?

217
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,180
Be careful, it's cold out there.

218
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,910
Don't worry, I'm heading down now.

219
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,550
Why aren't you wearing socks in this cold weather?

220
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,660
I was just planning to go downstairs for a stroll,

221
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,609
so I forgot about it.

222
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:27,950
Sure.

223
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,090
I just got back from working overtime.

224
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,680
So you...

225
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,820
You must be tired from working overtime.

226
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,540
Well, I'll head home now.

227
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,790
Good night.

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,200
♫I never wish to wake from my dream♫

229
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,440

232

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,330

234
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,330

238

♫Write it down in your heart and never disappear♫

240
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,090

Don't catch a cold.

242
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,830
He Suye.

243
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,160
He Suye.

244
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,030
Driver, please open the door.

245
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,240
He Suye.

246
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,770
He Suye.

00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,670
He Suye.

248
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,770
He Suye.

249
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,830
Go ahead, tell me.

250
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,070
Why are you so troubled?

251
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,000
Not going to talk?

252
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,920
It's up to you whether you want to talk or not.

253
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,310
I can figure it out with a bit of calculation.

254
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,200
Is it related to Miss Shen?

255
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,400
I just feel that she...

256
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,460
is a bit heartless.

257
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,760
To be honest,

258
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,870
I'm starting to doubt

259
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,480
if I'm being too presumptuous.

260
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,370
You know,

261
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,160
you finally like a girl,

262
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,600
but you can't force it.

263
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,160
If it doesn't work out, let it go.

264
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,930
After all, you're over thirty.

265
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,170
Don't make things difficult for yourself.

266
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,730
Do you understand?

267
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,160
I understand.

268
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,400
Let me pour you some more.

269
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,890
[Manager of Front Office]

270
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,820
The scent is gone.

271
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,450
[Congratulations on your offer]

272
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,310
It seems we still have to part ways.

273
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,120
I made the right decision,

274
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,100
didn't I?

275
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,160
Drink this tangerine peel water before you go back.

276
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,000
Why?

277
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,850
You've been preoccupied with Miss Shen's matter

278
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,070
qnd weren't focused on eating.

279
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,190
I'm worried you might have indigestion.

280
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,390
Drink some tangerine peel water.

281
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,440
It helps with digestion and relieves stagnation.

282
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,710
[Winter]

283
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,070
Isn't this heater a bit too small?

284
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,850
Will it be enough?

285
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,710
Although this heater is relatively small,

286
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,450
its effect is very good.

287
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,280
It will definitely be warm enough for winter.

288
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,270
Okay, let's plug it in then.

289
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,510
Alright, shall we put it here?

290
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,050
This was knocked off earlier while making the bedding.

291
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,990
This is...

292
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,240
When we were tidying up the room just now,

293
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,480
we accidentally knocked it over.

294
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,680
Where should it be placed?

295
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,730
Give it to me, I'll eat it later.

296
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,120
Since winter is approaching,

297
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,490
we've changed your bedding to something warmer.

298
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,130
It's humid in these mountains, isn't it?

299
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,910
So we applied for a heater for you.

300
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,550
If you need anything else,

301
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,720
you can always come to me.

302
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,390
Did you not rest well recently?

303
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,510
You looked rosy just a few days ago,

304
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,850
but today you seem a bit haggard.

305
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,240
Is it because

306
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,630
you're a bit tired?

307
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,870
I've been having some insomnia.

308
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,960
Then you must be having something on your mind.

309
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,470
Come, come. Sit down and chat with me.

310
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,480
I made a decision,

311
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,000
but I'm not happy about it.

312
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,270
I'm wondering

313
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,460
if I made a mistake.

314
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,310
In this world,

315
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,550
there's no absolute right or wrong.

316
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,590
It's only about whether you regret it or not.

317
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,090
If you're having insomnia,

318
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,640
could it be that you're feeling some regret?

319
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,610
I...

320
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,400
I shouldn't be regretting it, should I?

321
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,140
Life is like the clouds in the sky.

322
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,070
Gathering and parting are all destined.

323
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,880
If it's meant to be,

324
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,270
even if they turn into rain,

325
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
they will

326
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,940
fall into the same lake.

327
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,070
Do you know how to play?

328
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,590
It's lagging, it's lagging.

329
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,690
I'm still better at this, right?

330
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,240
How do I jump?

331
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,400
Press this, press this.

332
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,420
When are you coming back this year?

333
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,310
I'm coming back tomorrow.

334
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,190
Have you booked your flight?

335
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,240
Yes, I'll arrive in the evening.

336
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,870
Do you want me to send a car to pick you up?

337
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,560
No need,

338
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,270
I can take a taxi myself.

339
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,650
By the way,

340
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,330
Auntie Wang

341
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,780
is also coming to spend the New Year with us.

342
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,960
Just wanted to let you know.

343
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,430
Okay.

344
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:40,830
Hanging up now.

345
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,200
I was just thinking

346
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,550
that you rejected Dr. He too harshly.

347
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,070
I didn't expect that

348
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,240
you've already received the offer so soon.

349
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,070
Have you told him?

350
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,750
About receiving the offer.

351
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,070
I know.

352
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,750
It's not just because of the long-distance relationship between you two.

353
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,610
Your previous relationship

354
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,680
still casts a big shadow over you, doesn't it?

355
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,640
But, Shen Xifan,

356
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,550
finding someone who genuinely cares for you

357
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,610
is not easy.

358
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,550
Can you stop pushing him away

359
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,050
over and over?

360
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,650
It's like how I kept pushing and pulling with Lin Yishen.

361
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,110
In the end, we missed our chance.

362
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,750
Do you think we are

363
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,240
still friends now?

364
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,720
What are you doing?

365
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,310
Li Jie just told me

366
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,750
that he's at the handsome TCM doctor's place.

367
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,510
We'll go there now.

368
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,530
You need to clear things up with him.

369
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,640
I don't want to.

370
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,640
What should I

371
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,340
even say?

372
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,610
Say anything.

373
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,720
At least tell him that you do care about him.

374
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,740
Do you know what the most crucial part is?

375
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,230
It's not that you didn't tell him about it,

376
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,830
it's that he feels as if

377
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,160
you don't care about his feelings at all.

378
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,000
Even if you two are just platonic friends,

379
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,550
you went through this matter together.

380
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,480
You shouldn't exclude him completely, right?

381
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,750
Where are you guys?

382
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,310
We're at Suye's place.

383
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,790
Can I come and join you?

384
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,790
Let me ask first.

385
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,440
Fang.

386
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,250
What are you doing here?

387
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:30,920
Go sit down.

388
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,320
It's okay, Senior He. I'll help you.

389
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,830
We can't have guests cooking for us.

390
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,200
Really, it's fine.

391
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,850
Go get some drinks from the fridge for them.

392
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,640
Hurry, go on.

393
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,640
Alright then.

394
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,110
Suye.

395
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,720
Manager Xu from the hotel.

396
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,590
You remember her, right?

397
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,320
She says she's nearby.

398
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,420
She wants to come over.

399
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
Is she alone?

400
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,580
She might be with Manager Shen.

401
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,640
Should I...

402
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,720
It's fine, just tell them to come over together.

403
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,680
Okay, I'll reply to them then.

404
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,210
Go ahead.

405
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,659
Go up that way.

406
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
How do I get there?

407
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:24,860
You lead the way.

408
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,610
Would you like a drink?

409
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,290
Yes.

410
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,360
We're out of the elevator now.

411
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,440
Xiangya, I haven't figure out

412
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,110
how to put it yet.

413
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,760
Let's forget it.

414
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,750
We're already here.

415
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,250
But I really...

416
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,730
Please come in.

417
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,100
I've put the slippers here for you.

418
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,950
Put on the slippers and sit with them for a while.

419
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,230
I'll go prepare the meal.

420
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,030
Please, have a seat.

421
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,230
This game!

422
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,400
I'm really good at this.

423
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,030
You can play this?

424
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,960
I can't get past this part. You try.

425
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,190
Let's play together.

426
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,630
Here it comes.

427
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,420
Perilla cucumber carrot soup.

428
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,960
Looks impressive.

429
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,440
The main event.

430
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,300
It looks so delicious.

431
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,680
It's good for dispelling cold. Try some.

432
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,360
Have a bowl.

433
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,400
Is it for cooling down or warming up?

434
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,320
Warming up.

435
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:07,960
Okay.

436
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,360
I'll try some of that lotus root.

437
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:08,800
Be careful, it's hot.

438
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,630
Is it good?

439
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,670
Is it tasty?

440
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,320
Mm, it's delicious.

441
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,880
He wants some too.

442
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,670
Have some more soup.

443
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,450
That's enough, that's enough.

444
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,280
Here you go.

445
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,000
Thank you.

446
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,940
Is this shredded potato or...

447
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:16,700
I don't know.

448
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,000
I want one too.

449
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,630
Is it good?

450
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,780
How is it?

451
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:19,550
It's good, right?

452
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,590
It tastes so healthy.

453
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,510
It's incredibly delicious.

454
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,280
Tasty, isn't it?

455
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,150
Tissue, tissue, tissue!

456
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:23,840
What happened?

457
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,480
Wipe it off.

458
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,360
Thanks.

459
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,440
If the tissue doesn't clean it completely,

460
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,990
do you want to try a stain removal pen?

461
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,800
It's delicious.

462
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,320
There's one next to the washing machine in the storage room.

463
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,120
Okay.

464
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm sorry.

465
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,710
I'll go get it then.

466
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,890
The radish flavour is strong.

467
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,840
It's really tasty.

468
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,020
Senior He,

469
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,130
do you have any chili sauce?

470
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,070
Personally,

471
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,480
Yes, I do.

472
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,320
I'd like to improve it a bit.

473
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:54,670
I think it's at...

474
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,550
I'll go get it.

475
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,570
The flavour is a bit mild.

476
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,640
I'd like to make it a bit stronger.

477
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,480
What do you want to add?

478
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,440
Manager Shen.

479
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,150
Senior He used to have a girlfriend.

480
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,060
Have you heard about it?

481
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,150
I haven't heard about that.

482
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,030
They were college classmates.

483
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,000
They dated for about...

484
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,070
about five or six years, I think.

485
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,850
Eventually, it was because

486
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,920
the girlfriend got an opportunity to study abroad.

487
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,530
So she broke up with Senior He.

488
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,550
And after she left, she never came back.

489
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,670
What's wrong?

490
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,530
Do you also think I shouldn't go study abroad?

491
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,920
No, that's not it.

492
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,690
I just suddenly thought of a friend of mine.

493
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,510
She also went abroad to study.

494
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,960
Senior He was depressed for a long time because of that.

495
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,050
So, you...

496
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,960
I want to say...

497
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,730
If you really don't like him,

498
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,480
stop leading him on.

499
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,030
Ever since you rejected Senior He,

500
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,320
he's been in low spirits

501
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,320
and preoccupied with worries.

502
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,800
Today you even came to his house.

503
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,710
Do you want to see

504
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,040
how upset and heartbroken he is because of you?

505
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,230
Or are you trying to prove how charming you are?

506
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,320
Senior He has always been a gentle

507
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,300
and kind person.

508
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,360
But that doesn't mean

509
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,150
you can treat him so casually.

510
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,580
If you really don't like him,

511
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,230
please stop bothering him.

512
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,880
The situation between He Suye and me

513
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,390
might be a bit complicated.

514
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,710
But you're right.

515
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,950
I held him back.

516
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,950
Thank you for reminding me.

517
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,650
The elevator is here.

518
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:34,790
Be careful on your way.

519
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,670
Goodbye, Senior He.

520
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,670
Goodbye, Senior He.

521
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,190
Goodbye.

522
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,630
Fang.

523
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,000
Could you stay for a moment?

524
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:42,950
I have something to tell you.

525
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,250
You guys go ahead, it's fine.

526
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:48,550
Goodbye.

527
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,310
Goodbye, goodbye.

528
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,280
Senior He,

529
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:01,920
I'm sorry.

530
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,670
Xiao Fang.

531
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
I was told

532
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,880
by my grandfather to supervise your internship.

533
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,410
You are my student,

534
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,400
but,

535
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,490
you're also just my student.

536
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,620
Next semester,

537
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,590
you won't need to intern under me anymore.

538
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,900
You are an excellent student,

539
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,420
very diligent and intelligent.

540
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,240
I believe

541
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
you will definitely achieve great things in your studies.

542
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,160
You don't need to rush to answer now.

543
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,510
Think it over when you get back.

544
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,860
Be careful on your way home.

545
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,800
I'll be going now.

546
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:36,920
When you went downstairs just now,

547
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,710
did you catch up with Xifan?

548
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,050
No.

549
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:45,650
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought her.

550
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,590
It's not your fault.

551
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,160
Did she tell you what's on her mind?

552
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,070
What do you mean?

553
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,830
She's been in a lot of pain since she rejected you.

554
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,230
She's been very conflicted.

555
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,440
Conflicted for days.

556
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,880
The reason for her conflict

557
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,230
is because she cares about you.

558
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,760
She's afraid of rushing into a relationship with you,

559
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,230
and then immediately being in different countries.

560
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,440
If conflicts arise,

561
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,880
there won't even be a chance to communicate.

562
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,530
In the end, you might not even be able to remain friends.

563
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:26,390
These words,

564
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,630
why doesn't she say them herself?

565
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,190
Actually, Xifan's romantic experiences

566
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:36,490
are very limited.

567
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,230
She only had one first love that lasted seven years.

568
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,630
They broke up just last year.

569
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,800
They were in a long-distance relationship for a long time.

570
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,190
During the last period, she was in a really bad state.

571
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,750
She's very afraid of getting hurt again.

572
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,840
Later, it was because

573
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,510
the girlfriend got an opportunity to study abroad,

574
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,760
so she broke up with Senior He.

575
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,510
And after she left, she never came back.

576
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,240
I love you too much.

577
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,640
That's why I didn't realize you've always been so selfish.

578
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:32,430
You studying abroad

579
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,190
will cause so much trouble for those around you.

580
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,780
How come I'm only realising how selfish you are now?

581
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,800
Senior He has always been a very gentle

582
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,880
and kind person.

583
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:41,960
But that doesn't mean

584
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,630
you can treat him so casually.
