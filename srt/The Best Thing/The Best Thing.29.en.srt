00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,659
It's a small basket.

189
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:42,370
You stash your phone in it.

190
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,300
[Smart and cute Xifan]

191
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,500
It matches your wedding dress.

192
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,900
Right? They're all lace.

193
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,570
My wedding dress is also made by lace.

194
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,530
Light yellow,

195
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,900
a warm color.

196
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,520
Bride Q&A time.

197
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,060
Your wedding is coming soon.

198
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,000
How are you feeling now?

199
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,409
I'm curious what he's wearing.

200
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:57,960
I wonder how his hairstyle is different from usual.

201
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,330
I'm looking forward to seeing him.

202
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,010
It must be black and white suits.

203
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,560
I want to see what he looks like.

204
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,130
I want to see what he looks like.

205
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,480
I'm looking forward to seeing the groom.

206
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,770
I've seen the picture of the groomsmen,

207
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,000
but not the groom's.

208
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,160
Guess we'll see him onsite

209
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,360
He's dressed as formal as you.

210
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,160
After all, it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

211
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,220
So, let’s dress formally.

212
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,460
What's He Suye like as a partner to you?

213
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,560
He's someone who lifts your mood.

214
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,200
Because early on,

215
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,600
Xifan was pretty down,

216
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,660
and didn't know how to choose.

217
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,110
He Suye is like

218
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,930
an exit of her emotions and her companion.

219
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,100
He's romantic and interesting.

220
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,200
Later on,

221
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,260
we'll give each other flowers when we meet.

222
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,330
I think giving flowers is very romantic.

223
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,100
There is a saying,

224
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,000
someone's always running to you with flowers.

225
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,580
I think it's like

226
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,159
the kind of love we dreamed of.

227
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,240
[Xifan and Suye are in love]

228
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,530
And he's a family guy.

229
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,350
He cooks at home

230
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,300
every day.

231
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,200
It's rare for young people like us,

232
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,400
ordering takeout every day.

233
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,310
Having someone cook at home is so warm.

234
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,070
When we meet at home, he cooks every day.

235
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,310
[All tricks can be ignored]

236
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,970
What's He Suye's favorite food?

237
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,860
Spicy hot pot.

238
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,800
We eat the same breakfast every day,

239
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,659
fried dough sticks,

240
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,780
soy milk,

241
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,710
tea eggs.

242
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,660
He loves them,

243
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,260
otherwise, he wouldn't have persisted for so long.

244
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,050
[Mostly he did it to bump into you]

245
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,330
What'd Xifan’s friends first impression about He Suye?

246
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,700
Back at the hotel,

247
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,460
I liked his Moments.

248
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,500
Then he saw it,

249
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,860
and posted something on his Moments again,

250
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,530
and we called him "Cheesy TCM guy".

251
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,500
But it doesn't matter.

252
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,860
A little scheming for love is no big deal.

253
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,090
[Dr. He was doing it for love]

254
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,270
Am I right?

255
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,390
What did you say

256
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,180
when you two got official?

257
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,130
I'll be responsible for you.

258
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,760
I like someone for a long time.

259
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
I'm a very loyal person.

260
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,800
I will love you forever.

261
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,520
What kind thing did Xifan gave He Suye,

262
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,100
not a gift, but he still treasures it?

263
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,730
The keychain.

264
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,260
I got my keys that day and thought,

265
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,300
wow, so many keychains,

266
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,280
I should find one his size to give him

267
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,230
[Lock him down]

268
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,170
Later, I gave him a ring.

269
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,560
I put it on his middle finger carefully,

270
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,700
and he complained I got the wrong finger.

271
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,650
When we get married,

272
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,380
we'll buy a nicer ring.

273
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,340
It feels like two people exchanging their feelings.

274
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,159
[A mutual romance]

275
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,400
For Xifan's proposal to Suye,

276
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,130
it was a honeysuckle ring.

277
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,260
Their bond is full of

278
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,510
a lot of little things,

279
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,260
the shared little memories.

280
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,060
Any words for him

281
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,260
at the wedding?

282
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,240
I don't think the two of us

283
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,760
ever seriously said "I love you" to each other.

284
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,780
So I want to use the wedding to say,

285
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,330
"He Suye, I love you so much."

286
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,710
It should be very simple, earnest.

287
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,770
I'll make sure those three words carry weight.

288
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,860
What do you think is your wedding song?

289
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,200
When I think of the wedding,

290
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,340
the first song I think of

291
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,900
is Taylor Swift's Love Story.

292
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,180
"Romeo and Juliet"

293
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,200
are quite suitable for them.

294
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,590
The romantic and joyful vibe.

295
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,560
Do you have any expectations for your future life?

296
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,100
Cooking at home every day.

297
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,000
Trying every medicated diet out there.

298
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,060
Because He Suye has a comfortable sofa at home.

299
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,020
They would snuggle up on the sofa,

300
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,950
read books together,

301
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,420
and watch movies together.

302
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,650
Actually, the bedroom's got many vinyl records.

303
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,810
When night comes,

304
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,510
sky not fully dark,

305
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,460
playing records indoors,

306
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,130
dancing and chatting.

307
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,250
[Romance overload]

308
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,310
I think that's quite romantic.

309
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,250
As Ruohan,

310
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,700
do you have any wishes for them?

311
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,930
I hope you two can love each other passionately forever.

312
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,600
It's like a long stream,

313
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,510
a real love story

314
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,100
that could happen around us.

315
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,700
It's quite rare.

316
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,400
People get distracted by something else,

317
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,360
missing what's right here

318
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,620
the little stories around us,

319
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,860
that happened to us.

320
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,659
I hope they can love each other forever.

321
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,560
I also hope the love story

322
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,330
and the love they have

323
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,330
can also be spread to everyone who sees it.

324
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,300
I hope you all find your own love.

325
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,980
[Believe in love, hold love]

326
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,060
My wedding is coming up.

327
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,730
Please look forward to it.

328
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,730
P.S. There's a bonus scene, we'll be dancing later.

329
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,900
I have no clue how it'll turn out.

330
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,200
I hope everyone here today

331
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,400
comes happy

332
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,660
and leaves happy.
