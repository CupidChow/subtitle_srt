3
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,680
Did you gain weight during the New Year?

4
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,350
Happy New Year.

5
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,430
Happy New Year.

6
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,560
Mr. Lin, you're a bit early.

7
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,760
Happy New Year.

8
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,840
I gained 7.3 jin.

9
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,400
You're so precise.

10
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,850
Thank you.

11
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,130
Have some candy, have some candy.

12
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,600
Happy New Year.

13
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,750
Have some candy, come have some candy.

14
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,560
You're in your thirties.

15
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,680
Drinking so much bubble tea, you'll get fat.

16
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,210
It's none of your business if I get fat or not.

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,310
What's going on between you two?

18
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,079
What are you arguing about?

19
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,190
It's nothing. I don't want to talk to him.

20
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,470
I don't want to talk to you either.

21
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,400
Come on, drink some bubble tea.

22
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,240
Stop drinking.

23
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,560
Why can't I drink? I'll drink if I want to.

24
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,680
Just let him drink.

25
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,590
It's my treat this time.

26
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,430
Let him drink.

27
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,360
Fine, you drink. I'm leaving.

28
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,030
Wait a moment.

29
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,340
This is a gift specially from my parents for you.

30
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,000
Just take it.

31
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't be angry anymore.

32
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,320
Is this for me?

33
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,360
Yes, it's yours.

34
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,510
You, go after her. Stop drinking.

35
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,230
Oh, stop drinking.

36
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,079
Xu Xiangya.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,590
Wait a moment.

38
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,300
Let me talk to you.

39
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,630
Xifan.

40
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,630
Do you know

41
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,080
what's going on with Xiangya and Mr. Lin today?

42
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,900
They're at odds with each other.

43
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,630
Leave them alone.

44
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,450
They're always like this.

45
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,120
That's true.

46
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,750
What's wrong?

47
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,430
The bus is here.

48
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,339
What's the matter?

49
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,660
Good news.

50
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,360
Good news? What's going on?

51
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,160
Tell me about it.

52
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,040
The weather is so nice today, look.

53
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,000
Alright then.

54
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,050
You'll still graduate with your master's degree under my supervision.

55
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,270
After advancing to your doctoral studies, you can transfer to the gynecology department.

56
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,600
This afternoon,

57
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,480
I'll contact Director Zhao from the gynecology department.

58
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,270
I'll ask him to be your doctoral supervisor.

59
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,560
Thank you, Professor.

60
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,000
That's quite good.

61
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,160
It's a good thing to find your own ideas and goals before

62
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,870
starting your doctoral studies.

63
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,870
If there's nothing else,

64
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,430
I’ll leave now.

65
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,920
I have a meeting at the Third Hospital this afternoon.

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,560
Okay.

67
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,520
Then I'll see you out.

68
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,390
No need.

69
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,450
You should prepare for your rounds.

70
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,560
I'll be going then.

71
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,470
Goodbye, Professor.

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,160
Goodbye.

73
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,040
Senior He.

74
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,480
Have you made up your mind?

75
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,480
You're transferring to the gynecology department?

76
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,830
I've been thinking about it for a while.

77
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,560
I think what you said makes sense.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,270
I don't want to

79
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,630
have my achievements and efforts discredited one day.

80
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,560
Although this might not necessarily happen,

81
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,710
I need to consider my own interests.

82
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,510
Moreover,

83
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,440
I feel that oncology doesn't really suit me.

84
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,390
The atmosphere is too depressing.

85
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,360
So,

86
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll take this opportunity to transfer to gynecology.

87
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,010
During my doctoral studies,

88
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,040
I want to research women's health issues.

89
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,000
This direction suits you well.

90
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,360
I think so too.

91
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,000
Alright, hurry back to school.

92
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,870
Get some rest while you can.

93
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,760
The internship in gynecology will be even more demanding.

94
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,780
Good luck, Senior He.

95
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,409
Thank you for mentoring me during my internship these past two years.

96
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,850
It's part of my job.

97
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,040
What's the deal with this picture?

98
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,950
You two, explain this to me right now.

99
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,060
Confess immediately.

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,120
Mom, what's wrong?

101
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,650
I'll land after 10 p.m.

102
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,230
It'll be midnight by the time I get home.

103
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,310
Why such a rush?

104
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,400
Let's talk about it after the New Year.

105
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,270
Don't we have to do a thorough cleaning tomorrow

106
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,070
and prepare for the New Year's Eve dinner and such?

107
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,160
Alright, alright, I'm at the airport now.

108
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,430
I've got to go now.

109
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,040
Bye-bye.

110
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,400
Shs's calling you back for a blind date, huh?

111
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,480
Why pretend to be so reluctant?

112
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,760
Wasn't it already arranged for you to go back for a blind date?

113
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,080
I hope your blind date is successful.

114
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,080
What?

115
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,600
We've known each other for almost ten years, right?

116
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,330
You should know what kind of person I am by now.

117
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,550
I like you.

118
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,040
Do you want to be together with me?

119
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,240
We can't be just friends anymore anyway.

120
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,630
Even if we break up in the future,

121
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,030
the worst outcome would just be

122
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,030
not being able to be friends, right?

123
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,840
I'll quit and go back to my hometown then.

124
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I won't be in your way at all.

125
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,000
So, what do you say?

126
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,150
Is this result okay?

127
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,390
Oh, so it started before the New Year?

128
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,010
And no one told me?

129
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,270
I thought you two were really angry with each other.

130
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,080
We didn't want other colleagues to know.

131
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,030
After all, we work in the same place.

132
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,000
We didn't say anything during the New Year

133
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,840
because it was a bit awkward.

134
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,020
We were looking for a chance to tell you.

135
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,600
We were planning to tell you

136
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,390
after the morning meeting.

137
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,630
But the way you were teased by us

138
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,720
was really funny.

139
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,480
Fine.

140
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,910
So you two teamed up to play me, huh?

141
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,390
By the way,

142
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,400
your acting is really bad.

143
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,600
It could only fool her.

144
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,790
Alright, alright, my acting is bad.

145
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,870
Your acting is good.

146
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,480
The day she gave the gift,

147
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,750
you didn't even finish your lines

148
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,470
before you walked away,

149
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,770
leaving me here alone.

150
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,630
Enough.

151
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,710
So, are you two

152
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,370
planning to keep this a secret forever?

153
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,380
No, we won't.

154
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,420
I'm planning to quit with you when the time comes.

155
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,730
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

156
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,080
Working in hotel food service,

157
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,870
besides our main duties,

158
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,260
there are too many things to worry about.

159
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,550
When researching new dishes,

160
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,880
I feel particularly limited.

161
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:28,840
So,

162
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,270
I might as well quit with you

163
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,110
and find a new environment.

164
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,830
It also avoids office romance, right?

165
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,670
Then I'll stay here.

166
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
After you graduate and come back,

167
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,550
if you want to come back to work,

168
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,750
we can still be colleagues.

169
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,910
Okay.

170
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,440
Are you not angry anymore?

171
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,330
Not anymore.

172
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,480
That's good.

173
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,840
What's going on with you two?

174
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,320
Let go of each other's hand. What are you doing?

175
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
But seriously though,

176
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,120
I've come to realize

177
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,630
that when two people have feelings for each other but insist on being just friends,

178
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,310
it's bound to come to an end.

179
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,550
So why not just start dating?

180
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,510
The worst outcome is breaking up,

181
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,550
and not even being able to be friends.

182
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,630
At least there won't be any regrets.

183
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,280
So, you and Dr. He...

184
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,090
Stop.

185
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,140
Why are you suddenly talking about me?

186
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,650
[Oncology]

187
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,750
Where's today's homework?

188
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,100
You seem to look forward to my dad's daily assignments, huh?

189
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,720
My dad is in charge of cooking at home,

190
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,490
but he didn't cook today,

191
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,870
so there's no homework.

192
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,920
Okay.

193
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,070
I'm still looking forward to seeing you.

194
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,160
Dr. He, a patient has arrived.

195
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,970
Come in.

196
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,270
-Let’s go for dinner.
-Let’s go.

197
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,790
Xifan, let's go.

198
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,440
Maybe I should go back first.

199
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,470
Where are you going back to?

200
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,080
Your parents

201
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,120
went hiking today, didn't they?

202
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,440
You won't have anything to eat if you go home.

203
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,680
That's right.

204
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,010
Well,

205
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,550
let's go.

206
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,630
Everything else is fine.

207
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,390
Just remember,

208
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,030
don't drink alcohol after taking the medication.

209
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:19,870
Okay.

210
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,510
Thank you, Dr. He.

211
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:20,870
You're welcome.

212
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,630
It's my duty.

213
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,870
Please be careful as the vehicle enters the station.

214
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,360
Okay, okay, alright.

215
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,910
Okay, please have a seat.

216
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,480
It'll be ready in a moment.

217
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,320
Oh my!

218
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,050
He Suye.

219
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,600
Why are you so late?

220
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,840
Sit down.

221
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,940
I just saw your WeChat message.

222
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,320
You're lying.

223
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,650
I bought so much alcohol for you.

224
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,660
I wanted to drink it with you.

225
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,690
And you only show up now.

226
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,900
You've had too much to drink.

227
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,870
You fickle woman.

228
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,220
Me?

229
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:07,790
Why?

230
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,349
You are fickle.

231
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,640
Fine.

232
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,920
Then tell me how I'm fickle.

233
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,160
You were the one who hooked me first.

234
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,870
You caught me and then let me go.

235
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,880
I...

236
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,100
I clearly sent you red beans.

237
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:38,940
Did you eat them?

238
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,580
Did you come for your follow-up visit?

239
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,600
What kind of person does that?

240
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,080
What kind of fish,

241
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,190
spits red beans back at the person who caught it?

242
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,440
Look at me.

243
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,790
Just like this.

244
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,550
Today, I...

245
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,240
went to dinner with Senior Lin and the others.

246
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,470
so I haven't had a chance to eat the red beans yet,

247
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,430
and I haven't had time for the follow-up visit either.

248
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,990
Besides,

249
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,990
how did I hook you?

250
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,200
You did.

251
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,840
No, I didn't.

252
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,680
You hooked me right there.

253
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,120
He Suye, thank you for liking me.

254
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,570
You’re drunk. I’ll take you back.

255
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,430
I'm not leaving.

256
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,400
-Let’s go.
-No.

257
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,150
He Suye.

258
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,870
I remember someone told me,

259
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,310
drinking and then being in the wind in this weather can cause a cold.

260
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,550
What, were you lying to me before?

261
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,680
Take me home, please.

262
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,850
Since you hooked me first,

263
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,120
you'll have to be responsible for me.

264
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,240
You can't just abandon me.

265
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,960
Alright.

266
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,590
I won't abandon you.

267
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,350
I'll take you home.

268
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,920
Come on, lift your arms.

269
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,510
You're so heavy.

270
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,750
How can you be such a lightweight and still love to drink?

271
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,850
It's the opposite way.

272
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,700
This way goes to my house.

273
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,580
And garbage all over the place.

274
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,680
I'll come back to clean it up later.

275
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,510
He Suye.

276
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,550
Put me down, put me down.

277
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,580
Password, password.

278
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,130
Enter the password.

279
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,390
You, don't look.

280
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,500
Can you wash up by yourself?

281
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:12,920
Then I...

282
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,510
No problem.

283
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,070
I'm leaving, okay?

284
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,990
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

285
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,660
Xifan.

286
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,160
Good night.

287
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,640
Good night.

288
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,640
Fickle woman.

289
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,220
You were the one who hooked me first.

290
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,310
How come you caught me

291
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,970
and then let me go?

292
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,210
I don't think this counts as hooking him.

293
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,910
Dinner's ready.

294
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,270
Coming.

295
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,540
Where are the soup bowls?

296
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,480
I forgot them.

297
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,510
I'll get them.

298
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,630
Mr. Shen has created a new dish again.

299
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,750
The last dish in the medicated diet menu.

300
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,410
Red bean and crucian carp soup.

301
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,170
Alright.

302
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,790
Serve the soup.

303
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,570
Oh, okay.

304
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,370
What kind of person does that?

305
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,680
What kind of fish,

306
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,660
spits red beans back at the person who caught it?

307
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,660
Look at me.

308
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,750
Just like this.

309
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,030
You need to flip this fish over.

310
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,850
Only if you flip it over

311
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,810
can you see the red beans in the soup, you know?

312
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
Like this.

313
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,360
You've scattered it.

314
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,450
Hey, hurry and serve the soup.

315
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,070
The first bowl

316
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,200
goes to Ms. Shen first.

317
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,040
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

318
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,380
Ms. Liu.

319
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,280
Your soup looks kind of scary.

320
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Can it taste good?

321
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,310
This soup

322
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,720
nourishes the spleen and boosts energy.

323
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,990
It's especially good for women.

324
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,400
It tastes really good.

325
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,680
It's alright.

326
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,880
It even cures constipation.

327
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,710

The guest list of March is out.

362
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,350
Many of them are returning customers.

363
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,070
Please prepare in advance, everyone.

364
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,930
The team from Zhongyu Technology will also be checking in this week.

365
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,750
Zhongyu Technology attended the IT summit

366
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,960
here last year.

367
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,270
In the list is a director

368
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,160
called Yan Heng.

369
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,370
He's the younger son of CEO Yan from Zhongyu Technology.

370
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,570
He started a small robotics company abroad.

371
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,720
He's won quite a few awards.

He's a rising star in the industry.

373
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,960
We must provide excellent service to Young Mr. Yan

374
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,960
as well as his team this time.

375
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,170
We need to secure this client.

Our Marketing Department manager...

384
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:33,910
Long time no see.

385
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,240
Long time no see, Young Mr. Yan.

386
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,600
You... you know each other?

387
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,790
We're old friends.

388
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,430
This way, please.

389
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:40,160
Okay.

390
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,600
They know each other?

391
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,480
He should have said so earlier.

392
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,690
Manager,

393
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,790
Mr. Yan particularly dislikes

394
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,830
being called "Young Mr. Yan."

395
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,400
Please be mindful of this in the future.

396
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,360
I'm terribly sorry.

397
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,750
I'll inform our colleagues right away.

398
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,260
Alright?

399
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,210
I apologize.

Could you please...

401
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,680

407
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,310

00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,250
I've missed you.

416

418
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,030

424
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:01,940
Sorry.

425
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,130
I'm allergic to mangoes.

426

Could you please help me change this drink?

427
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,050
I'm sorry.

428
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,920
I wasn't aware of this situation beforehand.

429
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,190
I'm here to see Xifan.

430
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,260
Do you know where she is?

431
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,680
She's probably at work.

432
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,400
Could you please help me contact her?

433
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,780
Can't you reach her?

434
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,150
I remember it now.

435
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,440
It seems like she's blocked you, hasn't she?

436
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,120
Why don't you look around, Mr. Yan?

437
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,730
Our hotel is quite large indeed.

438
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,330
But she must be somewhere around here.

439
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,340
You all

440
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,610
are helping her hide from me, aren't you?

441
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,050
It seems like you're the one who's been hiding, doesn't it?

442
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,760
You didn't even show your face when you broke up with her.

443
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,160
And now you suddenly appear.

444
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,460
What do you mean?

445
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,930
I want to get back together with her.

446
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,250
What makes you think she wants to get back together with you?

447
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,460
She's doing very well and is happy now.

448
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,310
What makes you think

449
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,790
she would take you back?

450
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,110
What do you mean?

451
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,570
Does she have a new boyfriend now?

452
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
It's none of your business.

453
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,000
Where did this Southeast Asian-style set meal come from?

454
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,550
You're the Food & Beverage manager.

455
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,550

00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,880
the most basic service standards?

457
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,120
You actually threatened customers with food safety.

458
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,670
I'm sorry, General Manager.

459
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,920
Please deduct my bonus.

460
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,900
Of course I will deduct it.

461
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,480
There will also be a public criticism tomorrow.

462
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,400
I'm sorry, General Manager.

463
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,960
Alright, alright. Get back to work now.

464
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,090

Come on, please solve this!

You go!

469
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,080
Am I the general manager? Go.

470
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,160
You go first!

471
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,350
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

472
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,360
Mr. Yan. Well...

473
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,070
Why don't you go back to the villa and rest for a while?

474
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,150
I'll definitely...

I can take the company bus.

495

That Mr. Yan

503
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,630
is Manager Shen's boyfriend, right?

504

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,290
Being your boyfriend is too tiring.

511
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,870
You don't care about me at all.

512
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,510
You only care about yourself.

513
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,370
You're too selfish.

514
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,520
I just love you too much.

515
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,150
That's why I didn't realize you've always been this selfish.

516
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,080
Xifan,

517
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,520
I've been thinking for a long time.

518
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,950
We should break up.

519
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,170
Xifan,

520
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,240
let's get back together.

521
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,150
Get back together?

522
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,510
I was really too busy last year.

523
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,920
The company's self-developed robot

524
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,760
needed to apply for patents,

525
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
go public, and compete for awards.

526
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,110
I also had to deal with Zhongyu's acquisition

527
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:28,990
and handle my father.

528
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,970
During that time, I was really stretched thin, I didn't...

529
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,150
After I finished all that and came to my senses,

530
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,110
I really regretted it.

531
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,960
I shouldn't have lost my temper at you.

532
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,510
I shouldn't have argued with you.

533
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,800
We didn't just argue.

534
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,000
We broke up, okay?

535
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,460
Our seven years of love,

536
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,380
how could we just break up like this?

537
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:48,960
Xifan, listen to me.

538
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,920
Don't touch me.

539
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,480
Go away.

540
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,740
It's okay.

541
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,200
We're all here.

542
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,490
What did he tell you?

543
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,970
He's not trying to get back together with you, is he?

544
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,980
He came to see me today.

545
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,800
He said

546
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,070
he was too busy with work before,

547
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,440
so he neglected me.

548
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,830
He said he really regrets it now.

549
00:39:58,990 --> 00:39:59,990
Tell me,

550
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,510
what am I

551
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,740
to him after all?

552
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,400
I actually thought of so many things before,

553
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,710
things I wanted to say to scold him.

554
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,620
I thought about it day and night.

555
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,880
but when he stood in front of me,

556
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,630
I couldn't remember a single word.

between Manager Shen and the customer?

564
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,440
What is it?

565
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,590
Let me tell you,

566
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,320
it's about that Mr. Yan, Yan Heng.

567
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,030
You mean him?

568
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,670
If I were her,

569
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,440
I'd marry into a rich family

570
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,070
and become a wealthy wife instead of coming to work.

571
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,590
Yeah. That Mr. Yan

When working in a hotel,

00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,780
one should maintain a professional attitude

Manager Shen,

591
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,840
you need to quickly resolve

If you work night shifts,
