1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,280
I'm dropping Meena off for work.

2
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,960
Everyone had to go through fierce
competition to earn their place here.

3
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,000
Do you really think
they'll accept a nepotism hire like you?

4
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,440
So, are you really sponsoring me?

5
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,840
But I have one condition.

6
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,480
<i>You went through all that trouble</i>
<i>to help her mom escape,</i>

7
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,800
yet that ungrateful woman
is out with another man anyway.

8
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,560
<i>I don't like it</i>
<i>when you're with that suit owner.</i>

9
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,440
- Dylan is my friend.
- But I'm your fiancé.

10
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,160
Just do what you used to do
when you were your grandpa's lapdog!

11
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,520
I'm a person, not anyone's lapdog.

12
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,320
Even if the will names him,

13
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,480
if I get to it first,
do you think it'll stay that way?

14
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,320
You're truly despicable.

15
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,960
<i>Without you, H Group wouldn't survive.</i>

16
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,240
<i>Because there are enemies out there</i>
<i>waiting to take us down.</i>

17
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,320
They'll crush us and seize the opportunity
to expand their own empire.

18
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,240
My offer will be far more satisfying.

19
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,880
That depends on what you have to offer.

20
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,800
- Meena…
- Do you have anything else to instruct me?

21
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,440
Meena…

22
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,320
- About what you said earlier--
- You don't need to explain anything to me.

23
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,800
I'm only here because
I'm borrowing your name to survive.

24
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,400
Who am I to offer help?
I shouldn't be a burden to you anyway.

25
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
Aunt Bua said you didn't have dinner
because you were waiting for me, right?

26
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,240
Eat this first.

27
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,800
Bua Loy with ginger syrup?

28
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,800
It's all that was left in the fridge.
Do you want something else? I'll order it.

29
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,280
No need. Skipping one meal
won't kill me or trouble your house.

30
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,840
Anything else?
If not, I'm going to take a shower.

31
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,720
It's very dangerous.

32
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,120
What?

33
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,200
Everything I do,

34
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,960
everything I'm involved in,

35
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,520
it's really dangerous.

36
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,040
That's why. It's not that I don't
understand or don't want your help.

37
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,600
That's all.

38
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,400
Took you long enough.

39
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,520
If you'd just apologized,
it would've been over.

40
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,960
"I'm sorry."
Do you even know how to say it?

41
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,120
I don't like talking.

42
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,320
I like doing.

43
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,720
Sorry.

44
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,000
Monmeena, I'm sorry.

45
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
Monmeena.

46
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,240
I'm sor--

47
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,240
THAILAND

48
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,920
Hello?

49
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,240
Hello, Chairman Wang.

50
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,480
Negotiation? What negotiation?

51
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,760
Mr. Yai is gathering everyone. I hope
it's not another shocking announcement.

52
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,280
Maybe someone else is dead.

53
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
Brother, watch your mouth.

54
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,000
Haven't you noticed? Every time we gather,
it's either drama or someone dies.

55
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,040
Honestly, there was no need to call me
and Mote. You could've just sent an email.

56
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,400
I don't want to miss work at the hospital.

57
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,080
Sorry for disturbing everyone's schedules.

58
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,559
But since we have a very special guest,

59
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,720
I wanted all of us to be here.

60
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,360
A special guest?

61
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,680
Chairman Wang.

62
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,520
Hello, everyone.

63
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,400
Hello,

64
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,680
Mr. Pramet.

65
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,920
Wang!

66
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,280
Chairman Wang Zhong.

67
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,960
So, Yai, you're really
partnering with JW Group?

68
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,600
The food is ready.
Should I bring it in now?

69
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,200
No need!

70
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,520
What partnership?

71
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
What's this "important person" nonsense?

72
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,440
- Excuse me.
- What the hell?

73
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,760
No need.

74
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,400
Get lost, Wang.

75
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,200
You don't see you're being used, Yai?

76
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,800
He's not here for business.

77
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,160
He just wants to mess with me.

78
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,960
You two have history?

79
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,480
I'm sorry. It just slipped out.
I didn't mean to ask that.

80
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,560
You already said it.
No need to apologize now.

81
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,240
Everyone knows.

82
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,160
Chairman Wang just wants to share a meal
and get to know everyone.

83
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,400
Why are we doing business with him?

84
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,440
Mr. Yai, why didn't you consult the family

85
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,400
before deciding to partner
with an outsider?

86
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,680
If I'm doing something
that benefits the family,

87
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,200
I don't need to ask for permission.

88
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,560
Benefits the family? Or just you?

89
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,360
- Aunt Bua.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,560
- Serve the food.
- Yes, Mr. Yai.

91
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,800
No!

92
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,000
No one wants to get to know you, Wang.

93
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,720
But I want everyone to know.

94
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,160
Please, have a seat.

95
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,480
I'll tell you everything.

96
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,120
PHUKET
33 YEARS AGO

97
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,840
What? A hundred million units per month?

98
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,920
Is that even possible?

99
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,160
Of course!

100
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,520
You know how my father's
real estate business is expanding.

101
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,760
Those tiny bolts are essential.
We need them constantly.

102
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,320
So, I pitched your factory to my father.

103
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,280
Are you sure, Met? You know this factory
is my own investment, not my father's.

104
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,160
Come on, Wang.

105
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,640
I still don't get it.

106
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,840
Almost every business in Phuket
has your father's hand in it,

107
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,280
yet you're using your own money
to build this factory?

108
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
I just want to be with the woman I love.

109
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,720
The woman you love
but your father doesn't?

110
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,040
Is she poor?

111
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,800
She…

112
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,120
Let's just say no one can know about us.
That's all you need to know.

113
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,880
Is she a movie star or something?
Why so secretive?

114
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,080
Never mind. What matters is that

115
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,360
if I can stand on my own two feet,

116
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,160
I can live my own life
without my father interfering.

117
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,520
Then take my father's deal.

118
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,720
Your dream will come true.

119
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
My factory is just starting out.

120
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,520
Our production capacity isn't there yet.

121
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,520
Then expand. Buy more machines.

122
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,280
That requires a hundred million.

123
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,440
I don't have that much money yet.

124
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,200
Then take out a loan from the bank.

125
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,400
Wang, if you want to make it big,
you need to take risks.

126
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,960
If you keep hesitating,
when will you ever be successful?

127
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,200
When will you get to be
with the woman you love? Trust me.

128
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,240
Take my father's deal,
and you'll be golden.

129
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,880
Alright. Let's do it.

130
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,560
- That's the spirit!
- Let's do it.

131
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,400
Let's celebrate, my friend.

132
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,840
- Let's go.
- I'm in.

133
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,240
Yeah!

134
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,440
To the one you love.

135
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,000
Here it is.

136
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,360
MR. WANG JONGTRAIPATTANA
HAS TAKEN OUT A LOAN OF 116,000,000 BAHT

137
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,120
SIGNATURE OF THE BORROWER

138
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,080
Cancel the order?

139
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,400
Yeah, my father ordered me
to terminate the contract for your bolts.

140
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,960
Your factory's products
failed to meet our quality standards.

141
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,000
But every batch passed the QC
under the specifications you set.

142
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,520
How is this my fault?

143
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,720
My job was just
to deliver the message. That's all.

144
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,600
Met!

145
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,880
You can't do this to me.

146
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,800
You're the one who convinced me to invest.
I've only just delivered two shipments.

147
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,720
If the contract is canceled now,
how can my factory survive?

148
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,880
That's your problem, not mine.

149
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,960
If you want to challenge this,
go ahead and sue us.

150
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,040
You're annoying.

151
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,400
Based on our investigation,
our factory wasn't blacklisted

152
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,480
due to quality issues.

153
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,120
Instead, the new factory replacing us

154
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,320
paid a hefty under-the-table fee

155
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,600
to Mr. Pramet to convince Mr. Preeda.

156
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,280
Damn it.

157
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,320
Damn it!

158
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,000
‪You…

159
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,480
You betrayed me.

160
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,320
You betrayed me for money.

161
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,440
Met!

162
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,320
Damn it!

163
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,760
You betrayed your own friend, Mr. Met?

164
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,840
It was just a little business maneuver.

165
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,960
The guy wasn't sharp enough.
You can't blame someone smarter.

166
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,960
If Dad knew that everything you did
was just to line your own pockets,

167
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,360
he'd regret
pushing his eldest son so hard.

168
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,480
- Shut your mouth, Mote.
- I said this because it's been ages.

169
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,840
That hellish period is long gone.

170
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,880
But since we're discussing
working together,

171
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,800
I just wanted to share

172
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,480
what it feels like
to be betrayed by someone you trust.

173
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,640
I simply don't want any of you
to go through what I did.

174
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,560
Do the board members know about this?

175
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,920
What do you mean
by shaking your head, Nuanchan?

176
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,000
Because if this gets out,

177
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,240
H Group's credibility will collapse.

178
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,840
That means the hospital business
Mote built up will suffer as well.

179
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,480
You're all just looking out
for your own businesses.

180
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,720
Maybe you should look out for yours, too.

181
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,640
And the family's business.
Dad's business as well.

182
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,200
Exactly.

183
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,160
All of us have worked tirelessly.
Even Parin is giving his best effort.

184
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,000
If everything falls apart
because of your actions,

185
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,680
wouldn't that be a disgrace?

186
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,720
Damn it.

187
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,200
You're just lucky
you're only the eldest son.

188
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,000
So what?

189
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
You regret not being the eldest?

190
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,800
If you were, you'd have already
taken my place, right?

191
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,720
- You've always been jealous of me, right?
- Brother!

192
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,960
I have never been jealous of you.

193
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,560
If you want it, just say it.
Stop pretending you don't.

194
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,000
If Mote were in your position,
he'd be doing a much better job.

195
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,480
No need to argue.

196
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,720
The one who'll take the position
and do well at the job

197
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,600
is Parin, my son.

198
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,600
Maybe he should stop clinging to his mommy
before thinking about taking the throne.

199
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,040
- Mr. Met!
- Why?

200
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,040
Hey.

201
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,520
Ms. Pa!

202
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,880
I'm drenched now.

203
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,880
I wasn't aiming at you. Blame Mr. Yai.

204
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,560
You bitch!

205
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,520
I did it for you.

206
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,680
Damn it!

207
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,360
Pa!

208
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
I think we should stop fighting
over someone else's past

209
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,200
and focus on solving our current problems.

210
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,200
I always keep my promises

211
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,320
to those who treat me well, Mekhin.

212
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,320
I am handing over the land you need
for your cocktail lounge

213
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,960
exclusively to Mr. Mekhin.

214
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,880
What Mr. Mekhin wants to do with it
is his decision.

215
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,800
Thank you all for your warm hospitality.

216
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,920
Next time, if I have a chance,

217
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,920
I'll visit again.

218
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,200
I knew it.

219
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,040
You didn't just come here for dinner.

220
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,960
You wanted to sow doubt
among people in this family.

221
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,400
You're overthinking.

222
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,400
I just wanted
to get to know everyone better.

223
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,200
And I do now.

224
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,960
What do you really want?

225
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,600
I'm sure what you want
is bigger than this.

226
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,240
What's your real goal?

227
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,520
We had an agreement, didn't we?
You weren't supposed to work with Yai.

228
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,280
If you wanted to sell the land,

229
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,160
- you should have contacted me, not him.
- Everything we agreed upon

230
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,000
remains unchanged.

231
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,440
How can you say that?
You've just handed Yai all the credit.

232
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,000
Do you still remember what we discussed?

233
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,920
If you sell the land to me instead of Yai,

234
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,400
I'll make you
a business partner in the project

235
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
- and share the profits.
- Hold on.

236
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,040
Are you in a position to make decisions?

237
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,840
I usually don't negotiate
with people who don't have the final say.

238
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,320
Sooner or later,
I will be the real chairman of H Group.

239
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,560
It will never be Yai,

240
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,280
and it won't be Uncle Met,
the man you despise so much.

241
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,400
You've done your research.

242
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,680
But actually,

243
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,360
there's no need to talk business.

244
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,880
If you truly want to become
the chairman of H Group,

245
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,880
I'll support you.

246
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,120
Does that mean
you'll sell the land to me before Yai?

247
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,880
You're still
as impatient as ever, Mr. Parin.

248
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,240
And why shouldn't I be?

249
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,480
Because you seem like
you're going to do what you said.

250
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,520
Have you ever gone fishing, Mr. Parin?

251
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,440
- Why would I go fishing?
- To learn the art of patience.

252
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,720
Because the best rewards

253
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,880
come to those who know how to wait.

254
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,320
Don't worry.

255
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,040
Our goals remain the same.

256
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,800
No matter what happens,

257
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,320
I will never let Mekhin
become the chairman of H Group.

258
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,680
How did this happen?

259
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,160
- Why didn't you stop it?
- How would I know?

260
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,840
We found out at the same time.
I'm the one who should ask you.

261
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,160
Don't our family and Chairman Wang's
family hate each other?

262
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
How could Mekhin
change Chairman Wang's mind?

263
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,400
What did Parin even do? He spends
all his time following his mother around.

264
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,320
And you, lower your voice.
You're giving me a headache!

265
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,400
If you're so capable,
why don't you take Yai down yourself?

266
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,320
Why are you using Parin?

267
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,720
The truth is, you'd love to scream
just like me, wouldn't you?

268
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,880
What's your next move?

269
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,400
If things continue like this,
the board will fully back Met.

270
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,160
- We need to act fast.
- We?

271
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,160
When have you even done anything?

272
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,440
Talking won't get things done.

273
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,240
Then what do you want me to do?
Shoot Yai myself?

274
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Don't let what your father said be true,
that you can't think for yourself.

275
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,920
Now, even the Honest Heart Foundation,
the one your wife and Tri run,

276
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,400
Yai already
sent his fiancée in to work there.

277
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,400
Why are you so shocked?

278
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,960
Nothing.

279
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,760
Has Nuan not told you anything?

280
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,920
I didn't ask her.

281
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,040
Otherwise, she would have told me.

282
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,760
Maybe you should start asking questions.
If you keep waiting for things,

283
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,760
even the hospital
and foundation you oversee

284
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,800
might slip through your fingers.

285
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,200
With JW Group agreeing to sell
the land to H Group for this project,

286
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,960
is there a chance
for future business collaboration?

287
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,920
That will never happen.

288
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Our company
has always been a market leader.

289
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,480
We have no policy
of forming joint ventures,

290
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,600
especially not with JW Group.
We don't even see them as competitors.

291
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,320
We're simply giving them a foothold
in the industry out of generosity.

292
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,040
There's breaking news.

293
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,920
CHAIRMAN P. BEATS HIS MISTRESS

294
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,640
CHAIRMAN P. BEATS HIS MISTRESS

295
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,080
- Is it Mr. Pramet?
- Is it?

296
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,200
What's going on?

297
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,320
Mr. Pramet, there's breaking news.

298
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,280
Chairman P. beats his mistress.
Is that you?

299
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,320
When did you remarry?

300
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,800
- Are you the man in the video?
- Are you?

301
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,480
- Is it you, Mr. Pramet? Please answer.
- Is it?

302
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,040
Mr. Pramet, please answer.

303
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,440
Shit!

304
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,240
Are you the man in the video?

305
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,400
Is it you, sir?

306
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,320
- Mr. Pramet?
- Please answer.

307
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,680
Please say something, Mr. Pramet.

308
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,320
- Should I ask them to leave?
- No need.

309
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,200
Just wait. I'd like to know who did this.

310
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,320
Mr. Pramet, do you really have a mistress?

311
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,920
Is this secrecy
related to domestic violence?

312
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,400
I have never used violence.
And she's not a mistress.

313
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,920
She's my legal wife.
I didn't announce it to the public

314
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,440
because it's a private matter.

315
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,280
Will you formally introduce your wife
to clear up the rumors?

316
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,720
What's wrong with you? Get them out.

317
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,200
At the upcoming charity event
for the Honest Heart Foundation.

318
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,400
What?

319
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,280
‪What is it?

320
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,000
Father simply prefers
to keep his personal life private.

321
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,240
But since the public is interested,

322
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,200
he will introduce his wife
at the foundation's event.

323
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,400
That way, there will be
no further misunderstandings.

324
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,000
What?

325
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,920
Isn't it good, Father?

326
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,080
- What are you--
- At the charity event

327
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,680
of Honest Heart,

328
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,000
as the director of the hospital

329
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,000
and a member of the Hemaratsiri family,

330
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,720
I assure you

331
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,080
that everyone will meet Met's wife.

332
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,800
Not bad.

333
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,600
You cornered Pramet so he couldn't refuse.

334
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,960
I just did what I could.

335
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,480
You know how much I worry about my mother.

336
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,680
If it wasn't in front of the reporters,
do you think he would have agreed?

337
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,320
You did well.

338
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,480
Just as expected from my fiancée.

339
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,080
Mr. Yai, do you really think
Mr. Pramet will do what Mr. Mote said?

340
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,600
If he wants to salvage his image,
he'll have to bring your mom to the event.

341
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,640
We might have a chance
to get your mother out.

342
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,800
You mean it?

343
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,000
I'll find a way.
You just need to be ready.

344
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,960
What do I need to do?

345
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,960
I'll tell you later.
It wouldn't be fun otherwise.

346
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,880
Why the hell did you interfere, Mote?

347
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,720
And why the hell did you go along
with that low-class in-law's game?

348
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,280
You've made everything more complicated.

349
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,600
If I hadn't stepped in, you'd have
been torn apart by the press by now.

350
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,560
Or would you rather let the world know
that someone in the Hemeratsiri family

351
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,000
is not normal?

352
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,120
That there's a sadist here!

353
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,360
Stop it right now! Just stop!
What are you doing?

354
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,240
Selling fish balls, obviously!

355
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,920
Your husband is meddling
in my damn business!

356
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,040
So, you're going to assault your brother
and make another headline?

357
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,600
Why?

358
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,400
Are you worried people
won't believe the abuse allegations?

359
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,920
I didn't use violence! I didn't do it!

360
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,440
Words are easy to say.

361
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,880
But once people believe something,
it's hard to change their minds.

362
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,680
If you really want this to die down,
taking Ms. Nate to the charity event

363
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,080
is your best option.

364
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,480
Let's go, Mote.

365
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,840
I've already spread the news
across every media outlet.

366
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,560
Ms. Monmeena knows how to turn the tables.
I bet you trained her well.

367
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,320
Trained what?

368
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,800
Even without me, she's always been sharp.

369
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,280
Right. Just as expected
from your future wife.

370
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,120
Yai!

371
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,200
You and your damn wife
spread the news, didn't you?

372
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,240
- I didn't do it.
- Oh yeah?

373
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,920
Then how the hell did the reporters
ask me about Nate?

374
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,680
How did the surveillance clip leak?

375
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,920
You didn't worry when you did it.
Now you start thinking when it blows up?

376
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,040
Do you think
I'm your only enemy in the family?

377
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,520
Damn it!

378
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,080
It was you, wasn't it?
You sent that video to the reporters.

379
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,440
What video? I don't know.

380
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,000
- Who else did you send it to?
- I don't know anything.

381
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,360
I don't know…

382
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,960
- How could you not know?
- I don't know…

383
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,360
You're coming with me
to the charity event.

384
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,760
If you pull any stunts
or make anyone suspicious,

385
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,520
I will kill you.

386
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,760
And your daughter, too.

387
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,679
Don't hurt my daughter!

388
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,920
Don't hurt my daughter…

389
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,679
<i>Let me go!</i>

390
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,800
That turned out better than we expected.

391
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,360
But why didn't you send the footage
to my friend to publish?

392
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,240
It would've blown up even more.

393
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,400
This is enough.

394
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,600
We barely had to lift a finger.

395
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,200
Let Met rot in his own filth.

396
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,400
Since we've had such a good day,

397
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,920
why don't we celebrate tonight?

398
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,280
Later tonight.

399
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,480
I have dinner
with the Permanent Secretary.

400
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,080
You know I always wait for you.

401
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,600
Please come home early.

402
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,440
- What are you looking at?
- The floor.

403
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,920
Just checking if there's a hole in it.

404
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,240
I'm not heavy enough
to wear down your floors!

405
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,440
Really?

406
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,480
Let's test it.

407
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,480
Not heavy at all.

408
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,360
You're just looking
for an excuse to touch me!

409
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,520
What? I'm just someone
who doesn't believe things easily.

410
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,840
Such a smooth talker.

411
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,640
Chamomile tea.

412
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,160
Careful, it's hot.

413
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,920
I know you're worried about your mother,

414
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,840
but Pramet won't kill her.

415
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,520
Drink this. You'll feel better.

416
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,400
Better?

417
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,080
I don't think it's the tea

418
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,320
that's making me feel better.

419
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,400
Then what is?

420
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,440
Not used to seeing me smile?

421
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,480
You've taken advantage of me
so many times already. Not a gentleman.

422
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,120
Hey!

423
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,920
Mr. Yai.

424
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,800
After the press conference, Mr. Met went
straight home. He didn't stop anywhere.

425
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,800
He should be with my mother,
preparing for the event.

426
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,880
- Why would he--
- He's too calm.

427
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,480
That's out of character. Usually,
he charges headfirst into problems.

428
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,880
Nate might be closer than we thought.

429
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,800
You know where she is?

430
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,160
Mr. Yai.

431
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,640
- Let me come with you.
- I'll check it myself.

432
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,480
If you come, you'll mess everything up.

433
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,080
Wait here.

434
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,400
Who's the porridge for, Aunt Porn?

435
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,560
Dad never eats porridge for dinner.

436
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,840
Yai…

437
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,880
What the hell are you doing here?

438
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,360
I asked you. Why are you here?

439
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,560
Hey, Yai.

440
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,760
It's here, isn't it?

441
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:45,160
Just answer me, damn it!
What the hell do you want?

442
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,560
It's that damn Monmeena, isn't it?

443
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,560
She asked you to come, didn't she?

444
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,920
Does she think I'll let her mother go?

445
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,320
No…

446
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,640
If Meena sees me like this,

447
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,840
it'll be a disaster.

448
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,000
Even if she gets on her knees
and begs me, I won't let her mother go!

449
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,120
This has nothing to do with Meena.
I was just suspicious.

450
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,240
- Suspicious of what?
- Suspicious of why a poor, powerless woman

451
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,240
can make you lose
your damn mind like this.

452
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,000
And what the hell does Meena have
that makes you have problems with me?

453
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,040
When Mei was alive, you and your mother
never gave a damn about Nate.

454
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,080
- Whether she lived or died.
- Because I love Monmeena.

455
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,440
And I will never let anyone hurt her.

456
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,120
Love doesn't exist.

457
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,280
Even families aren't real.

458
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,280
You were born for one purpose.

459
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,400
To be a tool for your father,

460
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,960
without a say in anything!

461
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,400
Damn it.

462
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,080
Like you? Married my mother out of fear
of losing your inheritance from Grandpa?

463
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,240
I think Grandpa considered making
you chairman, despite your incompetence…

464
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,080
Because I am the eldest son!

465
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,920
- Because you're obedient.
- I'm not obedient!

466
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,400
If I were, I wouldn't have
brought Nate into this house!

467
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,440
Because Nate is your trophy.
The one victory you have

468
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,800
over Grandpa.
That's why you won't let her go.

469
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,680
How pathetic.

470
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,640
Get the hell out of my room.

471
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,960
If you don't, I'll break Nate's bones!

472
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,840
Then I'll break yours in return.

473
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,360
Whatever pain you inflict on Nate,
you'll suffer it too.

474
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,360
You'd really harm your own father?

475
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,360
Have you ever acted like a father to me?

476
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,040
Yai…

477
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,280
You love that bitch Monmeena so much?

478
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,040
Fine.

479
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,440
I'll handle it.

480
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,120
<i>Are you coming back soon?</i>

481
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,520
<i>Still at a dinner party. It'll be a while.</i>

482
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,720
‪MR. MOTE

483
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,560
<i>I'll be waiting. You owe me tonight.</i>

484
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,000
How fussy.

485
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,680
‪YOU OWE ME TONIGHT

486
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,000
PEEP INN HOTEL

487
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,760
A dinner party, huh?

488
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,960
Mr. Yai, did you find my mother?

489
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,560
But judging from Pramet's reaction,
Nate is definitely there.

490
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,240
- I have to go save my mother.
- Hey.

491
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,440
Pramet won't dare do anything to her now.
I warned him already.

492
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,840
Both of you, before the charity event,

493
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,240
keep a close watch on Pramet,
inside and outside the house.

494
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,920
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

495
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,000
Wait. What exactly did you say to him?

496
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,440
How can you be so sure
he won't hurt my mother again?

497
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,600
<i>Because I love Monmeena.</i>

498
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,640
<i>And I will never let anyone hurt her.</i>

499
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,400
So, what did you say to him?

500
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,040
It doesn't matter.

501
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,240
- Just know that Pramet won't do it
- But--

502
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,800
If you provoke him, he'll only
tighten his grip on your mother.

503
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,680
But if we make him believe

504
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,280
we aren't fighting back,

505
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:23,040
on the day of the charity event,
Nate will finally be free from him.

506
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,280
You really will save my mother, won't you?

507
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,920
Meena,

508
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,080
you need to be patient.

509
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,080
Can you wait?

510
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,960
Don't stress too much.

511
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,800
No matter what, I will save your mother.

512
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,280
Why did Mr. Pramet
suddenly invite me to this meal?

513
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,360
Or he wants to negotiate about my mother?

514
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,800
The dining table in this house
has never been a place for peace.

515
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,040
Met asked me to come home.
Cover for me at the meeting.

516
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,320
Yai.

517
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,400
Your house is turning into a guesthouse.
What's he up to?

518
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,840
Yai.

519
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,200
Come see the artwork
for the charity auction.

520
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,960
Here it is.

521
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,840
Beautiful, right?

522
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,720
This photo was taken
by someone special to you.

523
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,200
- Someone special?
- Yes.

524
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,000
Who is it?

525
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,040
Someone way out of your league.

526
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,400
Today's family gathering

527
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,640
is for a special meal.

528
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,880
Good afternoon, Minister Noppachai.

529
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,360
You're looking much better.

530
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,880
Yes, thanks to your excellent care during
my last hospitalization, Dr. Pramote.

531
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,120
Don't forget to come
for your annual check-up.

532
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,520
- I'll prepare everything for you.
- Thank you.

533
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,640
Good afternoon, Minister.

534
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,040
Still just a deputy minister.

535
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,120
No promotion yet.

536
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,400
Let's be precise. Wouldn't want
people getting the wrong idea.

537
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,360
I'm just getting a head start. Next time,
you'll be leading the ministry for sure.

538
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,400
Mekhin…

539
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,240
Even after ten years,
this piece still feels timeless.

540
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,200
It's the same photograph you won
a competition with back in university.

541
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,840
You remember?

542
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,000
Come here.

543
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,680
This is Arisa,

544
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,440
Minister Noppachai's daughter.

545
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,400
You should get to know her because…

546
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,120
she's about to become Mekhin's fiancée.

547
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,960
Hold on.

548
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,800
That was an old plan
when Chairman Preeda was still alive.

549
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,080
But he's gone now.

550
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,840
Besides, Mekhin is already engaged
to this young lady, isn't he?

551
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,640
That's right.

552
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,920
Monmeena is my fiancée.

553
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,960
Nice to meet you, Ms. Monmeena.

554
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,680
I suppose I just
let my personal thoughts slip.

555
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,280
I've always believed the woman

556
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,800
who stands beside Mekhin

557
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,760
should elevate him, not drag him down.

558
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,520
Don't you have any manners? He's a senior.

559
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,680
Good afternoon, Minister Noppachai.

560
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,840
Nice to meet you, Ms. Arisa.

561
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,800
I must apologize, sir.

562
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,000
Meena and I deeply respect you,

563
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,560
but she hasn't had
the opportunity to meet you before.

564
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,720
And we didn't know you'd be joining us.
We weren't informed.

565
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,040
Father,

566
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,400
perhaps it would be best
to reprimand the liaison

567
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,320
for their oversight.

568
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,480
Yai.

569
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,920
No need for that.

570
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,760
We're all family here.
It's just a casual gathering.

571
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,720
This was actually my fault.

572
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,160
I rushed to arrange today's meeting since
I needed urgent assistance from Father.

573
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,680
How careless can you be?

574
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,200
Reckless!

575
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,240
I wanted a picture from a politically
influential figure, so I asked my father.

576
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:15,960
Tri was looking for a celebrity
photographer with artistic talent,

577
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,120
and I immediately
thought of a professional like Arisa.

578
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,800
I wouldn't call myself a professional.

579
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,280
I just enjoy photography.

580
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:29,160
But if you believe
my work can contribute, I'd be honored.

581
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,080
It'll be a huge asset. A photograph
from an up-and-coming designer,

582
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,280
I'm sure the auction will attract
plenty of bidders. You're beautiful,

583
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,440
from a prestigious family,
and everything you touch is elegant.

584
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,880
Arisa should have been
the eldest daughter-in-law.

585
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,640
When I learned about the agreement between
Dad and Minister Noppachai, I was thrilled

586
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,040
to have a refined and accomplished in-law
as the face of our family.

587
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,520
Unfortunately…

588
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,320
I'm fine.

589
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,920
Mekhin is a smart man. I trust he knows

590
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,920
how to choose
a life partner worthy of him.

591
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,800
And who are your parents, Meena?

592
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,120
My last name is Areerat.

593
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,800
My mother runs a mango sticky rice stall.

594
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,960
- I have a degree in accounting--
- She is a good singer.

595
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,600
- Really?
- Are you an artist?

596
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,880
Or a vocal coach?

597
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,640
I…

598
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,400
She used to sing at the nightclub.

599
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,520
She sings in a lot of places at night.
That's how she met Yai.

600
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,920
I heard you had quite the fanbase, too.
Not sure if they were just fans

601
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,760
or offering overnight service.

602
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,240
Come on, Mote.
You can't say that. It's not nice.

603
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,640
Yai loves Meena.

604
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,280
How many men she's been with
doesn't matter anymore, right?

605
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,600
My nephew

606
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,720
is so generous, sir.
He accepts everything.

607
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:29,040
They're baiting you.
Don't fall for it. Trust me.

608
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,920
Mom.

609
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,440
Why do Uncle Mote and Uncle Met
seem unusually in sync today?

610
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,200
It's like they planned
to humiliate Meena together.

611
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,640
Nate is Monmeena's mother?

612
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,280
- No wonder…
- What?

613
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,080
Nothing.

614
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,680
Do you want me to humiliate Monmeena
in front of Minister Nopachai, Father?

615
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,080
I just want her to realize
that someone of her status

616
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,840
doesn't deserve to be a part
of the Hemaratsiri family.

617
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,120
- And to see what her fate will be.
- That she'll be a mistress like her mom?

618
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,080
I want Yai to marry Arisa.

619
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,200
To protect your business with him?

620
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,640
I'll give you 20%

621
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,760
of the cocktail lounge's
total profit every month.

622
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,960
Interested?

623
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,800
You can probably imagine
how much money that would bring in.

624
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,160
Maybe enough
to expand your VIP hospital project.

625
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,240
- Forty percent.
- I'll give you 30.

626
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,120
Deal.

627
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,800
- Should we draft an MOU?
- Write it up yourself.

628
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,120
Yai will be furious if I do this.

629
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,680
Yai is obsessed with that Monmeena girl.

630
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,520
If you let her become your sister-in-law,

631
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,120
you might as well
consider yourself a stray dog.

632
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,040
But Meena isn't someone
who backs down easily.

633
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,080
I just want her to see that
as long as she stands by Yai,

634
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,560
her life will be nothing short of hell.

635
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,200
I'll drag her through the mud
until she's left with nothing.

636
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,120
I think it's rather romantic, a love story
that defies class differences.

637
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,680
That's one way to look at it.

638
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,960
But I worry that people will see Monmeena
as a leech clinging to wealth.

639
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,760
That would be truly pitiful.

640
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,960
Mom, what are you saying?

641
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,680
- Just stating the truth.
- A leech is still better than a parasite.

642
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:10,400
Leeches latch on, feed,
and eventually let go. But parasites?

643
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,440
They burrow in, cling to the host,
and claim to be part of the family.

644
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,400
Those kinds of freeloaders
are far more disgusting.

645
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,360
Who are you calling a parasite?

646
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,080
You aren't a leech or a parasite, right?

647
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,160
Then why take offense?

648
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:48,640
Congratulations, Minister Nopachai, on
securing another term as Deputy Minister.

649
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,280
And thank you, Arisa,
for supporting my mother's foundation.

650
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,920
If you'll excuse me,
I have to return to work.

651
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,160
Lately, I've been dealing
with too many parasites.

652
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,720
I have to work hard,
or they'll suck me dry.

653
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,760
I already feel parched
just thinking about it.

654
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,320
Excuse me.

655
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,720
<i>Congratulations to you.</i>

656
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,640
But my condolences to Monmeena.

657
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,000
I can still throw a punch here.

658
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:35,120
I found out Mr. Met hired a bodyguard
to keep a close watch at tomorrow's event.

659
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,480
<i>I don't know if we'll see each other again</i>

660
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,800
after helping your mother escape.

661
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,120
It all depends on how much
your plan impresses me.

662
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,320
Don't make Pramet suspicious,
or we'll lose our chance.

663
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,840
- Where do you think you're going?
- If you don't let me go, I'll expose you.

664
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,120
- <i>Chairman Wang!</i>
- Wang!

665
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,840
If you try to do anything,
your daughter will pay the price.

666
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,360
She was my first and last love.

667
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,840
I wish you could see her.

668
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,320
Who took Nate?!

669
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,720
- Hey!
- Hey?

670
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,760
Kill Ou and bring me
Meena and Pramet's wife.

671
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,240
Hey!

672
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,240
