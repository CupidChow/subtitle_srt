1
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,600
Wang? What the hell are you doing here?

2
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,800
For an inspection

3
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,000
as one of H Group's shareholders.

4
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,520
I'll get more shares,

5
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,040
enough to make H Group mine alone.

6
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,320
Let him go and tell me where Tri is.

7
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,360
<i>Then I'd rather be an ungrateful son</i>

8
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,960
<i>than your excuse to commit more crimes.</i>

9
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,120
Let's not see each other again, Mom.

10
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,480
His descendants

11
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,920
are willing to kill each other anytime,
just to get what they want.

12
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,080
Mote!

13
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,920
- Die!
- Watch out, Mr. Yai!

14
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,000
- Meena!
- No, no, no.

15
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,280
If you can't make her happy,

16
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,160
then let her be with someone
who's ready to take care of her.

17
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,840
<i>You're three months pregnant.</i>

18
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,520
Your power really does keep you
from missing anything, doesn't it?

19
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,680
If you're calling
to cancel my wedding to Dylan--

20
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,480
You need to marry Dylan as planned,

21
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,840
and move to Chiang Rai like you wanted.

22
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,640
You're making me marry him,

23
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,840
even though you know
the baby is Mr. Yai's?

24
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,880
You're asking me to lie to your own son.

25
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,520
Dylan loves you.

26
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,840
If you marry him,

27
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,440
he'll accept the child without question.

28
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,280
But he's not the father.

29
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,920
How can I make him take responsibility?

30
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,920
Whoever the father is,

31
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,280
that child

32
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,560
carries Jong blood.

33
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,240
So, all you care about is the bloodline?

34
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,760
What about your son?

35
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,120
Have you ever once thought
about how he'd feel?

36
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,040
One day, everyone will know
who the child's real father is.

37
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,440
When that day comes, how will
Dylan and Mr. Yai face each other?

38
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,400
Why make everything so complicated?

39
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,880
You want to marry Mark, don't you?

40
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,680
Chairman Wang,

41
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,760
please consider Dylan's feelings too.

42
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,400
Soon,

43
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,280
Mark will become
the head of the Jong family.

44
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,080
He'll have countless responsibilities.

45
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,600
You and the baby
would only be a weakness for him

46
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,760
and for this family.

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,840
I won't let him be distracted.

48
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,360
This is madness! Stop doing insane things

49
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,120
just to preserve
your family's so-called legacy.

50
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,960
Marry Dylan.

51
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,360
Move to Chiang Rai.

52
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,600
<i>And take care of my bloodline.</i>

53
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,440
And if you tell Mark about this,

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
get ready to bury your parents.

55
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,120
You loved Mei, didn't you?

56
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
So much that you never
once saw me or my mother.

57
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
So, this is where you've been.

58
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,920
You leaked news that I'll be
the next head of the Jong family?

59
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
It's your duty.

60
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
The one who deserves
that position is Dylan.

61
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,760
He's been a part of this family
his entire life.

62
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,680
He's done everything
for you and for the family.

63
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,320
He should be the one to lead. Not me.

64
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,440
I've made my decision.

65
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,320
If you're choosing based on blood,

66
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,920
Dylan is the legitimate son

67
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,520
of your lawful wife.

68
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,640
Monmeena.

69
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,560
And what if that woman

70
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,160
is no longer in this world?

71
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,600
You can't do that!

72
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,080
Don't use her name to threaten me.

73
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,280
Are you sure…

74
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,560
you want her to spend her life

75
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,960
on the run forever?

76
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,600
Looks like…

77
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,320
the one who has a decision to make…

78
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,520
isn't me.

79
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,160
I'm not mad about the damn title.

80
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,120
You give your all
and still end up meaning nothing.

81
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,960
Just like with Chairman Preeda,

82
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,840
I gave everything

83
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,160
for Hemaratsiri.
I was willing to die for it.

84
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,840
But in the end, I was never chosen.

85
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,800
Just because I wasn't the right blood.

86
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,560
Stupid, isn't it?

87
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,080
Yeah. It's so damn stupid.

88
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,720
So, you're accepting the position
to protect Meena?

89
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,520
Do I have a choice?

90
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,720
And…

91
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sure…

92
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,360
you'll take good care of her.

93
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,280
Are you tired, Mei?

94
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,640
I am.

95
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
Then, come sit and take a break.

96
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,040
Wow.

97
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,720
Your painting is beautiful.

98
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,200
And this flower is gorgeous too.

99
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,920
I didn't think it would arrive
in time for your birthday.

100
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,680
Do you like it?

101
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,200
I love it.

102
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,040
But I love the giver even more.

103
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,200
If you like it,

104
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,800
I'll order them for you every year.

105
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,600
And I'll paint you like this every year.
How's that?

106
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,760
Then, when will we ever be able
to walk by the sea in public?

107
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,440
I'm tired of hiding,

108
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,120
painting imaginary oceans like this.

109
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,680
Soon, Mei.

110
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,040
Very soon.

111
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,480
I'll make sure
the two of us can be together,

112
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,080
and no one will ever
come between us again.

113
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,480
It's not just the two of us anymore.

114
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,240
Here…

115
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,720
Our third little someone.

116
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,400
You're pregnant?

117
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,680
I'm…

118
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm really going to have a child?

119
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm so happy, Mei.

120
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,480
If it's a boy,

121
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,680
he'll carry on the Jong family legacy.

122
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,640
He'll bring peace

123
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,840
between our families at last.

124
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,240
Do you think our child can really do that?

125
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,080
Of course.

126
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,880
He'll be even greater
than we ever were, Mei.

127
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,640
Yes.

128
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,600
He can do it.

129
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,920
Mei.

130
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,200
Our child can do it.

131
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,200
Thank you.

132
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,480
Alright.

133
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,200
Thank you.

134
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,160
How is it?

135
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,720
It's fragrant and creamy.

136
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,320
Oh, weren't you supposed to attend
the shareholders' meeting today?

137
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,640
No one really cares
whether I'm there or not.

138
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,680
There's one more treat
I bet you'll love. Just wait.

139
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
Auntie, can I have my noodle, please?

140
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,800
Thank you.

141
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,520
Don't tell me…

142
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,640
I had Auntie make it
with my secret recipe, just for you.

143
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Chef Dylan, huh?

144
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,520
Try it. Let's see
how Chef Dylan's recipe holds up.

145
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,040
Let's see.

146
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,200
Thank you.

147
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,120
Will you let me be your chef

148
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,440
for the rest of my life?

149
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,840
I'm pregnant.

150
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,600
With Yai's child?

151
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,240
Does he know?

152
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,640
Chairman Wang stopped me from telling him.

153
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,880
At first, he wanted me to marry you

154
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
and pretend the child was yours…

155
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,000
but I can't lie to you.

156
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,240
I know how much pain he's caused you.

157
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,560
I can't hurt you too.

158
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,120
- Hello.
- Congratulations.

159
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,080
Alright.

160
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,120
Thank you so much. Please have a seat…

161
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,920
Sir, Mr. Dylan sent a message
that he won't be attending.

162
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,960
And Mark?

163
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,200
I'm sorry I couldn't accept your feelings.

164
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,960
I'm sorry for hurting you.

165
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,120
I'm so sorry.

166
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,160
It's okay.

167
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,400
Just knowing you care
this much about my feelings

168
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,960
heals me more than enough.

169
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,240
Maybe I'm selfish…

170
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,720
but I still want you in my life.

171
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,640
You're the best friend I've ever had.

172
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,480
Come on.

173
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,320
If the mother is suffering,

174
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,080
the baby in the womb suffers too.

175
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,880
Smile.

176
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Come on.

177
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,560
So, why haven't you told this to Yai?

178
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,160
- I--
- Was it because my dad threatened you?

179
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,400
That might be part of it.

180
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,800
But I don't even know
why I haven't told him.

181
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Maybe I'm afraid of what might happen.

182
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,600
Maybe it won't turn out

183
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,360
the way I hope.

184
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,960
I didn't dare go against my dad either,

185
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,520
when I believed

186
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,240
I was the one who deserved
to be head of the family.

187
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,359
Why are we both like this?

188
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,960
Is this really for the best?

189
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,200
On the occasion

190
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,640
of the Jongtraipattana family's
100th anniversary,

191
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,520
today is the perfect opportunity

192
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,800
for everyone

193
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,040
to witness

194
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,880
the rise of the new head of the family,

195
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,960
Mark Jongtraipattana.

196
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,360
Mark.

197
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,800
Everyone's waiting to hear your vision.

198
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,600
I don't have a vision.

199
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,040
But I do have two questions.

200
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,440
First question.

201
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,680
Why me?

202
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,640
You already have Dylan. So, why me?

203
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,000
Because I'm the eldest son?

204
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,280
Is that all it takes for you
to accept someone as a leader?

205
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,160
Even if I were a total bastard
who's done nothing,

206
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,800
you'd still be okay with that?

207
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,880
Dylan's the one
who worked his ass off for all of you,

208
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,160
who brought JW to where it is today.
Is this really how you thank him?

209
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,800
- If you have nothing to say, sit--
- I'm not finished.

210
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,040
You're no different from the Hemaratsiris,

211
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,760
obsessed with bloodlines,
protecting one another in wrongdoing.

212
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,440
And in the end,

213
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,680
the whole family collapsed.

214
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,240
Same goes for the Jongtraipattanas.

215
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,960
If you keep this madness up,

216
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,880
you'll meet the same end.

217
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,080
Mark!

218
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,680
Second question.

219
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,640
It's something I don't understand.

220
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,360
Why would Chairman Wang,

221
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,280
a great patriarch,

222
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,920
let the woman he loved

223
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,680
marry Pramet

224
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,600
of Hemaratsiri?

225
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,480
Why did you let me and my mother live
under the Hemaratsiri roof for decades?

226
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,760
- I won't answer that now.
- What did you do to her family?!

227
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,600
If you don't answer me right now,

228
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,640
I'm walking out of here
and never coming back to this family.

229
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,400
I'm not someone
who worships bloodlines like you.

230
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,920
I'll destroy your dream
in a second if I have to.

231
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,600
Enemies.

232
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,600
The Jong and Song families were enemies…

233
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,440
but Mei and I loved each other.

234
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,200
Hey.

235
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,960
<i>Business and massive profits</i>

236
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
<i>drove both my family</i>

237
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,400
<i>and your mother's family to dominate.</i>

238
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,160
This is for crossing the line.

239
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,880
<i>We always had conflicts.</i>

240
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,920
<i>But we never ordered a hit</i>
<i>on each other's heirs.</i>

241
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,120
JONGTRAIPATTANA COLD STORAGE

242
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,000
<i>Then came the assassination attempt on me.</i>

243
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,200
<i>My father lost all patience</i>

244
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,480
<i>to even breathe the same air as the Songs.</i>

245
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,440
What?

246
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,120
Kill them!

247
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,400
Dad, no!

248
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,400
Let go of me!

249
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,000
- Dad, no!
- Go!

250
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,560
Go!

251
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,360
- Mei, go!
- Dad, no!

252
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,000
Hey!

253
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,120
- Go!
- Let's go, sir.

254
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,680
Hurry up. They're after us.

255
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,000
- Hurry up.
- Go.

256
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,720
- Go.
- Mei!

257
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,160
Wang!

258
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,320
Wang!

259
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,440
Boss!

260
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,280
- Boss!
- Mei!

261
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,320
- No!
- Wang!

262
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,160
And I never heard from your mother again.

263
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,960
By the time I found out Mei had married
the eldest son of Hemaratsiri,

264
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,880
you were already a grown man.

265
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,720
So, the Song family was wiped out

266
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,920
because of your revenge?

267
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,320
It wasn't something I wanted to happen.

268
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,280
And you expect me to be in the same family
that annihilated my mother's relatives?

269
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,280
But you carry the blood of both families.

270
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,600
You're the only one

271
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,080
who can reconcile us.

272
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,840
Reconcile?!

273
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,160
You already slaughtered her whole family!

274
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,000
I'll be the one to lead the Jong family.

275
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,920
If we're not talking about blood,

276
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,160
just qualifications, I'm the most
suitable person for the position.

277
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
Does anyone object?

278
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,000
I won't allow it!

279
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,400
That title belongs to Mark and Mark alone.

280
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,360
- I won't take it.
- Mark!

281
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,760
I'm so sick
of your obsession with bloodlines.

282
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,920
You have only two choices now.

283
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,000
Either let Dylan succeed you,

284
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,120
or watch this family fall apart
with no heir at all.

285
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,960
I'm sick of this too.

286
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,440
Fine.

287
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,760
If you don't want Monmeena to die…

288
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,360
Are you threatening to kill me now?

289
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,840
Meena.

290
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,600
No need for threats.
I came here to let you kill me.

291
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,800
But would you really dare kill me

292
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,960
along with your own family's bloodline?

293
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,640
Meena…

294
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,720
You're pregnant?

295
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,320
I didn't tell you
because Chairman Wang threatened me.

296
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,240
He wanted to push you into becoming
obsessed with leading the family,

297
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,400
a role he can't fulfill.

298
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,840
You're…

299
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,800
Listen carefully.

300
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,480
I'm no longer part
of the Jongtraipattana family.

301
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,240
And you have no right
to interfere with me or my people.

302
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,720
Is that clear?

303
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,040
No.

304
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,840
I won't allow this. I won't!

305
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,480
You will be…

306
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,840
Mark.

307
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,080
You're my blood.

308
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,360
You have to inherit this family.

309
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,960
You have to!

310
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,080
My name is Mekhin.

311
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,240
Mark! Mark!

312
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,280
Mark! Mark!

313
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,680
Mark!

314
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,600
Mark!

315
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,840
Mark!

316
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,960
Mark!

317
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,880
What are you waiting for? Bring him back!

318
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,400
Mark! Bring him back!

319
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,480
Bring Mark back! Mark!

320
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,280
Mark!

321
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,160
Meena.

322
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
Meena.

323
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,040
Meena, I'm so happy.

324
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,680
We're having a child together.

325
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,760
From now on, it's just me and the baby.

326
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,520
I'll tell my child
that their father is dead.

327
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,640
If you really meant that,

328
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,800
then why did you come here?

329
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,480
I came here for Dylan.

330
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,720
I wanted Chairman Wang
to see Dylan's worth.

331
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,040
To see how much he loves his father.

332
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,480
And I came here for myself.

333
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,800
I don't want my child to grow up
not knowing who their father is.

334
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,720
And I will not live my life
hiding the truth

335
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,080
just to protect your hunger for power.

336
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,640
I'm willing to give everything up
for you and the baby, Meena.

337
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,320
When I begged you to be with me,

338
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,760
when I ran to you, you pushed me away.

339
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,160
But now that you know I'm pregnant,

340
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,640
suddenly you say
you're ready to take care of us?

341
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,680
Why? Because I'm carrying your blood?

342
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,560
That's not what this is, Meena.

343
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,000
You're no different from those you hate,

344
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,720
bloodline-obsessed tyrants.

345
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,880
It's too late.

346
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,480
From now on,

347
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,760
we have nothing to do with each other.

348
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,800
Once we reach the checkpoint,
a van from the casino will help you cross.

349
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,760
Don't stress.

350
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,720
Everything's been cleared.
You'll pass through.

351
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,200
Then drive faster.

352
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,360
Once we're across the border,

353
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,120
we'll fly straight to Europe.
Everything's already prepared.

354
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,920
Cops!

355
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,000
Damn it.

356
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,680
Drive faster!

357
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,280
Damn it!

358
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,560
Faster! Speed up!

359
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,120
We made it.

360
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,520
Come on, Dad. Let's eat.

361
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,240
Made it? You call this making it?

362
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
We haven't been caught yet. That's a win.

363
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,800
I'll find someone else tomorrow
to get us across the border.

364
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,880
The news is everywhere.

365
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,360
The police are hunting us down.

366
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,200
Who the hell would help us?

367
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,160
I told you we should've flown out.

368
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,080
I'd be sitting pretty by now!

369
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,840
You would've been arrested
the second you stepped into the airport.

370
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,040
Just eat something first.
We'll figure it out.

371
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,800
Screw it!

372
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,080
If I hadn't listened to you
from the start,

373
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,640
I wouldn't be stuck in this hellhole.

374
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,040
You're useless!

375
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,160
And if you hadn't tried to kill Yai,

376
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,400
we wouldn't be on the run.

377
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,760
If you think you're better than me, go.

378
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,000
Catch that flight.

379
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,040
We can split up right here.

380
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,600
I'm the son of a billionaire.
I have a lot of money.

381
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,480
So, why am I hiding
in a rat hole like this?

382
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,000
The money you took is still here.

383
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,360
We just need to get out of the country.

384
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,040
You'll be rich and comfortable again.

385
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,400
Just hang in there, Dad.

386
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,960
Alright.

387
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,640
Parin, the porridge is ready.

388
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,040
Parin?

389
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,320
Your porridge, darling.

390
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,160
Parin, aren't you hungry?

391
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,160
Porridge with shrimp,
just the way you like.

392
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,200
Parin?

393
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,360
Parin?

394
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,280
Parin.

395
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,719
Parin.

396
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,840
Arisa!

397
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,480
Parin…

398
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,920
Parin, my son.

399
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,360
Your favorite porridge…

400
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,320
Here.

401
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,760
Big shrimp, just how you like it…

402
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,640
MOTHER

403
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,160
If you want to call her, just call.
No need to overthink it.

404
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,960
I'd better not. I'm hungry.

405
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,680
Did you send your mom any pictures today?

406
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,440
All done.

407
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,600
Don't you ever want to go back
to Thailand and visit your mom?

408
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,280
I don't want to go back
to that same cycle of problems.

409
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,240
Life here might be demanding,

410
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,640
but I'm at peace.

411
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,520
And I get to be with someone I love.

412
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,080
Still, I feel sorry for your mom.

413
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,160
She's all alone.

414
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,480
Just like my dad.

415
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,080
You miss your father, don't you?

416
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,560
Ever since he sent me here,

417
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,280
I haven't seen him again.

418
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,160
When I'm ready,

419
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,800
let's go back together.

420
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,720
I want to meet Mr. Noppachai,
as his son-in-law.

421
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,920
Sure.

422
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,600
Risa…

423
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,800
What's wrong?

424
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,360
MP NOPPACHAI BUSTED - MORALIST ON
THE SURFACE, HUMAN TRAFFICKER UNDERNEATH

425
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,720
My dad was arrested.

426
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,520
- Alright.
- Here.

427
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,320
The fruits aren't big this year, huh?

428
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,280
Right?

429
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,920
CHIANG RAI - MAE SAI

430
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,160
Mom! Dad!

431
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,840
- Meena!
- Meena!

432
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,640
- Easy now. Walk slowly.
- Whoa.

433
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,800
Mom…

434
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,920
Just sit down and rest.

435
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,480
Slowly. Let me take this.

436
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,680
Mom,

437
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,080
I'm just pregnant.

438
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,120
I'm not that fragile. Don't worry.

439
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,880
Let me take care of you for once.

440
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,800
It took a long time for us to meet

441
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,360
and finally live together in peace.

442
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,400
- Drink some water.
- Alright.

443
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
Thank you, Dad.

444
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,360
I'm sorry for all the pain we caused you.

445
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,200
If I hadn't left your mother alone…

446
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,120
Don't blame yourself.

447
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,760
If I hadn't asked Pramet

448
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,400
to help with Meena's surgery,

449
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,000
none of this chaos would've happened.

450
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,640
But Mom…

451
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,560
That choice gave me my life.

452
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,000
I know

453
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,720
you both did everything for me.

454
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,360
It's because

455
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,480
you are the heart of our lives.

456
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,480
Then, please,

457
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,920
whatever mistakes we made,

458
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,320
let's leave them behind.

459
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,800
Let's cherish this moment,

460
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,800
now that our family is finally together.

461
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,120
The four of us. My grandchild is here too.

462
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,680
I missed you so much.

463
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,080
Mr. Yai.

464
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,800
Can I stay too, please?

465
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,360
Don't you feel any shame
coming all the way here like this?

466
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,880
I do.

467
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,840
I'm ashamed I ever used you.

468
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,280
Ashamed I hurt you.

469
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,480
That's why I don't want to be ashamed
of not being there for my child.

470
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,680
I never felt love from my father.

471
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,680
I know how painful loneliness is.

472
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,520
That's why I don't want our child
to grow up with that same emptiness.

473
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,000
Please give me a chance
to take care of you and the baby.

474
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,280
You never gave me that chance.

475
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,600
I was ready to stand by you.

476
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,600
- But you pushed me away.
- Because I was worried about you.

477
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,920
I didn't want you in danger,

478
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,080
in the madness
of that power-hungry bloodline.

479
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,280
I grew up in a broken home.

480
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,840
But I had Aunt Duangjai and Dr. Ti,
and my life turned out okay.

481
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,200
I'll give my child warmth and security.

482
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,720
Now I have Dad and Mom.

483
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,480
My baby won't be alone.

484
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,000
This thing between us is over.

485
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,200
From now on, we go our separate ways.

486
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,840
Mark.

487
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,800
Rest easy.

488
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,960
Your bloodline lives on.

489
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,120
Dylan and I, we're both your blood.

490
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,600
But we'll live our lives.

491
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,440
You might not like that…

492
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,440
but I want you to know
we'll live happy lives.

493
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,960
Mark… Mark…

494
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,720
Mark!

495
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,480
- Nurse! Quickly, help!
- Mark!

496
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,360
I won't be that kind of person.

497
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,240
This is my workplace.

498
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,880
Are you planning to be a farmer now?

499
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,280
I bought all this land.

500
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,560
I'm going to grow trees and flowers,
attract tourists.

501
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,040
While I win my wife back,

502
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,440
I should also learn
how to live like my in-laws.

503
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,160
Was this Dylan's idea?

504
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,160
Dylan is my little brother.

505
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,360
You?

506
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,520
You've only ever held pens and guns.

507
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,760
You think you can handle hoes and shovels?

508
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
Don't forget.

509
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,520
I was an executive.

510
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,760
Mr. Mekhin, we're ready.

511
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,200
- Head that way. I'll join you shortly.
- Yes, sir.

512
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,400
Let's go.

513
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,480
Let's see how long you can keep this up.

514
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,680
A lifetime.

515
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,840
I'll be watching.

516
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,280
Don't look away.

517
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:47,920
Yai.

518
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,480
Yes, Dad?

519
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,680
- Let's go.
- It's over there.

520
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,400
Dad?

521
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,560
He's been calling him that for a while.
You just never noticed.

522
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,680
Mom, you always take other people's side.

523
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,280
What other people?

524
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,280
He's my son-in-law.

525
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,320
Mommy!

526
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,640
Mommy!

527
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,760
FOUR YEARS LATER

528
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,600
Where have you been, sweetheart?

529
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,480
You're all sweaty.

530
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,920
KAMRAM YARD

531
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,440
Uncle Yai.

532
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,920
I took her to see butterflies and bugs.

533
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,520
Maysa,

534
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,160
tomorrow, Daddy…

535
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,320
Tomorrow, Uncle will come pick you up.

536
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,000
- See you tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.

537
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,440
Bye-bye.

538
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,800
Maysa, let's go take a shower.

539
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,920
Let's go.

540
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,880
One, two, three, alright.

541
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,520
You're getting heavy now.

542
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,720
How long are you going
to keep being this cold to him?

543
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,200
It's not even half of what
he made me suffer.

544
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,480
So, you're going to let
your pride get in the way

545
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,600
of your daughter
spending time with her father?

546
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,680
Maysa's growing every day.

547
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,480
Think it over, dear.

548
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,400
You're back…

549
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,280
Mark, my son.

550
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,440
The court sentenced
Mr. Noppachai to life in prison.

551
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,680
Father…

552
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,080
<i>Obsession makes us greedy,</i>

553
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,520
<i>ravenous, blind, and leads us astray.</i>

554
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,920
<i>Families shattered…</i>

555
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,880
<i>separated, losing those they love.</i>

556
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,240
<i>Even losing their own lives.</i>

557
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,600
<i>The deeper you sink into delusion…</i>

558
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,560
<i>the more it haunts you,</i>

559
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,760
<i>like a nightmare.</i>

560
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,600
Mote.

561
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,720
Dad…

562
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,400
You've embarrassed me.

563
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,440
You don't deserve to be my son.

564
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,920
You don't deserve to be a Hemaratsiri.

565
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,120
I am a Hemaratsiri.

566
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,440
You don't deserve to be a Hemaratsiri.

567
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,560
I'm Pramote Hemaratsiri!

568
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,080
You don't deserve to be a Hemaratsiri!

569
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,240
I'm Pramote Hemaratsiri!

570
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,520
I am a Hemaratsiri!

571
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,400
I'm a doctor! I'm Pramote Hemaratsiri!

572
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,520
I'm Pramote Hemaratsiri! Let me go!

573
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,080
<i>It's like a dark shadow</i>

574
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,320
<i>that chases you wherever you go.</i>

575
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:44,880
Police here!

576
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,760
Tri, run!

577
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,280
- Dad! Dad!
- Tri!

578
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,760
- Can you move?
- Dad, go!

579
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,960
Go!

580
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,600
Dad, go!

581
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,320
Go!

582
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,680
Dad!

583
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,160
Dad!

584
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,160
Dad!

585
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,720
Dad!

586
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,840
Dad!

587
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,280
<i>It's tragic how people fight to the death,</i>

588
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,760
<i>only to end up with nothing.</i>

589
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,040
Mom…

590
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:43,960
Parin!

591
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,720
Parin.

592
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,240
Parin, my son.

593
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,640
My son is back.

594
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,080
My son is back.

595
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,280
Maysa.

596
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,240
Maysa,

597
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,720
why are you sitting here
all by yourself? Where's your mom?

598
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,560
Mommy, Daddy Yai is here.

599
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,080
POVERTY DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN SUFFERING

600
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,800
What did you just call me?

601
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,360
Daddy Yai.

602
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,320
What did you call me again?

603
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,200
Daddy Yai.

604
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,160
Maysa.

605
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,280
Are you hungry? Come eat now.

606
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,960
Come to Mommy.

607
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,320
Are you hungry?

608
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,000
Come here. Let me feed you.

609
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,560
Good girl.

610
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,240
Take a big bite.

611
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,960
One, two, three.

612
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,560
Good girl.

613
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,840
One more bite?

614
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,000
No more?

615
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,680
It's a dinosaur! How does it roar?

616
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,440
How about a monkey?

617
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,200
Maysa, go play over there for a bit, okay?

618
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,800
Go on, good girl.

619
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,400
Are you thinking about me?

620
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:24,880
Meena.

621
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,680
You taught her to call me Daddy, right?

622
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,000
No way…

623
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,720
I didn't.

624
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,640
Thank you.

625
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,320
I didn't teach her.

626
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,520
They said the temperature's dropping
to 17°C tonight. Keep this on.

627
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,200
It's hot. Wear it yourself.

628
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,280
But I'm cold. I want to stay like this.

629
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,360
Like this, okay?

630
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,600
Please?

631
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,080
I've been cold for nearly four years,
and you never heard me complain.

632
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,120
Well, why didn't you tell me?

633
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,000
Every time I came near you,
you'd frown like you just got Botox.

634
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,920
Want me to frown again?

635
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,080
No, no.

636
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,600
Hmm?

637
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,320
I can't wait to fall asleep holding you.

638
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,520
Did I say you could?

639
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:37,960
You just did.

640
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,440
- Take this.
- Fine.

641
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,600
It's alright.

642
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,880
Whoa. Maysa's watching.

643
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,560
Maysa, come here.

644
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,520
Give Daddy a hug.

645
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,320
Let's hug, three of us.

646
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,280
You and our daughter
are the greatest gifts of my life.

647
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,080
Every time I look at her,

648
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,600
I'm thankful
for whatever brought you into my life,

649
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,720
for letting me know

650
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,880
how it feels

651
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,200
to be loved.

652
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,080
Even if it meant giving up
the leader position

653
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,000
of the family…

654
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,560
that you…

655
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,520
spent your whole life fighting for?

656
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,040
I don't regret it at all.

657
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,160
Yes, I used to be like that.

658
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,800
I wanted power. I wanted to lead.

659
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,120
But you, Meena…

660
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,120
You made me realize

661
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,120
people don't need much more than someone

662
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,960
who loves them for who they are

663
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,400
and stays by their side
until their very last breath.

664
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,400
I'm glad

665
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,880
to hear you say that.

666
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,640
I don't want you to end up
like Chairman Preeda

667
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,000
or Chairman Wang.

668
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,480
Consumed by ambition

669
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,320
until they forgot all their morals.

670
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,920
Hyah!

671
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,240
What is that?

672
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,960
What's that, Maysa? A tree?
What is it again?

673
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,040
Mountain!

674
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,720
Yes, good girl. Let's roll.

675
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,280
THE END

676
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,920
Be careful.

677
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,320
- Mountain and what?
- Let's go there.

678
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,080
What is this called in English?

679
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,560
- Tree.
- Tree!

680
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,560
