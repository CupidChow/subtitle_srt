1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,440
Now you've got everything you need

2
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,320
to destroy the Hemaratsiris.

3
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,520
<i>So, what are you waiting for?</i>

4
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,480
One of the people who was prioritized
for a heart transplant 13 years ago…

5
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,040
was Monmeena.

6
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,920
Meena.

7
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,200
I should've killed you
when I had the chance!

8
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,920
This family fed you,

9
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,200
gave you a place to live for years.

10
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,880
And this is how you repay us?
You ungrateful dog!

11
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Say that again.

12
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,120
<i>If I tell you the truth,</i>

13
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,360
you have to help me avoid going to prison.

14
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,680
We'll see whose story holds up.

15
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,040
<i>If we don't trust each other,</i>
<i>who else can we trust?</i>

16
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,480
You're no different from the Hemaratsiris.

17
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,080
You're selfish.

18
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,600
When you're no longer useful,
I just don't want you anymore.

19
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,880
You're disgusting.

20
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,800
With that thorn gone,

21
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,200
everything will finally belong
to my one and only son.

22
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,040
I'm so happy for you, darling.

23
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,800
- Excuse me.
- Just need to talk with the board

24
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,520
about the little bomb Yai dropped.

25
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,120
CHAIRMAN

26
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,360
After you, Mr. CEO of H Group.

27
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Met.

28
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,120
Why are you here?
Parin, call the police right now.

29
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,640
Call them? To arrest me for what?

30
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,600
Murder?

31
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,000
Nate and her husband aren't dead.

32
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,880
So, what are you gonna charge me with?

33
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,880
I'll find something. Someone like you
must have a long list of crimes.

34
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,480
Yai and Chairman Wang

35
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,400
- helped you with the case, didn't they?
- How smart.

36
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,920
Much smarter than your mom.

37
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,400
What's this? Your project?

38
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,400
Useless. Pointless.

39
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,280
Crap. Throw it all out.

40
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,600
I'm not doing it.

41
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,680
I already discussed
those projects with the board.

42
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,880
What right do you have to cancel them?

43
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,080
My name's cleared. I'm a free man now.

44
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,080
And I'm taking back

45
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,160
my position as head of H Group.

46
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,920
And whoever crossed me before,
I remember everything.

47
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,320
Especially you and your mom.
You better watch your backs.

48
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,840
Why are you still here? Get out.

49
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,320
You pathetic punks.

50
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,720
How do I take this down?

51
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,840
We got rid of one enemy,

52
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,160
and now an old one crawls back! Ugh!

53
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,240
The will still has your name as CEO.

54
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,760
No way in hell
I'm letting him run things his way!

55
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,120
What is with this obsession
over the title?

56
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,400
It's never-ending.

57
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,520
<i>I'm on the way to the airport now.</i>

58
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
Where are you going, Parin?

59
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,200
I'm going to see Risa.
I'm heading to the airport.

60
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,960
What for?

61
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,880
Help me deal with Pramet first.

62
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,200
Risa's leaving the country.

63
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,600
This could be the last time I see her!

64
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,920
Parin!

65
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,720
Can't I at least say goodbye to her, huh?

66
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,320
Can you drive faster?

67
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,720
Calm down. It's rush hour. This is normal.

68
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,360
I've set up a meeting with the board.
You need to come with me.

69
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,680
Ask them to support you,
so we can get rid of Pramet

70
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,600
before he causes more damage.

71
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,080
This isn't right. Where are you taking me?

72
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,600
- The airport's not in this direction.
- Parin.

73
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,400
Pull over.

74
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,360
- Stop the damn car!
- We can't stop here.

75
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,720
This is you, isn't it?

76
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,840
What are you doing?

77
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,920
I'm taking you to see the shareholders.

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,040
We need their support to oust Pramet.

79
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,000
But I'm going to the airport!

80
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,680
Forget Arisa!

81
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,080
That family is rotten to the core.
She'll only drag you down.

82
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,400
I've done everything you asked.

83
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,400
Why can't you give me this one thing?

84
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,960
Huh?!

85
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,480
Stop the car!

86
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,320
Yes, sir.

87
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,160
<i>I'm boarding now. Goodbye, Parin.</i>

88
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,080
Parin, get in the car. Go to work.

89
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,760
Parin, where are you going?

90
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,080
Get in the car! Get in the car, Parin!

91
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,880
I said get in the car!
Where are you going?

92
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,840
Come back now, Parin!

93
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,240
Come back!

94
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,040
You were part of my plan, but not anymore.

95
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,760
When you're no longer useful,
I just don't want you anymore.

96
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,000
All I want now is the top spot and power.

97
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,560
So, when are you getting out of my life?

98
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,920
<i>Take your meds, and don't forget</i>
<i>to drink lots of water, okay?</i>

99
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,040
<i>When you sleep,</i>
<i>don't worry about anything.</i>

100
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,800
<i>Clear your mind and get some good rest.</i>

101
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,840
<i>Tomorrow, breakfast will bring you me.</i>

102
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,000
<i>Oops. I mean,</i>
<i>I'll bring you your breakfast.</i>

103
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,600
Alcohol helps clean
emotional wounds too, Mr. Yai.

104
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,680
I just don't get it.
You love Ms. Monmeena.

105
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,520
Why do you keep hurting her?

106
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,040
Because it's for the best.

107
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,240
How is that the best?

108
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,520
Ms. Monmeena is crying her heart out.

109
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
And you're clearly miserable too.

110
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,160
Look around me.

111
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,280
I'm surrounded by enemies.

112
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,200
Every single day is a war.

113
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,880
But you can protect her.

114
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,240
And why would I drag
someone I love into this mess?

115
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,760
She has a chance at a normal life,
with her family.

116
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,800
A life she's always dreamed of.

117
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,120
Letting her go is the best thing I can do.

118
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,160
But…

119
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,200
I want you to be happy too.

120
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,720
Thanks.

121
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,240
I'll be a lot happier
once you finish the job I asked for.

122
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,840
All done, sir.

123
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,880
This is serious. Why won't you answer?

124
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,520
What's with this mass stock dumping?
Why are we just now finding out?

125
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,680
There were no signs.

126
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,520
Suddenly, last night,
shareholders started dumping everything.

127
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,800
Have you figured out
who bought up all the shares yet?

128
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,480
Excuse me.

129
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,040
The new major shareholder
just arrived in the conference room.

130
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,720
Wang?

131
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,120
What are you doing here?

132
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,320
For an inspection

133
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,920
as one of H Group's shareholders.

134
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,320
This family might have a smart chairman,

135
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,360
but it's a shame

136
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,400
he has a meddlesome mother,

137
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,760
like a frog trying to climb
where it doesn't belong.

138
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
As for the hospital execs?

139
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,880
They're unethical organ traders.

140
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,160
And you as an executive director?
You're as dumb as they come.

141
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,360
Stupid and arrogant.

142
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,560
Just a worthless earthworm
squirming in a position of power.

143
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,240
Who would dare invest in you idiots?

144
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,040
That's why I had
to sweep it all up myself.

145
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,880
Now, where should I start?

146
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,920
By removing you?

147
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,680
Or restructuring
the entire H Group leadership?

148
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,960
You don't have the authority, Wang.

149
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,480
Even if you bought out
all the board members,

150
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,440
Hemaratsiri still holds 51% of the shares.

151
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,760
That's more than you, you dumbass!

152
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,200
Then you'd better clutch onto
those remaining shares of yours tight.

153
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,000
Because soon, I'll get more shares,

154
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,280
enough to make H Group mine alone.

155
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,480
Wang, you bastard.
This place belongs to me!

156
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,880
If you do this--

157
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,880
Yai!

158
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,600
How could you do that to Father?

159
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,200
Shameless!

160
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,200
The H Group presidency belongs to my son.

161
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,960
You can't just take it away.
The will clearly states it.

162
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,360
Stop being so stubborn.

163
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,560
You know very well H Group
isn't a family-run business.

164
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,560
It's governed by corporate law.

165
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,600
If you want a position,

166
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,720
you need shares. You need power.

167
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,480
As for that inheritance you got,
is there even any left?

168
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,240
Or did you already use it
to pay off your debts to us?

169
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,360
This place belongs to Parin, my only son!

170
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,120
And where exactly is your son right now?

171
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,280
Before you go screaming like a lunatic,

172
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,640
maybe go find your son first.

173
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,960
Oh, by the way,

174
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,120
Parin asked me to tell you
not to bother looking for him.

175
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,560
He doesn't want his mother anymore.

176
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,880
Liar.

177
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,080
You're lying. You're lying!

178
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,960
It's because of that bastard Parin
that we're in this mess!

179
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,280
- Where is that goddamn nephew?
- Don't you dare insult my son!

180
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
A scumbag like you has no right!

181
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,920
And what the hell did you teach your son
to destroy H Group like this?

182
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,440
H Group is a mess because of you!

183
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,600
If you hadn't pissed off Wang,

184
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,640
he wouldn't be hunting us down like this.

185
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,160
He's taken control of H Group,

186
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,000
and soon enough,
he'll kick your sorry ass out!

187
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,760
Remember this.

188
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,960
Everything your father built is about
to go up in flames because of you.

189
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,080
Got that?

190
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,320
If Chairman Preeda's ghost could see this,

191
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,880
he'd be tormented,

192
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,480
knowing H Group now belongs to you,

193
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,960
someone outside his bloodline.

194
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,720
Congratulations. You've won.

195
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,960
That's not enough.

196
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,080
If his spirit really lingers,

197
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,840
I'll make sure he sees
blood isn't thicker than water.

198
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,440
I'll show him he was wrong
to choose blood over loyalty.

199
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,480
And he'll see that his descendants

200
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,720
are willing to kill each other anytime,
just to get what they want.

201
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,480
Are you planning
to wipe out the whole family?

202
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Good.

203
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm actually curious now

204
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,280
if your vision will really come true.

205
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,440
When are you going to let me go?

206
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,800
If you think you can use me
to bait Mote, dream on.

207
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,880
You should know your husband
better than anyone.

208
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,000
I've got something I need you to do.

209
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,520
And what do I get in return?

210
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,000
Ms. Nuanchan.

211
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,120
Mr. Pramote pushed Ms. Mei down the stairs

212
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,280
because she found out

213
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,480
he accepted a VVIP heart transplant case.

214
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,240
You damn little snake!

215
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,720
If you hate Uncle Met that much,

216
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,560
why not kill him and be done with it?

217
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,000
Why drag this out?

218
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,040
I want him to live long enough
to see Hemaratsiri burn.

219
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,520
So, when he meets Grandpa in hell,

220
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,000
he'll be able to tell him exactly

221
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,240
who destroyed everything.

222
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,920
And if I see Grandpa,

223
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,400
I'll tell him his parenting,

224
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,040
his idea of raising us right,

225
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,960
was the very reason

226
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,840
his precious empire is falling apart.

227
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,560
I didn't tell your mom
you were meeting me here.

228
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,600
What do you want?

229
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,640
You really don't care

230
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,360
about the chairman position?

231
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,640
You fought so hard to get it.

232
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,320
That's what my mom wanted.

233
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
I never wanted any position in H Group.

234
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,200
So, you're really not coming back?

235
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,520
Nothing gets past you, huh?

236
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,800
Yeah.

237
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,800
I'm going to find Risa.

238
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,120
I'm not coming back.

239
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,400
If you're not coming back,

240
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,240
then sell me your shares in H Group.

241
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,440
I'll sit here.
I'll let the righteous one sit alone.

242
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,000
Good.

243
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,720
Better keep your distance from evil.

244
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,640
And if that's not far enough,
feel free to sit in the pool.

245
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,000
I'll throw in some chicken for you.

246
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,960
Nuan!

247
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Why, Pa?

248
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,920
You witch…

249
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,240
The company's on the verge of collapse,
and you're still bickering like brats.

250
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
Say what you have to say,

251
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,320
before the so-called "righteous" here
get hauled off by the police.

252
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,240
About H Group,

253
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,320
it's true Wang holds the largest stake.

254
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,440
But if we hold onto our combined shares,

255
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,360
he won't be able to take full control.

256
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
So?

257
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,520
Transfer all your shares to me.

258
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,000
- For what?
- For what?

259
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,560
So I'll have the authority
to negotiate with Wang

260
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,280
and stop him
from taking over our company, you idiots!

261
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,560
You? Negotiate?

262
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,080
All you do is yell and throw tantrums.
What else can you do?

263
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,760
For someone like you,

264
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,360
even if we gave you everything,
you'd just sell it off.

265
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,920
Or would you rather
cuddle those shares in jail?

266
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,880
You're barely keeping your head
above water and you're lecturing others?

267
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,720
The only one
who can take on Wang right now

268
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,520
is me.

269
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,360
Right now, I'm sacrificing for all of you,

270
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,560
unless you'd rather see H Group
fall completely into his hands.

271
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,680
Then transfer yours to me.

272
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,640
I'll deal with Chairman Wang myself.

273
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,480
I think I can handle this on my own.

274
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,920
Aunt Nuan,
you should focus on avoiding jail first.

275
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
- Tri!
- Hey!

276
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,360
Don't be ridiculous right now!

277
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,520
Just transfer your shares to me first.
Once I deal with Wang,

278
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,440
I'll give them back.

279
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
We don't trust you.

280
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,280
For God's sake!

281
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,360
What now?

282
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,640
Sorry to interrupt, but I have
some urgent messages to deliver.

283
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,400
Parin? Parin! Where is he?

284
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,160
Why don't you watch first?

285
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,760
Chairman Wang still doesn't hold
enough shares to change the board.

286
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,840
But if we add your shares to his,

287
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,120
that would be just enough.

288
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,320
You want me

289
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,680
to sell all my shares to you?

290
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,800
If you're not coming back,

291
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,320
what's the point in holding onto them?

292
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,880
If you want revenge against Grandpa
and your mother for stealing your life,

293
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
there's no better way than
to sell your shares to an enemy like me.

294
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,000
No, Parin! No!

295
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,560
Where is Parin?

296
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,480
Where's my son? Tell me right now!

297
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:00,440
Pa, if Parin sells his shares to Yai,
I'm putting a bullet in his head.

298
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,200
That's all I needed to say. I'm leaving.

299
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,000
Where are you going?

300
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,200
Take me to Parin right now.

301
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,320
Do you hear me?

302
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,840
I really don't know where he is.

303
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,640
Take me to him. I'll deal with him myself.

304
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,360
Don't you dare touch my son!

305
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,600
Your son is about to ruin everything!

306
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,040
He hasn't done anything yet.

307
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,720
And if he sells his shares to Yai,
then what?

308
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,360
- He won't.
- You want H Group to fall?

309
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,920
I said he won't. Are you crazy?

310
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,960
- What if he does?
- He won't!

311
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,920
Mote.

312
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,240
You think I'd just disappear?

313
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,720
I'm not going anywhere
until I make you pay.

314
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,560
Use Aunt Bua's master key.
Leave the door open.

315
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,520
Our special guest will let himself in.

316
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,560
Where are you going?

317
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,120
You knew the truth, didn't you?

318
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,080
How could you spread lies to the press?

319
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,400
How does it feel to be betrayed?

320
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,400
You little brat.

321
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,360
Hey!

322
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,880
Dad…

323
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,440
What's the occasion?

324
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,800
Why'd you call everyone here for dinner?

325
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,920
Well, we're a family, right?

326
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,640
We've got to show some love and unity.
It makes everything run smoother.

327
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,600
We're all together now. I've got my father

328
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,440
and my brother here. I'm so happy.

329
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,800
Good.

330
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,200
I've got some great news
to share with everyone.

331
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,120
Meena and I

332
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,880
are getting married.

333
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,400
Getting married?

334
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,280
Yes.

335
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,320
I want to start a new life
with someone who truly loves me.

336
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,720
Don't worry, Chairman Wang.

337
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,080
Once I take this new path,

338
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,840
I'll never look back.

339
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,360
Good. Dylan will have his own family.

340
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,880
I'm happy for you.

341
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,960
Well, if no one else has an announcement,

342
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,640
let's eat.

343
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,560
No need. I'll get it for you.

344
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,680
- Here it is. Eat more.
- Thank you.

345
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,120
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

346
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,480
Even if I don't know
why Mr. Yai is pushing me away,

347
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,320
I still don't want to give up.

348
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,600
If that's how you feel,

349
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,880
then marry me.

350
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,640
Let's test it.

351
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,880
Let's see if he still loves you,
if he still wants you.

352
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,840
If he doesn't fight to get you back,
I'll take care of you.

353
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,400
Even if he doesn't fight for me,

354
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,960
I don't know
if I can love you the same way.

355
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,320
You'll just have to try.

356
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,320
Lots of friends turn into lovers, right?

357
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,680
You don't feel anything at all?

358
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,760
Did "we" mean nothing to you?

359
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,760
There's something.

360
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,560
There's something you misunderstood.

361
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,560
From the beginning,
there was never really a "we".

362
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,080
Fine.

363
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,360
Then I can go to Chiang Rai with Dylan

364
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,840
without any guilt.

365
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,000
We're starting a new life there.

366
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,000
Congratulations.

367
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,760
I'm moving to Chiang Rai with Meena.

368
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,560
She means everything to me.

369
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,880
- Without her--
- You've done well, Dylan.

370
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,280
It's perfect.

371
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,640
With Monmeena out of the picture,

372
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,720
Mark will have no weaknesses.

373
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,560
He'll be able to fully focus
on leading this family.

374
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,800
You didn't call me here
to stop me, did you?

375
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,600
Take Monmeena.

376
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,680
Keep her out of sight, out of Mark's life.

377
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,600
In a few days,

378
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,360
it's the ancestral ceremony
for the Jong family.

379
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,520
I'll make sure everyone sees Mark

380
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,760
as the new leader from our bloodline.

381
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,480
We must prepare.

382
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,960
That's all you wanted to say?

383
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,920
Yes.

384
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,800
Anything else?

385
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,640
Even now,

386
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,520
you still make me
appreciate being your son.

387
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Damn it…

388
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,560
I'm never going to lose H Group.

389
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,160
Help me think

390
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,520
of a way to deal with Yai.

391
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,360
PARIN

392
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,360
MONDAY, MAY 20TH

393
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,400
Parin…

394
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,040
You won't abandon me.

395
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,320
You won't abandon me.

396
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,840
I only prioritized someone.

397
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,400
I'm not a murderer.

398
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,720
Parin!

399
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,920
You can't sell those shares to Yai!

400
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,280
Mr. Pramet already took Mr. Parin.

401
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,640
I know.

402
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,880
What about the documents?

403
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,520
I got them last night.

404
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,480
Should I go help Mr. Parin?

405
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,600
No need.

406
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
He won't lay a hand on Parin
until he has those shares.

407
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,840
And what's next?

408
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,880
I'll finish the legal process,

409
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,600
then get rid of them all from H Group.

410
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,080
I'm going with you.

411
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,320
- Chairman!
- My arm!

412
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,720
Call an ambulance.

413
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,600
Don't move.

414
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,400
What is it, Tri?

415
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,160
Yai, help me!

416
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,760
What happened?

417
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,480
Dad's gone mad.

418
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,480
He's taken Parin hostage
and shot Aunt Pa and Aunt Nuan.

419
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,160
<i>He's forcing everyone</i>
<i>to sign their shares over.</i>

420
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,960
<i>I tried to stop him, but he locked me in.</i>

421
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,520
I'm scared he'll kill someone.
Please help!

422
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,720
I'll be right there. Don't be scared, Tri.

423
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,960
Ambulance is on its way.

424
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,240
Get Chairman to the hospital.
Keep me updated.

425
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,320
- Yes, sir.
- Mark.

426
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,720
Mark, don't go.

427
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,080
Mark! Mark!

428
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,840
I'll check the Chairman's floor.
You look around the other floors.

429
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,880
Be careful, Mr. Yai.

430
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,920
I told you to sign!
You deaf or something? Sign it!

431
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
Sign it!

432
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,040
Sign it now!

433
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,760
You think you can beat me by doing this?

434
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,520
I don't know. Let's find out.

435
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,679
Let him go.

436
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,520
And tell me where Tri is.

437
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,920
Ugh!

438
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,120
So, Triprapa called you here?

439
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,960
You really care
about that little sister, don't you?

440
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,960
Even if she has a father like you,

441
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,560
she's still my sister. And so is Parin.

442
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,680
Wow, I feel so left out.

443
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,240
You only love your siblings,
not your father.

444
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,880
Ungrateful!

445
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,400
What have you ever done
to deserve my gratitude?

446
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,240
Well, good luck
with your precious siblings then.

447
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Yai.

448
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,200
Tri?

449
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,080
Here!

450
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,840
Parin already has a mother.

451
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,480
He doesn't need you to worry about him.

452
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,320
What the hell did you inject me with?

453
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,040
You'll find out.

454
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,560
You really thought
we were gonna kill each other?

455
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,520
In the Hemaratsiri family,

456
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,520
blood runs thicker than water, you moron!

457
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,040
You bastards…

458
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,400
Tri…

459
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,000
Let go of me!

460
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,080
Let go of me!

461
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,040
You're all really gonna kill each other?

462
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,000
You want Yai to win
by making us tear each other apart?

463
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,920
You don't see it? He's been
playing all of us this whole time!

464
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,320
The family's downfall
won't be because of him.

465
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,360
It's us. We're the fools
who let him pull the strings.

466
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,400
Grandpa always said,
"When a heron fights a clam,

467
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,040
the fisherman wins."

468
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,160
Dad's the crazy heron,

469
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,560
and you guys are the clams,

470
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,960
losing your minds fighting each other.

471
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,400
Meanwhile, the fisherman, Yai,
is taking everything from us.

472
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,320
Our family should work together
and take him down,

473
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,160
so we can keep everything that's ours.

474
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,360
How was it, Yai?

475
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,240
How does it feel to be betrayed
by your beloved little sister?

476
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,800
I told you already.

477
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,360
If you didn't love me,

478
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,360
then an outsider like you
deserves nothing from this family.

479
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,720
Met's going to kill Yai.

480
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,000
We need to get out of here
before we end up as accomplices to murder.

481
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Your time's up, Yai.

482
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,080
- Damn it!
- Hey!

483
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,160
- Parin…
- Yai, run!

484
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,120
Yai, run!

485
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,920
- Parin.
- Go!

486
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,120
Stop!

487
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,800
Ugh!

488
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,280
Damn it!

489
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,720
- Why the hell did you interfere?!
- Don't hurt my son!

490
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,160
Pramet!

491
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,000
Don't hurt my son!

492
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,520
- How the hell did you raise your son?!
- Stop!

493
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,960
Why aren't you going after him?

494
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,680
Safe travels, my dear.

495
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,200
Yes.

496
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,000
Don't skip your checkups, okay?

497
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,440
Don't worry.

498
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,600
I'll take her to every single one,
every six months, not missing a beat.

499
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,840
INTHON

500
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,760
Let's go, Meena.

501
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,640
Let me use the restroom one more time.
It's a long ride.

502
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,480
Okay.

503
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,080
Go.

504
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,920
Hello, Inthon?

505
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,480
Mr. Yai?

506
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yai!

507
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
I know you're still in here.

508
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,240
No matter how much you struggle,

509
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,040
you won't escape.

510
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,040
I've changed
the passcodes for every floor.

511
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,320
Today,

512
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,440
you die by my hand!

513
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,240
Don't worry

514
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,560
that anyone will know
you died like a dog in here.

515
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,840
When the cops find your body,

516
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,720
they'll see the tranquilizers, the bullet,

517
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,080
and the fingerprints of someone
with a motive to kill you.

518
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,360
After that, I'll take care of Wang.

519
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,360
Everything from Hemaratsiri will be mine!

520
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,960
Wait…

521
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,240
No one said anything
about framing someone.

522
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,200
Whose fingerprints did you prepare?

523
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,800
Apapat?

524
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,000
She's the mother of my nephew.

525
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,480
I wouldn't send family to jail.

526
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,000
It's gotta be someone
outside the bloodline, you idiot.

527
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,560
Oops.

528
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,000
Took you long enough, Nuanchan.

529
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,680
Mote.

530
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,560
Seeing someone so smart

531
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,840
be so dumb… feels great.

532
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,200
You tricked me?

533
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,240
Oh yeah. We'll stage it perfectly.

534
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,960
You'll just be the pawn
who snapped and accidentally killed Yai.

535
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,920
- Let me go!
- It's time

536
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,000
I settled the score with my dear wife.

537
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,320
Let go of me! Let go!

538
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,400
- Let go of me!
- Come here!

539
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,800
- Who are you calling?
- I'm calling the police.

540
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,880
You can't!

541
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,520
This is our chance.

542
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,520
Let them kill each other,
then everything will be ours.

543
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,400
We just need to hide
until they're all dead.

544
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,280
Stop it already, Mom!

545
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,160
How could you go along with murder?

546
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,640
Everything I do is for you.

547
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,560
You're doing it
for the inheritance that's not yours.

548
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,120
When will you stop being so greedy?

549
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,320
Learn to be satisfied for once, please.

550
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,920
I did everything for you.

551
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,520
You did it for yourself!

552
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,880
Don't say it was for me.

553
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,720
I never asked for any of this.

554
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,640
You're my son.

555
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,800
You have to do what I say!

556
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,200
I won't.

557
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,560
I hate your orders.

558
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,000
I hate everything you've done.

559
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,760
I hate you!

560
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,600
I'm the only one who's ever loved you.

561
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,120
I raised you.

562
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,760
I gave you everything.

563
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,200
And this is how you repay me?

564
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,760
You're ungrateful!

565
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,480
Ungrateful!

566
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,160
Will you tell the police?

567
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,040
No!

568
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,000
Then I'd rather be an ungrateful son

569
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:22,680
than your excuse to commit more crimes.

570
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,880
Let's not see each other again, Mom.

571
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,880
Parin. Parin.

572
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,520
Parin, where are you going?

573
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,080
Parin, come back. Parin!

574
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,560
Parin, where are you going?

575
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,520
Come back. You have to listen to me.

576
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,840
What the hell is this?

577
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,040
Parin…

578
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,680
Parin!

579
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,520
Come here!

580
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,000
After everything I did to protect you,

581
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,560
how dare you betray me, Mote!

582
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,840
I'm about to repay you.

583
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,160
Do you know how disgusted I was
having you as my wife?

584
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,800
How much I hated you?

585
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,520
How you annoyed me?

586
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,720
You made my skin crawl, Nuan!

587
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,840
Ugh!

588
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,480
You're going to pay for killing my father!

589
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,680
Uncle Mote!

590
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,640
No, Uncle Mote!

591
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,040
Uncle Mote!

592
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,120
You want to get into this?

593
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,280
Mote!

594
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,040
You bastard!

595
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,280
You evil husband!

596
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,520
Uncle Mote!

597
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,640
Yai.

598
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,680
You wanna know how Mei died?

599
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,120
I'm telling you.

600
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,160
Your mother gave her life to show me

601
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,440
just how loyal
the Hemaratsiri bloodline is.

602
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,560
I was drunk that day,

603
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,200
but I saw everything.

604
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,520
How dare you betray my dad?
Give me the evidence.

605
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,320
- Give my dad the evidence!
- Let go of me!

606
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,960
Give me the evidence!

607
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,800
I'll tell the police.

608
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,920
Mote, what the hell are you doing?!

609
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,560
She was going to get me arrested.

610
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,160
She'd bring us all down
because of that VVIP transplant case.

611
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,600
I couldn't let that happen.

612
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,920
She would've destroyed the whole family!

613
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,640
She's still alive. Her pulse is strong.

614
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,400
- Let me call for an ambulance.
- Don't.

615
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,840
Help…

616
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,880
Help me…

617
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,680
Help me…

618
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,480
Destroy the evidence.

619
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,680
Then call the police.

620
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,200
Just like my family.

621
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,000
No matter how evil we are,
we protect our own.

622
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,560
It's not wrong if my kid kills someone

623
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,520
because my kid is a good person, right?

624
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,800
This kind of disgusting family love,
I like it!

625
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,880
Do you like it too, Tri? Do you?

626
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,600
Damn it.

627
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,520
- Ugh!
- Stop!

628
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,560
Yai, stop!

629
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,200
Damn it!

630
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,520
Tri!

631
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,920
Will you stop, Tri?!

632
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,000
Get yourself together!

633
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,360
Ugh.

634
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,360
Die now, Yai.

635
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,160
- Die!
- Watch out, Mr. Yai!

636
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,200
Meena!

637
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,680
Meena!

638
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,040
Why the hell are you here?!

639
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,280
If you die here too,

640
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,800
what the hell am I supposed
to make up and tell the cops?

641
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,400
You think I'm that smart?

642
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,720
The police are on their way.

643
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,000
You called the police?

644
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,000
You little bitch!

645
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,440
Dad!

646
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,440
Ugh!

647
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,360
Dad, the cops are here!
We have to go, now!

648
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,680
The police are here. We need to go.

649
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,960
Meena.

650
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,240
- Meena.
- Mr. Yai.

651
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,480
- Meena.
- Mr. Yai.

652
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,160
You're safe…

653
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,880
Why did you do that?

654
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,800
Do I really have to say why?

655
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,120
Meena!

656
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,320
Meena!

657
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,760
Meena!

658
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,920
How is she?

659
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,920
She's safe now.
Waiting for her to wake up.

660
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,560
Will it take her dying next time
for you to finally realize?

661
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,800
Ti!

662
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,200
It's between Meena and Mr. Yai.
Please, don't…

663
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,480
If you can't make her happy,

664
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,160
then let her be with someone
who's ready to take care of her.

665
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,640
How long are you
going to keep hurting her?

666
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:33,720
- Ti, stay out of your sister's matters.
- I wouldn't!

667
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,560
If this hadn't almost killed her!

668
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,280
- Meena. She's awake!
- Meena!

669
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,320
- Meena, you're awake.
- Nurse!

670
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,200
The patient's awake now.

671
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,680
Meena, how are you?

672
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,840
- Meena.
- She's awake now.

673
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,840
Please help.

674
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,760
- Please.
- Thank you.

675
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,400
ONE MONTH LATER

676
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,920
Well.

677
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,800
If you had let me go with you that day,

678
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,320
I never would've let this happen.

679
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,200
If you knew, you would've stopped me.

680
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,360
Does this count

681
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,200
as knowing each other too well?

682
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,120
You're still planning to follow me
to Chiang Rai, aren't you?

683
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,120
I've never loved the wrong person.

684
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,240
Because you told my mom to buy a house.

685
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,320
Whatever you told her,

686
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,200
she told me everything.

687
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,200
As long as you want me,

688
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,480
- I'm ready to spend the rest of my life--
- Dylan…

689
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,160
- I--
- The soup's here.

690
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,960
Let's eat, Meena.

691
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,200
Dylan.

692
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,160
I'll be right back.

693
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,360
Are you alright, Meena?

694
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,200
- What?
- You're three months pregnant.

695
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,680
<i>Your lymphoma is no longer</i>
<i>responding to treatment,</i>

696
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,680
<i>and it's metastasized</i>
<i>to your bones and lungs.</i>

697
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,480
<i>That's why you've been so easily fatigued,</i>

698
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,080
<i>short of breath,</i>

699
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,320
<i>and severely anemic.</i>

700
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,240
I'm afraid…

701
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,000
it's now in the final stage.

702
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,800
If his father sees this,
how happy will he be?

703
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,160
Yes?

704
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,360
Meena…

705
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,960
What's wrong, Aunt Jai?

706
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,760
- Why are you here?
- Chairman would like to speak with you.

707
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,480
<i>Let's talk about</i>
<i>welcoming my grandchild, shall we?</i>

708
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,840
Grandchild?

709
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,560
- Meena… You…
- Yes.

710
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,160
So, you're accepting the position
to protect Meena?

711
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,800
Do I have a choice?

712
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,360
This is madness.

713
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,320
Stop doing insane things
