1
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,480
I want to know
what Mark plans to do to the Hemaratsiri.

2
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,000
This is about Mark's mother.

3
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,760
Don't bother hiding who you are anymore.

4
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,360
It's obvious from how you want
to destroy H Group that you're Yai.

5
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,080
So, this is what
a two-faced person looks like.

6
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,560
Thanks to you, Aunt Nuan.
I learned from the best.

7
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,680
- Tri!
- I'm ready to answer your question now.

8
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,880
Who connected Poot's death
to Chairman Preeda's?

9
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,400
<i>I always end up risking my life</i>
<i>for the foolish things.</i>

10
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,520
Especially when
it comes to someone I love.

11
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,880
<i>Hello, Meena?</i>

12
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,960
<i>Mr. Yai, Help me! Who are you?!</i>

13
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,880
Mekhin, your fiancé, is dead.

14
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,520
<i>Why are you clinging to me?</i>

15
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,920
The Jongtraipattana family

16
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,120
is nothing but hell!

17
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
You want a warm family moment?

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,920
Try it.

19
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,640
You sent a document?

20
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,520
What document?

21
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,960
It's a gift. I think you'll like it.

22
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,200
Parin!

23
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
My precious boy.

24
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,360
You're the best!

25
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,840
I didn't think you'd get your hands
on this kind of juicy evidence.

26
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,920
You don't have to.

27
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
I want to deal with them myself.

28
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,360
MARK

29
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,000
Public opinion on Lek's performance
is terrible right now.

30
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,240
By winning this award, your image

31
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
will far surpass his.

32
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,360
I've already told the hospital staff
to share the page,

33
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,560
so it'll get more views.

34
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,200
Thank you so much.

35
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,120
Yes?

36
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,560
Cancel the interview?

37
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,560
Why? Why do you have
to rescind Mr. Mote's award?

38
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,920
What's going on?

39
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,000
Uncle Mote, look at this.

40
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,960
The leak shows that the hospital
received medical equipment donations

41
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,720
in exchange for moving VIPs
to the front of the surgery queue.

42
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,200
What is all this?!

43
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,120
You're all dressed up.
Going to the award ceremony?

44
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,360
Oh.

45
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,240
But they're not giving it to you anymore,
are they, Mr. Mote?

46
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,320
How pitiful. Oh, no! I'm so sorry.

47
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,400
You got all dressed up for nothing.

48
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,920
What page posted that?
Tell them to take it all down.

49
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,400
It's too late. It's already
been shared thousands of times.

50
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,760
Find out who leaked it, fast.

51
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,320
I think I know who it is.

52
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,000
HEAVEN HOSPITAL
READY FOR SERVICE, OPEN 24 HOURS

53
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,160
You called for me, Professor?

54
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Was it you

55
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,720
who told the media

56
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,920
about us prioritizing VVIP patients?

57
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,360
I never agreed with it,

58
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,840
but there's no way
I'd ruin your reputation.

59
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,400
I'm on duty almost every day.

60
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,720
I don't have time
to deal with these things.

61
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,840
If not you, then who?
That Nont boy's mother?

62
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,400
I'm sure it wasn't her.

63
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,320
Then, who was it? Who did you talk to?

64
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,720
Was it Monmeena? Was it her?
Did she leak it to the media?!

65
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,880
I never shared anything
about work with anyone.

66
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,520
If it wasn't either of you, then who?
Who would do such a terrible thing?

67
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,640
Doctor Ti.

68
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,840
- You can go.
- Mr. Mote!

69
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,920
I'm sure Doctor Ti didn't leak it.

70
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,520
I'm sorry if we made you uncomfortable.

71
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,480
You can be in love with him all you want,

72
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,440
but you shouldn't defend him for this

73
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,440
when it's obvious
he's the one who leaked it!

74
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,520
But we have no proof.

75
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,560
Not only did you accuse him,
you dragged Monmeena into this.

76
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,560
If he gets angry and talks to the press,

77
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,320
our hospital could be ruined
all because of your temper.

78
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,720
Yes, sir?

79
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
Please calm down.

80
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,800
I really don't know
how the information got out.

81
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,440
Please allow me to investigate further,

82
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,080
and I'll explain everything.

83
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,240
Yes. I'm really sorry.

84
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Everyone is condemning
Pramote and his hospital right now.

85
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,840
Someone's bound to dig deeper
into their misconduct.

86
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,840
Tri, you were in charge of the foundation.

87
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,000
Why didn't you know about
the queue-jumping?

88
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,840
I was only handling
public relations and coordination.

89
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,440
Aunt Nuan was managing everything.

90
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,720
She never told me about any of this.

91
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,040
You were tasked with taking care of it
and didn't know anything.

92
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,240
Like father, like daughter.

93
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,960
I guess your stupidity runs in your DNA.

94
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
- Mom!
- It's the truth.

95
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,160
She should realize
that thanks to your help,

96
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,960
she doesn't have to be
Pramote's lapdog anymore.

97
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,640
I've always known that.

98
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,640
The reason
I haven't been cast out of this family

99
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,559
is because of Parin and you, Aunt Pa.
You both showed me mercy.

100
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,840
If you realized it,
then make yourself useful.

101
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,039
Don't just feed off us like a parasite.

102
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,280
Did you find out

103
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,840
how many VVIP cases they handled?

104
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Not yet.

105
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,480
Then, why are you still here?!
Go look it up!

106
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,520
I'm surrounded by idiots.

107
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,440
I told my people to take the news down
and spoke to the press

108
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,040
about removing the posts.
How's it going on your end?

109
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,920
I've been talking to the press all day.

110
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,320
I explained to every investor

111
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,240
that there's no evidence
proving their involvement.

112
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,840
I kept bowing and apologizing.

113
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,640
My face was practically glued
to the ground before they calmed down.

114
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,400
It's exhausting.

115
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,880
Mr. Winai,
the real estate tycoon, is calling.

116
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,240
He hasn't called you in a long time.

117
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,720
Think he has a "special case"
he needs help with?

118
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Answer him.

119
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,400
Hello?

120
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,000
<i>How did my name get leaked, Mr. Pramote?</i>
<i>What are you people doing?!</i>

121
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,920
Leaked?

122
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,560
Let me check on that.

123
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,120
Tri is calling me.

124
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,600
Yes, Tri?

125
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,520
<i>Check the news page</i>
<i>I just sent you, Aunt Nuan.</i>

126
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,520
<i>Non-stop scandals</i>
<i>involving hospital executives</i>

127
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,240
<i>who exploited the foundation</i>
<i>for personal gain from the privileged.</i>

128
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,440
<i>Recently, a list of VIPs was released,</i>

129
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,160
<i>confirming the individuals</i>

130
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,000
<i>who used their influence</i>
<i>to skip the queue.</i>

131
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,720
BIG NAME HOSPITAL EXECUTIVES SCANDAL

132
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,720
It's the real list.

133
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,160
PATIENT LIST

134
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,880
NOPPACHAI

135
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,960
They must be in deep trouble
with the VIPs.

136
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,040
Noppachai's name is on that list too.

137
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,040
The media won't let this die down easily.

138
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,200
Stop!

139
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,800
Tri.

140
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,960
Are you okay, Father?

141
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,680
The police are looking for me eveywhere.

142
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,320
Can you help me find a place to hide?

143
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,400
If I wasn't on the run,

144
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,760
I'd crush them even harder.

145
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,360
They deserve this,
after all the times they trampled on me.

146
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,720
Apapat planned this well.

147
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,640
Mote's going to be crushed.

148
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,600
This is your victory too.

149
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,120
Thank you so much
for putting yourself in their service.

150
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,520
I'd do anything for us.

151
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,080
Once we get rid of all of them,

152
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,560
I'll let you take over for me.

153
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,120
And what's your next move?

154
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Apapat's a wild dog.

155
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,960
She's not going to let this drag on.

156
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,880
Was it you, Tri?

157
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,400
You're the only one

158
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,480
who had access to the name list.

159
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,520
INFORMATION

160
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,880
No.

161
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,800
Not just the name list,

162
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,000
but also the details of every
surgical misconduct you committed.

163
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,600
And this won't end with just
being removed from the hospital.

164
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,520
Your medical licenses
could be revoked at any time.

165
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,720
Prioritizing VIPs is just unethical.

166
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,320
That alone
wouldn't get your license revoked.

167
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,680
You might've gotten away with it
if it weren't for the organ trafficking.

168
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,520
Met.

169
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,440
Should we call the police?

170
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,640
Go ahead. Call them.

171
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,000
So I can drag both of you to jail with me.

172
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,480
Say a word about it,
then get ready to rot in prison.

173
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,120
Then try me.

174
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,640
I've got nothing left to lose, Nuanchan.

175
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,840
Unlike you.

176
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,680
What do you want?

177
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,200
Pramet isn't going anywhere.

178
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,720
Ms. Triprapa has been secretly hiding
and taking care of him.

179
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,600
No job.

180
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,120
Pulling strings. Living his dream.

181
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,760
He must've always been doing that to you.

182
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,400
What are they doing at the foundation?

183
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,400
Let's celebrate.

184
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,960
Father!

185
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,320
Tell me everything you know
about the foundation.

186
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,240
- I don't know anything!
- Stop!

187
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,520
- Move, Tri.
- No!

188
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,160
If you kill him, you'll never find out
the truth about your mother's death!

189
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,160
Father!

190
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,760
Shit.

191
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Stop it!

192
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,480
Yai, you piece of shit!

193
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,480
This is nothing compared
to what you did to my mother.

194
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,160
You assaulted her.

195
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,520
You emotionally abused her.
You made her live through hell.

196
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,280
She deserved it! She chose
to be with many men herself.

197
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,280
They tricked me into marrying Wang's slut

198
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,640
and raising a bastard like you!

199
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,400
If Tri hadn't overheard
your talk with Dad,

200
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,520
I would've been fooled for the rest
of my life. Your mother deserved to die!

201
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,040
Was it you?
You killed my mother, didn't you?!

202
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,160
I don't know.
She fell down the stairs and died.

203
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,560
I was drunk at the club that night--

204
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,119
Chairman Wang got the autopsy report.

205
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,760
My mother died from suffocation,
not falling down the stairs!

206
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,359
Don't do it, Yai!

207
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,560
Don't!

208
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,640
It was Monmeena.

209
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,120
What about Monmeena?

210
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,200
She was the reason
your mother died, you fool!

211
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,240
Tell yout staff to post more
about Pramote and Nuanchan.

212
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,160
Get the parents of the skipped children
to report everything to the ministry.

213
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,840
Max.

214
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,560
- Keep an eye on Pramet.
- Yes.

215
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,920
About Ms. Monmeena--

216
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,440
Don't ever let Meena find out about this.

217
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,360
Mr. Yai.

218
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,160
The hospital's page
just shared Pramote's interview.

219
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,160
All this time, my main duty
has been to perform surgeries

220
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,000
and treat my patients.

221
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,880
That's why I didn't know anything
about the patients' background.

222
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,960
Also, I wasn't involved

223
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,400
in any of the foundation's
management decisions

224
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,520
until I heard about

225
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,760
people exploiting it

226
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,440
for personal gain.

227
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,760
I'm devastated.

228
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,120
Because the true purpose
of Heaven Hospital,

229
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,800
working in collaboration
with Honest Heart Foundation,

230
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,480
is to return healthy hearts to society,

231
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,880
not to profit from them.

232
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,600
<i>I've already ordered an investigation</i>
<i>to find out what happened.</i>

233
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,760
<i>The truth will come to light soon.</i>

234
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,440
Are you trying
to make yourself look innocent

235
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,680
and pin everything on me?

236
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,840
Someone has to survive
to protect the other.

237
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,760
If not, we'll both go down.

238
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,640
And do you really think people
will believe you didn't know anything?

239
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,520
Hiding behind me like this

240
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,680
won't help.

241
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,280
Trust me.

242
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
The only way out of this

243
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,280
is to take responsibility like a man.

244
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,640
You need to follow my plan.

245
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,560
If you trust me,
we'll survive, just like we always have.

246
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,000
Don't you trust me?

247
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
Don't you trust me?!

248
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,680
Is that why you don't trust my plan?

249
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,400
I'm not surprised.

250
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,080
Even blood siblings

251
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,880
can't trust each other.

252
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,760
So, if you can't trust your husband,

253
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,840
I understand.

254
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,640
If you no longer trust me,

255
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,680
maybe we can't be life partners anymore.

256
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,680
It's not that I don't trust you.

257
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,000
But I… I…

258
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,000
Then prove it.

259
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,640
Prove it.

260
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,800
Prove that I married the right person.

261
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,760
If you trust me,

262
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,800
then we can get through this together.

263
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,120
RUEANROT

264
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,480
<i>I'd like to admit that</i>

265
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,880
<i>the operations</i>

266
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,040
<i>involving prioritizing</i>
<i>the heart transplant queues</i>

267
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,080
<i>were carried out by me alone.</i>

268
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,440
<i>And I'd like to take this opportunity</i>

269
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,560
<i>to resign</i>

270
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,560
<i>from my management position</i>
<i>at Heaven Hospital</i>

271
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,600
<i>to take responsibility</i>

272
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,720
<i>for my misconduct.</i>

273
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,160
And I'd like to confirm that

274
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,360
Mr. Pramote Hemaratsiri…

275
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,400
had no involvement in these actions.

276
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,560
I can't believe

277
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,360
Ms. Nuanchan loves Mr. Pramote that much.

278
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,960
Love makes people blind.

279
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,280
That's true.

280
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,680
But it can also
give them incredible strength.

281
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,760
Just like how you've given it to me.

282
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,800
After you.

283
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,000
Yes.

284
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,440
Thank you.

285
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,280
This restaurant is usually packed.
Where is everyone?

286
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,200
I wanted to spend
some time alone with you.

287
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,880
Uh…

288
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280
Don't tell me you booked
the whole restaurant for me.

289
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,640
Thank you.

290
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,080
Dylan, you didn't have to do this.

291
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,680
I'd like to cancel our agreement
to fake our relationship

292
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,280
and make it real.

293
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,520
Would you let today
be the first day of our love?

294
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,080
<i>Meet me.</i>

295
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,520
Is everything okay?

296
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,320
Oh, it just…

297
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,200
I need to go see Dr. Ti right now.
Please excuse me.

298
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,360
Mr. Yai.

299
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,240
I went to see Pramet today.

300
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,600
Is he back?

301
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,840
He never left.

302
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,880
Mr. Yai, is something wrong?

303
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,920
Why did seeing him
make you look like this?

304
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,120
Or did you find out more about your mom?

305
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,960
Did Pramet have something to do…

306
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,240
He was drunk at the club that night.

307
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,120
If it wasn't him, then who else
could've caused your mom's death?

308
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,000
You did find out something, didn't you?

309
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,000
Does it have to do

310
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,160
with the hospital prioritizing
heart transplants for VVIPs?

311
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,200
The VVIP who needed a transplant,

312
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,600
the one who caused your mother's death,
was none other than Monmeena!

313
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,200
Stop lying.

314
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,320
How could she be the VVIP?

315
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,000
Or did you arrange it?

316
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,480
In exchange for Nate becoming my wife,

317
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,320
I told Mote to prioritize her.

318
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,760
When Mei found out that the kids
from her foundation who needed new hearts

319
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,880
had been skipped in the queue

320
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,520
because I bribed Mote and Nuanchan,

321
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,200
she was furious!

322
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,960
That's organ trafficking.

323
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,720
Didn't know, didn't care. But I did know

324
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,640
that your mother was burning with anger

325
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,440
over how the foundation's mission
had been corrupted.

326
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,720
And the child from the foundation
whose heart was skipped for Monmeena

327
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,640
got worse and eventually died!

328
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,000
She confronted me that night.

329
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,600
I couldn't take it anymore.
So, I went to your club!

330
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,680
If I hadn't,
I might've been the one who killed her.

331
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,440
The next morning,

332
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,800
I found out with everyone in the house,
she'd fallen down the stairs and died.

333
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,520
And I don't know anything
about that autopsy report!

334
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,400
If you had any shred of humanity,

335
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,600
my mother wouldn't have died!

336
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,840
Who said I don't have humanity?

337
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,520
I saved Monmeena's life!

338
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,560
If it weren't for me,
she would've died as a child

339
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,480
and never lived long enough
to be your sweetheart.

340
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,600
You should be thanking me, Yai!

341
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,040
I'll kill you, Met.

342
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,240
I'll kill you. I'll kill you, Met!

343
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,720
Then go ahead!

344
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,080
But Monmeena has to die too.

345
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,960
She's the reason your mother died, Yai!

346
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,960
How do you think that kid would feel

347
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,440
after finding out they only survived

348
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,400
because they were one of the VVIPs?

349
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,080
They would feel it was unfair.

350
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,120
Knowing their beating heart

351
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,960
was stolen from someone more deserving.

352
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,440
That feeling…
If it were me, I wouldn't know

353
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,720
how to live with that guilt.

354
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,880
Meena, it wasn't that kid's fault.

355
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,360
That kid was an unfortunate soul,

356
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,000
a tool for those terrible adults.

357
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,680
That's true, from our point of view.

358
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,520
But from that kid's perspective,

359
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,040
it would be a scar they carry forever.

360
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,080
The day I lost my mother,

361
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,160
it was unbearable.

362
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,560
It hurt so much,
I didn't want to keep living.

363
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,160
I don't want
to feel like that again, Meena.

364
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,160
I don't know what really happened.

365
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,880
I just know you want justice
for your mom's death.

366
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,240
And I don't want you to spend
the rest of your life filled with regret.

367
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,000
I'll do anything to help you.

368
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm scared, Meena.

369
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,840
I'm afraid I won't be able
to get justice for Mom.

370
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,640
Mr. Yai, listen to me.

371
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,600
I'll be right here by your side,

372
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,640
no matter what happens.

373
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,720
I'm not going anywhere.

374
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,120
I promise.

375
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,400
I didn't think this day would come.

376
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,520
Do you know that when you disappeared,

377
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,200
I told myself

378
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,000
I'd give anything

379
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,120
just to hold you again?

380
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,920
I'll go now.

381
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,080
Bye.

382
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,080
You betrayed me!

383
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,120
<i>You lied to me.</i>
<i>You didn't go see Doctor Thiti.</i>

384
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,480
MR. YAI

385
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,400
NO SEARCH RESULTS FOR "MR. YAI"

386
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,440
Mr. Yai.

387
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,640
Inthon, can you check
Mr. Yai's location for me?

388
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,600
I want to know where he is.

389
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,240
Dylan, calm down.

390
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,720
- People are watching--
- Don't lecture me!

391
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,280
Do you remember

392
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,800
what you promised me?!

393
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,560
Do you?!

394
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,760
Why didn't you sign
the approval for the hotel's budget?

395
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,160
The project you went and discussed
with Mark behind my back?

396
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,040
Why should I sign it?

397
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,840
Stop being such
an attention-seeking brat, Dylan.

398
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,720
You're the vice chairman. Grow up.

399
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,400
And what you did

400
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,040
was something grown-ups
are supposed to do?

401
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,560
I've been doing my job just fine, and you
brought someone in for me to report to.

402
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,640
Mark is your brother!

403
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,320
He's not my brother.

404
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,520
You can't run
from the truth forever, Dylan.

405
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,120
You shouldn't have held JW hostage.

406
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,760
If you're upset,
you should've talked it out with me.

407
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,320
I don't want a brother.
Just get out of my family.

408
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,680
I don't want to stay that badly.

409
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,720
Then get out!

410
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,800
I'm here as Mark for revenge.

411
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,040
Not for greatness.

412
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,280
Revenge? Have you watched too many movies?

413
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,880
Believe what you want. I've said my piece.

414
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,320
Then prove it.

415
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,960
In exchange for Monmeena,
the woman you love.

416
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,840
You have to stay away from her.
Cut all contact.

417
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,400
If you can do that,

418
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,360
I'll believe
you're really here for revenge.

419
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,920
Deal.

420
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,680
And how do I know you'll actually do it?

421
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,600
If I don't, you can shoot me.

422
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,800
Do you remember what you said?!

423
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,840
You broke our deal,

424
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,960
then die!

425
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,600
<i>Mr. Yai is at this location.</i>

426
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,960
INTHON

427
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,320
SOOPANAVA PORT

428
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,480
Excuse me.

429
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,240
Excuse me.
I need to get to this location. Fast.

430
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,040
Yes.

431
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,160
Mr. Yai. Mr. Yai.

432
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,760
Mr. Yai. Mr. Yai. Dylan.

433
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,240
Where's Mr. Yai?

434
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,880
You're really here.

435
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,800
Did you track his GPS?

436
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,040
I asked you. Where is Mr. Yai?

437
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,640
- Where's Mr. Yai?!
- What was all that between us?

438
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Did you just use me and that's it?

439
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,840
Dylan, I asked you, where's Mr. Yai?
What did you do to him?!

440
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,800
And what is this?!

441
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,400
Don't tell me you killed Mr. Yai, Dylan!

442
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,560
- Did you kill Mr. Yai?!
- I shot him!

443
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,560
I shot him and kicked him into the river.

444
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,560
I'm sorry.

445
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,600
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

446
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,000
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

447
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,000
- Mr. Yai! Let go!
- What are you doing? It's dangerous!

448
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,480
Let go of me! I'm going to help him!

449
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,600
- It's dangerous, Meena!
- Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

450
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,440
Mr. Yai!

451
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,720
- Mr. Yai!
- He's not dead!

452
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,480
I didn't shoot him!

453
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,560
Stop acting crazy!

454
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,680
Mr. Yai…

455
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,440
Mr. Yai!

456
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,720
Hello, Inthon.

457
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,600
I've found Mr. Yai.

458
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
He's safe with me.

459
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,320
Okay. Okay, Inthon…

460
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,320
Mr. Yai.

461
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,560
Dylan. Dylan!

462
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,680
Say what you want to say.

463
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,000
You fooled me.

464
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,760
You agreed to work for me
just to get close to Yai.

465
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,040
You lied to me.

466
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,320
- Tell me you didn't! Tell me--
- Sorry!

467
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,320
I'm sorry.

468
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,200
He really came here
just to take everything away from me.

469
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,520
He came into my family

470
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,600
as the eldest son.

471
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,320
So, my father was ready to hand him
everything that used to be mine.

472
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,240
And now it's you.

473
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,920
Dylan, listen to me.

474
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
Mr. Yai didn't take me from you.

475
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,600
I love him. And I believe he loves me too.

476
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
Yeah?

477
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,360
Do you know what deal he made with me?

478
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,680
He gave you to me
in exchange for his power.

479
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,320
He chose to lead Jongtraipattana
over staying with you!

480
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,200
That's why he acted
like he didn't know you!

481
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,080
Maybe he loves you, but not as much

482
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,640
- as he loves power!
- That's not true!

483
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,160
He brought you in as his fiancée

484
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,440
so you could help him search for the will

485
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,760
because he wanted
to seize power over the Hemaratsiri.

486
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,880
But after he failed,
he started feeding off my family instead.

487
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,440
Seriously, Meena, someone like him?!

488
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,240
You think a guy like that
could ever really love you?

489
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,400
And you still choose him over me?

490
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,200
I…

491
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,240
Do you choose him or me?

492
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,400
Think about it.

493
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,000
If you don't choose me,

494
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,640
then I don't need to care about you.

495
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,280
And it'll be easy
for me to destroy Mekhin.

496
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,760
Let's say

497
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,760
he won't end up in good shape.

498
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,880
You two are brothers by blood.

499
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,320
- Why do you have to kill him?!
- He's not my brother!

500
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,880
Me or him?

501
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,880
Answer me! Me or him?!

502
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,280
I'm sorry.

503
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,720
But I choose Mr. Yai.

504
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,240
And even if I chose you,

505
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,200
you'd realize
my heart only belongs to him.

506
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,840
Remember that, Dylan.

507
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,520
Is there anything
I get to choose for myself?!

508
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,000
Parin!

509
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,800
How could you do this?

510
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,360
You removed me
and Mr. Mote from our positions.

511
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,480
You locked us out
of the hospital and office.

512
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,360
You cut off my paycheck
and cut me off from the family fortune.

513
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,200
I just did what I had to.

514
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,520
I had to protect H Group's reputation.

515
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,280
Reputation?

516
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,080
It was Mr. Mote and I
who built that reputation for H Group.

517
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,440
You're out of line.

518
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,160
Nothing's out of line.

519
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,000
I wasn't talking to you. Shut your mouth.

520
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,760
It's already generous
that I didn't sue you both.

521
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,920
If I didn't care about
the Hemaratsiri name,

522
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,120
you'd both be in jail right now.

523
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,200
What kind of sick doctors
do something like that?

524
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,440
This is basically human organ trafficking.

525
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,600
Transplanting children's hearts
for the rich?

526
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,840
The punishment you deserve is having your
licenses revoked and rotting in prison!

527
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,480
Don't act so righteous, Pa!

528
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,600
Wake up!

529
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,880
Or should I call the cops
and drag you out by your hair?

530
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,280
You and I aren't different. You'd do
anything to take control of Hemaratsiri.

531
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,480
Just wait. Someone as rotten as you

532
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,720
- will end up like me. We're the same.
- Nuan!

533
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,400
- Nuan, let go of me!
- Please stop!

534
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,520
- You bitch!
- That's enough.

535
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,400
That's enough, Mom.

536
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,760
You crazy bitch!

537
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,240
Must be nice being you, huh?

538
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,360
Even now,
you can sit here and enjoy your drinks.

539
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,280
Pa and her son
are about to take everything from you!

540
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,520
Wasn't it because
you approved those VIP cases?

541
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,160
Now we're all in trouble.

542
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,720
Are you blaming me again?!

543
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,840
Wasn't it you who wanted to boost revenue

544
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,200
to prove yourself to this damn family?!

545
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,160
Now is not the time to turn on each other.

546
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,880
Apapat…

547
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,800
I'll get back at you.

548
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,520
I can take anything,

549
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,520
but I can't afford
to lose my medical license.

550
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,880
What do Pramote and Nuanchan's VIP cases

551
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,840
have to do with me?

552
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,000
People see you're close to that family.

553
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,880
And someone dug up the fact that
you're also connected to Mr. Wirot's son,

554
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,400
the one found guilty of money laundering.
So, now it's a mess.

555
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,800
Are they insane?!

556
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So what now? Everything's out of control.

557
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,480
Hey! What's next, lawyer?!

558
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,840
Is it true you were involved

559
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,720
in unethical VIP heart transplants
with Ms. Nuanchan?

560
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,680
You're the lawyer.

561
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,960
Tell me what I need to do.

562
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,880
Whether I was involved or not
is my business.

563
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,000
Don't tell me you can't handle this.

564
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,040
Father.

565
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,000
Risa.

566
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,000
Are you busy today?
I haven't heard from you.

567
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,440
Father's sending me abroad.

568
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,680
- Risa.
- Parin.

569
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,000
Why is your father sending you away?

570
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,000
Is it because of the case?

571
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,320
Yes.

572
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,360
He says he's worried about my safety.

573
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,440
Why did it have to come to this?

574
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,320
Maybe it's because of family.
Even when we did nothing wrong,

575
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,760
If someone in the family did,

576
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,760
we all have to suffer for it.

577
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,080
Risa.

578
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,120
Don't worry. I'll find a way to help you.

579
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,160
I'll do whatever it takes
to keep you from leaving.

580
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,560
My Parin is the best.

581
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,240
You can do anything.

582
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,480
Risa…

583
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,800
I'm here for you, Risa.

584
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,360
I'm here for you too.

585
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,120
Arisa! Come here.

586
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
- I said come here.
- Father…

587
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,640
Why are you here?! Huh?!
What the hell are you doing here?!

588
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,960
Because of all of you,
I ended up like this!

589
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,360
Father…

590
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,120
- Parin was just trying to help.
- Help?

591
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,040
I don't need your help!

592
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,080
Get out, right now,

593
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,840
before I lose my patience
and put a bullet in your head!

594
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,960
- Father!
- Go!

595
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,080
Father!

596
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,640
- I said get out!
- Please leave, Parin. Leave now.

597
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,360
Hey.

598
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,280
Get back inside, right now.

599
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,040
And cut contact with him. Go.

600
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,320
Mr. Yai, Ms. Triprapa is here to see you.

601
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,440
Can I call you Yai now?

602
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,520
Let's cut to the chase.

603
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,600
I want you to help Father
get his freedom back.

604
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,000
Help him return to society.

605
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,000
Why should I help him?

606
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,000
Ever since Grandpa died,
all I had left was you and Father.

607
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,480
Now you hate me,

608
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,560
and Father's a fugitive.

609
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,480
I have no one left.

610
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,560
And I feel bad for him.

611
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,400
Please, Yai.

612
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,880
First of all,

613
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,840
you're the one who hates me.

614
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,320
Don't you remember what you did?

615
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,040
And you know what Pramet did.

616
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,840
Consider this my last request
as your sister.

617
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,200
And I won't bother you ever again.

618
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,920
Even if we're not related by blood,

619
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,240
I've always seen you as my sister.
That hasn't changed.

620
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,520
Thank you.

621
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,040
And about Father…

622
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,040
I'll see what I can do.

623
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,920
Thank you, Yai.

624
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,360
Mr. Yai.

625
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,920
I'm busy. Wait outside.

626
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,000
I said wait outside.

627
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,560
Please.

628
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,560
Mr. Yai.

629
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,840
Are you hurt?

630
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,680
What do you want?

631
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,560
I found out about your deal with Dylan.

632
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,320
Why? Why did you do that?

633
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,560
I've got nothing to say.

634
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,840
I told Dylan I choose you.

635
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,480
Whatever you're planning,

636
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,800
- I'll stand by you.
- Stop babbling nonsense.

637
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,720
Mr. Yai…

638
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,520
You're no longer useful to me.

639
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,920
Don't waste your time.

640
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,680
Mr. Yai…

641
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,520
PULL

642
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,800
Get in. Unless you want to face
the press right now, Aunt Nuan.

643
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,160
Long time no see, Nuanchan.

644
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,240
You resigned from the hospital

645
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,720
to take the fall for your husband.

646
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,160
How nice of you.

647
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,120
But was it worth it?

648
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,040
How do you know Mote won't betray you?

649
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,120
Thanks for picking me up.

650
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,080
I think you should come help me.

651
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,280
We're both in trouble.
We should be helping each other.

652
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,080
I might not completely trust my husband,

653
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,120
but I don't trust you at all.

654
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,840
Really?

655
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,760
Then, let me show you something.

656
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,000
Say what you want.

657
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,120
Transfer all your shares to me,

658
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,280
and I'll make sure
you can keep working as a doctor.

659
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,880
Think about it, Uncle.

660
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,800
Do you really want to lose everything
to Apapat and Parin?

661
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,360
Even your career?

662
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,480
Or do you want to keep it?

663
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,720
All you care about now
is surviving, right?

664
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,640
Aunt Nuan's resigned.
She's definitely going to be charged.

665
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,040
Then let Aunt Nuan take the fall.

666
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,800
No. I can't betray someone I love.

667
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,040
Are you sure

668
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,680
Aunt Nuan's the one you really love?

669
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,760
How do you think she'd react

670
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,240
if she found out you prefer men?

671
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,800
Your father and your wife
have always tried to suppress you.

672
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,800
When Grandpa was alive,
he never acknowledged you.

673
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,440
You were always the outcast.
And once you got married,

674
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,160
you fell under Aunt Nuan's control.

675
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,240
You've never really loved her.

676
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,680
You've only used her
to climb your way to the chairman's seat.

677
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,840
And once you got there,

678
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,400
you were going to leave her anyway.

679
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,160
So, how is this any different
from my offer?

680
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,080
It's only a matter of time
before she sees your true colors.

681
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,120
Think carefully,

682
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,760
is this the right time for your plan?

683
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,320
What are my chances of getting away?

684
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,760
If I let Nuan take the fall
and go to prison,

685
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,720
will I actually survive this?

686
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,360
I promise you…

687
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,760
I'll do everything I can
to help you survive.

688
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,080
Then, let's do it.

689
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,760
Tell me what I need to do.
I'll do anything!

690
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,360
How dare you betray me like this?

691
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,920
Nuan.

692
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,520
Yai!

693
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,160
I heard everything!

694
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,080
You think you can ditch me anytime?

695
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,480
How could you do this to me
after everything I've done for you?

696
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,400
- How could you do this?!
- Nuan! Let me explain!

697
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,000
- It's a family matter now.
- Nuan!

698
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,760
If you'll excuse me.

699
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,640
- How could you do this to me?
- Nuan!

700
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,920
- I did everything for you!
- Hey! Calm down, Nuan!

701
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,320
Now you've got everything you need

702
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,640
to destroy the Hemaratsiris.
So, what are you waiting for?

703
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,600
One of the people who was prioritized
for a heart transplant 13 years ago

704
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,120
was Monmeena.

705
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,040
Meena.

706
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,320
I should've killed you
when I had the chance!

707
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,040
This family fed you,

708
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,320
gave you a place to live for years!

709
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,000
And this is how you repay us?!
You ungrateful dog!

710
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,080
Say that again.

711
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,240
If I tell you the truth,

712
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,480
you have to help me avoid going to prison.

713
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,200
Let's see whose story they believe.

714
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,800
Yours or mine.

715
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,160
<i>If we don't trust each other,</i>
<i>who else can we trust?</i>

716
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:09,200
You're no different from the Hemaratsiris.
You're selfish.

717
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,720
When you're no longer useful,
I just don't want you anymore.

718
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,000
You're disgusting.

719
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
