1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,080
Grandpa's will grants everything to me!

2
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,280
What makes you so sure

3
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,440
your name is really in the will?

4
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,960
Yai!

5
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,000
Hey!

6
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,960
<i>You want me to spare Ou's life</i>

7
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,920
because he's Monmeena's father, don't you?

8
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,400
Can you do what I ask?

9
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
- What if we can't?
- Shut up when grown-ups are talking.

10
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,880
I'm ordering you to work for me.

11
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,920
There's no way I'll betray Mr. Yai.

12
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,840
Some people don't understand
until it's too late.

13
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,200
He went as far as ordering
a car to almost hit you

14
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,320
to threaten me for the will!

15
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,960
Mr. Yai would never do that to me.
You're lying!

16
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,480
Then ask him yourself.

17
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,360
The agreement between us ends now.

18
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,920
I don't want to see you ever again.
Remember that!

19
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,000
‪OPEN 24 HOURS
‪HEAVEN HOSPITAL, READY TO SERVE

20
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,880
Why did you put that call through
from the reporters?

21
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,280
They said they wanted
to interview you about the foundation.

22
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,920
They just wanted to talk about Nate
running off in the middle of the event!

23
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,840
I told you
to screen every single call first.

24
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,960
Is this too hard for you to do?

25
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,760
- I'm sorry, sir.
- You can leave now.

26
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,400
Calm down.

27
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,400
This situation might be good.

28
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,040
Good? Are you insane?

29
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,560
The board's been calling me nonstop,
demanding to know what happened.

30
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,680
Met's scandal

31
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
stole the spotlight from us!

32
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,760
His scandal discredits him.

33
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,760
The board already sees
that he's not fit to lead.

34
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,960
It's good for you.

35
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,200
We've invested so much.

36
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,720
But my name barely made the news.

37
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,720
Met's going to drag all of us down.

38
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,200
When can we finally get rid of him?

39
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,000
Our time will come.

40
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,040
Don't treat me like that.

41
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,960
It makes me feel like
everything I've done for you means nothing

42
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,240
I'm sorry…

43
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,720
I have no more meetings today.

44
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
How about

45
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,560
we go to your favorite restaurant?

46
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,040
And then go home afterward.

47
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,200
Shall we go now?

48
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,320
Sure.

49
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Your coffee, sir, ma'am.

50
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,240
Thank you.

51
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,720
Oh. Isn't that Monmeena's foster brother?

52
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,400
Who?

53
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,880
Dr. Thiti. I've told you about him before.

54
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,920
Want to use the restroom first?
Traffic's bad right now.

55
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,440
Good idea. The driver
can just take the expressway.

56
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,480
I'll be right back.

57
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,400
Your coffee, sir.

58
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,560
- I've already transferred the payment.
- Thank you.

59
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,040
You drink coffee too, Professor?

60
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,120
Extra sweet latte.

61
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,680
Extra sweet?

62
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,800
It's because Monmeena, Mekhin's fiancée,

63
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,280
disappeared
from the charity event last night.

64
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,360
I'm exhausted. I spent the whole day
dealing with the press.

65
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,920
How did Monmeena go missing?

66
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,680
From what I've heard, she was abducted.

67
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,040
No one knows what condition she's in.

68
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,640
You must be worried about your sister.

69
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,640
Oh…

70
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,360
Professor…

71
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,560
Could I ask for your help?

72
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,800
If you hear anything about Monmeena,
please let me know.

73
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,080
Of course. If I hear anything,
I'll call you right away.

74
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,400
Thank you so much.

75
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,360
Professor…

76
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,880
Yes?

77
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,080
Well…

78
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,920
Never mind. Please excuse me.

79
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,920
What were you talking about?

80
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,960
Just checking if Dr. Thiti had heard
anything about Monmeena's disappearance.

81
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Has she contacted her family?

82
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,120
Not at all.

83
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,960
She hasn't reached out
to his family at all.

84
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,960
Then, where on earth is she?

85
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,360
Parin still hasn't found her.

86
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Parin.

87
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,080
Sorry I'm late.

88
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,920
What happened to your face?

89
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,640
Was it because of Ms. Meena
and Ms. Nate's disappearance?

90
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,640
Actually, I asked you to meet me today
because I wanted to ask about that.

91
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,400
But now…

92
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,440
I don't want to hear it anymore.

93
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,480
Why not?

94
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,720
Because you probably don't want to talk
about your family drama.

95
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,520
See?

96
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,760
I'm good at reading people.

97
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,480
Well, since you're already here,

98
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,960
how about being my model for a bit?

99
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,400
I just got a new concept idea
after seeing your face.

100
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,720
That's fine.
But you have to tell me the concept first.

101
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,840
"Wrecked."

102
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,960
Because your face
looks pretty wrecked right now.

103
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,960
Let's do it.

104
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,400
Move over here.

105
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,600
Alright.

106
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,200
Smile again. Make it even more wrecked.

107
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,640
Alright, smile more.

108
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,400
Wow.

109
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,360
That looks way better.

110
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,000
Wow.

111
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,200
This is a relief.

112
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,080
Are you tired?

113
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,240
If you're tired,

114
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,680
take a break.
I'll stay right here with you.

115
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,880
With this cool breeze,
taking a nap sounds perfect.

116
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,120
I won't bother you, then.

117
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,800
Father, you're here.

118
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,200
Has Yai contacted you?

119
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,760
Not at all. No calls, no messages.

120
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,280
I don't know if he's okay.

121
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,800
Good!

122
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,040
Hope the bastard's dead already.

123
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,720
Idiot!

124
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,680
What is this message?

125
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,240
What location?

126
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,680
Nate!

127
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,200
- Damn it.
- Father?

128
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,480
Father, where are you going?

129
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,160
Meena won't change her mind, Dad.

130
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,120
She must have feelings for Mekhin.

131
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,120
She's just a kind person.

132
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,240
She's grateful to Mekhin
for helping her mother.

133
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,400
That's all.

134
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,040
Meena belongs to Mekhin now, Dylan.

135
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,680
You don't stand a chance against him.

136
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,360
That's because I haven't tried.

137
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,400
I don't want you
getting involved with that woman.

138
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,560
Meena is strong and brave.

139
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,680
She's perfect to be the future lady
of the Jongtraipattana family.

140
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,840
If you want to be my successor,

141
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,760
you'll forget about her.

142
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,440
Dad!

143
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,120
Leave now.

144
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,000
Go.

145
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,600
I've sent Pramet Ou's location.

146
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,760
Tell our men who are watching
to wait for my orders.

147
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,360
We can't afford any mistakes this time.

148
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,280
Yes, sir.

149
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,120
Father.

150
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,600
Why are you bringing a gun, Father?

151
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,800
I'm going to blow his head off,
you dumbass!

152
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,200
- Father!
- Open the gate.

153
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,200
Yes, sir.

154
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,760
Father…

155
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,600
Where are you going?

156
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,080
Just let Nate go.

157
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,760
Nate is mine!

158
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,080
They're husband and wife.

159
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,320
And I'm her husband too!

160
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,440
- Father…
- Stay out of this!

161
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,760
If I can't be happy, she won't be either!

162
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
Father.

163
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,760
Father.

164
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,880
Where is Met rushing off to?

165
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,400
Aunt Nuan, how do we stop Father?

166
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,720
What's going on?

167
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,200
He's going after Nate.

168
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,280
And he knows where she is?

169
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,480
Yes.

170
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,920
Mote, are you near home?

171
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,760
Good. I'm waiting for you here with Tri.

172
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,440
We have to go after Met right away.

173
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,080
Meena.

174
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,680
Mr. Yai…

175
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,880
Slowly.

176
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,000
Are you okay?

177
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,440
Does anything still hurt?

178
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,200
I'm sorry.

179
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,800
I'm sorry for lying to you…

180
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,040
for hurting you…

181
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,840
but I had to.

182
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,080
How long have you known
you weren't a Hemaratsiri?

183
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,120
I've always proved myself
as a Hemaratsiri.

184
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,080
You can't stay here.

185
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,880
I found out the day Grandpa died.

186
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,360
He never meant for an outsider like me,

187
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,360
the bastard son of someone unknown,

188
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,280
to inherit the Hemaratsiri legacy.

189
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,200
You know…

190
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,440
I used to think having someone
like Pramet as a father

191
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,880
was like not having one at all.

192
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,720
But it was alright.
At least I still had Grandpa.

193
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,680
That night,

194
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,760
I became someone without a family.

195
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,280
I didn't even know
who my real father was anymore.

196
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,520
So, without H Group,

197
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,240
I had nothing left.

198
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,080
Mr. Yai…

199
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,680
You've felt alone
all this time, haven't you?

200
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,440
It's okay now.

201
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,440
I'm here.

202
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,480
I'll stay by your side.

203
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,720
You've been tired, haven't you?

204
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,360
It's alright now.

205
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,120
I'll talk to my father.

206
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,040
I'll make sure you get that will.

207
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,440
You've forgiven me?

208
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,000
If you ever lie to me again,

209
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,200
I'll never forgive you.

210
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,280
From now on, I won't lie to you anymore.

211
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,760
I promise.

212
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,680
No more secrets between us, alright?

213
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,040
Mote, hurry. Don't lose him.

214
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
I'm trying!

215
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,760
Just keep your eyes on his car.

216
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,000
Inthon?

217
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,120
We've got a problem, Mr. Yai.

218
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,600
Ms. Tri, Mr. Yai is listening.

219
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,520
Dad found out where Nate is.

220
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,080
How did he find out?

221
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,280
Someone sent him a location,
but we don't know who.

222
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,240
Uncle Mote and I are following him.

223
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,720
He has a gun.

224
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,160
<i>What should we do?</i>

225
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,080
Why hasn't Meena come back yet?

226
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,840
Ou…

227
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,240
What if Meena chooses Mr. Yai?

228
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,400
No. It can't be Mekhin.

229
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,040
I've known Mr. Yai for a long time.
He's not a bad person.

230
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,800
He's always been good to Meena.

231
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,160
I truly believe

232
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,880
he will protect her
from the rest of the Hemaratsiri family.

233
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,320
Even Chairman Preeda didn't survive.

234
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,240
He didn't just die

235
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
from some illness
like they claimed, right?

236
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,760
How do you know that? Or…

237
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,000
I didn't kill him.

238
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,400
But that lawyer, Pornchai, thought I did.

239
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
That's why he went crawling
to Parin for help.

240
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,640
But Chairman Wang's men got to him first.

241
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,160
Even the leader of the Hemaratsiri family
could be killed.

242
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,600
And Chairman Wang has his sights set

243
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,880
on wiping
the Hemaratsiri name off the map.

244
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,000
Do you really want our daughter

245
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,880
caught in the middle of this storm?

246
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,560
Nate?

247
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,000
- Nate.
- I feel dizzy.

248
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,840
Let's go rest inside.

249
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,880
That's Dad's car.

250
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,320
Dad's not here.
What do we do now, Uncle Mote?

251
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,720
Tri, are you sure he brought a gun?

252
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,720
I saw it with my own eyes.

253
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,760
He's definitely planning
to kill Nate and her husband.

254
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,600
Mote, don't you want the board
to finally get rid of Mate?

255
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,520
I think we need to call the police.

256
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,080
- But if this makes the news…
- Hey.

257
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,680
Between the family's reputation

258
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,080
or stopping him from becoming a murderer,
what's more important?

259
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,720
I'll call Minister Noppachai for help.

260
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,000
Don't go.

261
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,120
Stay here. It's dangerous.

262
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,640
Hello. I need to report

263
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,040
a potential murder.

264
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,480
Rest for a bit.

265
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,080
I'll go find Meena and bring her home.

266
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,520
Ou…

267
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,800
No matter what you think,

268
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,600
I want Meena to decide for herself
when it comes to Mr. Yai.

269
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,440
Alright, just rest now.

270
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,880
- Mr. Met?
- Pramet!

271
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,760
Father!

272
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,600
- Father!
- Tri, don't go! It's dangerous.

273
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,360
- Father!
- No!

274
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,320
Father!

275
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,520
Ou!

276
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,720
- Ou!
- Come here!

277
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,280
Nate!

278
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,840
You dared run away from me?

279
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,160
Come here.

280
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,040
Pramet!

281
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,800
You gonna shoot me?

282
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,440
Then Nate takes the first bullet!

283
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,240
Let my wife go!

284
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,120
She's my wife too.

285
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,480
She's mine!

286
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,840
- Father!
- Tri, no.

287
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,760
- No, Tri. It's dangerous.
- Father! He's inside.

288
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,120
- Tri!
- Calm down.

289
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,040
- No!
- Father!

290
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
Mom!

291
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,560
- Father!
- Mom!

292
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,280
Let go of me!

293
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,240
If I just get rid of you,

294
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,520
then Nate will be all mine.

295
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,640
Father!

296
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Stomach shot.

297
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
Arm shot.

298
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,280
Leg shot.

299
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,360
The only part left is your head.

300
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,720
Nate!

301
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,240
You crazy bitch!

302
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,960
Damn!

303
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,400
Damn it.

304
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,120
Are you crazy?

305
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,760
- Let go of me!
- Father!

306
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,520
- Meena.
- Let go!

307
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,000
- Let go of me!
- Father!

308
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,520
Pramet.

309
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,200
I won't tolerate you anymore.

310
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,560
If I have to die tonight,
then I'm taking you with me!

311
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,840
Nate!

312
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,520
Enough.

313
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,800
- Mom!
- Father!

314
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,880
- Father!
- Mom!

315
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,560
- Don't go, Meena!
- Father!

316
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,440
Why did you involve the police
in Uncle Met's case?

317
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,840
Yeah.

318
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,000
I've been getting nonstop calls
from reporters.

319
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,240
You should be thanking me.

320
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,520
I took out Pramet,
the one who could inherit everything

321
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,280
if we can't find the will.

322
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,840
That still leaves Yai.

323
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,960
Mr. Yai's already tarnished by a scandal.

324
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,480
No matter how capable he is,

325
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,960
the board won't trust a leader
surrounded by controversy,

326
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,560
whether it's from Met or Mr. Yai.

327
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,880
And if we nudge things just right,

328
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,760
stir up enough trouble…

329
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,680
I think

330
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,680
taking him down won't be too hard.

331
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,200
Not bad.

332
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,080
Now that Ou is dead,

333
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,680
no one will ever find the will.

334
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,680
Fine.

335
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,560
I'll start working on the board members.

336
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,840
And I

337
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,920
will push for the VIP hospital project

338
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,400
of yours.

339
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,280
If I had just listened to Dad
and taken Mom to Chiang Rai,

340
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,600
they wouldn't have died.

341
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,760
This is all my fault!

342
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,080
It's my fault, Mr. Yai!

343
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,920
- It's all my fault.
- Meena.

344
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,120
It's not your fault.

345
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,520
Why?

346
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,040
The police found two bodies at the scene.

347
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,560
<i>Last night, a fire broke out</i>

348
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,120
<i>at an auto shop in Pathumthani.</i>

349
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,480
<i>After three hours,</i>

350
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,720
<i>the fire was brought under control.</i>

351
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,920
<i>At the scene, authorities</i>
<i>discovered two charred bodies</i>

352
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,520
<i>that have not yet been identified.</i>

353
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,960
<i>In addition,</i>

354
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,440
<i>security footage</i>
<i>from a dashcam at the scene</i>

355
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,920
<i>captured footage</i>
<i>of Mr. Pramet Hemaratsiri, H Group's heir,</i>

356
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,200
<i>entering the premises with a gun.</i>

357
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,080
<i>The incident is suspected to be linked</i>

358
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,320
- <i>to a love triangle.</i>
- Turn it off.

359
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,800
Mr. Yai.

360
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,160
You need to go to the police station
to give a statement.

361
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,760
Listen to me, Meena.

362
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,800
I need to go see the police.

363
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,840
I'll come back to you as soon as I can.

364
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,560
MOM

365
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,280
Mom?

366
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,880
Mom.

367
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,920
Where are you?

368
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,920
Mom, can you hear me? Where are you?

369
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,520
Mom…

370
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,120
Mom, are you okay?

371
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,360
Mom, do you hear me?

372
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,240
- Mom…
- Monmeena…

373
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,160
I already warned you.

374
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,680
Chairman Wang…

375
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,440
Mom…

376
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,400
Dad…

377
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,800
The picture you sent…

378
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,880
It's real, isn't it?
Where are Mom and Dad?

379
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,040
Now you truly understand what it means

380
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,480
to see a coffin.

381
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,719
Do you want to face a second one?

382
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,000
I surrender.

383
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,679
I give up.

384
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,360
I'll do whatever you ask.

385
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,719
Just please…

386
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:59,000
let my parents go.

387
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,520
I'll do anything.

388
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,880
The only way to save them…

389
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,200
is to do exactly as I say.

390
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,840
Understand?

391
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,560
This way, please.

392
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,480
Why did you insist on leaving
the hospital and bringing me here?

393
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,160
I want to end this nightmare.

394
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,680
I'm going to keep my promise to you.

395
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,640
The will is under here.

396
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,760
Under this wreckage, there's a metal box.

397
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,080
How do you know?

398
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,760
Dad said if something happened,
to grab the steel box under the rubble.

399
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,720
When I heard about the will,
I think it's there.

400
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,560
Here it is, sir.

401
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,880
It needs a passcode.

402
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,120
The passcode is my birthday.

403
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,080
PREEDA HEMARATSITI

404
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,520
Grandpa's signature…

405
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,320
Mr. Yai, aren't you going to read it?

406
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,480
There's no need.

407
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,120
The real will no longer exists.

408
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,160
If you hear from Meena,
please let me know immediately.

409
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,360
Yes, thank you.

410
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,880
Still no news from Meena?

411
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,640
Meena must be devastated.

412
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,520
She's spent her whole life
searching for her parents,

413
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,680
and now, after finally finding them,
they're gone.

414
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,040
I feel so helpless.

415
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,160
Aunt Jai…

416
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,560
Meena!

417
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,280
Meena, are you hurt? Are you okay?

418
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,240
- Are you hurt?
- I'm okay.

419
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,680
Just a little bruised.

420
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,400
Really?

421
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,800
I want Meena to stay here for a while.

422
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,560
She's family.

423
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,520
An outsider like you

424
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,920
doesn't need to ask
our permission for her.

425
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,240
There's no need.

426
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,200
Dr. Ti…

427
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,360
Why would you stop me?

428
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,880
Because of him, you've been
in danger over and over again!

429
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,360
I'm sorry.

430
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,600
I promise you,

431
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,280
from now on, I won't let anything
happen to Meena again.

432
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,000
I'll do my best to protect her.

433
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,800
You're going into a battlefield tomorrow.
I can't go with you.

434
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,120
If I were weak,
I'd have died when I was three.

435
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,360
Why are you making jokes now?

436
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,840
Hey.

437
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,760
Don't worry.

438
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,600
I'll take care of them
and come right back for you.

439
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,120
Get some sleep tonight, okay?
And don't forget to take your medicine.

440
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
Alright.

441
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,120
I'll go now.

442
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,800
Do you love him?

443
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,400
Dr. Ti…

444
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,960
He's a mafia.

445
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,240
Being with him means
your life will be in danger.

446
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,280
He does what he has to do.

447
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,280
These people survive through dirty deals.

448
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,840
He doesn't deserve you.

449
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,160
Dr. Ti.

450
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,160
This is my heart. My choice.

451
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,520
I'm tired.

452
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,720
I'll head inside now.

453
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,080
Dr. Ti…

454
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,640
I've always seen you as family.

455
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,800
And I want you

456
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,880
to always be my beloved brother.

457
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,280
Next week, contact Attorney Thatsanai.

458
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,040
Tell him I'm filing
to become the estate administrator.

459
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,520
But Attorney Thatsanai
has close ties to Mr. Parin's family.

460
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,520
That's exactly why I want him. I'll show
them who holds the real power in H Group.

461
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,040
Mr. Yai,

462
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,600
all the heads of the accounting
departments across H Group are here.

463
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,400
You want us to compile
a full financial report

464
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,640
on all H Group's assets?

465
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,600
Does Director Pramote

466
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,720
know about this?

467
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,480
I need to notify Mr. Parin first.

468
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,640
We need to follow protocol.

469
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,480
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble.

470
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,280
And how do you plan
to explain what I found?

471
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,000
The hospital's contributions shrink every
year, while its revenue keeps growing.

472
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,360
Where is that money going?

473
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,160
And these land purchases for Heaven Home…

474
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,640
Quite a few of them are dodging taxes.

475
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,280
Any explanation?

476
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,920
Being fired

477
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,600
or going to prison…

478
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,120
Which would you prefer?

479
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,280
I…

480
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,640
I'll have the report ready
within this week, sir.

481
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,400
What about you?

482
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,880
I can do it, sir.

483
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,160
Why did Mekhin contact you, Attorney?

484
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,320
Parin.

485
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,680
I'll call you back.

486
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,200
What is it, Mom?

487
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,840
Yai just called a board meeting
without informing us.

488
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,040
I've called this meeting today

489
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,440
because many of you are concerned about
the news involving my father, Mr. Pramet.

490
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,720
There are concerns about how this
might affect our businesses.

491
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,640
Today, I will be presenting
our first-quarter financial results,

492
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,640
along with updates on the ongoing cocktail
lounge project under my supervision.

493
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,000
How did Yai call a meeting
without us even knowing?

494
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,840
Because the board is still deciding
whether to support us or Mekhin.

495
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,280
They're calculating
who can bring them the most benefit.

496
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,320
Let's go inside.

497
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,520
Regarding the cocktail lounge project--

498
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,360
Mr. Mekhin, you called a board meeting,

499
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,320
yet it seems you were careless.

500
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,280
You didn't invite everyone.

501
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,560
That was intentional.

502
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,600
I was afraid the four of you
would feel uncomfortable,

503
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,080
since the company's first-quarter profits
have dropped by 25% compared to last year.

504
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,400
That's due to the economic downturn.

505
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,640
Every business is struggling right now.

506
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,000
Except for H Club,

507
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,880
which saw a 20% increase
in profits this quarter.

508
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,120
I understand your concerns,

509
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,880
watching our profits decline

510
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,080
year after year from Heaven Home.

511
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,920
As I said,

512
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,880
it's because the top management position

513
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,240
is still vacant.

514
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,440
That's why I'm stepping forward

515
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,360
to take on the role of H Group Chairman.

516
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,760
You have no right to make that decision.

517
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,440
As the eldest grandson
of the Hemaratsiri family,

518
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,560
I have a birthright
that neither the second son…

519
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,600
nor the youngest grandson can claim.

520
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,240
Now that both Grandpa and Father
are gone, it's my duty to lead.

521
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,120
It's a long-standing tradition.

522
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,080
No.

523
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,280
You need to wait
until we open the will first.

524
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,280
You should honor
your grandfather's final wishes,

525
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,920
not force your way in like this.

526
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,520
Then open it.

527
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,480
Open the will.

528
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,200
I'll abide by whatever it says.

529
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,480
Or we could settle this
through a democratic process,

530
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,680
by letting everyone decide.

531
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,840
Tomorrow, we'll hold a formal vote
to elect the next Chairman of H Group

532
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,960
to move the company forward.

533
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,600
If you agree with my proposal,

534
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,600
please raise your hand to vote.

535
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,960
Wait.

536
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Weren't we in agreement
that you would back us?

537
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,280
Why did you vote for Mekhin's proposal?

538
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,400
We needed certainty. This uncertainty

539
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,520
is freezing up
H Group's entire operations.

540
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,160
You said we wouldn't have to wait long,
but ever since the Chairman's passing,

541
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,800
revenues have dropped,

542
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,800
and the company's value has been falling.

543
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,800
We had to choose

544
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,840
what's best for business.

545
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,520
But…

546
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,120
Hmm.

547
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,000
You told me you had all the board members

548
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,840
wrapped around your little finger.

549
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,880
How did you lobby them exactly?

550
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,720
Mr. Yai can just snap his fingers
and have the entire board in his pocket.

551
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,400
You talked like you had a brain,
but you're just empty-headed.

552
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,080
You're no better.

553
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,880
If you had a better option,
why did you ask for my help?

554
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,760
Is there no way to kick Mr. Yai
out of H Group?

555
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,640
Even with Pramet on the run,

556
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,520
the board still sees Yai
as the strongest candidate.

557
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,400
So, your plan is to use the board's vote
to climb into the chairman's seat?

558
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,560
Since we can't find the will,

559
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,400
using the rules
is the only logical solution.

560
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,600
Yai, the inheritance of Hemaratsiri,

561
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,320
Grandpa decided that himself.
You have no right to cross that line.

562
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,440
Upset, are you?

563
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,200
The feast was almost in your mouth,

564
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,240
but I kicked it away first.

565
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,520
What are you talking about?

566
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,160
I'm talking about you pushing
this VVIP hospital project

567
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,960
and lining your pockets from
the construction. Thought I wouldn't know?

568
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,640
You can't hide your greed.

569
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:43,080
International patients
are pouring into Thailand every year.

570
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,520
The long-term profits will be huge--

571
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,200
You're defending him this much?

572
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,840
Do you need his support that badly?

573
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,200
Lek.

574
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,560
If you take over management,

575
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,720
H Group will collapse.

576
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,400
The only one
who's going to collapse is you.

577
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,360
Once the will is read,

578
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,200
I'll expose all your dirty secrets.

579
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,600
Ou is dead. Don't forget that.

580
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,320
Without the will, you have nothing.

581
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,440
In the board's eyes,

582
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,600
you'll always be beneath me.

583
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,960
From what we saw today,

584
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,280
if you don't find a way to destroy him
in front of the board,

585
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,760
you'll stay beneath him forever.

586
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,360
MR. YAI

587
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,400
Mr. Yai, how are you?

588
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,800
Tomorrow, I'll be chairman of H Group.

589
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,480
I'm coming to pick you up.
We're celebrating tonight.

590
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,440
Alright.

591
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,600
Meena! What's wrong?

592
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,400
Why are you crying?

593
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,840
What happened?

594
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,240
Aunt Jai…

595
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,800
What should I do?

596
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,480
He's going to hate me.

597
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,080
He'll never forgive me
if he finds out the truth.

598
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,200
Tell me, sweetheart.

599
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,560
Tell me.

600
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,720
Chairman Wang…

601
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,840
forced me.

602
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,240
He tricked me.

603
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,960
He tricked me into doing so many things.

604
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,680
I didn't want to.

605
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,520
I didn't want to lie to him.

606
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,760
I love him.

607
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,840
He'll hate me forever.

608
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,680
I didn't mean to do it.

609
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,040
Meena, what do you truly feel
for Mr. Mekhin?

610
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,800
You just like him?

611
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,880
You have feelings for him? Or…

612
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,520
I love him.

613
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,760
I want to see him succeed.

614
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,800
But I don't know what to do.

615
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,520
Can we tell Mr. Mekhin the truth?

616
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,360
No!

617
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,240
My parents are still
in Chairman Wang's hands.

618
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,720
He's ruthless.

619
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,920
I can't risk it.

620
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,640
Meena…

621
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,680
I think you need to find another way.

622
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,640
If Mr. Mekhin finds out the truth

623
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,800
about your betrayal,

624
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,120
you might lose him forever.

625
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:14,920
Meena.

626
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,680
Mr. Mekhin.

627
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,000
Did you cry?

628
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,560
I was just…

629
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,920
thinking about my parents.

630
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,560
You're taking Meena
to the penthouse, aren't you?

631
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,720
Yes. You don't need to worry, Aunt Jai.

632
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,600
No matter what happens,

633
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,440
I hope you'll protect her

634
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,760
and never hurt her.

635
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,000
I would never hurt the woman I love.

636
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,720
Alright.

637
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,880
I'm glad to hear that.

638
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,680
Please take care of her.

639
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,200
I will. Don't worry.

640
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,120
Let's go.

641
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,200
<i>You sold yourself to live here.</i>

642
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,840
And now you're trying to play the victim?

643
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,320
<i>Marry me.</i>

644
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,440
<i>Today, I will oversee</i>

645
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,280
<i>the voting process</i>
<i>for the new Chairman of H Group.</i>

646
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,000
As soon as my parents are safe,

647
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,640
I'll tell you the truth.

648
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,000
<i>You're more capable than I thought.</i>

649
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,400
By now, everyone
must have seen the real will.

650
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,000
How do you have the real will?

651
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,840
We have found the official will
of Mr. Preeda Hemaratsiri.

652
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,560
You don't have any more
objections, do you?

653
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,320
<i>You've completely destroyed Mekhin's life.</i>

654
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,760
Your father would be proud

655
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:28,880
<i>to see you earn that seat</i>
<i>through your own merit.</i>

656
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,320
A seat that no matter how hard Yai tries,

657
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,920
he'll never claim.

658
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,120
How the hell is this possible?!

659
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,640
<i>I trusted you. I believed in you.</i>

660
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,000
<i>Why did you betray me, Meena?</i>

661
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,800
Why did you betray me, Meena? Why?!

662
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,800
