1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,120
We have a very special guest.

2
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,960
- <i>Wang.</i>
- Mr. Pramet.

3
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,120
You!

4
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,840
<i>I knew it.</i>
<i>You didn't just come here for dinner.</i>

5
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,240
What do you really want?

6
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,080
Someone in the Hemaratsiri family
is not normal.

7
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,240
There's a sadist here!

8
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,200
We might have a chance
to get your mother out.

9
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,400
What do I need to do?

10
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,320
<i>If you don't leave,</i>
<i>I'll break Nate's bones!</i>

11
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,200
Then I'll break yours in return.

12
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,160
You'd really harm your own father?

13
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,560
Have you ever acted like a father to me?

14
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,160
This is Ms. Arisa.
You should get to know her.

15
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,800
Because she's about to become

16
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,560
Mekhin's fiancée.

17
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,560
But I worry that people will see Monmeena
as a leech clinging to wealth.

18
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,080
A leech is still better than a parasite.

19
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,440
I just want her to see that
as long as she stands by Yai,

20
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,880
her life will be a living hell.

21
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,280
Why are you two here?

22
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,760
Let's talk somewhere else.
I don't want my son to see this.

23
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,560
Hey, don't be so scared, Aunty.

24
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,520
We won't harm you.

25
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,200
Aren't you here to collect the debt?

26
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,800
I told you I wouldn't skip out.
Alright? Just give me some time

27
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,520
to juggle my finances. Please.

28
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,960
- Please.
- Why would you need to?

29
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,280
Why didn't you tell us
you know someone important

30
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,520
at H Club?

31
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,640
That way, we wouldn't have
even needed to get violent.

32
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,680
You wasted time
and got yourself hurt for nothing.

33
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,040
Someone important at H Club?

34
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,720
Why are you still confused?

35
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,760
The club owner was kind enough
to pay off all of your debt.

36
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,399
You're getting off easy now.

37
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,720
You're so damn lucky.

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,920
If you ever need money again,

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,480
just let us know.

40
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,680
What? Just go.

41
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,320
- Get out of here.
- Let's go.

42
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,000
Could Meena and Mr. Mekhin really be…?

43
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,720
Hey.

44
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,040
Your family's dining table
is really never peaceful.

45
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,640
I was about to fight for you.
Why did you stop me?

46
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,080
Because Mr. Pramet was calm today,
but with the intent to kill.

47
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,000
If you stood up against him,
he would just say that

48
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,920
being in love with a lowlife
made you act like one.

49
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,600
Also, today I saw

50
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,080
that Mr. Mote and Ms. Tri
get along so well.

51
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,880
There are enemies at every turn.
You'll just exhaust yourself.

52
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,920
We'd better sit back
and watch them put on a show.

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,160
That'll be fun.

54
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,080
That's a relief.

55
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,080
Yai.

56
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
You go ahead.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes.

58
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,840
You should've stayed
until Mr. Noppachai left.

59
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,440
I hope you haven't forgotten

60
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,920
that because of his protection,

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,240
no one dares to mess with H Club.

62
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,160
- If he's unhappy--
- He wouldn't mind me, Tri.

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,560
I've given him so much.

64
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,920
And why did you have to be
so rude to Meena?

65
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,520
- Did Dad tell you to?
- Father just wanted you to realize

66
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,240
what kind of woman is truly worthy of you.

67
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,600
If you don't agree with that,
you should've just kept quiet.

68
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,280
But I agree.

69
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,520
Monmeena isn't worthy of you.

70
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,280
If you choose her,
she'll only drag you down.

71
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,560
There's no such thing
as up or down like that, Tri.

72
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,760
We humans are equal.

73
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,520
We're not equal.

74
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,160
We're wealthier.

75
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,880
She's just looking to live off you
to have a better life. Disgusting.

76
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,120
Triprapa.

77
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,480
You shouldn't judge Monmeena
if you don't know her well enough.

78
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,360
A woman who moved in with a man
before marriage?

79
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,360
If you want me
to think highly of her, I can't.

80
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,680
If you ask me who's worthy of you…

81
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,200
I didn't choose her because she's worthy.

82
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,080
I chose her because I love her.

83
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,240
But I don't want you
to be with that woman.

84
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,760
This is my life.

85
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,440
I can choose for myself.

86
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,480
And I won't tolerate you
belittling Monmeena again.

87
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,600
Pack it and send it
to the foundation for me.

88
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,600
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

89
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,240
You always seem
to take photos of this flower.

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,520
Its Xyris indica.

91
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,400
A weed that always competes
with rice stalks for space and resources.

92
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,200
I love them

93
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,480
because they're just like me.

94
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,560
How so?

95
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,440
They're just weeds with no use,

96
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,880
other than looking cute.

97
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,160
Looking cute is accurate,

98
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,640
but I don't agree
with the "having no use" part.

99
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,160
Is it that obvious

100
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,720
that Father is using me for something?

101
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,160
I didn't mean it like that.

102
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,560
I love taking photos.

103
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,200
When I look at the pictures I've taken,

104
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,920
I often remind myself that,

105
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,720
"Yeah,

106
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,559
I've got some time free
from my father's influence as well."

107
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,919
I think it's kind of him

108
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,960
to let me have some time away
from the power game he's so fond of.

109
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,960
Photography

110
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,080
is the purest form of happiness for me.

111
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
But today,

112
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,240
Father used my photos

113
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,880
to negotiate a connection
with the Hemaratsiris.

114
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,960
It was a wake-up call.

115
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,680
I understand you.

116
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,480
Thank you for trying to understand me.

117
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
You're not the only one

118
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,000
desperate for freedom.

119
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,440
Parin.

120
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,440
But I'm not Xyris indica.

121
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,560
Because they're cute,

122
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,840
but I'm very handsome.

123
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,320
Risa, why are you laughing?

124
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,000
Risa?

125
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,840
What's so funny? I told the truth.

126
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,320
Risa.

127
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,320
You think I'm not really handsome?

128
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,920
Before I flew back here,

129
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,480
I saw the news that you were appointed
CEO of Heaven Home.

130
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,840
Seeing you again,

131
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,640
you've changed so much,
I don't know how to react.

132
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,120
I'm just more mature.

133
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,840
I've changed my style, my position.

134
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,240
But deep inside,

135
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,120
I've remained the same

136
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,240
from the day we first met until now.

137
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,240
Parin.

138
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,560
Oh.

139
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,720
Are you still here, Risa?

140
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,240
Mr. Noppachai has been waiting
in the car for a while now.

141
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,080
Yes.

142
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,720
Ever since he became the CEO
of Heaven Home, he's been really busy.

143
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,000
Next year, we're aiming

144
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,400
to launch ten new development projects
worth around 30 billion baht.

145
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,720
Yes.

146
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,440
So, every minute is valuable to him.

147
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,040
He might not have time to personally
see someone off for so long again.

148
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,480
Mom!

149
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,480
Then, I'll take my leave now.

150
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,320
Father must be waiting,
as you said, Aunt Pa.

151
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,840
Goodbye. Goodbye.

152
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
Risa.

153
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,960
Mom.

154
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,880
Why did you say
something like that to her?

155
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,840
You know very well

156
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,640
that Mr. Noppachai
is more than impressed by Yai.

157
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,880
If you're looking to be with Risa,
it'll be difficult.

158
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,960
He couldn't stop praising Yai.

159
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,240
I really want to know,

160
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,480
if the will is read and you become
the Hemaratsiri chairman,

161
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320
would he still find Yai worthy?

162
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,520
Then we need to find the will quickly.

163
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,440
Aunt Bua.

164
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,560
Did something happen? You called for me.

165
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,320
Ms. Tri has been on her knees,

166
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,080
crying in front of the chairman's portrait
ever since she spoke with Mr. Yai.

167
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,000
Did they have a fight?

168
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,440
Before bringing her in,

169
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,160
you never introduced her to me
or told me anything about her.

170
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,440
I think this all seems too strange.

171
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,400
Even if I marry her,

172
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,440
you'll remain
the most important person to me.

173
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,440
It's just the two of us siblings.

174
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,920
In this house,

175
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,560
I don't trust anyone but you.

176
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,560
Me too.

177
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,040
I have only you, Yai.

178
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,240
No matter what happens,
I'll always be by your side.

179
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,720
<i>This is my life.</i>

180
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
I can choose for myself.

181
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,520
And I won't tolerate you
belittling Monmeena again.

182
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,840
I don't think you're the one
I was supposed to meet.

183
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,200
Dad's busy, so he sent me instead.

184
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,360
Let's get this over with.

185
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,480
Being around you for too long
makes me uncomfortable.

186
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,040
Probably the only thing we agree on.

187
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,280
Wedding invitation?

188
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,120
What if it is?

189
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,320
Would you congratulate me
or feel sorry for me?

190
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,160
I'd congratulate you.

191
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,840
But my condolences to Monmeena.

192
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,440
I can still throw a punch here.

193
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,440
HONEST HEART FOUNDATION'S
30TH ANNIVERSARY PARTY

194
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,360
A fundraiser for charity?

195
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,200
Your company is a major sponsor.
We had to invite you.

196
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,480
I'm being honored by Mr. Mekhin himself?

197
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,080
YOU'RE CORDIALLY INVITED
MR. WANG JONGTRAIPATTANA AND FAMILY

198
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,520
Bring this card to Chairman Wang.

199
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,440
It's his personal invitation.

200
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,680
AUNT BUA

201
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,240
You're not eating anything.

202
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,880
Are you starving yourself to death, Nate?

203
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,920
Eat.

204
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,920
Eat it.

205
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,280
I told you to eat. Open your mouth.

206
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,680
Just eat!

207
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,920
Damn it!

208
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,920
Is this how you plan to beat me, huh?

209
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,800
Is this how you want to do it?

210
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,280
If you can't come
to the fundraiser with me,

211
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,160
I'll make your life a living hell.

212
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll expose Meena

213
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,000
in front of the media.

214
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,200
I'll make sure the scandal
drives her into hiding.

215
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,680
And eventually,

216
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,160
she'll end up nothing more
than a mistress, just like you!

217
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,120
Do you understand?!

218
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,640
Eat it!

219
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,440
Eat!

220
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,040
You already know someone like me

221
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,480
can ruin anyone's life if I want to!

222
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,280
Eat!

223
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,680
<i>But it doesn't matter now…</i>

224
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,440
<i>because I'm here with you.</i>

225
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,880
I want you to be happy.

226
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,319
Please, come with me.

227
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,840
So you don't have to live
through this anymore.

228
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,360
I'll never let my daughter

229
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,440
suffer the same fate as me.

230
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
She hasn't stopped crying?

231
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,280
She probably has,

232
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,720
but still doesn't want to come out.

233
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,320
Mr. Yai.

234
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,000
Why don't you go in and talk to her?

235
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,360
I don't want to cause
a rift between siblings.

236
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,000
What's the matter, hmm?

237
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,920
I thought you didn't want to talk to me

238
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,240
or love me anymore.

239
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,920
How could I not love you?

240
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,160
You're my sister, Tri.

241
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,440
Since that woman came around,
you've been different.

242
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,360
She took your love away from me.

243
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,440
Tri.

244
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,720
Listen to me.

245
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,080
No one can take away
the love I have for you.

246
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,520
We're family.

247
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,480
And family means

248
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,320
we take care of each other.

249
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,280
We love each other forever.

250
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
Right?

251
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,440
I'm hungry. Let's eat something.

252
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,080
Come on. Get up.

253
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,600
Get up.

254
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,720
Can you promise me?

255
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,480
No matter what happens,

256
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
promise me you won't abandon me.

257
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,280
Tri.

258
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,760
I promise…

259
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,080
I'll never abandon you.

260
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,120
You promised me.

261
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,000
I promised you.

262
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,880
Is the car ready?

263
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Yes, sir.

264
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,280
Once we're out, I'll drive Ms. Meena
and Ms. Nate to the Khao Yai house.

265
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,560
I found out

266
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,640
that Mr. Met hired bodyguards
to keep watch tomorrow.

267
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,560
He won't let Ms. Nate out of his sight.

268
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,280
If that's the case, I'll find a way.

269
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,440
Get ready for your parts.

270
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,640
Right.

271
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,320
Mr. Yai.

272
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,880
I'm so afraid our plan will fail.

273
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,520
Trust me.

274
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,680
I have to now that
you're touching my face like this.

275
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,760
We'll succeed.

276
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,800
We'll succeed.

277
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,080
THE DAY OF THE FUNDRAISER

278
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,680
Just a little more.

279
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,680
Tell me if it hurts.

280
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,200
Make her look stunning.

281
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,560
Cover all the bruises
on her face with foundation.

282
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,560
What about the ones
on her neck and arms, sir?

283
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,840
If you see bruises, cover them up.

284
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,400
Do I have to spell it out for you?!

285
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,200
Right.

286
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,920
Let me do your neck.

287
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,280
Mr. Met, here are some snacks.

288
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,760
Put them down over there.
You want me to carry them for you?

289
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,880
Clear out the kitchen.

290
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,920
The family probably
won't be back for dinner tonight.

291
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,360
Yes.

292
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,640
<i>Ms. Nate is outside.</i>
<i>Mr. Pramet is dressing her up.</i>

293
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,920
MR. YAI

294
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,960
Yes, Aunt Bua?

295
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,160
Okay. Thank you so much.

296
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,600
Mr. Yai, is Mom really
going to attend the fundraiser?

297
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,960
You're looking good.

298
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,320
Mr. Yai.

299
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,360
They're dressing your mom up.

300
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,720
So, she'll be at the fundraiser, right?

301
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,920
Right?

302
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,440
Inthon has prepared everything.

303
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,240
And did Chairman Wang respond?

304
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,720
Are you feeling nauseous, sir?
Bring it here.

305
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,480
Is Dad still suffering
from the side effects?

306
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,840
Doctor gave him a more potent medicine.

307
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,480
The chemotherapy is likely
to cause more side effects this time.

308
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,000
Please lie down, sir.

309
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,200
THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 30TH

310
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,880
Tell Dad that I'm going to attend
Mekhin's fundraiser in his place.

311
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,320
Yes.

312
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,320
Dylan.

313
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,920
What did Mekhin want?

314
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,000
He sent you the invitation for
the fundraiser for his mom's foundation.

315
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,240
It's tonight.

316
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
Give me the card.

317
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,160
You're not in any condition to go.
I'll go in your place.

318
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,240
Give it to me.

319
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,920
YOU'RE CORDIALLY INVITED
30TH ANNIVERSARY OF HONEST HEART

320
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,200
Give me my phone.

321
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,520
Don't you hear me?

322
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,440
UNLOCK
12:16

323
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,680
MEKHIN

324
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,320
<i>Help me with my plan,</i>

325
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,360
<i>and you'll get to take revenge on Pramet.</i>

326
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,400
Mr. Yai, we should get
to the fundraiser now,

327
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,000
so I can get ready.

328
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,200
Have some of this.

329
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,080
I don't know when we'll be able
to eat at the fundraiser.

330
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,400
- I'm not hungry.
- Don't be stubborn.

331
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,600
Well, sit down.

332
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,520
Try it. It's not too sweet.

333
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,600
Here.

334
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,400
No. I'm really not hungry.

335
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,320
It has the perfect sweetness,
not too sweet.

336
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,520
Here.

337
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,080
Is it sweet?

338
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,080
It is.

339
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,040
But I don't think it's that sweet.
The strawberries helps balance it out.

340
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,320
Here, taste it again.

341
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,080
Wait. Hey!

342
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,480
You're so hands-on for someone
who's just a fake fiancé.

343
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,200
Are you okay?

344
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,800
I don't know

345
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,400
if we'll see each other again

346
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,440
after helping your mother escape.

347
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,080
Of course, we will.

348
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,400
You searched for me and found me,

349
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,800
and now we're here together.

350
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,760
What if you have to hide from Pramet
and I can't find you?

351
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,160
Then I'll be the one to come to you.

352
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,000
It's Chairman Wang.

353
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,520
Chairman.

354
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
I've received the invitation.

355
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,720
But whether I'm helping you or not…

356
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,560
It all depends on how much
your plan impresses me.

357
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,440
- Welcome.
- Good evening.

358
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,360
How are you doing, ma'am? Sir?

359
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,000
- We're doing well.
- That's good to hear.

360
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,440
- Thank you for attending.
- Yes.

361
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,960
CRYSTAL

362
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,720
Welcome.

363
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,600
Right. Today's fundraising event
is being held

364
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,480
to help provide heart transplants
for underprivileged children.

365
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,640
Dr. Pramote's goal is to help children

366
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,040
with financial disadvantages

367
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,360
through the Honest Heart Foundation

368
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,720
under Heaven Hospital.

369
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,760
Up until today,

370
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,960
we've saved the lives
of dozens of children.

371
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,440
Every patient who has received
a healthy heart from us

372
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,200
is now able to live a normal life.

373
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,600
The smiles of the children

374
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,120
who have received healthy hearts
from our foundation

375
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,480
truly make me proud.

376
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,000
We must thank all of our generous guests

377
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,840
who've always been
great supporters of our foundation.

378
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,280
It's my great pleasure.

379
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,400
As the CEO of Heaven Home,

380
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,199
I'm truly honored

381
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,840
to support such an incredible project.

382
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,679
All of us in the Hemaratsiri family
know very well

383
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,880
that we can play a crucial role
in improving children's lives.

384
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,560
- Can we have a group picture?
- Of course.

385
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,679
Please stand closer together.

386
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,000
Ready?

387
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,239
Such a shameless attempt to steal credit.

388
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,040
If you two are going

389
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,320
to praise yourselves
in front of the press like that,

390
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,080
I'll have to keep up with it.

391
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,280
You and your mom are nothing but leeches.

392
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,240
Yai's mom started this project.

393
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,800
I think it's you, Uncle Mote,

394
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,040
who's sucking it dry.

395
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,200
When Yai mentioned parasites,

396
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,480
I think he was referring
to the two of you.

397
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,400
Smile, Uncle. The reporters are watching.

398
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,680
Please feel free.

399
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:33,200
THE TREATMENT

400
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,400
Here.

401
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,640
Thank you.

402
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,640
Where's Aunt Pa?

403
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,840
Did you let the press take your photos?

404
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,240
I did, Mom.

405
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,800
Don't let them steal all the spotlight.

406
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,640
Don't worry. I can handle myself.

407
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,480
Get some rest.

408
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,200
Damn it! Of all days, why today?

409
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,000
Mekhin seems very protective
of Ms. Monmeena.

410
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,760
He won't leave her side.

411
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,200
Are you disappointed

412
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,760
that Yai is engaged to Monmeena?

413
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,520
A little.

414
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,760
Father had high hopes for me

415
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,600
to be with Mekhin to strengthen
the connection between our families.

416
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,120
At first, I thought that

417
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,680
being with Mekhin wouldn't be so bad.
At least we knew each other.

418
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,120
But now that I can't be with him,

419
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,320
I have no idea who Father
will try to push me toward next.

420
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,720
Then, let me help you
escape all this stress.

421
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,240
How would you do it?

422
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,520
I'll become the chairman of H Group.

423
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,360
It'd be great
if you actually pulled that off.

424
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,720
You really think so?

425
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,240
Being with you

426
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,480
is obviously more comforting
than being with a stranger, right?

427
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,280
Thank you

428
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,840
for trying to help me.

429
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,520
Do you think
I have what it takes to run H Group?

430
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,280
Of course. Managing Heaven Home is tough,
and you've done it well.

431
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,640
Running H Group would be a breeze.

432
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,680
If you try to pull any stunts,

433
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,560
you die.

434
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,080
Hello, everyone. Hello.

435
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,080
This is Ms. Nate, my wife.

436
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,600
They're Mr. Met's bodyguards.

437
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,080
He hired them to follow Ms. Nate.

438
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,480
Mom.

439
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,040
Calm down.

440
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,240
Meena.

441
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,920
Meena.

442
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,360
Smile.

443
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,320
Your brother

444
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,640
sure knows how to steal the spotlight.

445
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,200
With all these reporters around,

446
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,840
it'd be perfect if Nate causes a scene.

447
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,760
Where are you going?

448
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,600
Meena.

449
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,960
Don't alert Pramet. It'll ruin our plan.

450
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,600
Meena.

451
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Where are you going?

452
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,080
Hmm?

453
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,400
If you don't let go,

454
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,800
I'll expose you.

455
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,200
What the hell?

456
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,720
Mom.

457
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,920
Did he hurt you?

458
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,360
Are you in pain?

459
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,000
Wherever you're taking me tonight,

460
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,280
I'll go with you.

461
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,200
Do you really mean that?

462
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,640
I never want to be apart from you again.

463
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,480
Really?

464
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,920
Ms. Nate, you seem very close
to Miss Monmeena.

465
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,040
Ms. Nate has always
had a soft spot for Meena.

466
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,720
So, I'm lucky there's no in-law drama.

467
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,000
- Good.
- Yeah.

468
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,960
Right, Father?

469
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,760
Yes.

470
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,920
My son is starting a family.

471
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,520
Come here.

472
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,040
And this is my talented daughter,

473
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,840
the driving force behind our foundation.

474
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,720
This is the moment I truly cherish,
being surrounded by my perfect family.

475
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,560
We're so envious of you.

476
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,920
- Can we take some family photos?
- Of course.

477
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,040
Move in closer, please.

478
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,880
- Closer, please.
- Good.

479
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,400
How did a charity event

480
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,880
suddenly turn
into Pramet's family reunion?

481
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,360
When will you get the will?

482
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,800
Are you just going to let Met
take everything that's rightfully yours?

483
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,240
There's also Yai.

484
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,040
They'll take what's yours.

485
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,160
Pathetic.

486
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,920
Are you scared? If I don't fight back,

487
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,720
the board will never take you seriously,

488
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,320
and Uncle Met will always
keep you under his thumb.

489
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,680
You two also work for the foundation,

490
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,920
but Tri gets all the credit.

491
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,200
Stand up for yourselves.

492
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,600
Stop hiding behind others. It's pathetic.

493
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,880
It's time. Everyone,
please head inside for the event.

494
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,880
Please. Right this way.

495
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
- What?
- Who's that?

496
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,160
I'll go in your place.

497
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,640
I'll go.

498
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,400
In this condition,

499
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,000
Pramet will just laugh at you.

500
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,600
Tell the doctor

501
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,200
to give me some anti-nausea medicine.

502
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,720
Dad.

503
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,640
Now!

504
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,400
Yes, sir.

505
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,040
- It's Chairman Wang.
- Chairman Wang?

506
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,720
Wang?

507
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,960
Can I have an interview, please?

508
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,000
Does your presence
at this fundraiser mean that

509
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,840
JW will have a special collaboration

510
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,680
with H Group in the future?

511
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,480
I'm here solely to support the mission

512
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,160
started by the foundation's founder.

513
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,400
And today, I'm bringing
the most valuable photograph of my life

514
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,120
for the auction.

515
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,000
Could you tell us what that photograph is?

516
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,960
It's a photograph
of the woman I love most.

517
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,280
Who is she?

518
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,000
Is she your wife?
Could you tell us her name?

519
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,800
Let's have some photos.

520
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,840
Of course.

521
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,560
Is this a scene-stealing fest?

522
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,600
First, it was Met, and now it's Wang.

523
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,240
You two look really good.

524
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,240
Thank you very much for honoring us.

525
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,800
Please proceed inside.

526
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,360
Congratulations.

527
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,880
What the hell are you talking about?

528
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,440
Asshole.

529
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,240
The hell was that?

530
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,920
This woman…

531
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,040
Is she Dylan's mother?

532
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,360
She was my first

533
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,720
and last love.

534
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,640
She's on the beach,

535
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,080
but the flowers she's holding
don't seem to be tropical.

536
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,160
They're plum blossoms.

537
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,480
They bloom only once a year.

538
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,840
I ordered them from Lampang
for her birthday.

539
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,160
I wish you could see

540
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,080
how happy she was to have that present.

541
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,120
Ladies and gentlemen,

542
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,200
my name is Triprapa Hemaratsiri,

543
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,680
Vice President
of the Honest Heart Foundation.

544
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,800
I'd like to welcome all honorable guests

545
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,920
to this evening, an opportunity

546
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,280
for all of us to save the lives

547
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,280
of children with heart conditions

548
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,120
and provide them
with healthy lives in our society

549
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,600
through heart transplants
made possible by your generous support.

550
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,080
On this special evening,

551
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,560
I've received some very good news
that I'd like to share with all of you.

552
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,920
I'd like to invite
Chairman Wang Jongtraipattana,

553
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,360
the chairman of JW Group,
to share this good news with us.

554
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,840
Dad.

555
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,560
Greetings

556
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,160
to all our generous guests.

557
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,520
I've been informed that
the Honest Heart Foundation

558
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,320
has saved the lives of dozens
of underprivileged children

559
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:30,160
and given them a chance to live
normal, healthy lives in our society.

560
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,600
And to continue the mission of Ms. Mei,

561
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,960
the founder of this foundation,

562
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,040
I am proud to announce that,

563
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,120
in addition to donating the photograph

564
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,400
to the foundation's

565
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,520
for tonight's auction,

566
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,320
I'd like to make a donation

567
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,560
of 50 million baht

568
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,920
to honor both Ms. Mei

569
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,520
and Mr. Pramet, my good friend.

570
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,520
What the fuck was that?

571
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,360
Met.

572
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,800
Your best friend
really stole the spotlight this time.

573
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,760
Hey.

574
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,320
Everyone will see your true colors.
Calm down.

575
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,000
I'd like to invite Mr. Pramet Hemaratsiri

576
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,040
to receive the donation
from our honored guest.

577
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,200
FOR HONEST HEART FOUNDATION
50,000,000 BAHT

578
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,720
Get ready.

579
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,880
Take a deep breath. In and out.

580
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,240
Everything will be alright.

581
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,600
Hey.

582
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,640
- Stand by right here. Wait for the signal.
- Yes.

583
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,640
- Hey, you guys ready?
- Let's go.

584
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,640
Father, everyone is waiting.

585
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,560
Why did you have to do this?

586
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,920
Get more men to watch Nate closely.

587
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,600
- Never let her out of your sight.
- Yes, sir.

588
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,000
Guys, I need two more inside. Now.

589
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,880
Yes, boss.

590
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,360
If you try to do anything,

591
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,400
your daughter will pay the price.

592
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,560
DONATION FOR HONEST HEART FOUNDATION

593
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,040
Smile. The press is taking photos.

594
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,960
How the fuck could I?

595
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,520
Don't you see those flashes blinding me?

596
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,200
Why aren't they here?

597
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,360
I called you a long time ago.
Why didn't you come?

598
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,840
Ms. Nate, Ms. Monmeena, this way.

599
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,200
You're willing to throw away 50 million

600
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,160
just to steal the spotlight
at my family's event.

601
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,440
You can't just be filthy rich,

602
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,640
you have to be stupid too.

603
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,800
Just like the time
I made a fool of you, dumbass.

604
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,640
Someone like me

605
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,760
wouldn't waste a fortune
on an insignificant outcome.

606
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,000
You made me lose the one I loved.

607
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,760
Today,

608
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,840
you'll lose the one you love as well.

609
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,360
What the hell are you talking about?
What the hell, Wang?

610
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,280
Nate?

611
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Where is Nate?!

612
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,160
Where the hell did Nate go?!

613
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,000
Mr. Pramet!

614
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,000
Mr. Pramet!

615
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,040
Ms. Nate was taken!

616
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,120
What the hell did you say?

617
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,640
Ms. Nate was taken!

618
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,360
Then go get her! Go!

619
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,080
Get in.

620
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,280
Okay.

621
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,800
Poot!

622
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,920
Follow them!

623
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,320
Yai!

624
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,320
Where did your woman take my wife?

625
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,720
Where the hell is Nate?!

626
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,560
Yai is so fearless

627
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,240
for taking Nate out
in the middle of an event.

628
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,280
Mr. Yai, Ou took
Ms. Monmeena and Ms. Nate.

629
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,480
Who's Ou?

630
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,440
Who took Nate?!

631
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,240
Yai! You…

632
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,280
You dickhead.

633
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,560
Looks like someone intervened
and took Nate away.

634
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,960
Right, Lek… What?

635
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,320
Where did Lek go?

636
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,560
Our men are waiting on two routes.

637
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,960
Take the will

638
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,840
and get rid of Ou.

639
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,840
- But Meena isn't a part of this.
- Kill Ou.

640
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,840
And bring me Meena and Pramet's wife.

641
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,200
Yes, Dad.

642
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,160
Hello.

643
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,600
On my way.

644
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,840
Good.

645
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,440
<i>Come back to me!</i>

646
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,320
<i>Come here!</i>

647
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:50,160
- <i>Don't, Mom! Run!</i>
- <i>Come here!</i>

648
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,440
<i>Mr. Yai! Get my mom away!</i>

649
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,440
<i>Trust me! Run away, Mom!</i>

650
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,960
Your wife is with Pramet,

651
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,960
and Meena is in Mekhin's hands.

652
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,400
Your wife and daughter
have always been their playthings.

653
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,320
When did my wife end up with Pramet?

654
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,200
I saw Pramet
with your wife for over 20 years.

655
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,640
What kind of man are you

656
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,280
to let your wife and daughter
sell themselves like this?

657
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,200
What the hell did you say?
I can just shoot you.

658
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,920
There's a fundraiser this evening.

659
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,720
Meena planned to get Nate away.

660
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,440
I have a way to get your wife
and daughter out of there.

661
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,600
For the will?

662
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,440
But you and your mom betrayed me before.

663
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,320
So, how can I trust you?

664
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,360
Pramet's bodyguards

665
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,800
and Mekhin's men will be
all over your wife and daughter.

666
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,800
If I don't show you the way,

667
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,680
how are you supposed
to get them out of there?

668
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,440
Grandpa's will grants everything to me!

669
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,640
What makes you so sure

670
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,800
that your name is really in the will?

671
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,320
Yai!

672
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,320
You want me to spare Ou's life

673
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,280
because he's Monmeena's father, don't you?

674
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,760
Can you do what I ask?

675
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,840
- What if we can't?
- Shut up when grown-ups are talking.

676
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,240
I'm ordering you to work for me.

677
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,280
There's no way I'll betray Mr. Yai.

678
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,160
You don't understand until it's too late.

679
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,760
He went as far as ordering
a car to almost hit you

680
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,680
to threaten me for the will!

681
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,320
Mr. Yai would never do that to me!
You're lying!

682
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,720
Then ask him yourself.

683
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,720
The agreement between us ends now.

684
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,280
I don't want to see you ever again.
Remember that!

685
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,240
