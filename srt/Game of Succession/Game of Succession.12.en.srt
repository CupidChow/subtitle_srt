1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,360
You can't win against Mekhin.

2
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,880
That's because I haven't tried.

3
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,280
I don't want you
getting involved with that woman.

4
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,280
Why are you bringing a gun, Father?

5
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,880
I'm going to blow his head off,
you dumbass!

6
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
‪Nate!

7
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,080
‪Nate.

8
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,640
‪-Mom!
‪-Dad!

9
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
‪Hey!

10
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,880
‪-Mom!
‪-Dad!

11
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,640
Once the will is read,
I'll expose all your dirty secrets.

12
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,760
Without the will, you have nothing.

13
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,480
You'll always be beneath me.

14
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,440
Dad said if something happened,
to grab the steel box under the rubble.

15
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,720
I think it's the will.

16
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,000
The real will no longer exists.

17
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,680
If Mr. Mekhin finds out the truth
about your betrayal,

18
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,400
you might lose him forever.

19
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,520
Meena.

20
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,120
Ms. Triprapa, can you give an interview?

21
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,560
Has Mr. Pramet
contacted the family at all?

22
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,360
How is the family planning to respond

23
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,520
now that Mr. Pramet is a murder suspect?

24
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,920
My father didn't kill anyone.

25
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,600
But the police have CCTV footage

26
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,840
showing Mr. Pramet
entering the warehouse with a gun

27
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,000
before the fire broke out.

28
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,480
- Yes, there's evidence.
- What do you say?

29
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,280
But do you have a picture
of my father killing someone?

30
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,560
Do you?

31
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,080
If you have no proof,

32
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,880
then you have no right
to accuse my father of murder.

33
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,880
Just because you're the media
doesn't mean you can forget your humanity.

34
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,560
Then why is he running?
If Mr. Pramet is innocent,

35
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,040
why hasn't he turned himself in
to prove it?

36
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,720
If he doesn't turn himself in,
the public has every right to suspect him.

37
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,920
Yes, we need answers
from both him and you, Ms. Triprapa.

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,080
Yes.

39
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,040
Can you stop already?!

40
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,240
If he turns himself in,
what kind of headline will you run?

41
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,640
Well…

42
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,080
If you twist the story to get more views

43
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,440
and convince the public that my father's
guilty before the court even rules on it,

44
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,440
that's defamation. And it could damage
H Group's reputation, worth billions.

45
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,720
And if he turns out to be innocent

46
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,360
and our reputation is ruined…

47
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,160
I think the surveillance footage here has
recorded who should be held responsible.

48
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,440
- We're just looking for updates.
- Yes.

49
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,280
Then ask the police.

50
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,120
We're waiting for answers too.

51
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,120
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

52
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,680
We're waiting, just like everyone else.

53
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,360
When will you be able
to share any updates?

54
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
- About the updates--
- We have business to attend to.

55
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,840
Excuse us.

56
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,960
Mr. Mekhin, Ms. Triprapa…

57
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
Go home first, Tri.

58
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,080
Aren't you coming with me?

59
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,000
I've got things to take care of.
You go on ahead.

60
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,960
Oh, Tri.

61
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,320
Why are you here?

62
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,560
You still have the audacity to show up?

63
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,800
Why are you talking like this?

64
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,680
Everything is a mess!

65
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,920
Dad is missing.
We don't even know if he's okay or hurt.

66
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,560
Monmeena is the reason
our family is suffering.

67
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,240
You can't blame Meena for that.

68
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,560
Dad took her mother away.
He left her to grow up in an orphanage.

69
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,320
If she's claiming
what was stolen from her, isn't that fair?

70
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,000
Her mother took money from our father.

71
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,600
So, how is he the villain here?

72
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
He forced Nate with money, Tri.

73
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,600
Then blame Nate
for selling herself to our father.

74
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,360
- She brought this curse on him.
- Stop it, Triprapa!

75
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,840
Don't talk about my mother like that

76
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,760
when you don't even know
why she ended up here.

77
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,880
Whatever the reason was, it doesn't change
the fact that she sold herself.

78
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,680
She sold herself to be here,
and now she's pretending to be the victim.

79
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,840
Your parents were selfish.

80
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,480
They were cursed. They deserved to die!

81
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,560
You! Why the hell are you still here?!

82
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,680
You bring nothing but disaster!
You ruined my father's life!

83
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,080
You destroyed my family!

84
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,600
If it weren't for you,

85
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,400
your father and mother
would still be alive!

86
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,720
You ruined everything!

87
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,520
Get out of here, Monmeena!
You're shameless!

88
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,960
- Tri, that's enough!
- No!

89
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,040
- Monmeena!
- Come here!

90
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
No! Monmeena!

91
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,520
Why are you crying?

92
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,880
Ms. Tri was right.

93
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
If I hadn't come up
with that reckless escape plan,

94
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,360
my parents…

95
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,960
I've caused trouble for you.

96
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
I never once thought this was your fault.

97
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,400
You did everything you could

98
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
to bring your family back together.

99
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,080
But what if what I did was truly wrong?

100
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,000
Would you forgive me?

101
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,880
Of course I would.

102
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,920
You need to help me

103
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,320
stop Mekhin
from taking control of H Group.

104
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,240
The only way to save your parents

105
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,360
is to do exactly as I say.

106
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,040
I'm grateful for whatever

107
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,920
brought you into my life.

108
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,040
Without you,

109
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,200
I wouldn't know what happiness feels like.

110
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,240
Meena…

111
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,760
Why are you crying again?

112
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,320
What's wrong?

113
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,040
Do you remember our promise?

114
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,480
No more secrets between us. Remember?

115
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,960
No more secrets between us, alright?

116
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,760
I was just…

117
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,840
thinking about the people I love.

118
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,680
Because of that will…

119
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,320
Because of that will,

120
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,880
I've lost everyone I care about.

121
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,320
Meena.

122
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,160
Meena.

123
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,880
You miss your parents, don't you?

124
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,520
Don't cry.

125
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,240
I'm scared that one day…

126
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,160
I'll have no one left.

127
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,440
I'm scared…

128
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,440
that you'll leave me too.

129
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,080
I love you.

130
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,880
I love you.

131
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,520
Mr. Yai.

132
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,320
Growing up in this family

133
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,200
taught me never to trust anyone,

134
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,600
to never believe in love.

135
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,000
But you made me believe again.

136
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,600
Meena…

137
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,480
I want you by my side.

138
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,320
You make my life meaningful.

139
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,240
I love you, Meena.

140
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,520
Will you marry me?

141
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,760
Yes…

142
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,160
Yes, I will.

143
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,040
I will stand by you.

144
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,040
I will do everything for us.

145
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,920
I promise…

146
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,440
I promise…

147
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,600
Good morning, everyone.

148
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,880
Today, I will oversee

149
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,120
the voting process
for the new Chairman of H Group.

150
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,840
The candidates for the position are…

151
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,360
Mr. Mekhin Hemaratsiri, CEO of H Club,

152
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,480
and Mr. Parin Hemaratsiri,

153
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,680
CEO of Heaven Home
Property and Development.

154
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,760
If we secure four votes from our side
and just five more from the board, we win.

155
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,640
You're sure about those five votes, right?

156
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,160
Absolutely.

157
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,040
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>

158
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,920
Officer, I'm in front of the building.
Please hurry.

159
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,360
As soon as my parents are safe,

160
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,280
I'll tell you the truth.

161
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,920
I'm begging you.
Don't do anything to my parents.

162
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,240
- Please…
- The only way to save them

163
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,280
is to do exactly as I say.

164
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,520
Understand?

165
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,480
Your parents are waiting. Get in.

166
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,960
Dad! Mom!

167
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,480
Meena…

168
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,560
Nate… Run!

169
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,560
- Get out of here!
- No. I won't leave you again.

170
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,080
- Go.
- Let me go!

171
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,320
Let me go!

172
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,920
Calm down. Calm down!

173
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,240
Chairman Wang, my daughter
has nothing to do with this.

174
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,960
Let her go.

175
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,120
Take my life instead.
Just let my daughter go.

176
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,720
No.

177
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,320
Ou, since you've worked for me

178
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,840
for a long time…

179
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,520
One, two,

180
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,000
three.

181
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,800
I'll let you go. Two of you.

182
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,160
You'll have to decide,
Do you want your father

183
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,680
or your mother to go with you?

184
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,200
And the one you don't choose

185
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,160
will die here.

186
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,760
No. No! Let me go!

187
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,680
What's your decision?

188
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,120
Please, Chairman Wang. Let my parents go.

189
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,920
Officers! They're upstairs!

190
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,360
Let's go!

191
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,720
This way, please.

192
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,400
We will now proceed with the voting.

193
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,120
The ballots are now before you.

194
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,080
If you're ready, please begin.

195
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,400
H GROUP'S CHAIRMAN ELECTION
MR. MEKHIN HEMARATSIRI

196
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,760
MR. PARIN HEMARATSIRI

197
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,120
Now, I'll start counting the votes.

198
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,520
MEKHIN HEMARATSIRI
PARIN HEMARATSITI

199
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,560
‪H GROUP'S CHAIRMAN ELECTION

200
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,960
Mr. Mekhin, one vote.

201
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,520
Mr. Parin, one vote.

202
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,680
This way, officers.

203
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,920
Wait. What's going on?

204
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,120
My parents are being held captive here.

205
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,440
Wait. You can't go up there.

206
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,320
Let me go. Move.

207
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,440
Please, let us investigate.

208
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,800
- This way, officers.
- It's private property.

209
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,280
- You can't go inside.
- Dad! Mom!

210
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,560
- Hey!
- You can't go up there.

211
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,800
Mr. Mekhin, one vote.

212
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,280
Mr. Mekhin, one vote.

213
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,320
Mr. Parin, one vote.

214
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,520
Mr. Mekhin, one vote.

215
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,280
Mr. Mekhin, one vote.

216
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,800
Mr. Parin, one vote.

217
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,520
Mr. Parin, one vote.

218
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,960
Where are they?

219
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,800
- What?
- There's no one here.

220
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,680
There's no one here.

221
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,320
Where are your parents, ma'am?

222
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,200
They must be here. I saw them here.

223
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,280
Get out of my place.

224
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,880
This is trespassing.

225
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,040
Where did Chairman Wang hide my parents?

226
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,200
Why would your parents be here?

227
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,480
Doctor, tell me where my parents are.

228
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,960
- I don't know!
- Calm down.

229
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,280
Please leave my clinic now.

230
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Or I'll sue all of you.

231
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,640
You're not going to tell me?

232
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,880
Then move. Move!

233
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,240
Are you alright?

234
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,040
I'm alright. Thank you.

235
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,320
And the final vote…

236
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,120
Mr. Mekhin, one vote.

237
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,560
The final tally is nine to seven

238
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,960
in favor of Mr. Mekhin Hemaratsiri

239
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,320
as the new Chairman of H Group.

240
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,280
This is impossible!
It can't end like this!

241
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,000
You told me we had five votes secured!

242
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,640
Who betrayed us? Who?!

243
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,560
Ms. Pa, calm down.

244
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,200
When you lose,
you must accept defeat with grace.

245
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,720
Don't tell me…

246
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,080
those two votes he gained…

247
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,440
You're canceling
your cocktail lounge project

248
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,240
to invest in the VVIP hospital instead?

249
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,720
I won't hold
any of your past actions against you,

250
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,680
in exchange for your two votes tomorrow.

251
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,160
Think carefully.

252
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,400
Lek and his mother
are more dangerous than I am.

253
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
Do you really want to be under them?

254
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,680
You traitors!

255
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,920
CHAIRMAN OF H GROUP

256
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,880
I sincerely appreciate everyone's trust.

257
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,000
I think that's a little early to say,
Mr. Yai.

258
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,760
Good morning.

259
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,640
Good morning.

260
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,080
I am Thatsanai,

261
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,800
a lawyer for Heaven Home Company.

262
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,520
I have an important announcement
for everyone here.

263
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,080
Now,

264
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,400
we have found the official will
of Mr. Preeda Hemaratsiri.

265
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,360
I request that we read
Grandpa's will in front of everyone,

266
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,200
so that all of us can witness

267
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,040
his final wishes together.

268
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,160
Where are my parents?

269
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,440
They're not dead yet.

270
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,720
<i>Meena!</i>

271
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,280
Mom! Where are you?!

272
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,280
<i>Are you safe?</i>

273
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
Where's Dad?

274
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,600
<i>I'm okay.</i>

275
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,000
You fought so hard
to save Mekhin, didn't you?

276
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,800
This is impossible.

277
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,080
How do you have the real will?

278
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,400
Father…

279
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,400
Mother… or Father?

280
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,120
Or Mother? What's your decision?

281
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,520
Who should sacrifice?

282
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,480
Your father or your mother?

283
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,280
Meena, don't worry about me.
Take your mother and run.

284
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,320
No, Dad! No!

285
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,520
Please, just let my daughter go.
I'm begging you!

286
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,400
- No!
- What should I do?

287
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,040
Can't decide?

288
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,240
Huh? What's your decision?

289
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,520
Huh?

290
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,800
Mom!

291
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,560
I surrender.

292
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,240
Dad, please.
Tell me where you hid the will.

293
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,600
Chairman Wang.

294
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,680
Your plan is to use Mr. Preeda's will

295
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,160
to stop Mr. Yai from becoming
Chairman of H Group, right?

296
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,160
I'll do it for you.

297
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,640
In exchange
for letting the three of us go,

298
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,560
I'll do it for you.

299
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,080
Well, well.

300
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,480
I give up.

301
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,880
But if you fail,

302
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,639
they die.

303
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,760
I won't fail.

304
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,600
Ou,

305
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,960
your daughter's got guts.

306
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Alright then.

307
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,159
So, your job is…

308
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,280
Take the real will to me…

309
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,200
and replace it with my fake one.

310
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,920
<i>What if he opens it</i>
<i>and realizes it's fake?</i>

311
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,120
Even if Mekhin opens it, he won't know

312
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,440
it's fake.

313
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,120
Aside from Attorney Pornchai
and Chairman Preeda, who are already dead,

314
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,560
no one has ever seen the real will.

315
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,680
And he even gets it from
the daughter of the one who stole it.

316
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,920
Your job

317
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,880
is to make him believe it's real.

318
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,640
Mr. Yai, aren't you going to read it?

319
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,240
There's no need.

320
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,200
The real will no longer exists.

321
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,720
Finish your job,

322
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,600
and your parents will survive.

323
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,680
If you don't fail,

324
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,240
you'll see them again.

325
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,640
Deal?

326
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,080
Hmm?

327
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,280
I'm asking you!

328
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,040
You're more capable than I thought.

329
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,480
By now,
everyone must've seen the real will.

330
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,760
If this is the real will,
then go ahead and read it.

331
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,840
Yes, let's hear it now.

332
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,200
Everyone here can be a witness.

333
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,400
- Please proceed.
- If I may.

334
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,000
"I, Preeda Hemaratsiri,

335
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,360
hereby declare
this last will and testament

336
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,120
to distribute my assets

337
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,880
upon my passing

338
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,800
as follows.

339
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,920
First, the land and real estate
on Sukhumvit Road

340
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,080
shall be inherited
by Mr. Pramet Hemaratsiri

341
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,640
and Mr. Pramote Hemaratsiri
as legal owners.

342
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,880
Third, the penthouse building

343
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,520
shall be inherited
by Mr. Pramet Hemaratsiri,

344
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,640
Mr. Pramote Hemaratsiri,

345
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,800
and Mr. Parin Hemaratsiri as legal owners.

346
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,640
Fourth…"

347
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,000
Your father left
the real estate to Met and you,

348
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,520
the foundation to Tri,

349
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,440
and all the stocks and cash
to everyone, except Mr. Yai.

350
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,000
What's going on?

351
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,560
Why is his name missing?

352
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,600
Or…

353
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,240
Could it be he was appointed
as the estate executor?

354
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,880
"And finally,

355
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,640
I hereby appoint

356
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,800
Mr. Parin Hemaratsiri as the sole chairman

357
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,080
and decision-maker of H Group."

358
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,800
Parin!

359
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,560
Parin!

360
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,560
Parin…

361
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,400
"Additionally, Mr. Parin Hemaratsiri

362
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,800
shall serve as the executor
of my entire estate,

363
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,880
overseeing the distribution of assets

364
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,360
as per my final wishes."

365
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,280
This is fraud.

366
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,800
This is just a duplicate.

367
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,760
It's not the original will!

368
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,320
Yes, it's a duplicate.

369
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,760
But it was made at the same time
as the original will.

370
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,400
Then where's the original? Show it to me.

371
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,720
You can't just use an official seal
on a duplicate as proof.

372
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,000
Without the original,

373
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,520
this document is invalid!

374
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,960
This document should be voided!

375
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,640
The estate must be divided
according to the legal succession order!

376
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,680
The original will
is at the district office.

377
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,400
And to confirm that this will

378
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,520
is indeed legitimate,

379
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,760
I have invited the district director

380
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,760
to verify it. Please come in.

381
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,400
Mr. Preeda Hemaratsiri

382
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,560
personally visited the district office

383
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,360
on January 11, 2024,

384
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,560
and officially registered his last will

385
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,560
and testament as a municipal document.

386
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,240
This can be verified
by the inscription on the will's envelope.

387
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Apart from the witness' signature,
it bears my signature, an official seal,

388
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,200
and was properly registered

389
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,760
in our records under the will registration
book at the district administration.

390
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,640
The will has
an accompanying PK-7 certificate,

391
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,640
issued by the district office

392
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,760
for verification.

393
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,080
If you still have doubts,
you may verify it

394
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,600
with the official will registry.

395
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,560
That way, you can confirm

396
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,720
whose name was signed
as the estate executor

397
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,760
by our grandfather.

398
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,480
He didn't leave anything for Mr. Yai.

399
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,480
How is that even possible?

400
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,600
He was too cruel to Mr. Yai.

401
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,080
You don't have
any more objections, do you?

402
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,200
<i>Well done, Monmeena.</i>

403
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,720
You've completely destroyed Mekhin's life.

404
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,520
Then,

405
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,640
I will release your parents

406
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,120
as promised.

407
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,080
How is this possible? How?!

408
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,360
How the hell is this possible?!

409
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,280
How is this possible?!

410
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,720
Ms. Monmeena, please come back now.

411
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,880
I'm on my way up.

412
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,760
‪Mr. Yai.

413
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,760
Mr. Yai! Stop! Stop it!

414
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,120
- Please, don't hurt yourself! Stop!
- Let go of me, Meena!

415
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,080
- Please, don't hurt yourself! Stop!
- Let go of me!

416
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,760
- Let go of me!
- Mr. Yai!

417
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,400
- Let go of me!
- Mr. Yai, please stop!

418
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,360
Please, don't hurt yourself!

419
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,960
- Meena! Let go of me!
- Please stop.

420
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,600
Mr, Yai, please don't hurt yourself.

421
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,440
Everything's ruined
because of that damn will.

422
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,360
How did he get it?

423
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,760
How did they get the will?
I burned it with my own hands!

424
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,440
Who gave it to him?

425
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,040
Who gave him the will?!

426
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,600
Who?!

427
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,640
It was me. I did it.

428
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,040
The will I burned…

429
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,680
was fake, wasn't it?

430
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,200
Yes.

431
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,840
You betrayed me?

432
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,640
Mr. Yai…

433
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,440
I'm sorry.

434
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,160
I'll do anything.

435
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,800
I didn't mean for this to happen.
I'm sorry.

436
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,760
Please listen to me. I'm sorry.

437
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,400
Monmeena…

438
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,680
- Mr. Yai…
- Mr. Yai!

439
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,040
- Mr. Yai!
- Mr. Yai!

440
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,280
- Mr. Yai!
- Mr. Yai, stop!

441
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,920
- Mr. Yai! You can't do it!
- Please let Ms. Meena go.

442
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,840
- I'm sorry, Mr. Yai!
- Please let her go.

443
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,600
- Mr. Yai.
- Mr.Yai!

444
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,600
- I'm sorry…
- Mr. Yai!

445
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,120
- Mr. Yai, please let her go.
- Mr. Yai!

446
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,680
Inthon!

447
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,400
Mr. Yai, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

448
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,320
Mr. Yai, please stop. I'm sorry.

449
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,480
Mr. Yai, I'm sorry.

450
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,000
I trusted you with everything.

451
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,400
Why did you betray me?

452
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,400
Why did you betray me, Meena? Why?!

453
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,600
I really didn't mean to…

454
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,960
Yai.

455
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,480
I could've given you everything,
even my life.

456
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,720
I loved you

457
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,200
more than I've loved anyone.

458
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,040
The whole world could betray me,
but it wasn't supposed to be you, Meena.

459
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,520
It wasn't supposed to be you! Why?!

460
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,200
- She's breathing! Take her to the room.
- No!

461
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,960
- Leave her there.
- Mr. Yai…

462
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,680
It's an order!

463
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,240
Monmeena betrayed you?

464
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,480
Over the will?

465
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,760
- Get out.
- Yai.

466
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,720
I don't want to talk to anyone right now.

467
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,600
Everyone, get out. Get out!

468
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,720
Ms. Tri, let's go for now.

469
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,840
After this, I will proceed
with the court request

470
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,000
to grant you full authority

471
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,720
to manage and oversee
the estate of the Hemaratsiri family,

472
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,520
as stated in Mr. Preeda's will.

473
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,640
This is the Chief Secretary,

474
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,720
the head
of all secretarial matters at H Group.

475
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,400
She will handle all business and personal
affairs on your behalf moving forward.

476
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,440
- Good day, sir.
- Thank you.

477
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,480
I've heard you served
my grandfather for decades.

478
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
There are many things
I'll need your guidance on.

479
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,080
It's my honor.

480
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,360
I will do my best
to serve you, Mr. Chairman.

481
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,200
I want to take a look inside.

482
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,720
We need to redecorate the Chairman's
office to match Mr. Parin's style.

483
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,160
Of course, ma'am.

484
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,000
CHAIRMAN

485
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,920
Please leave us.

486
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,800
Yes, ma'am.

487
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,640
We did it, Mom.

488
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,400
This office belongs to us now.

489
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,680
Mom…

490
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,520
Ten years ago,

491
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,240
when Pramet ruined the business

492
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,960
Grandpa entrusted to him,

493
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,720
and Pramote was still struggling
with the hospital,

494
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,000
the one who carried the weight

495
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,840
of keeping Hemaratsiri afloat

496
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,200
was your father, Pranon.

497
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,520
Grandpa once told your father

498
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,440
he would give everything to our family.

499
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,280
If your father hadn't been in poor health
and hadn't left us so soon,

500
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,000
he would be the one
sitting in that chair right now.

501
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,880
He would be watching over his son,

502
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,640
knowing how capable you've become.

503
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,480
Your father would be proud

504
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:04,600
to see you earn that seat
through your own merit.

505
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,640
This is my chair.

506
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,840
A seat that no matter how hard Yai tries,

507
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,680
he'll never claim.

508
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,080
Ms. Pa…

509
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,600
Did that Meena girl die?

510
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,920
Keep an eye on them and report back to me.

511
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,920
This time, Yai has fallen so hard.

512
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,600
The more he's crushed, the better.

513
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,160
Congratulations
to the new Chairman of H Group.

514
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,840
You really did it, Parin.
You took Yai down completely.

515
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,800
Of course.

516
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,360
Even after
being betrayed right to his face,

517
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,600
he still managed
to take the chairman's seat

518
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,520
without relying
on two-faced backstabbers like you.

519
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,840
Why is that surprising?

520
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,040
Among us, there's no such thing
as loyalty when profits are at stake.

521
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,320
People like you can never be trusted.

522
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,360
If Yai had won,

523
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,560
he wouldn't have spared you.
Couldn't you see?

524
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,240
Of course I saw it.

525
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,960
But I had to secure my own survival

526
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,760
because Parin made me doubt.

527
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,440
Just like you,
when Pranon was still alive,

528
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,800
you used to run between my father

529
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,480
and Met,

530
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,880
trying to find
the safest place in Hemaratsiri.

531
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,000
Mr. Mote!

532
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,320
Maybe it's just a family trait.

533
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,440
When you're stuck in the middle,
unable to rise to the top,

534
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,200
you do everything to survive.

535
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,240
Don't get too cocky.

536
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,640
Whether you like it or not,

537
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,600
you still need people like me

538
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,280
to strengthen your ties with the board

539
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,160
and improve your public image.

540
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,200
Aren't you overestimating your importance?

541
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,360
But you both know the truth.

542
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,160
Even if Grandpa
handed everything to Parin,

543
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,800
in the eyes of the world,

544
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,800
Mr. Yai is still more capable than him.

545
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,200
Like Mr. Mote?

546
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,400
Otherwise, Dad would have
handed H Group to Mr. Mote.

547
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,320
Let's stop fighting

548
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,680
and focus on moving forward.

549
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,720
I will prove to everyone

550
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,560
why Grandpa chose me over Yai.

551
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,680
That's the real question. Why?

552
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,640
Grandpa always kept you beneath Yai.

553
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,920
So, why suddenly hand over everything?

554
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,600
What's even stranger is that Yai
wasn't mentioned in the will at all.

555
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,080
How is that possible?

556
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,600
Maybe Dad and Yai

557
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,760
had a secret none of us knew about.

558
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,280
Where do you want me to meet you?

559
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,720
Meena followed my dad's orders.
She's not at fault!

560
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,680
‪Hey!

561
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,800
Do you really think
Yai will accept a traitor like you?

562
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,520
Except for Mr. Yai himself,
no one can kick me out of this place.

563
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,760
Remember that!

564
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,600
I'll cut off their lifelines.

565
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,520
I'll let them see that without me,

566
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,800
H Group will collapse.

567
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:45,120
You need to do something,
or you'll be thrown off that chair.

568
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,040
To fully avenge what Pramet did,

569
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,640
you must ensure Mekhin
loses all his power in H Group.

570
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,520
We have reports of minors

571
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,280
being exploited at H Club.

572
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,720
<i>You need to come with us for questioning.</i>

573
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,880
Mr. Yai!

574
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,720
I found proof of fraud at Heaven Home.

575
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,880
How serious is it?

576
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,200
Enough to land them in prison.

577
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,800
<i>I love you, Yai.</i>

578
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,120
If you still want me in your life,
stop this nonsense now.

579
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,640
<i>If you want Yai out of H Group,</i>

580
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,840
just let everyone know that
Mr. Mekhin isn't a real Hemaratsiri.

581
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,840
