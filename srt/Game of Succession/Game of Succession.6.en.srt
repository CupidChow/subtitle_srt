1
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,720
There's no place for the weak.

2
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,040
If you don't step on others,

3
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,120
you'll be the one crushed beneath them.

4
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,480
You knew Dad was going to give
me everything, so you killed him!

5
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,280
If anyone wanted him dead, it was you!

6
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,440
You asshole!

7
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,240
If Ou set this up,

8
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,360
the fire could get out of control.
People might die.

9
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,720
We've come this far.
There's no turning back now.

10
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
Come on. Pick up.

11
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,560
Maybe he's running back
to whoever sent him.

12
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,560
Mr. Parin. It's me.

13
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,960
Find him

14
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,440
and get rid of him.
Get me the Hemaratsiri will.

15
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,720
Aren't you leaving this house?

16
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,640
That fire was set on purpose to target me.

17
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,640
Did you catch who did it?

18
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,840
Anyone who's good to me,
I'll be good to them.

19
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,400
But anyone who wishes me harm,

20
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,840
I won't let them get away with it.

21
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,680
Aunt Bua.

22
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Yes?

23
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,520
How is Ms. Nate doing?

24
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,160
She looks better this morning.

25
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,720
She was up making breakfast
like she always does.

26
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,120
Maybe she was just too exhausted
last night and got light-headed.

27
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,320
Well then, can you

28
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,080
keep an eye on her today?

29
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,520
If she doesn't get enough rest,
it could get worse.

30
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,760
- Of course.
- Thank you.

31
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,280
My pleasure.

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,120
Let's go, Max.

33
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,760
- Yes.
- Where are you going?

34
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,840
I'm meeting a friend to return this suit.

35
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,760
So, I'd like to borrow your car today.

36
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,399
If you're going out, let's go together.
I have some business around there as well.

37
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,080
Around where?

38
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,440
Huh?

39
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,920
I haven't told you

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,760
where I'm meeting my friend.
So, where exactly are you going?

41
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,400
I have business everywhere.

42
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,080
Either way, we'll have
to pass by your stop. Right, Inthon?

43
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,960
Sure.

44
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,120
Are you coming or not?
If you're not, you can just walk there.

45
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,080
Of course, I'm coming.
Why are you so grumpy?

46
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,960
And the suit is not that expensive.

47
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,320
Why did you need to borrow one? I could
buy you a new one every day if you want.

48
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,040
Please.

49
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,200
Well, nothing to do again.

50
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,880
RUEANROT

51
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,920
- Monmeena!
- Mr. Dylan.

52
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,200
This is the one?

53
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,320
Yes. Mr. Dylan,

54
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,840
this is Mr. Mekhin. Mr. Mekhin,

55
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,040
this is Mr. Dylan,

56
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,240
the one who lent me the suit.

57
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,240
You are…

58
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,160
Meena's fiancé.

59
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,600
Nice to meet you in person, Mr. Mekhin.

60
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,840
I've heard a lot about you.

61
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,880
Please, have a seat.

62
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
- Here's the suit.
- Thank you.

63
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,120
Again, I'm so sorry

64
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
for dragging you into my mess.

65
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,120
So, if you ever need a favor,
don't hesitate to ask.

66
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,520
Okay.

67
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,920
And how's your foot? Fully recovered?

68
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,560
I've been fine since the day I got hurt.
I put some ice on it,

69
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,560
and it felt much better.
If I were still in pain from that fall,

70
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,280
I'd be a drama queen.

71
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,120
You're tough, huh?

72
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,680
Are you done? Let's go.
We have somewhere to be.

73
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,080
Your fiancé seems to be in a hurry.
I ordered a lot of food.

74
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,720
I was planning
to have a big meal with you.

75
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,600
Meena.

76
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,120
I'm really sorry.

77
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,400
But I have to go with Mr. Yai.

78
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,200
Then, let me cover the bill

79
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,200
to thank you for saving me.

80
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,120
Okay, that's fine.

81
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,480
I'll consider that payment for the suit.

82
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,400
But don't forget.

83
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,360
You still owe me
for the new pants I bought you.

84
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,960
What pants?

85
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,240
It's nothing.
You don't need to worry about it.

86
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,640
I'll pay for the meal. As for the food,

87
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,560
I'll have the staff pack it up.

88
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,560
Okay.

89
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,840
I'm not surprised a woman
like Monmeena is already taken.

90
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,200
But I'm only disappointed

91
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,360
that she hadn't met me sooner.

92
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,400
It would've been better
if she never met you at all.

93
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Don't talk to him again.

94
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,720
What's with you, Mr. Yai?

95
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,720
He can't be trusted.

96
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,760
Stop assuming everyone
is as complicated as you.

97
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,240
He's not doing anything to me.
Dylan is just a normal guy.

98
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,880
Women always say that
when a new man comes into their lives.

99
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,080
Mr. Yai, are you too deep into character?

100
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,640
Don't forget that we're alone here.

101
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
You don't have to put on an act.

102
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,320
I know. I'm just warning you.

103
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,320
I'm reminding you that our engagement

104
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,520
is nothing but a sham to fool everyone.

105
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,320
You have no right
to interfere in my personal life.

106
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,320
But your life

107
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,280
falls under our agreement. That means
I do have the right to control it.

108
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,880
- Yes, Aunt Bua?
- Where are you, Mr. Yai?

109
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Please come back to the penthouse now.
Everyone is waiting for you.

110
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,560
What's going on?

111
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,280
Perfect timing, Mr. Mekhin.

112
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,720
So, I can inform everyone at once.

113
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,360
This morning,
our patrol unit found a body.

114
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,280
Shot in the head and dumped
near the old warehouse.

115
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,760
Our investigation confirmed

116
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,360
that the body belongs to Mr. Pornchai.

117
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,640
What about the will? Was it on him?

118
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,320
It wasn't. We found nothing but his body.

119
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,360
Time of death was likely
around 3:30 a.m. last night.

120
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,360
If any of you had been
in contact with Mr. Pornchai,

121
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,200
please let me know.

122
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,880
Mom.

123
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,280
Mom.

124
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,480
Mr. Pornchai didn't show up
when I was there

125
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,800
because someone killed him?!

126
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,440
Lower your voice.

127
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,080
That's right.
We missed our chance to save him.

128
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,440
Then who did it, Mom?

129
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,200
Could it have been Ou?

130
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,840
I said keep your voice down!

131
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,720
Why would Ou kill the lawyer now?
He kept him alive all this time.

132
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,800
Besides, there was a fire last night,

133
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,440
and Ou was too busy trying to escape.

134
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,000
I think it's impossible.

135
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,920
Then who did it, Mom?

136
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,440
I was this close

137
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,400
to securing my position as chairman.

138
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,120
- Damn it!
- There's only one possibility.

139
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,600
The person who knew
your name was in the will

140
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,120
and has been trying
to stop it from happening.

141
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,400
Our men in Bangkok

142
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,680
have eliminated
the Hemaratsiri family's lawyer, sir.

143
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,040
But he didn't have the will on him.

144
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,080
It must be in Ou's possession.

145
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,640
We're tracking him down.
Just give us a little more time, sir.

146
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,240
Time?

147
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,240
You say that as if I have plenty to spare.

148
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,640
Finish up everything here.
I won't be in Phuket next week.

149
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,440
Where are you going, sir?

150
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,120
To visit an old friend in Bangkok.

151
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,400
And maybe drop in on Ou as well.

152
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,560
Did you order Mr. Pornchai's murder?

153
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,640
What the hell are you saying?

154
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,280
You killed Mr. Pornchai

155
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,160
because you knew
whose name was in the will.

156
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,160
Mr. Pornchai already told me.

157
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,800
Grandpa drafted the will
to make me chairman.

158
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,440
Not a filthy one like you, Yai!

159
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,480
Yai!

160
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,600
So what if I did?

161
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,400
Can you prove the will
actually has your name on it?

162
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,840
What is mine

163
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,800
will eventually be mine.

164
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,320
Hold on to whatever you have now.

165
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,200
Because when my time comes,

166
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
you won't have a damn thing left.

167
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,200
Leave me alone!

168
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,440
Where did Ou run off to?

169
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,560
And where the hell is the will?!

170
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,280
METHAS

171
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,880
What? If it's not urgent,
call me tomorrow.

172
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,520
<i>It's about your future sister-in-law.</i>

173
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,240
<i>I've emailed you. Take a look.</i>

00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200
MOTHER: NATENAREE AREERAT

179
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,720
FATHER: APICHAT THONGKORN

180
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,680
Monmeena…

181
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,400
- Does your wife know you're here?
- She doesn't.

182
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,080
- She's asleep.
- Really?

183
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,080
- She's here to get you.
- There you go.

184
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,960
- What?
- Speak of the devil.

185
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,160
Go away, all of you!

186
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,280
Go! Go away! He doesn't even
help me raise the kid anymore!

187
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,320
Go back to wherever you came from!

188
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,520
You keep dragging
my husband here to drink!

189
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,520
He doesn't care about his family anymore!

190
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,040
Go! Get out!

191
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,880
What the hell?

192
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,520
Damn it.

193
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,760
<i>Hey, they've found our safehouse.</i>

194
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,320
<i>The lawyer was killed. They left</i>
<i>the body where the police could see.</i>

195
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,280
<i>They don't even care about the police.</i>
<i>You should give the boss the will.</i>

196
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,240
The one who had Mr. Pornchai killed
is the one who hired Ou to steal the will.

197
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,599
And he'll be the next corpse.

198
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,440
Get Ou and the will
before he's disposed of,

199
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,280
and before Parin reaches him.

200
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,560
I've checked the hospitals
in Bangkok and nearby areas.

201
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,240
He's nowhere to be found.
Could he already be dead?

202
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,280
You must find him, even if he is.

203
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,480
Right.

204
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,840
Ms. Nate.

205
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,360
Are you still not feeling better?
Did you see a doctor?

206
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,600
There's nothing wrong with me.

207
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,200
What? What are you doing?

208
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
What are you doing?

209
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,920
Stop it. Can't you
stay away from me? Stop.

210
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,680
I can't.

211
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,120
How could you let
Mr. Pramet hurt you like this?

212
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,560
It's none of your business.

213
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,840
How long has he been abusing you, Mom?

214
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,480
How did you let him do this to you?
Why didn't you call the police?

215
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,640
What really happened?
Why aren't you telling me? Can you?

216
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,240
Why did you have to submit to him?

217
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,440
What happened?

218
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,360
Please tell me.

219
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,600
I'm here to help you, Mom. Please.

220
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,040
That's enough.

221
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,360
Stop with all that nonsense.

222
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,320
Do you really think
that if I tell the police,

223
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,920
they'll be able to help me?

224
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,160
After all this time, don't you realize

225
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,000
how powerful the Hemaratsiris are?

226
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,720
Mom. Mom.

227
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,560
Let's run away from this place.

228
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,320
I'll get you out of here. Please, Mom.

229
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,240
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Come with me, Mom.

230
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,240
Shut your mouth. I'm not going anywhere.

231
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,560
And stop doing this.

232
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,120
- Mom.
- Get out of here.

233
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,800
I said get out!

234
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,960
Mom…

235
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,520
Mom and daughter? Mom and daughter?

236
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,760
Pa!

237
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,040
What makes you think you can sit there?

238
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,400
I'm the mother of a soon-to-be chairman.

239
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,000
What the hell are you babbling about?

240
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,760
I'm the current chairman. This is my seat.

241
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,520
An acting chairman.

242
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,160
Soon, the will
is finally going to be read.

243
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,600
And the name stated
to inherit the position of chairman is…

244
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,120
You know?

245
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,760
Sooner or later,
I'll be sitting here anyway.

246
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,960
You'll have to get used to another seat.

247
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,680
Nonsense!

248
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,400
You're saying that like you already know
your son's name is in the will.

249
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,480
Let's just say you'd better enjoy
your time as acting chairman

250
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,440
while it lasts, alright?

251
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,360
And why should I believe you?

252
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,920
No one even knows where the will is.

253
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,640
And if 100 days pass

254
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,760
without it being read,

255
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,920
I will continue to be
the legitimate chairman anyway.

256
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,640
And the first thing I'll do
is kick you two out of this place!

257
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,640
You dumbass!

258
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,960
It might not turn out like that, Uncle.

259
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,200
- How?
- What a leech.

260
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,160
You are a leech!

261
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,120
Mr. Met!

262
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,800
Please calm down.

263
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,320
Well then, please excuse me

264
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,160
and our next chairman. Pathetic.

265
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,520
You're pathetic! Are you running away?

266
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,720
- What are you looking at?
- Don't, Mr. Met.

267
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,040
Please eat something first.

268
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,160
I'm not in the mood to eat anything!

269
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,720
Drama queen!

270
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,080
- I'm so sorry.
- Why do you have to apologize?

271
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,640
Why are you saying sorry to him?

272
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,840
I…

273
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,400
Why are you butting in?

274
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,120
You know she's not well.
Why can't you be gentler with her?

275
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,440
Nate is my wife.
I can take care of her myself!

276
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,720
And you! Just go take care
of your future husband! Go!

277
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,240
Get out, you fool!

278
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,840
Go!

279
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,240
Get back up. Get up.

280
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,480
Stop being so dramatic. Clean it up!

281
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,120
Now!

282
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,440
Thow all this away. I don't want them!

283
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,040
Yes, Jum?

284
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,680
Max, drive me to H Club.

285
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,480
Ms. Monmeena, Mr. Yai is busy right now.

286
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,520
Please wait a moment.

287
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,560
- You can decide it, Tri.
- Mr. Yai!

288
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,560
There's something urgent
I need to talk to you about.

289
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,360
Tri, wait outside.

290
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,320
Yai!

291
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,080
I took the day off specifically
to look at the furniture

292
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,040
we're importing from Italy with you.

293
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,000
If we don't get this done,
when will we have everything we need?

294
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,160
You know it takes time.

295
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,640
If we don't pick them soon,
the timeline will be postponed.

296
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,920
The renovation will be delayed.

297
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,760
I don't want anyone
in the family nagging you again.

298
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,600
Wait outside.

299
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,000
- Yai!
- Just go.

300
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,200
- Wait outside, everyone.
- Yes.

301
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,240
Yes.

302
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,560
- Please, Ms. Tri.
- Please.

303
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,000
- What is it?
- Mr. Pramet has been abusing my mom.

304
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,520
I want to get her out of there
as soon as possible.

305
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,760
Mr. Yai,

306
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,560
please help my mom.

307
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,000
I'll do anything as promised.
Just help her.

308
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,920
Please, Mr. Yai!

309
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,520
Hey, Monmeena.

310
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,480
Calm down. Compose yourself.

311
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,120
My mom has been abused.
How can I stay calm?

312
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,320
So, you're not going to help me?

313
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,400
Fine. I'll do it my way.

314
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,440
If you want to get Nate out safely,

315
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,440
we need a plan.

316
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,560
What's so great about her
that makes Yai go head over heels?

317
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,240
Please have
some refreshing juice, Ms. Tri.

318
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,360
- Take it away.
- Sorry?

319
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,920
I don't want it. Take it away.

320
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,840
What's going on?

321
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,440
It's nothing.

322
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,040
I'll go see Dad now.

323
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,120
You can tell me anything.

324
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,160
I'm your brother, after all.

325
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,520
Thank you.

326
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,160
Welcome, Ms. Tri.

327
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,080
- Dad is here, right?
- Well…

328
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,680
CHAIRMAN

329
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,240
You look stressed. What happened?

330
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,000
Why the hell do you need to know?

331
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,520
Don't you have anything better to do
than being nosy?

332
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,600
Hey, let me help.

333
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,240
It's okay. I can carry it myself.

334
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,240
Thank you.

335
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,000
You cook Thai food really well, Nate.
Teach me sometime.

336
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,160
Yes.

337
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,360
You've been living here a long time.

338
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,720
You were with Mr. Met
since Mei was still around.

339
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,040
And when she was gone,
you moved up to be… What is it?

340
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,200
Legal wife? Hmm, no. Secret wife?

341
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,200
Right?

342
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,960
You've endured all this time
for a reason, haven't you?

343
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,440
What is your reason, really?

344
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,840
I'm not sure what you're talking about,

345
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,320
but my duty

346
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,360
is only to take care of Mr. Pramet.

347
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,120
Please excuse me.

348
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,240
And about cooking Thai food,

349
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,960
Bua can teach you as well.

350
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,600
What is going on here?

351
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,720
Hey.

352
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,720
I think you two are so alike.

353
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,480
I'd believe you were mother and daughter.

354
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,920
Or could I be right?

355
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,240
Mom.

356
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,680
I'm sure Ms. Pa already knows
we're mother and daughter.

357
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,840
Let's leave this place together.
If Ms. Pa tells Mr. Pramet,

358
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,440
he'll only hurt you more.

359
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,400
Enough of this. I'm not going anywhere.

360
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,400
Stop trying to take me away!

361
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,640
Do you know that ever since
the day you abandoned me,

362
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,560
I've been searching for you?

363
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,880
When I found out you were living here,

364
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,280
I worked and saved every penny

365
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,120
because I thought if I had enough,
I could get you out of here.

366
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,200
I know you had your reasons
for leaving me,

367
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,560
but none of that matters now.

368
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,120
Because I'm here with you.

369
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,000
I want you to be happy.

370
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,840
Please come with me, so you
don't have to live like this anymore.

371
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,200
In two days, Mr. Mekhin
will help you escape abroad.

372
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,440
Let's go together, Mom.

373
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,400
Please.

374
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,280
I'll get you out of here.

375
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,600
Where's everyone?

376
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,200
No one comes up to eat anymore?

377
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,520
Uh…

378
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,720
Everyone wants to eat on their own floor.

379
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,400
The maids are serving their food.

380
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,000
No one respects me anymore?

381
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,400
I'm not having any of this.

382
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,240
What are you doing here?!

383
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,800
We need to go now.

384
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,480
Didn't you say it's in two days?
I haven't prepared anything.

385
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,040
Forget that, Mom. We have to go now.

386
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,560
We'll leave as soon
as I get a signal from Mr. Yai.

387
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,040
The plan is…

388
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,400
Mr. Yai, what's the plan?

389
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,800
There's a general meeting
at H Group that day.

390
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,600
Pramet will be there.

391
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,360
<i>When he leaves, we'll have 30 minutes</i>
<i>to get Nate in the car.</i>

392
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,120
<i>That day, Nate will go</i>
<i>grocery shopping as usual.</i>

393
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,240
<i>You have to act like you ran into Nate</i>
<i>in the elevator by chance.</i>

394
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,160
<i>Once you're on the first floor,</i>
<i>get into your own cars.</i>

395
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,680
<i>One of my men will be waiting</i>
<i>in the parking lot with a car.</i>

396
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,400
<i>Tell Nate to get in that car,</i>

397
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,080
<i>then meet her at the designated spot.</i>

398
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,880
<i>That's all.</i>

399
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,040
Mom.

400
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,960
Let's go. Get in.

401
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,600
- Wait for me in Chiang Rai.
- Yes.

402
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,520
<i>Everything's set. Follow the plan.</i>

403
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,760
Let's go.

404
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,480
Mom, don't be afraid.

405
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,520
Take a deep breath and follow the plan.

406
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,320
Where are you two going?

407
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,920
I'm going shopping for Mr. Met.

408
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,200
Ah.

409
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,920
Do you need me
to get anything for you, Ms. Apapat?

410
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
No.

411
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,120
Come with me. I'll drop you off.

412
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,360
Uh…

413
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,520
It's okay.

414
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,040
Get in. Let's go together.

415
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,360
I'm heading to a nearby spa anyway.

416
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,840
I still want you to teach me
how to cook Thai food.

417
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,280
We can chat in the car.

418
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,240
Thank you, but…

419
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,560
Come on. Get in.

420
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,280
Come on. It's raining. Hurry.

421
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,920
Yes.

422
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,200
Change of plan. I'll cancel it.

423
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,680
- Max, let's go.
- Yes.

424
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,480
Mr. Mekhin, we need to change the plan.

425
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,160
Are you trying to tell me

426
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,440
that Monmeena is Nate's daughter?

427
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,880
You don't have to believe me.

428
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,280
I heard Monmeena

429
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,240
is planning to get Nate out of our house.

430
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,200
You can see for yourself

431
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,320
if I'm telling the truth or not.

432
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,800
And what do you get

433
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,840
from telling me this?

434
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,600
The will is one thing.

435
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,560
Our family matters are another.

436
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,520
We're still family, after all.

437
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,240
I just don't want you looking like a fool

438
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,600
when the mother and daughter trick you.

439
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,560
Whether you do anything about it or not

440
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,600
is up to you.

441
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,120
I'll go get my nails done.

442
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,840
You look stressed. What's wrong?

443
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,920
Why the hell do you need to know?

444
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,040
Yeah.

445
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,360
Do as planned. I'm on my way.

446
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,400
How dare you run away from me, Nate?

447
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,880
Hello.

448
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,720
<i>Change of plan. Do as I say. Play along.</i>

449
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,080
Uh, yes.

450
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,360
I'm out grocery shopping.
I'll head home once I'm done.

451
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,680
Yes. Goodbye.

452
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,360
- Mr. Met called?
- Yes.

453
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,800
He seems really worried about his wife.

454
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,320
- Hey. What are you doing?!
- I'm sorry.

455
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

456
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,080
- Where were you looking?
- I'll wipe it for you.

457
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,600
- Don't!
- Ms. Apapat.

458
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,560
Let's clean it up in the restroom.

459
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,200
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

460
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,040
Ms. Apapat.

461
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,200
I'll buy you a new dress.

462
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,400
Make it quick.

463
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,160
I bought this one for 30,000.
It's my first time wearing it.

464
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,120
It's probably ruined.

465
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,160
What?

466
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,000
Mr. Met?

467
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,640
Are you leaving? Let's go together.

468
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,040
Get her.

469
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,200
No need. I can walk there myself.

470
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,120
Make it quick.

471
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,880
Let's go, Ms. Nate!

472
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,400
Inthon!

473
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,600
Follow them!

474
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,280
What?

475
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,200
You're such a nuisance!

476
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,640
Are you okay, Ms. Nate?

477
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,280
- I'm okay.
- Let's go.

478
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,360
Think about it.

479
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,320
Mom!

480
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,560
- Get Nate away.
- But…

481
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,720
I'll be right behind you.
Ready when you are.

482
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,440
Hurry. Let's go.

483
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,720
Let's go!

484
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,560
- Careful, Mom.
- Slowly.

485
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,480
- Quickly, Meena!
- Faster.

486
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,960
Go, Mom!

487
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,400
Hurry up!

488
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,560
Mom! Get in! Mom!

489
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,720
He's here!

490
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,440
- Mr. Met!
- No, Mom!

491
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,600
Mr. Met!

492
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,360
Let go of her! Don't, Ms. Nate!

493
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,680
Let go of Monmeena!

494
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,720
If you leave me, Nate,

495
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,560
your daughter dies.

496
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,080
Mom… Mom…

497
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,320
- Hey, what?
- Stop!

498
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,000
Do you dare stand up to me, huh?!

499
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,280
- I'll just break her neck.
- Stop it!

500
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,080
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

501
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,400
What? What are you going to do, Yai?

502
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,920
Huh?

503
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,280
Don't hurt Monmeena. I'm begging you.

504
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,160
I'll say this one last time, Nate.

505
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,120
Come back to me,

506
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,560
or your daughter dies! Move!

507
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,480
- Mom, don't do it! Don't!
- Ms. Nate, don't.

508
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,560
Mom! Get out of here!

509
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,400
Run! Don't come near us!

510
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,760
Mr. Yai! Get my mom out of here!

511
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,240
Hurry! Get her away! Don't worry about me!

512
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,520
Hurry!

513
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,960
Well, Yai. I've never seen you hesitate.

514
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,280
So, what's your choice?
Will you save your woman

515
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,920
or my woman?

516
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,840
- Mom!
- I surrender! I surrender!

517
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,920
- No!
- Please, let my daughter go!

518
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,600
- Let my daughter go!
- Mom!

519
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,160
Mom, get away from here, Mom.

520
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,600
Come back to me then!

521
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,600
No, Mom! No!

522
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,720
Don't come. Run away!

523
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,560
Mom! Mom!

524
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,120
- Get in!
- Let go of my daughter.

525
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,040
Let her go now.

526
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,920
Meena.

527
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,360
Mom! Mom!

528
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,680
- Meena, stop.
- Mom! Mom!

529
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,920
Mom! No!

530
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,800
- Meena, get in the car!
- No! Mom!

531
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,200
Is this 191?

532
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,640
- I'd like to report a crime. It's--
- Hey.

533
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,800
- Wait.
- Hey.

534
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,080
Let go, Mr. Yai.

535
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,200
What do you think you're doing?
Give me back my phone.

536
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,880
Hey, Meena, are you crazy?!

537
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,160
You think it will help?

538
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,800
They basically work for my family.
They won't help us.

539
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,520
Then, what do you want me to do?

540
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,400
If I can't get to Mom,
Mr. Pramet might do something to her.

541
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,600
He's probably hurting her right now.

542
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,200
- I can't just sit and wait.
- But you have to!

543
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,320
It's for your mom's safety.

544
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,240
Take care of the CCTVs at the supermarket.
Make sure no footage leaks.

545
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,640
Come out! Now!

546
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,120
Come here.

547
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,760
Are you trying to run from me?

548
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,560
Are you?

549
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,000
Come here! Come here!

550
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,680
Go!

551
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,360
Go in there! Go!

552
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,040
Did you think you can run from me?

553
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,680
Then you'll be in this room
even longer than before.

554
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,240
So long that I might
just forget you're here.

555
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,480
Mom! Mom!

556
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,440
- Where are you, Mom?!
- Hey, calm down.

557
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,480
Mom! Where are you, Mom?!

558
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,400
Mom! Mom!

559
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,480
Where are you, Mom?! Mom!

560
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,760
Mom! Where are you?!

561
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,760
I'm here now, Mom!

562
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,680
Mom! Can you hear me?!

563
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,680
Where are you now?! I'm here for you!

564
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,600
What the hell are you yelling for?!

565
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,480
Where are your manners?

566
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,040
Where did you put my mom, huh?!

567
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,880
Nate belongs to me.

568
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,280
I can do whatever I want with her.
Stay out of it!

569
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,600
I can't find her.

570
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,120
The bedroom is empty.

571
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,480
Where are you keeping Nate?

572
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,520
What will you do to me?

573
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,320
Try anything,
and you'll never see Nate again.

574
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,120
I might lose control and kill your mother.

575
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,800
Don't do anything to my mom.

576
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,360
Let her go right now!

577
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,480
Please! I'll do anything!

578
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,680
You're so damn annoying!

579
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,560
Your mom came to me first!

580
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,200
Think about it.

581
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,800
How do you think she got the money

582
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,640
for your heart surgery?

583
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,360
She traded her life for yours.

584
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,560
So, your mom's life belongs to me.

585
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,320
And none of you

586
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,520
will ever see her again. Get out!

587
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,720
No! You can't take my mom
away from me, Mr. Pramet!

588
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,600
No!

589
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,360
Ouch! Hey!

590
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,560
Let Nate go.

591
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,760
I can,

592
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,160
but only if you make me
the legitimate chairman first.

593
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,080
If you want to help
your woman's mother so badly,

594
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,880
then you'll have to help me too.
Do you understand, son?

595
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,880
What the hell are you crying for?
Your mom's not dead.

596
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,720
Get out!

597
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,520
Good. Keep me posted.

598
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,480
How was it, Mom?

599
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,360
They're tearing each other apart,
just as we planned

600
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,800
Take that, Pramet.

601
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,880
What a control freak.

602
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,440
So, all that's left is the will.
Once we find it, we win.

603
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,760
The will will be in our hands.

604
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,040
You'll inherit everything.

605
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,920
I won't let Mr. Pramet hurt my mom again!

606
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,920
Are there any other places?

607
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,160
- Where could he be hiding her?
- Calm youself.

608
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,400
My mom is being abused,

609
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,240
and she's no where to be found.
How can you expect me to stay calm?

610
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,320
Oh.

611
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,240
Is it because Mr. Pramet is your father
that you're so unaffected by all this?

612
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,560
The victim isn't part of your family,

613
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,600
so you don't care, do you?!

614
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,560
I never saw that man as my father.

615
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,200
How many times have I told you
to stay out of my business?

616
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,160
Huh? What the hell is wrong with you?

617
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,200
Huh? Why are you always meddling?

618
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,440
- <i>When I was young…</i>
- I told you.

619
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,120
- <i>he was abusing my mom too.</i>
- Don't stick your nose in!

620
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,400
- <i>I didn't get what was happening at first.</i>
- Got it?!

621
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,920
But as I grew up, I realized
it was physical abuse.

622
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,080
I tried to get my mom away,
just like you did.

623
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,400
But she only said,

624
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,800
"I won't run anymore."

625
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,880
She wanted to stay here
and live her life with me.

626
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,760
That's when I realized I had to do
whatever it took to become chairman

627
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,560
of this family's business.

628
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,840
If I had enough power,

629
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,880
I could protect my mom.

630
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,320
But it was too late.

631
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,680
Can I ask what happened to your mom?

632
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,200
One day, she went to work
at the foundation as usual.

633
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,840
But suddenly,
she was taken to the hospital.

634
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,800
I got there as soon as I heard.

635
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,400
But by the time I arrived, she was gone.

636
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,880
That morning, she told me,

637
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,120
"I'll make some rice porridge
for you after work."

638
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,360
Everyone said

639
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,120
my mom's death was an accident.

640
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,520
But I know it was murder.

641
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,120
Don't tell me

642
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,040
Pramet did it.

643
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,520
Pramet was drunk and asleep
in the same room as my mom that day.

644
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,640
Then, who did it?

645
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,440
I've been investigating.

646
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,440
And I'm certain
it was someone in this family.

647
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,760
As you can see,

648
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,720
they'll do anything for themselves.

649
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,960
They care about no one.

650
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,640
Someone in the family?

651
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,000
I'll make them pay with their lives.

652
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,120
I'll help you.

653
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,520
I'll find out who killed your mother.

654
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,920
We need to work together now.

655
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,080
We're in the same boat.

656
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,080
I'm dropping Meena off at work.

657
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,760
Everyone worked hard
to earn their place here.

658
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,800
Do you really think
they'll accept a nepotism hire like you?

659
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,240
Will you really be able to sponsor me?

660
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,640
But I have one condition.

661
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,560
You risked everything to help her mom
escape, yet that ungrateful woman

662
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,600
is out with another man.

663
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,360
<i>I don't like it</i>
<i>when you're with that suit owner.</i>

664
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,240
- Dylan is my friend.
- But I'm your fiancé.

665
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,440
Do as you always did
when you were your grandfather's lapdog.

666
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,480
Do what you've always done!

667
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,320
I'm a person, not anyone's lapdog.

668
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,120
Even if the will names him,

669
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,280
if I get to it first,
do you think it'll stay that way?

670
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,120
You're despicable.

671
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,200
<i>Without you,</i>

672
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,760
<i>H Group wouldn't be able to survive.</i>

673
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,040
<i>Because there are competitors out there</i>
<i>waiting to take us down.</i>

674
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,120
They'll crush us and seize the opportunity
to expand their own empire.

675
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,040
My offer will definitely interest you,
Chairman Wang.

676
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,640
That depends on what you have to offer.
