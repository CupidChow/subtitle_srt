1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,560
I'll be watching closely to see

2
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,360
how long you can
keep up this act about Monmeena.

3
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,080
I think your mother remembers you.

4
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,600
<i>She's just pretending not to.</i>

5
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,360
What do you mean?

6
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,880
The will you're looking for

7
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,840
is with me.

8
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,880
But I'm not giving it to you easily.

9
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,120
What do you want?

10
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,160
You need to help me get rid of Mekhin.

11
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,400
No matter

12
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,800
how many lifetimes you live,
you'll never beat me.

13
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,960
Damn you, Yai!

14
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,120
<i>You're right in front of me.</i>

15
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,240
How can you say my real mother is dead?

16
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,360
Don't call me mom.

17
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,960
And from now on, stay out of my life.

18
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,520
<i>Let me help you.</i>

19
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,160
If Ou wants to see Monmeena so badly,

20
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,960
I'll take her to him.

21
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,640
I won't die so easily.

22
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,080
<i>But if I do,</i>

23
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,400
<i>you're coming with me.</i>

24
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,520
I left my phone in the car.
Go grab it for me.

25
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
Meena!

26
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,080
Irregular heartbeat.

27
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,400
If she gets an IV
and rests at the hospital for a while,

28
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,920
she should recover just fine.

29
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,520
Didn't you know
that Meena has a heart condition?

30
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,920
Her heart hasn't acted up
like this in a long time,

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,080
not since she last experienced
extreme shock.

32
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,080
What did you do to Meena?

33
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,240
She almost got hit by a car.

34
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,920
Got hit by a car?

35
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,520
Are you even taking care of her?

36
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,200
Why did you let this happen?

37
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,720
I don't think

38
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,160
this was an accident.

39
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,320
It's probably because Meena
was with someone dangerous like you.

40
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,640
I won't let this happen again.

41
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't care

42
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,160
that your family owns this hospital.

43
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,400
If you can't take care of Meena properly,

44
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,000
please let her go.

45
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,800
I don't want my sister to risk her life

46
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,200
or get dragged into
your family's business.

47
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,200
Who's really warning me here, Dr. Thiti?

48
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,640
Monmeena's older brother?

49
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,800
Or the man who secretly
has feelings for her?

50
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,680
If you're worried about her
as a brother, that's fine.

51
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,040
But if it's something more,

52
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,960
I have to warn you, as her fiancé.

53
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,440
I'm Monmeena's fiancé.

54
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,680
I'll be the one protecting her.

55
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
Let's see if you can live up to that.

56
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,920
It's time to move.

57
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,920
Are your people ready?

58
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,520
Well?

59
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,600
Yeah.

60
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,880
My people are ready.

61
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,680
I did everything you asked.

62
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,600
Just don't mess it up on your end.

63
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,600
Are you sure there won't be
any problems after this, Mom?

64
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,920
Why are you overthinking this?

65
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,880
Someone's offering
to take care of Yai for us.

66
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,920
If we don't take this opportunity,

67
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,120
we might never get another chance.

68
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,720
But I think Ou's plan…

69
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,320
- Isn't it too dangerous?
- It's dangerous for Yai.

70
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,440
But it's safe for us.
That's all that matters.

71
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,080
But I still think…

72
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,320
You know as well as I do.
This world, especially this family,

73
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,760
has no place for the weak.

74
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,080
If you don't step over others,

75
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,920
you'll be the one crushed beneath them.

76
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,080
Do you want to be among the winners?

77
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,080
Are you feeling better?

78
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,600
Want me to call the doctor?

79
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,080
I'm okay now.

80
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,200
Next time, don't bother bringing me
to the hospital. It's a waste of money.

81
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,400
Nothing is a waste
when it comes to health.

82
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,520
And this is my family's hospital.

83
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,840
I could get you the most expensive
check-up package if I wanted to.

84
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,720
That's not necessary.

85
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,400
Other than my weak heart,

86
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,240
I'm perfectly healthy.

87
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,240
You don't have
to take responsibility for this.

88
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,720
It was an accident.

89
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,480
It wasn't entirely an accident.

90
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,080
Sorry?

91
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,440
It was all my fault.

92
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,000
You don't have to believe me,

93
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,720
but I assure you,

94
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,320
I won't let anything like this
happen again.

95
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,160
What's wrong?

96
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,160
Is it acting up again?

97
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,880
I'll get the doctor.

98
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,040
Why do we need this?

99
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,280
Because I told you to leave,
and you wouldn't.

100
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,200
I'm going to check on her.

101
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,040
And why can't I be here?

102
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,840
Right now, you're not a relative.

103
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,600
I need to protect her privacy.

104
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,640
Mr. Yai,

105
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,520
please wait outside so I can finish up.

106
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,360
Ms. Koy, please step outside.
I'd like to talk to my sister alone.

107
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,520
Yes, Doctor.

108
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,000
Meena,

109
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,080
what's going on
between you and Mr. Mekhin?

110
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,480
Are you sure
it's still just a fake relationship?

111
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,040
What do you mean?

112
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,720
Today, I saw how concerned
Mr. Mekhin was about you.

113
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,640
It didn't look fake.

114
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,760
I can't help but worry.

115
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,000
I don't want you
getting too caught up in this.

116
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,520
You don't actually
have feelings for him, do you?

117
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,000
Well…

118
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,640
It doesn't matter whether I do or not.

119
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,240
An agreement is an agreement.

120
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,960
We're nothing more than that.

121
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,600
Trust me.

122
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,320
Are you stressed, Mr. Yai?

123
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,640
I just needed some fresh air.

124
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,760
This is Bangkok.
The air here is never fresh.

125
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,120
It's cooler inside
if you need to cool down.

126
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,560
Or… are you avoiding someone?

127
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,120
Why would I need to do that?

128
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Someone like Ms. Monmeena, maybe?

129
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,960
Why would I need to avoid her?

130
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,360
I thought you felt guilty
for her ending up in the hospital.

131
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,040
I just took responsibility, that's all.

132
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,160
Then, if you're not avoiding her,

133
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,360
are you avoiding your own feelings?

134
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,080
What was that?

135
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,360
Ms. Monmeena is a good person.

136
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,160
It wouldn't be surprising if you liked her

137
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,560
But don't forget,

138
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,560
she's also an important piece in our game.

139
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,040
It's not too late to change your mind.

140
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,800
I'm not changing my mind.

141
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,000
Love doesn't matter.

142
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,720
What matters

143
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,120
is the will.

144
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,160
"H" FAMILY'S NEW CLUB
TO FEATURE EROTIC MASSAGE

145
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,160
NETIZENS SLAM IT AS AN INSULT TO BUDDHISM

146
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,920
It's not even open yet,
and he's already causing me trouble.

147
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,880
Hello, Mr. Sak. It's me.

148
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,760
Did you see the news? I need your help.

149
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,040
I need to buy some land, and I don't want
this news affecting the price.

150
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,720
It'll get more expensive.

151
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,360
I'll leave that to you.

152
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,160
I heard your problematic father

153
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,400
has been stirring up trouble all morning.

154
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
Looks like it'll be
a busy day for you, Mr. Yai.

155
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,000
Same goes for you.

156
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,440
You're such a busybody.

157
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,600
I was just looking out for you.

158
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,200
I've been checking with my fortune teller.

159
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,400
Apparently, big figures in this family
are about to fall.

160
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,520
They should be careful
about every move they make.

161
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Some might even meet their end.

162
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,800
Thank you for looking out for me.

163
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,880
And has your fortune teller
checked your future yet?

164
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,120
You want me to tell you?

165
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,000
I might be more accurate
than the fortune teller.

166
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,600
I'd rather not bother you.

167
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Then, next time,

168
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,440
don't stick your nose into my business.

169
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,240
Got it?

170
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,760
You can only run your mouth for now, Yai.

171
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,320
Thank you so much.

172
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,120
Are you eating alone, Mr. Pramet?

173
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,840
- Mr. Aekaphop, hello.
- Hello.

174
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,400
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

175
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,200
I just finished a round of golf
and figured I'd grab a bite.

176
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,480
I'll stop by the office later.

177
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,480
- Have some drinks with me.
- Thank you.

178
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,960
So, how's the cocktail lounge
coming along?

179
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh, of course.

180
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,120
Our big project is about to open.

181
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,880
H Group's projects
always drive stock prices up.

182
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,280
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

183
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,720
I was just talking to a close friend
about adding a massage service

184
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,280
to the lounge.

185
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,040
Huh? What kind of massage?

186
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,720
The special kind, of couse.

187
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,440
- Isn't that a bit much?
- Not at all.

188
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,680
Would Mr. Mekhin be okay with that?

189
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,520
Oh, I know how to handle that.

190
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,080
No need to worry.

191
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,720
Whatever I say, Yai will go along with it.

192
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,320
Glad to see
you and your son getting along.

193
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,720
But did you run this by your brother?

194
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,440
Why should I have to run it by Mote

195
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,440
when I'm the chairman of H Group?

196
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,240
The authority to make decisions
is mine alone.

197
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,200
Well,

198
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,040
I heard a rumor

199
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,720
that Mr. Parin and Mr. Pramote

200
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,560
have been lobbying board members.

201
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,640
And a good number of them
seem ready to switch sides.

202
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,520
I think you should be careful.

203
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,360
There might be an attempt to push you out.

204
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,800
But don't worry, I'm on your side.

205
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,960
- Please excuse me.
- Yes.

206
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,520
Mote…

207
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,800
Mote.

208
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,640
I always thought
someone as pretentious as you

209
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,280
had at least some honor.

210
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,640
But look at you, stooping so low
to do Pa and her son's bidding.

211
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,480
Just because you wanted some attention?

212
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,120
Are you drunk again?

213
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,720
Why don't you go sleep it off first?

214
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,400
What the hell makes you think

215
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,120
you could ever run our family business?

216
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,760
Do you remember what Dad said?

217
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,560
In this house,

218
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,520
a worthless man like you

219
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
can only hide in his own shadow.

220
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,600
Don't think for a second
that you can compare to me, Mote.

221
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,760
Pfft!

222
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,120
Hey!

223
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,360
You think if you weren't the eldest,

224
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,280
Dad would even care about you?

225
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,480
Mote, you…

226
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,960
Huh?

227
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,560
Am I wrong?

228
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,040
Well?

229
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,440
If Yai wasn't your son,

230
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,000
would anyone even care about you?

231
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,080
You dumbass.

232
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,680
Do you envy me, Mote?

233
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,480
You knew Dad was going to give
me everything, so you killed him.

234
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,760
If anyone wanted him dead, it was you!

235
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,480
You knew

236
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,080
he was going to hand
everything to Yai, not you!

237
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,640
You asshole!

238
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,200
- You!
- Hey! That's enough!

239
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
Enough, Met!

240
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,120
Met, stop this. Met!

241
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,120
Stay out of this!

242
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,000
Yai is my son. If he gets something,

243
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,480
that means I get it too.

244
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,720
Mei already died in this house.

245
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,000
And then Dad. Who else
could it have been, if not you?

246
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,240
Mei's death was an accident,

247
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,200
not murder!

248
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,920
She lived in this house for ten years.

249
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,880
How could she have fallen
down the stairs and died?

250
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,480
Everyone here uses the elevator.

251
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,040
Am I really supposed to believe

252
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,440
she just tripped down the stairs?

253
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,720
What did she do
to stand in your way? Tell me.

254
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,200
Have you already decided

255
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,240
who's next?

256
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,720
- Mote!
- Enough, Met!

257
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,880
That's enough!

258
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,000
Remember this.

259
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,560
No one in this house
wanted any of these deaths to happen.

260
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,320
You're just like Dad said.

261
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,200
A man like you will never be in charge.

262
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,880
You'll always be a follower, Mote.

263
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Damn it!

264
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,360
Dad always backed him up,

265
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,520
so now he thinks
he can do whatever he wants.

266
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,920
Damn you!

267
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,400
If you love Dad so much,
why don't you go join him?!

268
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,680
I've spent my whole life

269
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,280
trying to get Dad to notice me.

270
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,520
What a pathetic life!

271
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,760
Enough. Calm down, Mote.

272
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,280
Listen to me.

273
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
Mote said all that

274
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,840
just to make you think less of yourself.

275
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,280
Don't fall for it.

276
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,120
Don't let him control you.

277
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,920
We need to be the ones controlling him.

278
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
Don't forget

279
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,760
how much we've sacrificed to get this far.

280
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,120
We can't let it all go to waste now.

281
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,360
It's okay.

282
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,080
It's fine.

283
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,360
Thank you for taking
down the news, Mr. Sak.

284
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,560
I'll process the payment soon.

285
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,760
Right. Goodbye.

286
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,360
Hello, Inthon.

287
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,520
My office door is jammed.
Call someone to fix it.

288
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,000
<i>I'm out collecting debts</i>
<i>at a club nearby, Mr. Yai.</i>

289
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,840
<i>I'll head back as soon as I'm done.</i>

290
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
- Go!
- This way!

291
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,520
Go! This way!

292
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,440
Go!

293
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,840
Hurry! Get her on the stretcher!

294
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,200
Come on!

295
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,120
This way!

296
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,640
Run this way! Hurry!

297
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,640
- Hurry!
- Anyone still inside?

298
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,120
- Mr. Yai!
- You can't go in there!

299
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,360
You can't go in!

300
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,480
- No!
- Sir!

301
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,840
What are you doing?

302
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,280
This way!

303
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,480
Anyone else?

304
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,520
Come on!

305
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,280
- Here!
- Hurry!

306
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,360
Go, go!

307
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,800
Get down there

308
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,600
Hurry up!

309
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,200
<i>Hemaratsiri Street, a major nightlife hub,</i>

310
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,480
<i>was struck by terror tonight</i>

311
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,960
<i>after a fire broke out at H Club,</i>
<i>the largest nightclub on the street.</i>

312
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,120
<i>Reports indicate that Mr. Mekhin,</i>

313
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,560
<i>the heir to the Hemaratsiri family,</i>
<i>is still inside the building.</i>

314
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,320
Mr. Yai!

315
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,360
Mr. Yai is not picking up?

316
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,960
Come on. Pick up.

317
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,920
<i>Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!</i>

318
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,440
<i>Can you hear me? Mr. Yai!</i>

319
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,320
Mr. Yai, did you make it out?

320
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,200
Mr. Yai!

321
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,320
<i>Answer me. Did you get out of there?</i>

322
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
<i>Answer me!</i>

323
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,440
<i>If you don't get out of there,</i>
<i>I swear I'll be very upset with you.</i>

324
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,480
You can't leave me alone.

325
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,120
<i>You can't leave me, Mr. Yai.</i>

326
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,320
<i>Don't die. You need to keep your promise.</i>

327
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,040
How's Mr. Yai?

328
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,560
I don't know.

329
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,840
Is anyone still inside?

330
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,640
There's one more over there!

331
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,480
Bring the stretcher!

332
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,000
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

333
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,240
Mom, if Ou set this up,

334
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
the fire could get out of control.
People might die.

335
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,200
Why do you care?

336
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,640
We only supplied a few men.

337
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,720
We had no part
in actually setting the fire.

338
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,160
- But this is serious--
- Trust me, Parin.

339
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,040
We've come this far.

340
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,880
There's no turning back now.

341
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,240
<i>Did you make it out, Mr. Yai?</i>

342
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,760
I'm at the back. Come pick me up.

343
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,000
So, it was you.
I was wondering who did it.

344
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,280
You've made it out alive, huh?

345
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,000
I've been through worse.

346
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,280
This was between you and me.

347
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,400
You didn't have to drag
my daughter into it.

348
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,520
You've been searching
for your wife and daughter for years.

349
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,960
You should be thanking me
I found them for you.

350
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,680
After I put a bullet in you,

351
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,680
I'll take my daughter back.

352
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,480
- It won't be that easy.
- But it won't be that hard either.

353
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,040
What are you planning to do
with the will? Who are you working for?

354
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,920
In movies,

355
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,040
the guy about to get shot
always starts talking.

356
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,160
Buys himself time.

357
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,880
The bad guy gets taken down.

358
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,280
The hero survives.

359
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,280
I think you're probably…

360
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,160
Mr. Yai!

361
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,920
I'm the hero, Ou.

362
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,160
Mr. Yai!

363
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,840
Mom.

364
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,880
Mekhin made it out. Send the pick-up car.

365
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,160
<i>And meet me--</i>

366
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,080
Hello?

367
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,240
Everything falls into place

368
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,320
and he still manages to fail? Pathetic.

369
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,080
Mom, is this really a good idea?

370
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,199
If we leave Ou like this,
he'll come after me.

371
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,800
Then, what do you want me to do?

372
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,800
If it were us on the losing side,

373
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,080
Ou would ditch us too.

374
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,520
No one plays by the rules in this game.

375
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,520
What if he tells the police

376
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,440
we were his accomplices?

377
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,679
I don't want to go to prison.

378
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,120
Let him say whatever he wants.

379
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,120
Between you, a Hemaratsiri heir,

380
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,280
and a thug like him,

381
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,480
who do you think the police
in this country will believe?

382
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,360
Parin, Parin.

383
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,040
Listen to me. Listen.

384
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,440
The two of us didn't do anything wrong.

385
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,679
The plan to kill Yai

386
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,719
was Ou's alone.

387
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,880
He threatened our lives

388
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,200
and forced you to help him.

389
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,640
You had no choice

390
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,840
but to go along with it.

391
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,880
The weaker ones like us

392
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,000
were the victims.

393
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,160
Do you understand?

394
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,000
Go.

395
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,920
- This way!
- Go, go!

396
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,880
Follow them! Hurry!

397
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,480
Come on!

398
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,360
- Is there anyone else?
- Hurry up!

399
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,880
Is anyone still inside?

400
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,880
Hey! What are you doing with my car?!

401
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,640
Move!

402
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,160
Go!

403
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,160
Don't hurt me.

404
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,480
Where's the will?

405
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,960
I gave you a chance to make this right
and see your daughter.

406
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,280
Who?

407
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,640
Who's stopping you from exchanging
the will for your daughter?

408
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,520
You don't want to know.

409
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,200
You wouldn't be able to handle the truth.

410
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,320
What are you talking about?

411
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,800
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

412
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,000
Are you alright?

413
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,040
It's nothing.

414
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,040
Just a few scrapes.

415
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,720
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I am.

416
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,840
I'm letting them treat me
because Inthon won't stop nagging.

417
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,600
I asked him to go through a full check-up,

418
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,120
not just first aid.

419
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,920
He's been through fire,
smoke, and bullets.

420
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,880
What?

421
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
It's nothing. I was just rambling.

422
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,320
I won't die that easily.

423
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,360
I'm fine. Can't you see?

424
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,400
Good. Being around you
is taking years off my life.

425
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,520
Is it the danger that stresses you out,

426
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
or is it because…

427
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,160
you care about me?

428
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,120
Just asking. You came all the way here.

429
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,680
Who said I was worried?
I just don't want you to die.

430
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,840
If you die,

431
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,080
who's going to help me
get my mom out of that house?

432
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,480
Also, your family would be all over me.

433
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,280
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

434
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,080
Wait.

435
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,400
I'll be done in a bit.
Let's go back together.

436
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,720
That way, Max can drive
Poot and Inthon home too.

437
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,760
Poot's still handling things at the club.
It'll take a while.

438
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,720
You should head back
with him first, Ms. Monmeena.

439
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,480
I'm good with either.
You seem to work well with your team.

440
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,600
They still can't find Ou, Mr. Yai.

441
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,480
Keep looking.

442
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,360
We're not leaving him with many options.

443
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,400
Maybe he's running back
to whoever sent him.

444
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,600
PHUKET

445
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,440
<i>We're bringing you updates</i>
<i>on the fire at H Club,</i>

446
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,000
<i>Hemaratsiri family's luxury club,</i>
<i>which broke out late last night.</i>

447
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,320
<i>It was initially reported</i>
<i>that Mr. Mekhin Hemaratsiri,</i>

448
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,680
<i>the eldest grandson of the family,</i>

449
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,480
<i>was still inside the building.</i>

450
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,920
<i>However, sources have confirmed that</i>

451
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,200
<i>Mr. Mekhin managed to escape safely.</i>

452
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,440
<i>If there are any further developments</i>
<i>on this incident,</i>

453
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,320
<i>we will report them promptly.</i>

454
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,760
How did a fire break out all of a sudden?

455
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,960
They must be trying to kill each other.

456
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,400
I'm done waiting for Ou.

457
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,640
Find him and get rid of him.

458
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,520
I don't care how you do it.

459
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,360
Get me the Hemaratsiri will. Go.

460
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
Yes, sir.

461
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,120
Find out what happened to Mekhin.

462
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,880
I want to know if he survived.

463
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,320
Understood, sir.

464
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,520
Hey, cheers.

465
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,520
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

466
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,840
Hey, I gotta take a leak.

467
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,760
Watch him for me.

468
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,520
Yeah, I'll…

469
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,440
- I'll watch him. Go.
- Yeah.

470
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
- You can trust me.
- Okay.

471
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,680
Yeah, I'm here.

472
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,000
Why am I so sleepy?

473
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,520
Hey, what are you doing, lawyer?!

474
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,760
Hey!

475
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,720
Hey! The lawyer's running away!
Go after him!

476
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,240
Hey! Stop!

477
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,360
Hey.

478
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,800
- Hurry!
- Wait! You go first!

479
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,560
Stop!

480
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,360
Damn.

481
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,000
Oh, man. Wait for me!

482
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,800
Mom.

483
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,840
It must be Ou. He's calling me again!

484
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,240
Don't answer it. Just hang up.

485
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,240
Stop calling me.

486
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,240
Mr. Parin, it's me.

487
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,040
Mr. Pornchai?

488
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,240
Yes.

489
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,200
I've been kidnapped by Ou.
You need to help me now.

490
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,960
How am I supposed to help you?

491
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,840
<i>You need to come help me now.</i>

492
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,200
I'm the only one who can confirm
that chairman Preeda's will

493
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,840
states that
the chairman position is yours.

494
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,040
Huh? What did you say?

495
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,280
Don't lie to me.

496
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,000
Why would I? I was the one who rewrote it.

497
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,200
Who else knows about this besides you?

498
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,960
The only people
who know the name in the will,

499
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,920
apart from the chairman, are me

500
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,640
and Mr. Mekhin.

501
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,520
<i>Are you going to help me now?</i>

502
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,600
<i>Hey.</i>

503
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,320
I'll be at your family's cemetery.
Get there fast.

504
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,680
Are you sure

505
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,040
Mr. Pornchai said the will

506
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,840
names you as chairman?

507
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,240
He won't pick up my calls.

508
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,200
We weren't even done talking.

509
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,400
Mom,

510
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,680
do you think the lawyer
is trying to trick me into helping him?

511
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,440
What if it's not my name in the will?
What if it's Yai's?

512
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,040
Why are you overthinking this?

513
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,600
He said it himself it's you.
Why are you doubting it?

514
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,280
Because Grandpa never told me.

515
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,200
He never even acted like he cared.

516
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,160
Yai has always been his favorite.

517
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,360
If he really decided
to give the chairman position to me,

518
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,680
wouldn't that be strange, Mom?

519
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,160
But Mr. Pornchai just said the position--

520
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,200
But we just betrayed him.

521
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,040
What if this is Ou's plan

522
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,000
to lure us out and kill us?

523
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,920
Hey, Parin.

524
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,600
If Ou really wanted you dead,
he wouldn't need the lawyer.

525
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,440
He could take you out anytime.

526
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,120
- Mom!
- His only target right now

527
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,960
is Yai. Why would he care about us?

528
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,640
Then, what am I supposed to do?

529
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,160
Risk my life out there
just because Mr. Pornchai said so?

530
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,320
You have to. And do it fast.

531
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,680
If the will names you as chairman,

532
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,760
Mr. Pornchai's return

533
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,920
will help us take everything from Pramet.

534
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,080
Your grandfather's position,
the chairman seat,

535
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,200
will be yours, Parin.

536
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,960
We'll have full control over this family.

537
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,640
Hemaratsiri Family Cemetery, please.

538
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,800
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up. I'll double the fare.

539
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,520
Where is Chairman Preeda's will?

540
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,320
<i>The number you've dialed</i>
<i>cannot be connected at this moment.</i>

541
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,280
Where the hell are you, lawyer?

542
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,200
I don't have it.

543
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,640
It's with Ou! He took it!
I have nothing to do with this anymore!

544
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,320
If you don't have it,

545
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,000
then you're no longer useful.

546
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,560
Please! No! Don't…

547
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,400
Hey.

548
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,320
You're all banged up and still drinking?

549
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,880
I drink all the time.

550
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,960
It won't slow down my healing.

551
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,200
But you shouldn't be drinking today.

552
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,840
You need rest.

553
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,760
If I don't drink,
I won't be able to sleep.

554
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,760
You know I have trouble sleeping.
Give it back.

555
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,080
Shouldn't you be drinking tea instead?

556
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,760
Do you have chamomile tea on this floor?

557
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,800
Why would there be?

558
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,240
You don't have to worry about my body.

559
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,160
I'm a lot tougher than most people.

560
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,200
You only became tough
because of your family.

561
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,400
But I still think everyone
should take care of their health.

562
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,720
Aunt Bua told me
you drink so much you have gastritis.

563
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,120
So, you shouldn't drink tonight.

564
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,640
Wait here. I'll get you some tea.

565
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,880
Not that you'd listen to me anyway.

566
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,800
There are all kinds
of alcohol in your room.

567
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,800
And if you still drink it,
I'll put a curse on you.

568
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,600
Who?

569
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,200
Who's stopping you from exchanging
the will for your daughter?

570
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,120
You don't want to know.

571
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,760
You wouldn't be able to handle the truth.

572
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,960
It's late. Why aren't you in bed yet?

573
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,680
How's Mr. Yai?

574
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,560
He's fine now.

575
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,640
Aren't you leaving this house?

576
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,160
<i>Yes?</i>

577
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,680
Help! The elevator is stuck.

578
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,560
<i>I'll check on it right away.</i>

579
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,640
Hurry, please.

580
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,720
Mom? Mom! Mom!

581
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,720
Mom! What's wrong?

582
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,520
Mom, you can't breathe?

583
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,840
Mom! Mom!

584
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,520
Calm down.

585
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,600
Mom…

586
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,400
- Almost there.
- Did you get it?

587
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,440
Just a moment.

588
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,920
Ms. Nate couldn't breathe properly.

589
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,640
Aunt Bua, call an ambulance!

590
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,880
No. Don't call an ambulance.

591
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,080
- Huh?
- Don't.

592
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,920
No. Don't.

593
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,120
Ms. Nate, are you feeling better?

594
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,800
Aunt Bua, is Mr. Pramet home yet?

595
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,800
He isn't.

596
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,440
Does this happen often?

597
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,880
Is it this serious every time?

598
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,400
No one really knows.
We just know she gets sick a lot.

599
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,200
Sick? What exactly is wrong with her?

600
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,760
Does she always lose her breath
and convulse like this?

601
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,960
The maids wouldn't know.

602
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,440
Ms. Nate is always on her floor
when she gets sick.

603
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,440
And Mr. Met
always calls a doctor to the house.

604
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,440
They've never taken her to a hospital.

605
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,360
Do you have the doctor's number?

606
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,040
I don't.

607
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,160
Mr. Pramet doesn't want anyone
doing too much for Ms. Nate.

608
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,600
Can I have Mr. Pramet's number?

609
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,080
Please, Aunt Bua.

610
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,400
I'll ask for the doctor's number
myself. Please.

611
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,400
Don't do it.

612
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,640
There's nothing wrong with me.
I'm not going to the hospital.

613
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,000
- Bua.
- Yes?

614
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,600
Please take me to my room to rest.

615
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,840
Yes, ma'am. Hey, come put the water away.

616
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,080
Here. Can you walk?

617
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,200
- Slowly.
- Walk slowly.

618
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,680
Be careful.

619
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,800
Hold it.

620
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,800
Slowly.

621
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,880
What is all this?

622
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,360
Hey, Yai.

623
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,480
How did you let the fire
at the club get out of control?

624
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,480
You know
we make millions from it every night.

625
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,560
If word gets out
and people stop coming to H Club,

626
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,960
what are we supposed to do?

627
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,000
Father, is this really the time
to be worrying about that?

628
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,480
Mr. Yai almost died
in the building last night.

629
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,800
You.

630
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,040
Look, Yai. You haven't even married her,
and she's already talking back to me.

631
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,480
That fire was set on purpose.
Someone was targeting me.

632
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,040
The police are handling it.
I'll update you if there's any news.

633
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,240
Set on fire?

634
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,800
Did you catch who did it?

635
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,600
Not yet.

636
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,520
Captain Charan
should have an update for me soon.

637
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,000
As for repairs,
I'll use money from the family's funds.

638
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,560
Do you think it's okay, Mr. Yai?

639
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,440
H Club is basically your business now,

640
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,440
not the family's.

641
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,120
Why should we all pay for the damages?

642
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,200
When Heaven Home ran that PR campaign
that brought in zero profit,

643
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,040
you still used
the family's money, didn't you?

644
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,960
So, why can't H Club, which
makes millions for the family every day,

645
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,560
use the same funds for repairs?

646
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,440
When you put it that way,
do whatever you want.

647
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,280
You didn't need to ask.
Not like my opinion matters anyway.

648
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,040
I wasn't asking. I was informing you.

649
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,160
Any comments, Uncle Mote?

650
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,120
Do as you see fit, Yai.

651
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,240
Why even ask him?

652
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,360
His hospital

653
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,880
wouldn't even survive
if it wasn't for you.

654
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,280
Hurry up and get it done.

655
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,920
We're losing millions every day. Damn it!

656
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,680
What a headache!

657
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,680
Uncle Mote.

658
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,760
You've been getting close
with Parin lately.

659
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,920
There's nothing special.
We're uncle and nephew.

660
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,400
Dad said you and Parin have been
calling multiple board members.

661
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,280
He's not sure what business issues
you've been discussing.

662
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,080
Is there anything I can help with?

663
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,440
- Yai, I--
- I understand

664
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,720
that my father humiliated you
and hurt you so much.

665
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,360
But I want you to choose wisely.

666
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,800
Because even though my father
holds the chairman's seat,

667
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,960
you already know

668
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,880
that the real power in this family

669
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,240
lies with me.

670
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,360
Actions speak louder than blood.

671
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,840
Anyone who's good to me,
I'll be good to them.

672
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,840
But anyone who wishes me harm…

673
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,760
I won't let them get away with it.

674
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,520
You killed Mr. Pornchai

675
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,240
because you knew
whose name was in the will.

676
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,600
Stop!

677
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,640
So what if I did?

678
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,520
<i>I think you two are so alike.</i>

679
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,640
I'd believe you were mother and daughter.

680
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,520
If you want to get
Nate out of here safely,

681
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,320
we need a plan.

682
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,480
Mr. Mekhin will help you escape abroad.

683
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,640
<i>I'll get you out of here.</i>

684
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,720
I'll say this one last time, Nate.

685
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,520
Come back to me, or your daughter dies!

686
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,640
- No…
- Come here!

687
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,760
If you want to help
your woman's mother so badly,

688
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,440
you have to make me
the legitimate chairman first.

689
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,840
Do you understand, son?

690
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,640
The will will be in our hands.

691
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,640
You'll inherit everything.

692
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,040
I'll find out who killed your mother.

693
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,000
We need to work together now.

694
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,120
We're in the same boat.

695
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,440
I'll make them pay with their lives.

696
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,480
