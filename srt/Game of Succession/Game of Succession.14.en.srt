1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,720
Meena followed my dad's orders.
She's not at fault!

2
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,840
Do you really think
Yai will accept a traitor like you?

3
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,800
Except for Mr. Yai himself, no one can
kick me out of this place. Remember that!

4
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,640
I'll cut off their lifelines.

5
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,560
I'll let them see that without me,

6
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,840
H Group will collapse.

7
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,760
Parin, you need to do something

8
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,160
or you'll be thrown off that chair.

9
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,080
To fully avenge what Pramet did,

10
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,680
you must ensure
Mekhin loses all his power in H Group.

11
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,560
Girls under 18

12
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,320
are being sexually exploited by H Club.

13
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,760
You'll need to come with us
to the station for questioning.

14
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,880
Mr. Yai!

15
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,760
I found proof of fraud at Heaven Home.

16
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,920
How serious is it?

17
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,240
Enough to land them in prison.

18
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,840
<i>I love you, Yai.</i>

19
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,160
If you still want me in your life,
stop this nonsense now.

20
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,680
If you want Yai out of H Group,

21
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,880
just let everyone know that
Mr. Mekhin isn't a real Hemaratsiri.

22
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,000
Heaven Home was supposed to buy this land

23
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,280
from a group of individuals
liable to pay 400 million in taxes.

24
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,400
But they avoided that

25
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,320
by transferring the money to each
of them for their portion of the land.

26
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,480
That was a sham transaction.

27
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,800
We have to bring this to the public
to prompt an investigation.

28
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,320
The injured party is a government agency.
Lek will be in serious trouble.

29
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,640
Mr. Yai.

30
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,960
If we tell this to the press,
Heaven Home will take a hit.

31
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,800
This could affect H Group.

32
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,040
If you're back in the chair one day,

33
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,520
you'll have to deal with it yourself.

34
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,320
It doesn't matter to me anymore,
whether I get the chair back or not.

35
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,040
All I want is to drag them away
from the fortune I helped create.

36
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,440
No need to worry about me.

37
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,480
It'll work.

38
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,440
I'll help you.

39
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,800
The press and the board are here.

40
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,080
Guys, Mr. Mekhin is here.

41
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,600
- Hello, Mr. Yai.
- Hello.

42
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,320
- Hello.
- Hello.

43
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,720
I've invited you all,
both the press and the board,

44
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,080
because I need to share
some important information

45
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,160
involving the management
of Mr. Parin Hemaratsiri,

46
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,080
CEO of Heaven Home.

47
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,120
Is it true

48
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,360
that you're not a Hemaratsiri by blood?

49
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,840
- Is that true?
- Is it true?

50
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,080
- Please tell us.
- Is it true?

51
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,280
Are you not a Hemaratsiri?

52
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,600
Who told them that?

53
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,320
Hey, is it true?

54
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,800
There's a rumor that Ms. Mei
was already pregnant

55
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,120
before marrying Mr. Pramet.

56
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,400
Is that true?

57
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,200
Is it?

58
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,240
- Please tell us.
- Is that true?

59
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,400
Did your mother ever tell
Mr. Pramet about her pregnancy?

60
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,960
- Right. Did she tell him?
- Did she?

61
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,400
Are you really someone else's son?

62
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,600
Did she let him know before the wedding?

63
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,520
- Yes.
- Where did this nonsense come from?

64
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,280
A Facebook page called
<i>Swept Secrets Uncovered</i>

65
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,040
exposed it this morning.

66
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,040
They said

67
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,640
you already found out that
you weren't Mr. Pramet's biological son,

68
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,760
but you kept it hidden
because you wanted the chairman position.

69
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,960
- Yes.
- Is that true?

70
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,880
Did you keep this a secret?

71
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,720
- Was she pregnant before marriage?
- Please answer.

72
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,760
- Are you not really his son?
- Are you another man's son

73
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,680
- before she had Mr. Pramet?
- Please explain.

74
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,840
Everyone, please.
Let us finish what we came to say.

75
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,560
How are you involved in this?

76
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,160
Mekhin, you need to confirm
whether it's true.

77
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,280
If it is, it could damage H Group's image.

78
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,760
You need to clarify this right now.

79
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,400
- What's the answer?
- What really happened?

80
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,240
- Is this all true?
- Please explain.

81
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,640
Yes, is it true?

82
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,360
- How did it all happen?
- Is it true?

83
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,680
<i>Are you not a Hemaratsiri by blood?</i>

84
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,480
Yes, I'm watching it.

85
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,320
Keep your eyes on Parin's next move.

86
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,160
Send someone to watch Mekhin too.

87
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,280
Make sure he doesn't notice.

88
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,680
It's almost time.

89
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,600
- Is it true?
- Is it?

90
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,040
Regarding that,

91
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,720
I'll explain everything, I promise.

92
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,080
But for now, I'd like you to listen

93
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,440
to what I'm about to share

94
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,280
because it directly affects
H Group's transparency.

95
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,560
Nothing is more important than this.

96
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,320
Whatever you're about to say

97
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,080
won't matter

98
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,280
without proof
that you're truly a Hemaratsiri.

99
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,320
- Yes.
- Is it true?

100
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,120
The Hemaratsiri family will clear this up.

101
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,720
To prove that what the <i>Swept</i>
<i>Secrets Uncovered</i> page said was a lie,

102
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Mr. Mekhin will take a DNA test

103
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,120
to confirm the truth.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,200
To make things clear,

105
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,200
I hope you're fine with that, Mr. Mekhin.

106
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,160
But right now, Mr. Pramet

107
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,440
is on the run from the police.
How are you supposed to do a DNA test?

108
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,640
We need the father.

109
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,800
We might not be able
to test with the father,

110
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,360
but we can confirm it through the sibling.

111
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,520
We'll have Mr. Mekhin
take a DNA test with Ms. Triprapa,

112
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,960
Mr. Pramet's daughter,

113
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,480
who has already confirmed her DNA

114
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,320
match with Mr. Pramet.

115
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,520
I have evidence
of tax evasion at Heaven Home.

116
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,240
And I have a witness

117
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,680
who can confirm that
the evidence Mr. Mekhin presented

118
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,840
was fabricated to falsely accuse me.

119
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,160
- Fabricated evidence?
- Why would he fake it?

120
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,520
I've worked for Mr. Mekhin
for a long time.

121
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,480
I always knew he wasn't a Hemaratsiri.

122
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,400
He planned to forge documents
to wrongfully frame Mr. Parin.

123
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,080
I tried to stop him,
and almost got silenced

124
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,800
by his men.

125
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,200
He's lying!

126
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
What?

127
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,040
Traitor!

128
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,800
I have proof!

129
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,760
They both beat me up badly.

130
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,760
Did you all see that?

131
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,840
Mr. Mekhin intentionally
tried to hide the truth

132
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,080
to stay in line
as an heir of the Hemaratsiri family

133
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,360
and used violence to keep it that way.

134
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm willing to take the DNA test

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,560
to prove I'm a Hemaratsiri.

136
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,320
Once the results are out,

137
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,960
I'll hold another press conference.

138
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,360
Once the result is out,

139
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,760
you won't have a place here anymore.

140
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,080
Dad.

141
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,480
Did you see the live news with Mekhin?
He got exposed.

142
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,000
What makes you so happy

143
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,280
about seeing him get exposed?

144
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,280
So, if he really isn't a Hemaratsiri,

145
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,520
that just makes him a fatherless son.

146
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,400
His mom was just a slut,

147
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,160
so desperate
she married a loser like Pramet.

148
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,520
Don't let me hear that again.

149
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,440
It's the truth!

150
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,240
You don't know the truth yet!

151
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,960
His family exposed him.

152
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,360
Isn't it clear now

153
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,320
that he already knew
what Parin said was true?

154
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,120
You've been waiting
for a chance to destroy him.

155
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,560
He's a nobody now,

156
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,880
without a powerful family backing him up.

157
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,800
I can crush him, or even kill him.

158
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,120
No!

159
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,320
Why not?

160
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,400
If Mekhin isn't Pramet's son,

161
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,640
then he's not our enemy.

162
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,480
We can teach him his place.

163
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,520
You think just because

164
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,920
he's no longer from a powerful family,
Monmeena's going to like you now?

165
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,320
You really think someone like her

166
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
doesn't already know?

167
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,040
You wouldn't like
a naive girl like that anyway.

168
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,280
Remember this.

169
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,440
You'll never take Monmeena
away from Mekhin.

170
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,960
So, stop trying.

171
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,680
How could someone
who always runs from problems

172
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,200
ever take care of Jong's family empire?!

173
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,520
Huh, Dylan?!

174
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,760
It's done.

175
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,160
I hope we'll hear about
my promotion tomorrow, Aunt Pa.

176
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,280
How could you hurt someone
you claimed to love?

177
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,160
Don't you feel guilty

178
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,440
for ruining the life
of a brother who loved you?

179
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,160
It was your fault.

180
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,920
Yai's life was ruined because of you.

181
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,680
- If you weren't--
- He never would've loved you anyway.

182
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,760
He saw me as his sister.

183
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,920
If not, we would've been together.

184
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,360
You're just making excuses
to make yourself feel better,

185
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,400
even though you know
he never loved you the way you wanted.

186
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,880
How pathetic.

187
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,960
I loved him before you did.
You stole him from me,

188
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,480
even though someone like you
is nothing compared to me.

189
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,600
I will make Yai realize

190
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,120
that I'm the one who's right for him,

191
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,760
not someone as pitiful as you!

192
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,560
The more you destroy his life,

193
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,280
the more he'll see

194
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,840
that you're nothing
and never deserved to be a part of it.

195
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,040
Thank you, Triprapa.

196
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,000
Your selfishness

197
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,360
gave me a chance to help him
and be by his side again.

198
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,240
It can't be. Yai will never forgive you.

199
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,800
I'll love the man you destroyed
with all my heart.

200
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,080
I'll make him happy

201
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,240
and erase all the pain you caused him.
Remember that.

202
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,280
It won't be that easy.

203
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,240
Yes, Mr. Yai. I'm on my way.

204
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,720
I can't find Mr. Yai. If he's home,

205
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,960
please take care of him, Aunt Bua.

206
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,200
Why won't Inthon pick up?

207
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,320
Pick up, Inthon! Damn it!

208
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,640
Inthon! What are you doing here?!

209
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,080
What?

210
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,920
You'll see.

211
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,720
I'll destroy everything you've built.

212
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
H Group

213
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,080
and your bastard children. I swear it.

214
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,280
Hemaratsiri will fall by my hands.

215
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,600
We have to wait a month
for the DNA results.

216
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,760
But in the meantime,
Yai can't interfere with anything.

217
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,080
So, that's why
Yai's name wasn't in the will.

218
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,960
My job's done.

219
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,520
He's here for the money.

220
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,040
ONE THOUSAND BAHT

221
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,960
Here. Your reward.

222
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,920
What? It's not enough?

223
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,359
Well, I betrayed Mr. Yai.

224
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,880
He could send someone to kill me any day.

225
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,319
I don't want to die.

226
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,400
Just say it.

227
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,800
You said you'd take me under your wing.

228
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,120
Will you?

229
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Other than following Yai around,
what else can you do?

230
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,960
Well…

231
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,680
I handled some admin stuff at H Club.

232
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,920
Then, why not make him the manager?

233
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,720
He's been there a while.

234
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,520
He knows the ins and outs.

235
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,680
He can be your eyes and ears.

236
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,800
You're not allowed in, sir.

237
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,840
What? Why not?

238
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,280
Move.

239
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,400
What is this?!

240
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,920
It's Mr. Parin's order.

241
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,800
Poot…

242
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,600
Management removed Mr. Yai
from all positions.

243
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,720
You and Inthon too.

244
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,400
You're such an asshole!

245
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,520
Yeah? But seems
I'm doing better than you now.

246
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,920
And I'm not Inthon's lackey
like you anymore.

247
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,560
Poot, you bastard!

248
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,600
Dickhead! You'll die a horrible death!

249
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,000
A horrible death?

250
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,560
Huh?

251
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,600
Take him out of here! Go!

252
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,120
- Go.
- Poot! Poot!

253
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,680
Poot! Just you wait!

254
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,400
You can start today.

255
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,920
Thank you so much, Mr. Parin.

256
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,640
And thank you, Mr. Mote.

257
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,120
Uncle Mote.

258
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,120
But first,

259
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,800
there's something important
you need to do for me.

260
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,400
Yes.

261
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,480
The code. The code…

262
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,720
Let's do it.

263
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,800
Mr. Yai, Mr. Parin
made Poot the H Club manager.

264
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,280
He wouldn't let Max in.

265
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,080
About the safe
with your important documents,

266
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,600
he doesn't know the code,

267
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,840
but I'm worried he's already moved it.

268
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,160
- Aunt Bua.
- Yes?

269
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Pack all my belongings.

270
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,560
Change all the access codes on my floor.

271
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,240
And be careful.

272
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,560
Understood. I'll get on it right away.

273
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,160
Let's go to H Club.

274
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,400
Did you get it out?

275
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,160
Then hurry.

276
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,840
Uncle Mote.

277
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,960
Are you sure Yai's important documents
are at the club?

278
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,920
I heard Dad

279
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,080
gave him a bunch of land, but the deeds
still list Dad as the legal owner.

280
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,960
Once we remove him as the beneficiary,

281
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,880
we can take that land back, despite
his objections that Dad gave it to him

282
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,080
as a gratuitous act.

283
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,840
We just need to find out
what he's holding.

284
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,040
But can someone like Poot
really handle this?

285
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,200
Don't underestimate him.

286
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,320
Still have the guts
to show your face here?

287
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,800
I've been waiting for this day.

288
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,880
The day I no longer
have to show mercy to "family".

289
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,320
You're just a whining loser.

290
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,040
For someone
who's lost all his life, like you,

291
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,280
even one win must feel huge.

292
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,600
Get out of the Hemaratsiri house.

293
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,440
Did you win on your own,

294
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,960
or did you need a girl like Tri
to hatch your plan for you?

295
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,120
Dad gave you a place to stay for decades,

296
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,360
even though you're not family.

297
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,080
Don't you think you should
appreciate that, you ungrateful bastard?

298
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,200
A coward like you should

299
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,440
focus on keeping
the position you never deserved.

300
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,160
You too.

301
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,720
Yai won't let this end so easily.

302
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,480
Yai is heading to H Club. Hurry!

303
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,440
What's the code?!

304
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
I'm out.

305
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,120
Mr. Yai.

306
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,200
You're not allowed in.

307
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,400
Hey. If you dare step inside,
then go ahead and try.

308
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,240
You two are under arrest for trespassing.

309
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,960
Cuff them!

310
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,920
Hey! Inthon!

311
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,480
Where's Mr. Mekhin?

312
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,320
Poot?

313
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,840
I'm sorry, Mr. Yai.

314
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,400
If I don't kill you,

315
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,920
I'll be the one who dies!
I don't want to die, Mr. Yai!

316
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,120
It's not too late to stop, Poot.

317
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,760
It's too late. I'm so sorry!

318
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,840
Poot!

319
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,040
Poot!

320
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,560
The suspect is Mr. Mekhin Hemaratsiri.

321
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,880
Put your hands up. You're under arrest.

322
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,120
- Cuff him.
- Yes, sir.

323
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,720
Go after him!

324
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,080
Get in the car!

325
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,720
Surrender now, and you'll have a chance
to fight this in court.

326
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,800
- Hey!
- Go!

327
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,160
Come on. Go.

328
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,600
<i>Catch him.</i>

329
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,720
<i>He ran out the back door.</i>
<i>He's got a gun and an injured arm.</i>

330
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,000
Mr. Yai was shot.

331
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,640
We can't let them arrest him.

332
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
Officer!

333
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,440
What's the matter?

334
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,640
Shoot me, and your captain dies!

335
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,080
Mr. Yai!

336
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,560
Run, Mr. Yai!

337
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,240
Run! Mr. Yai!

338
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,320
Mr. Yai! Get out of here!

339
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,360
Mr. Yai!

340
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,800
Mr. Yai, go!

341
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,240
Mr. Yai! Get out of here!

342
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,280
Inthon. Mr. Yai's gone.

343
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,840
<i>I know you hate me.</i>

344
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,600
But I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

345
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,680
I just want you to know
that you still have me.

346
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,120
Whatever you do,

347
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,680
I, Aunt Bua, Inthon, and Max,

348
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,720
we're all here to support you.

349
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,600
Mr. Yai.

350
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
Mr. Yai.

351
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,720
Are you awake?

352
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
Hmm?

353
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,560
Aunt Jai.

354
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,400
I came to see you.

355
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,320
Yes.

356
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,560
The fever's gone.
Do you still have a headache?

357
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,840
A little bit.

358
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,040
Then take the medicine.

359
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,000
When you arrived,
you said you had a headache.

360
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,680
You cried nonstop and fell asleep.

361
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,760
- Aunt Jai.
- Huh?

362
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,120
Where's my phone?

363
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,080
- It's right here.
- Mr. Yai probably called me.

364
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,360
But no one's called since you fell asleep.

365
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,960
Pick up.

366
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,920
Something happened
to Mr. Yai again, didn't it?

367
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,880
Here.

368
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,680
What happened? Tell me.

369
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,160
Mr. Yai's life was ruined because of me.

370
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,960
If I hadn't worked with Chairman Wang
to betray him and steal the will,

371
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,080
he wouldn't have lost H Group.

372
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,680
He wouldn't have been crushed like this.

373
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,400
It's all my fault.

374
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,920
Now everyone knows he's not a Hemaratsiri.

375
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,239
He's about to lose everything, Aunt Jai.

376
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,199
I don't know what to do.

377
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,239
I don't know how to fix this.

378
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,960
Meena. Meena.

379
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,440
Listen to me.

380
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,840
It's already happened.
You can't go back in time and undo it.

381
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,080
We can only let the fate
of Mr. Yai and the Hemaratsiris

382
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,320
play out as it's meant to.

383
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,440
And I doubt that family
will let Mr. Yai walk away so easily.

384
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,719
What do you mean?
What's happening, Aunt Jai?

385
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,480
Aunt Jai, tell me.

386
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,880
Meena. Hey, Meena.

387
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,080
Meena.

388
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,840
Meena, slow down.

389
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,800
<i>This morning, H Group, represented</i>
<i>by Mr. Parin Hemaratsiri and his family,</i>

390
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,840
<i>held a press conference</i>
<i>regarding Mr. Mekhin Hemaratsiri's</i>

391
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,560
<i>deceptions and violent behavior, which</i>
<i>have become a matter of public interest.</i>

392
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,640
Give me the remote!

393
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,720
Ti!

394
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,320
- Give it to me!
- Ti.

395
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,560
Ti, she'll find out anyway.

396
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,960
THE HEMARATSIRIS STATES THAT

397
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,880
ALL THE CONTROVERSIES
ARE ALL MEKHIN'S DOING

398
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,400
<i>The night of the incident,</i>

399
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,000
<i>we were going to announce it,</i>

400
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,320
but Mekhin convinced us to consider
the damage it might cause H Group.

401
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,800
We truly regret

402
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,160
believing him that day,

403
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,640
not realizing

404
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,480
it was all part of his plan
to hide his true intentions.

405
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,040
We owe everyone an apology.

406
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,640
It was my fault.

407
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,560
I learned the truth that night,

408
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,680
but my bond with him as a brother

409
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,640
stopped me from speaking out.

410
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,560
I never thought he'd go that far.

411
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,840
That night, Triprapa overheard a heated
argument between Mekhin and Grandpa.

412
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,560
It was about Grandpa not appointing him
as Chairman of H Group.

413
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,640
And the next morning,

414
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,480
Grandpa passed away.

415
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,240
What Mekhin did

416
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,920
was unforgivable
to all of us in the Hemaratsiri family.

417
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,880
We urge the police

418
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,560
to capture Mekhin and bring him to justice
for all the crimes he's committed.

419
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,400
If anyone sees him,

420
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,200
please share any information
about this criminal.

421
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,120
We are offering a ten-million-baht reward.

422
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,280
Mr. Yai killed someone named Poot.
He's now on the run.

423
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,520
It's all over the news.

424
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,360
<i>Breaking news. There was a shootout</i>
<i>between police and suspects</i>

425
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,080
<i>during the attempted arrest</i>
<i>of Mr. Mekhin Hemaratsiri,</i>

426
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,480
<i>owner of a popular club in Sukhumvit.</i>

427
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,800
<i>Two police officers were injured.</i>

428
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,200
<i>Mr. Mekhin was severely injured</i>
<i>but managed to escape.</i>

429
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,240
<i>Authorities are actively</i>
<i>searching for him.</i>

430
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,400
- Mr. Yai…
- Meena.

431
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,400
- Meena!
- Meena!

432
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,280
- Ti.
- Mr. Yai. No…

433
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,720
- No, no.
- Easy, Meena.

434
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,600
- Where are you going?! No!
- Meena!

435
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,920
- Meena! Meena!
- Meena, no!

436
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,120
- Meena, you can't do this!
- Meena, no!

437
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,120
- I'll go find Mr. Yai!
- Stop! Meena!

438
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,000
- Ti! Help her! Are you okay?
- Meena! Meena.

439
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,200
- Meena! What's wrong with her, Ti?!
- Calm down, Meena.

440
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,240
- Ti! What's wrong with her?!
- Look at me, Meena.

441
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,520
- Ti! Meena! Calm down.
- Look at me. Meena.

442
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,000
- Calm down, Meena. Help her, Ti.
- Meena!

443
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,200
- Please help her. Please let her be okay.
- Meena!

444
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,160
- Meena.
- Calm yourself.

445
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,040
Take a deep breath, Meena.

446
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,160
- Please help her.
- Please wait outside, ma'am.

447
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,800
We can't be there?

448
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,720
- Ti.
- Doctor Ti.

449
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,080
- Professor.
- The staff said your family's in the ER.

450
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,120
How's Meena?

451
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,880
She…

452
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,480
After hearing the news about Mekhin,

453
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
she had tightness in her chest
and passed out.

454
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,280
She came to briefly on the way here,
but she's still very weak.

455
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,880
Her pulse is faint.

456
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,280
Her BP definitely dropped.

457
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,440
Don't worry. I'll take care of her.

458
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,080
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Professor.

459
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,880
Ti, will she be alright?

460
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,000
She'll be fine under the director's care.

461
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,760
Right.

462
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,760
Mom.

463
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,120
Alright.

464
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,320
Thanks.

465
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,160
Uncle Mote.

466
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
To our success.

467
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,120
If they find Yai's body,
we'll throw an even bigger party.

468
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,280
He's now a double murderer.

469
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,760
He doesn't carry
the Hemaratsiri name anymore.

470
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,440
Even if he came back,
the board would never take him in.

471
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,480
If Parin's path is clear now,

472
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,160
should we go ahead and present
the hospital project at the meeting

473
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,880
to replace Met's cocktail lounge?

474
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,840
Hope you haven't forgotten our agreement.

475
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,280
Once I'm officially in the chair,

476
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,080
I'll announce the change right away.

477
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,280
What about Chairman Wang?

478
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,560
He and I are close.

479
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,920
You two have nothing to worry about.
Just get ready.

480
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,560
Let that mother and son
enjoy their moment.

481
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,680
Once the hospital project takes off,

482
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,600
I'll remove Parin
from the Chairman role for you.

483
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,280
Lek won't go down without a fight.

484
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,240
But we already brought down
someone so tough like Yai.

485
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,080
Just a spoiled brat

486
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,920
doesn't stand a chance against you.

487
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,560
Without you,

488
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,800
I never could've made my dreams come true.

489
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,600
I really did choose the right partner.

490
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,360
For you,

491
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,560
I can do anything.

492
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,520
Are you really going to push
the hospital project for those two?

493
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,680
It's the fastest way
for me to get some recognition.

494
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,560
Making that move

495
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,640
will benefit them more than you.

496
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,760
You could end up losing.

497
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,680
I think

498
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,080
you should talk about
your achievements in real estate,

499
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,560
so the board sees we're generating
more profit than the hospital project.

500
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,520
Have another drink. Today's a good day.

501
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,040
We need to make the succession
official as soon as possible.

502
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,360
Then no one will dare overlook
the two of us like before.

503
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,840
Gosh.

504
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,880
Get up to your floor, will you? Come on.

505
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,720
180 DAYS HAVE PASSED
STILL NO TRACE OF MEKHIN HEMARATSIRI

506
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,240
So, you had nothing
to do with this, did you?

507
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,360
I'm the chairman of H Group now.

508
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,280
There's no reason for me
to involve myself in criminal cases.

509
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,000
Good.

510
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,240
Being that careful is the way to go.

511
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,560
Because if anything happens,

512
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
it could affect Risa.

513
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,360
Father! Parin!

514
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,600
I don't want the man
who'll be looking after my daughter

515
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,240
to be mixed up in any legal trouble.

516
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,560
You really think I don't know
how you feel about her?

517
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,840
Are you going to give me a chance?

518
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,520
That's up to you

519
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,160
to prove yourself to me

520
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,360
that you're worthy of my daughter.

521
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,360
I'll do my best.

522
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,320
Thank you.

523
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,440
Father, Parin.

524
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
The food and the car are ready.
We can go now.

525
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,920
Great. But you two go ahead.
I have a meeting.

526
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,040
What?

527
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,240
Okay? Maybe next time, sweetie.

528
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,280
Alright.

529
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,480
Once the legal process is done,

530
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,600
I'll hold the official
inauguration ceremony.

531
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,200
I'd like to invite Mr. Noppachai and Risa

532
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,440
to honor us at the event.

533
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,360
Of course. If you need help with anything,
just tell Risa.

534
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,440
Hmm?

535
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,640
Yes, you.

536
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,040
My secretary is swamped
with office work right now,

537
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,280
so I'll need your help
managing my personal affairs.

538
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,040
Alright then.

539
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,320
I have to go, sweetie.

540
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,640
Bye.

541
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,800
When everything happened,
I was so confused.

542
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,960
Mekhin not being Uncle Pramet's real son…

543
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,080
Chairman Preeda's death…

544
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,240
I used to think I knew Mekhin really well.

545
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,000
But now I'm not so sure.

546
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,640
I thought about

547
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,680
waiting to see him

548
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,000
to get the truth straight from him.

549
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,720
But maybe there's no point anymore.

550
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,120
Right?

551
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,760
Why are you smiling so much today?

552
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,960
Or do you have other good news?

553
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,640
It's the best news of my life.

554
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,200
What is it? Tell me.

555
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,880
If you tell me,
I'll give you this whole piece of bread.

556
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,720
If you want to keep it to yourself,
I'll keep it.

557
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,560
There's plenty of bread.
Why'd you take a bite out of mine?

558
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,440
You said you were giving it to me.

559
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,480
Well, I took it back.

560
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,800
Whatever you give me,

561
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,080
I'll cherish it,

562
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,640
and I'm not giving it back.

563
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,280
Uh…

564
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,520
Orange juice.

565
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,440
We need vitamin C, after all.

566
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,680
I'll bring you some orange juice.

567
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,560
Have it.

568
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,320
Director of Cardiology Center?

569
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,160
It's the new project for our hospital.

570
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,680
Cardiology is very important.

571
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,360
I'd like someone skilled

572
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,880
and trustworthy like you to work with me.

573
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,880
Take a seat.

574
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,280
Yes.

575
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,920
During this time,
you should work more closely with me

576
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,600
to learn about the management side.

577
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,000
Of course, Professor.

578
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,760
Are you going to say something?

579
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,080
Oh…

580
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,240
I just wanted to thank you
for saving Meena that day.

581
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,200
She's lucky it was broken heart syndrome
and nothing more serious.

582
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,640
But she still had to stay here
for weeks to recover.

583
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,240
If you hadn't allowed her
to be treated here, I wouldn't--

584
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,800
Wouldn't be able to focus on work?

585
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,640
Yes.

586
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,000
And about the medical bill you covered,

587
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,600
I'll repay you.

588
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,960
If you want to return the favor,

589
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,680
just keep doing great work.

590
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,000
That's enough to impress me.

591
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,480
I'll do my best to live up
to the trust you've placed in me.

592
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,840
H GROUP GAINS PARTNERSHIP

H GROUP, LED BY PARIN HEMARATSIRI, MEETS
FOREIGN INVESTORS TO EXPAND GLOBALLY

594
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,400
They're enjoying their lives
without any shame.

595
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,400
How do I deal with these people?

596

599
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,800
TRIPRAPA HEMARATSIRI TO BE APPOINTED
AS EXECUTIVE OF H GROUP

600
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,840
Come in.

601
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,960
I brought you some milk.
Mom said you didn't have dinner.

602
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,480
Thank you.

603
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,120
Everything okay, Ti?

604
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,960
Why don't you move back to Chiang Rai
to be with your parents?

605
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,120
Well, I might be able to find
a better job here than there.

606
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,560
That's all. Nothing else.

607
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,560
You're not staying because

608
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,200
you still hope to find Mekhin, are you?

609
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,800
If he were still alive,

610
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,080
he would've come back to me by now.

611
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,480
He wouldn't have left me
waiting this long.

612
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,360
Meena…

613
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,720
Yeah?

614
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,400
I won't bother you, then.

615
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,680
Get some rest.

616
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,960
Yes.

617
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,920
Meena, can I say something?

618
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,920
Whatever you do,

619
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,880
I'll always respect your choices.

620
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,560
I just want you to be happy.

621
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,080
But if you're ever struggling,

622
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,240
you can always come to me.

623
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,560
Right. Thank you, bro.

624
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,600
Love you, best brother in the world.

625
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,400
Good night.

626
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,880
If your father were alive,

627
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,800
he'd be so proud of you today.

628
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,040
This is Nida, the niece of Ms. Warapa,

629
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,400
one of the top real estate moguls
in the north.

630
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,080
I'd like you to have dinner with her.

631
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,000
I'm not interested in that right now.

632
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:58,520
You should reconsider. If you marry Nida,

633
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,000
we'll gain a powerful business ally.

634
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,960
We need to get going.
I don't want to be late for the event.

635
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,520
But… Parin. Parin!

636
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,440
Welcome, honored guests.

637
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,920
Please welcome

638
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,520
Mr. Parin Hemaratsiri,

639
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,960
the new chairman of H Group, to the stage.

640
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,120
I want to thank all of you

641
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,880
for being here
as H Group enters a new era.

642
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,480
And our first project

643
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,840
is the Heaven Wellness
of Bangkok Hospital,

644
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,680
and I will be the one…

645
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,360
leading it.

646
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,560
The Heaven Wellness of Bangkok project

647
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,920
will pioneer the integration
of advanced technology

648
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,880
to elevate
the healthcare services we provide.

649
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:49,120
Our top priority is customer satisfaction,

650
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,000
as we strive to meet
the demands of modern lifestyles.

651
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,840
This spans 16,000 square meters
in the heart of Bangkok.

652
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,800
It's not happening!

653
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,160
No.

654
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,840
No.

655
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,880
That hospital project will never happen.

656
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,600
Chairman Wang?

657
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,760
Because the land you plan to build on

658
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,720
belongs to the Jongtraipattana family.

659
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,320
Chairman Wang.

660
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,200
Why don't we talk about this another time?

661
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,360
We might not get that chance. You may not
be able to speak to me anymore.

662
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,040
You'll have to speak with the new chairman

663
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,720
of JW Group.

664
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,280
<i>I'd like to appoint Mark</i>

665
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,720
<i>as the new chairman of Jongtraipattana,</i>

666
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,920
<i>effective immediately.</i>

667
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
<i>You're the Mr. Yai I love.</i>

668
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,000
I must just look a lot like him.
That's probably why you're confused.

669
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,640
<i>Mr. Joe informed us that Mr. Parin</i>
<i>hired him in connection to Poot's murder</i>

670
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:04,920
<i>six months ago at H Club.</i>

671
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Why did he have to turn himself in?!

672
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,520
There must be someone behind this.

673
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,000
Who?!

674
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,600
I'll never hand

675
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,560
the Jongtraipattana family
over to you, Dylan!

676
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,240
I'm not trying to take anything from you.

677
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,680
Take whatever Dad gave you,

678
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,720
but you have to let me have Monmeena.

679
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,720
I'm happy to be your future sister-in-law.

680
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,880
It's unbelievable how Poot's death
has opened so many doors for us.

681
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,560
This couple is hiding some dark secrets

682
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,840
about the deaths
of Chairman Preeda… and Mei.

683
