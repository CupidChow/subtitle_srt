1
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,920
You killed Mr. Pornchai

2
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,640
because you knew
whose name was in the will.

3
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,000
Yai!

4
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,040
So what if I did?

5
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,520
<i>I think you two are so alike.</i>

6
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,040
I'd believe you were mother and daughter.

7
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,720
If you want to get Nate out safely,
we need a plan.

8
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,880
Mr. Mekhin will help you escape abroad.

9
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,040
<i>I'll get you out of here.</i>

10
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,120
I'll say this one last time, Nate.

11
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,920
Come back to me, or your daughter dies.

12
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,040
- No.
- Move!

13
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,160
<i>If you want to help</i>
<i>your woman's mother so badly,</i>

14
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,840
make me the legitimate chairman first.

15
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,160
Do you understand, son?

16
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,040
The will will be in our hands.

17
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,040
You'll inherit everything.

18
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,440
I will find out who killed your mother.

19
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,400
We have to work together.

20
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,520
We're in the same boat now.

21
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,960
I'll make them pay with their lives.

22
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Are you sure about taking this job?

23
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,160
Yes, if I just stay at home,

24
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll go insane thinking about my mother.

25
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,840
Alright then.

26
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,960
As for your mother, I've got people
keeping an eye on Pramet.

27
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,920
Once we get a lead,
we'll help her immediately.

28
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,960
Thank you so much.

29
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,960
Well, well,
where are you two off to so early?

30
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,160
Where could they go?

31
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
Of course, they're going
to find Monmeena's mother.

32
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,520
I do hope you find her soon, Monmeena.

33
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,120
I'm really worried

34
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,120
that Mr. Pramet might go insane
and kill her before you get the chance.

35
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,080
Well then,
I hope you find the will soon too.

36
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,519
I'm afraid Mr. Yai
will get it before you do.

37
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,640
Monmeena!

38
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,000
Go ahead and talk big,

39
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,920
but when your mother dies,
I'll send a wreath to congratulate you.

40
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
Meena,

41
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,800
don't waste your time
on worthless people like them.

42
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,080
Once the will is revealed,

43
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,520
you two will be the worthless ones.

44
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,920
Even if the will names him,

45
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,840
if I get to it first,
do you really think it'll stay that way?

46
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,000
You're truly despicable.

47
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,200
It'll have the name
of whoever gets to it first.

48
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,560
Yai!

49
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,040
Don't assume you're above others.
It's not a good look.

50
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,640
A nightclub singer like you
has no right to speak like that!

51
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,560
You're defending him a lot. You really
don't know the truth yet, do you?

52
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,960
What truth?

53
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,720
I'm not telling you just yet.
Let's save the surprise.

54
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,640
But one thing's for sure.
You two are going to fall apart.

55
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,640
Let's go to work, Mother.

56
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,680
We wouldn't want people saying the new
chairman of H Group is irresponsible.

57
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,600
What did Mr. Parin mean by that?

58
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,280
Nothing.

59
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,400
<i>I think my mother's death might be</i>
<i>connected to the Honest Heart Foundation,</i>

60
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,520
<i>the foundation she founded herself.</i>

61
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,240
Mrs. Mei, there's an emergency.

62
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,680
What is it?

63
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,160
Please look at this document.
I can't make a decision.

64
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,280
Alright.

65
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,840
<i>I remember</i>
<i>she would spend her whole day here.</i>

66
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,240
<i>I got to see a different side of her,</i>

67
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,920
<i>one I'd never seen at home.</i>

68
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,360
<i>The part of her that was capable</i>

69
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,040
<i>and confident.</i>

70
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,680
<i>She gave everything she had</i>
<i>to make this foundation successful,</i>

71
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,400
<i>and that's why</i>
<i>it still stands strong today.</i>

72
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,200
That's why I think the foundation
might hold some clues about the truth.

73
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,680
I've tried
sending people in to investigate,

74
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,800
but there are things they can't access.

75
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,680
Then, let me help you this time.

76
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,040
I'll work at the foundation

77
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,400
and find out the truth for you.

78
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,680
I'll do my best. Don't worry.

79
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,720
Let me know if you need anything.

80
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,040
I'll put all my effort into
investigating your mother's case.

81
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,720
Hello, Yai.

82
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,680
What brings you to the foundation?

83
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,560
I'm dropping Monmeena off for work.

84
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,720
She's going to work here?

85
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,640
Sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

86
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,600
I hope the vice president
isn't upset with me.

87
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,159
I could never be upset with you.
You should know that.

88
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,360
What position will Monmeena be taking?

89
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Accounting assistant.

90
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,040
I don't think that's appropriate.

91
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,920
It's not a position just anyone can do.

92
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,600
I believe I can handle it.

93
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,080
Meena…

94
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,320
People might not take it well,

95
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,200
seeing you bring someone you know
into the finance department.

96
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,120
Tri, the foundation was my mother's.

97
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,680
If I want my fiancée to work here,
that shouldn't be an issue.

98
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,520
I also want Monmeena to be involved
in our family's business.

99
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,080
I trust you understand.

100
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,560
Of course.

101
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,240
Then, I'll leave Meena in your care.

102
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,040
Of course.

103
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,600
This is your assignment.

104
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,880
What exactly do you want me to do?

105
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Find sponsors for the fundraising event.

106
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,840
Sponsors?

107
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,720
And how does that relate to my job
as an accounting assistant?

108
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,560
Well, not just anyone can do this.

109
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,960
But I suppose you wouldn't want
to embarrass yourself,

110
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,240
letting people see
that Yai's fiancée is useless

111
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,760
and just leeching off his money.

112
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,320
I don't care what others think.

113
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,320
You're quite naive.

114
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,000
Even if you and Yai
claim connections don't matter,

115
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,320
do you really think
you'll be able to work here smoothly?

116
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,880
Every employee had to go
through multiple exams

117
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,560
and fierce competition
to earn their place here.

118
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,480
Do you really think they'll accept
a nepotism hire like you?

119
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,120
I'm giving you this task

120
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,840
so you can prove

121
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,040
that you belong here
because of your abilities.

122
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,080
Fine.

123
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,320
Good. Get it done quickly.

124
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,800
The event is next week.

125
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,080
- Hey!
- Let go of me!

126
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,800
It took forever to track you down.

127
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,160
Stay still.

128
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Hey.

129
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,520
Where is Ou?

130
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,520
I don't know!

131
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,440
Don't lie to me.

132
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,120
Tell me where he is

133
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,080
and where he's hiding the will.

134
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,080
I don't know!

135
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,760
Should we just end him here
and not waste our time?

136
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,000
Huh?

137
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,640
I really don't know where he is.

138
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,160
Then tell me
who hired you to steal the will.

139
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,240
If you don't talk,

140
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,760
you'll be meeting the Grim Reaper soon.

141
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,400
Stay quiet, and next time,
I won't aim for your leg.

142
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,760
I'll go for your balls instead.

143
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,800
Alright! I'll tell you!

144
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,160
I'll tell you.

145
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,640
Who?

146
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,240
Charman Wang?

147
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,520
Yes. Wang Zhong.

148
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,760
He owns multiple businesses in Phuket

149
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,240
and holds
significant influence in the area.

150
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,040
But why would he want the will?

151
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,760
He has no connection
to the Hemaratsiri family.

152
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,160
Figure out where he is now.

153
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,680
I want to know exactly what he's planning.

154
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,000
BANGKOK

155
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,440
SUVARNABHUMI AIRPORT

156
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,520
Are you okay, Ms. Meena?

157
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,160
I'm okay. I have to secure
a sponsor today, no matter what.

158
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,040
Good luck!

159
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,600
Thanks. I'm heading in.

160
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,760
Got it.

161
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,360
Why does this company look so familiar?

162
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,800
Hello. How may I help you?

163
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,880
I'm here to request sponsorship
on behalf of the Honest Heart Foundation.

164
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,160
Do you have an appointment?

165
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,120
No, I don't.

166
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,520
Please wait a moment.

167
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,280
Oh no.

168
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,360
It's a real estate company,
just like Hemaratsiri!

169
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,320
That makes them direct competitors.

170
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,320
There's no way
they'll agree to sponsor us.

171
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,360
Ms. Tri is so cruel!

172
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,760
I better get out of here.

173
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,840
Excuse me, miss. What's your name?

174
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,320
Excuse me?

175
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,520
Yes?

176
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,440
What's your name?

177
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,200
I'm Monmeena.

178
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,400
Her name is Monmeena.

179
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,960
Yes.

180
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,280
Please proceed to the 11th floor.

181
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,760
Proceed?

182
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,840
Yes. The elevator is that way.

183
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,760
Thank you.

184
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,480
Please have a seat and wait here.

185
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,800
Thank you.

186
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,600
All this just for a sponsorship request?
Do I have to meet the executive?

187
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,280
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

188
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,800
I was informed

189
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,680
that you're here from
the Honest Heart Foundation,

190
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,160
seeking sponsorship. Is that correct?

191
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,200
Yes, sir.

192
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,120
But before anything, I'd like to clarify

193
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,080
that our foundation

194
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,840
has no hidden agenda
regarding JW Development.

195
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,280
I understand

196
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,920
that your company
is a competitor to Heaven Home,

197
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,240
but this event is strictly for charity.

198
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,400
These are the foundation's documents.

199
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,440
Please have a look.

200
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,320
This event will bring together
many companies and organizations.

201
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,640
If JW Development sponsors us,

202
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,280
it would contribute
to the company's positive image as well.

203
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,560
My company doesn't
already have a good image?

204
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,280
No, sir.

205
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,920
That's not what I meant at all.

206
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,920
I just think

207
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,480
this would further enhance
your company's reputation.

208
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,000
Don't you think

209
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,040
this looks suspicious to me?

210
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
No, sir. I didn't mean…

211
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,760
I think that's enough.

212
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,040
Please take care of the paperwork.

213
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,760
Yes, sir.

214
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,040
I was having fun.

215
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,000
Nice to meet you.

216
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,920
Why is the CEO acting like this?

217
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,720
You tricked me, didn't you?

218
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,320
I knew you were here from the start.

219
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,120
From where?

220
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,080
Honest Heart Foundation, sir.

221
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,880
What's her name?

222
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,520
What's her name?

223
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,200
What's your name?

224
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,360
Excuse me? What's your name?

225
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,680
I'm Monmeena.

226
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,160
<i>Her name is Monmeena.</i>

227
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,360
Her name is Monmeena.

228
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,160
Let her come to the 11th floor.

229
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,280
So, I should be calling you
Mr. CEO now, shouldn't I?

230
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,040
Come on. Just call me
the same way you always do.

231
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,160
We're friends now, aren't we?

232
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,720
Since when?

233
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,080
Starting now.

234
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,000
We keep running into each other.

235
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,760
It's fate.

236
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,000
You can't escape me now.

237
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,480
Tell you what.

238
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,920
If you agree to be my friend,
I'll sponsor your event.

239
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,280
Deal.

240
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,640
That was fast.
Not even going to think it over?

241
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,360
No need. I have to get this sponsorship.

242
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,000
I need to rub it in
that scheming fiancée's sister's face.

243
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,160
Fiancée's sister? You mean Ms. Triprapa?

244
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,840
Obviously. She set me up
to come ask for sponsorship here.

245
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,400
So, will you really be able to sponsor me?

246
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,920
Won't there be any issue later?

247
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,760
No worries. If I say yes, then it's a yes.

248
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,560
The reason is what you just said.

249
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,600
But I have one condition.

250
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,360
What is it?

251
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,880
You have to have dinner with me tonight.

252
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,000
Are you changing your mind
and telling Mr. Mekhin's guys?

253
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,960
No way. Then they'll just follow me
and keep an eye on me again.

254
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,760
That serious?

255
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,600
You've already seen
how Mr. Yai is, haven't you?

256
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,320
Maybe he's just jealous.

257
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,400
No way. He won't be jealous.

258
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,000
It's just a meal with a friend.

259
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,480
Is there another way out of here?

260
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,560
It's been boring lately.

261
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,680
I haven't been anywhere at all.
Just stuck at home.

262
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,680
What are you bored of? Don't stress.

263
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Let's go somewhere after this.

264
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,680
- Shall we?
- Shall we go to the beach?

265
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,400
Three or four days should be good.

266
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,280
- Wow, sounds great. It's been a while.
- Let's relax.

267
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,440
That sounds good.

268
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,480
Stress makes you age fast.

269
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,840
Good afternoon, Ms. Tasanee.

270
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,160
Good afternoon, Mr. Mekhin.

271
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,440
I'm sure you already know
I'm here to talk about the land.

272
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,280
Yes, I've heard from Mrs. Pa.

273
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,680
Then I'll be straightforward.

274
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,600
I want to buy your land.

275
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,400
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

276
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,960
Is it because you're uncomfortable
with my plan to develop a lounge there?

277
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,680
At first, yes. But now,
I don't really care about that anymore

278
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,600
because the land isn't mine anymore.

279
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,280
Someone else made an offer,

280
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,200
double the price your family proposed.

281
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,600
If you were in my position,
wouldn't you have sold it too?

282
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,000
May I ask who bought it?

283
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,920
Do you want me to look further
into the new landowner?

284
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,000
No need. I'll find out tomorrow.

285
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,240
So, shall we go back to the penthouse?

286
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,360
MAX

287
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,040
- What is it?
- Ms. Monmeena is missing, sir.

288
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,600
I've been waiting for her
to finish her business,

289
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,040
but she hasn't come back yet.

290
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
<i>I called both the penthouse</i>
<i>and the foundation.</i>

291
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,080
No one has seen her.

292
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,800
Have you tried calling her?

293
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,200
I have,

294
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,920
but she's not picking up.

295
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,880
Return to the penthouse.

296
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Check Pramet's floor and call me back.

297
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,400
Understood, sir.

298
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,840
Cheers.

299
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,480
Thank you

300
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,560
for helping me with the sponsorship today.
Otherwise, I'd be in trouble.

301
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,040
It's nothing.

302
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,480
People who come to celebrate
don't usually look like that.

303
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,120
What do you mean?

304
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,960
Your mouth is smiling,
but your eyes aren't.

305
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,040
Is it that obvious?

306
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,240
You don't have to hide it with me.

307
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,080
Just be yourself.

308
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,480
Sorry for ruining the mood.

309
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,200
If something's bothering you,
you can tell me.

310
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,720
We're friends now.

311
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,960
There's been a lot going on at home.
It's stressing me out.

312
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,240
Is there anything I can do to help?

313
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,000
It's complicated.
I feel like there's nothing I can do.

314
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,240
I feel like I'm just a burden to Mr. Yai.

315
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,720
You're his fiancée.
I doubt he sees you as a burden.

316
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,160
He already has enough to deal with.

317
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,840
His existing business, new projects,
and all the internal family matters.

318
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
And I can't do anything to help him.

319
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,920
By new project,

320
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,360
you mean the cocktail lounge?

321
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,520
I've heard about that from some friends.

322
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
You know about it too?

323
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,920
It's a small world. Everyone knows.

324
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,680
Well, right now,
he's trying to buy land for it,

325
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,040
but it's not going very smoothly.

326
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,760
What if I know the owner of that land?

327
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,200
Seriously?

328
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,760
Of course. Why would I lie?

329
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
I could arrange a meeting
between you and the owner.

330
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,200
That way, you might be able
to help Mr. Yai with the deal.

331
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,360
Wow.

332
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,360
That would be amazing. Thank you so much.

333
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,720
Wow.

334
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,320
Come on. Let's toast to that.

335
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,720
Cheers.

336
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,480
Cheers.

337
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,640
You are serious about this, right?

338
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,240
MONMEENA

339
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,280
Thank you, sir.

340
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,520
It's nice to unwind like this
once in a while.

341
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,800
Anytime you want to go out, just call me.

342
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,960
Don't you have work to do, Mr. CEO?

343
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,160
Well… today happens to be a free day.

344
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,040
I work too, sort of.

345
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,000
Alright then, next time, it's on me.

346
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,320
I want Omakase.

347
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,160
Omakase?

348
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,880
You only paid
for one little meal this time.

349
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,160
Then, Wagyu beef

350
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,240
from New Zealand.

351
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,240
- It's Australian Wagyu, actually.
- Oh, really?

352
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,320
Is it okay?

353
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,640
I think

354
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,720
I'm starting to lose track
of what I'm saying. Let's toast again.

355
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,200
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

356
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,120
MR. YAI

357
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,120
I have a reservation.

358
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,280
This way, please.

359
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,800
After you, Mr. Thana.

360
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,560
Hey.

361
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,200
You can't beat me. See?

362
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,240
Bottoms up.

363
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,880
You know Mr. Dylan?

364
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
Do you?

365
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,880
Of course.

366
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,640
He's the new CEO of JW Development.

367
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,160
So, it's him.

368
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,600
Yes. He's only been
in the position for a short time,

369
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,080
but he's already
making a name for himself.

370
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,480
Please have a seat.

371
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,120
Two bottles.

372
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,960
We're alcoholics, aren't we?

373
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,480
Are we?

374
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,960
What are you doing?

375
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,600
Where should I look for her, sir?

376
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,280
PARIN

377
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,720
<i>Your woman is quite special, huh?</i>

378
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,000
Looking for your woman, big bro?

379
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,120
Where is she?

380
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,160
You're awfully impatient, aren't you?

381
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,720
Fine, I'll tell you.

382
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,160
She just left a moment ago.

383
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,440
But I'm not sure

384
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,680
if she's heading straight home
or somewhere else.

385
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
What the hell do you mean?

386
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,200
Well, the one she came with
was the CEO of JW.

387
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,240
Smart woman, isn't she?

388
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,680
The moment she realizes
the will isn't in your name,

389
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,440
she finds someone new right away.

390
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,560
Sir, let it go. It's not worth it.

391
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,880
You risked everything
to help her mom escape,

392
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,080
yet that ungrateful woman
is out with another man anyway.

393
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,000
Like mother, like daughter. Right?

394
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,360
I'm warning you. Shut your damn mouth

395
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,600
before I lose my patience.

396
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,320
Then don't hold back.

397
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,240
Leave Hemaratsiri anytime.

398
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,160
I can take care of everything myself.

399
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,160
Mr. Yai, please.

400
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,480
What are you looking at?

401
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,920
Thank you for everything.

402
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,280
Anytime.

403
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,520
MR. YAI

404
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,520
I should go inside now.

405
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,320
Drive safely.

406
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,520
Alright. Let's meet again soon.

407
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,520
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

408
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,440
I sent you to get sponsorship,
yet you disappeared all day,

409
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,880
only to return
with a man dropping you off.

410
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,800
Why are you even with my brother? Tell me.

411
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,080
You sure are invested, obsessed…

412
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160
Oh, no.

413
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,080
I should say
you care about my life so much.

414
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,280
Hey.

415
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,400
You're really mean

416
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,600
to send me to ask for sponsorship from JW.

417
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,960
Not my problem.
You were the fool who walked into it.

418
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,560
I assume you made a fool of yourself?

419
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,520
Hate to disappoint,

420
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,480
but JW has agreed
to sponsor the fundraiser.

421
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,600
Impossible. I don't believe you.

422
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,560
Feel free to call and check.

423
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,720
Or maybe… you got the sponsorship

424
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,440
because you personally
approached someone important

425
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,800
with your nightclub skills?

426
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Don't make people think
you only have money

427
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,680
but not common sense.

428
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,320
You just keep
looking down on other people.

429
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,720
Don't get cocky just because
you're engaged to my brother.

430
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,680
I only show respect
to those who deserve it.

431
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,320
Now, if you'll excuse me,

432
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,800
I have a fiancé to "cozy up" to.

433
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,520
He's probably been waiting for me.

434
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,160
Don't you know he's not home yet?

435
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,920
Why isn't he answering?

436
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,720
This way, please, sir.

437
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,400
- Yai.
- Mr. Yai.

438
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,080
Why didn't you answer my phone?

439
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,320
Hey.

440
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,440
He was really worried
when you went missing.

441
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,440
He searched for you for hours.

442
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,720
It might be best to talk to him tomorrow.

443
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,920
Tonight isn't the right time.

444
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,080
I can't wait until tomorrow.

445
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,800
I'm sorry, Mr. Yai, for disappearing
like that and wasting your time.

446
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,600
Are you mad at me?

447
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,360
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

448
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,080
I had my phone on silent.

449
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,600
I saw them
when I got back to the penthouse.

450
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,360
And where were you?

451
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:44,880
I told you from the very first day
you came here how you should act.

452
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,000
Did you forget? Should I put it
in writing? Maybe draft an MOU?

453
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,320
Mr. Yai,

454
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,440
please calm down. Let me explain.

455
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,400
Explain or make excuses?

456
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,000
You remember Dylan, right?

457
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,760
He's the CEO of the company
I was meeting with for a sponsorship.

458
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,040
He agreed to donate to the foundation,

459
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,600
and after our meeting,

460
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,760
I had dinner with him as a thank-you.

461
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,440
Dylan?

462
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,680
The owner of that suit jacket?

463
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,440
I won't do it again.
I don't want to trouble you.

464
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,320
You're not troubling me.

465
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,520
But you might be troubling him.

466
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,880
Please, don't do anything to him.

467
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,280
I was just worried about you.

468
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,160
There's already enough chaos going on.

469
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,560
I'm sorry.

470
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,440
I won't do it again.

471
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,840
Go take a shower.
I need to get back to work.

472
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,440
Alright, I won't bother you then.

473
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,320
And…

474
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,080
I don't like it
when you're with that suit owner.

475
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,240
Dylan is my friend.

476
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,880
But I'm your fiancé.

477
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,000
Which one should matter more?

478
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,360
I meant…

479
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,600
we're in the same boat now.

480
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,880
Yes.

481
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,320
Why am I overthinking this so much?

482
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,400
<i>I've arranged a meeting with</i>
<i>the landowner. Are you available today?</i>

483
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,480
Chairman Wang has arrived in Bangkok.

484
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,920
There must be something serious
for him to come in person.

485
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,120
Yes. I also heard he's seriously ill.

486
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,360
If it weren't important,
he wouldn't have left his mansion.

487
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,600
Could he be here

488
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,000
to retrieve the will from Ou?

489
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,880
I doubt he has it yet.

490
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,800
We're still negotiating with Ou
about Monmeena.

491
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,080
Anything else?

492
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,080
Well…

493
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,240
Mr. Yai.

494
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,800
Could you stop ignoring Ms. Monmeena?
I feel bad for her.

495
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,640
Ignoring her? I'm acting normal.

496
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,440
If I didn't know better,

497
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,880
I'd think you were jealous.

498
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,520
Stop talking about this.

499
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,680
Dylan.

500
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,400
Am I late?

501
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,960
Not at all. We still have time.

502
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,840
- Great, let's go then.
- This way.

503
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,000
Good morning.

504
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,440
We have a reservation.

505
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,040
Right this way, please.

506
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,520
Please, come in.

507
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,800
Mr. Yai? Why are you here?

508
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,280
I should be the one asking you that.

509
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,760
Shall we sit first?

510
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,560
This way, please.

511
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,440
Mr. Yai,

512
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,240
are you here to meet the landowner
for the cocktail lounge project?

513
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,200
Yes.

514
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,360
And how do you know?

515
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,560
Because Dylan knows the landowner

516
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,760
and arranged this meeting for me.

517
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,560
And why did you need to be here?

518
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,440
Because…

519
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,600
I wanted to help you.

520
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,760
There are plenty of ways to help.

521
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,120
Why did it have to be through him?

522
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,200
She was worried, so I offered to help.

523
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,880
I hope you don't think I'm overstepping.

524
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,320
You're overstepping.

525
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,480
Apologies for the wait.

526
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
We finally meet, Mekhin.

527
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,400
I must admit, I didn't expect this.

528
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,560
I didn't realize you were the landowner.

529
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,480
Thank you for meeting me.

530
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,400
I'm willing to offer double
what you originally paid for the land.

531
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,440
What do you think?

532
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,920
You live up to your reputation.

533
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,280
You have no interest
in getting to know me at all.

534
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,120
You're all business,
no interest in people. Just profit.

535
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,680
Is there anything more interesting
between us than business?

536
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,960
You never know.

537
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,720
What exactly interests you
about me, Chairman Wang?

538
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,800
Being the eldest grandson
of the Hemaratsiri family…

539
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,200
Are you happy?

540
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,360
Yes.

541
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,440
Very happy.

542
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,240
It would be even better if
my grandfather's will hadn't been stolen.

543
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,000
- Mr. Yai!
- It's alright.

544
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,960
Chairman Wang already knows.

545
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,080
So, you really want to be
the head of H Group, huh?

546
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,040
I've dedicated my life to this company.

547
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,000
I built H Group into what it is today.

548
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,040
Don't you think
I deserve something in return?

549
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,000
I'll tell you what.

550
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,360
Without you,

551
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,280
H Group wouldn't survive.

552
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,960
Exactly.

553
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,280
Because there are enemies out there

554
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,360
waiting to take us down.

555
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,000
They want to cut off the head

556
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,560
to crush us and seize the opportunity
to expand their own empire.

557
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,480
Isn't that right?

558
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,560
Enemies in business?

559
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,320
In that case,

560
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,720
maybe I shouldn't sell my land

561
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,040
to a business enemy.

562
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,520
Do you really want to make
an enemy of H Group?

563
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,600
I need that land.

564
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,960
Can you help me?

565
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,400
I could.

566
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,200
But I need you to do something for me.

567
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,800
If I can, I'll do it.

568
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,120
Pramet.

569
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,840
The man you call father.

570
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,520
If he kneels and begs me,

571
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,480
I'll give you the land.

572
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,760
Does it really have to be that extreme?

573
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,880
Meena!

574
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,880
Your fiancée, I presume?

575
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,200
Pretty. Bold.

576
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,520
Let me ask you something.

577
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,080
Do you really think
you'll have a happy life

578
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,760
with Mekhin?

579
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,400
I'll take that as your answer.

580
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,000
Excuse me then.

581
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,040
Mr. Yai.

582
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,600
Chairman Wang, please reconsider.

583
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,480
- This land means a lot to Mr. Yai.
- Monmeena.

584
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,440
Or would you rather help
your fiancé another way?

585
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,440
What do you mean?

586
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,920
Become my son's fiancée instead.

587
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,080
What?

588
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,880
Actually, he should have known

589
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,200
that I am H Group's business enemy.

590
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,960
Yet, he still brings
his fiancée to meet me.

591
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,800
I'm really disappointed in you.

592
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,360
Dylan.

593
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,200
You're his son?

594
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,520
What? You didn't know?

595
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,840
This is Dylan Jongtraipattana,

596
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,640
vice president of JW Group

597
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,120
and my heir.

598
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,160
Mr. Yai.

599
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,120
Mr. Yai.

600
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,320
Meena.

601
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,200
Meena.

602
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,640
Mr. Dylan Zhong,

603
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,800
is there anything else
you need to tell me?

604
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,840
I know you must be angry,

605
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,720
but please hear me out first.

606
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,800
You've had plenty of time.

607
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,600
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?

608
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,000
That you didn't
really want to be my friend?

609
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,880
You just wanted to use me
to make Mr. Yai's life harder.

610
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,320
No, that's not true.

611
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,120
I barely even help
with my father's main business in Phuket.

612
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,840
It's my fault
I didn't tell you the details.

613
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,600
I never meant any harm.

614
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,120
It doesn't matter anymore.

615
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,000
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

616
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,240
Please, let me prove myself.

617
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,360
I genuinely wanted
to be your friend, Monmeena.

618
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,520
Mr. Dylan, I need time to think.

619
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,800
Now I don't know how to feel about you.

620
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,760
Mr. Yai.

621
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,080
Mr. Yai, wait for me.

622
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,960
Mr. Yai, wait!

623
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,560
Wait!

624
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,480
Come talk to me.

625
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,520
Mr. Yai?

626
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,160
I told you Dylan can't be trusted.

627
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,520
Did you even listen?

628
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,640
I thought he was just my friend,
nothing more.

629
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,840
Friend?

630
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,400
You brought a snake into your circle.
How can I not be mad?

631
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,320
He probably told his father about the deal
just to make things harder for me.

632
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,640
I'm just worried about you.

633
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,800
I don't want him using you any further.

634
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,120
Mr. Yai, if Dylan is Chairman Wang's son,

635
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,880
if I convince him,

636
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,480
he might help persuade his father
to change his mind about selling the land.

637
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,040
Haven't you had enough?

638
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,040
Mr. Yai.

639
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,880
I don't know if Dylan ever lied to me,

640
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,960
but deep down,
I don't think he's a bad person.

641
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,200
Maybe we can turn this situation
into an opportunity.

642
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,760
It's impossible, Monmeena.

643
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,560
If his father truly wanted to sell,

644
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,440
he wouldn't have made
such a humiliating offer.

645
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,240
As for you,

646
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,760
stay away from Dylan.

647
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,120
Wait here.

648
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,640
I'll have Max pick you up.
I have other business to take care of.

649
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,560
I still don't see the connection. Why does
Chairman Wang want our family's will?

650
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,040
Keep an eye on both Pramet
and Chairman Wang.

651
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,280
And Dylan too.

652
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,560
Oh.

653
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,960
Anything specific you want me
to watch Mr. Dylan for?

654
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,400
Everything.

655
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,320
Especially when it involves Ms. Monmeena?

656
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,680
Got it. I'll keep an extra-close eye
on Mr. Dylan and Ms. Monmeena.

657
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,280
I won't let anything slip.

658
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,400
That land belongs to that damn Wang Zhong?

659
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,120
Tell me.

660
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,400
How much of our family's money
have you given to him?

661
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,120
Even if I offered him a billion,
he wouldn't take it.

662
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,720
That damn snake!

663
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,840
He hid his ownership
and didn't reveal himself.

664
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,880
He must have waited to jack up the price!

665
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,880
He didn't even ask for a lot of money.

666
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,040
He just wants you…

667
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,560
to kneel at his feet
in exchange for the land.

668
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,840
How about that?

669
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,200
Over my dead body!

670
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,880
I'll never bow to that bastard!

671
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,160
Damn!

672
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,080
Stop right there.

673
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,080
Do you want people to know

674
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,040
that the acting president of H Group
can't control his emotions?

675
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,360
Do you expect me
to control my emotions now?

676
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,400
Will you let that old crook
stand in our way?

677
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,600
You're acting
like a dog that's been burned.

678
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,880
What did you do to him in the past?

679
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,200
What? What did I do?

680
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,840
It's none of your business.

681
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,080
Now that old Wang Zhong
is standing in our way,

682
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,440
your job is to get rid of him.

683
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,600
Just do what you used to do
when you were Grandfather's lapdog.

684
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,400
Just what you used to do.

685
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,840
I'm a person,

686
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,720
not anyone's lapdog.

687
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,800
And yet, you still hope to take
the chairman's position as the eldest son?

688
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,360
I'll tell you what.

689
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,080
If this project fails

690
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,360
and I have to leave H Group
because of your rotten past,

691
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,600
that chairman seat
you so desperately want…

692
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,280
I'll tear it down myself.

693
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,160
You bastard, Yai…

694
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,480
Here's your tea, sir.

695
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,520
Are you alright, sir?

696
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,280
I'm fine.

697
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,120
Mr. Mekhin is quite sharp, isn't he?

698
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,000
If he wasn't,

699
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,040
how could he have carried
such a rotten family on his back?

700
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,240
Move.

701
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,360
I hope you haven't made
any deals with my brother yet.

702
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,880
That depends on what you have to offer,

703
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,760
Mr. Parin Hemaratsiri.

704
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,880
I assure you,

705
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,920
my offer will be far more satisfying.

706
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,120
You could at least knock.

707
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,720
You said you were planning to sell
the land to H Group.

708
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,960
I changed my mind.

709
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,920
I want to see what they're willing to do

710
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,160
to get that land.

711
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,800
What exactly are you planning
to do to Hemaratsiri?

712
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,240
What I do is none of your concern.

713
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,240
Just focus on your part of the job.

714
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,240
And about that woman,

715
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,800
Mekhin's fiancée,

716
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,400
don't get too close to her.

717
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,920
It'll only complicate my plans further.

718
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,680
Do you understand?

719
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,240
Monmeena is my friend.

720
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,360
What I do is my business.

721
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,040
Handle your affairs, and stay out of mine.

722
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,200
Dylan.

723
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,560
Dylan!

724
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,640
Sir, you should really see a doctor.
You need proper medical attention.

725
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,800
No.

726
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,920
I refuse to die just yet.

727
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,080
Mr. Yai.

728
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,640
How's H Club? Is the renovation finished?

729
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,440
You waited just to ask me that?

730
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,800
Yes, it's done. We're reopening tomorrow.

731
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,720
Are you still mad at me
about earlier today?

732
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,520
I'm still mad.

733
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,560
But not as much.

734
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,160
I was just trying to help.

735
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,440
I didn't think you'd be mad.

736
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,720
You don't need to help me.

737
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,600
Just keep your distance from people
who clearly have ulterior motives.

738
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,440
Don't meddle with business matters.

739
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,080
I don't want to worry about you.

740
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,440
Fine. I'm sorry

741
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,840
for meddling with your business.

742
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,240
Just pretend I never said anything.

743
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,080
Tonight, we have a very special guest.

744
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,720
<i>Wang.</i>

745
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,920
Pramet.

746
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,080
You brat.

747
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,800
<i>I knew</i>
<i>you didn't just come here for dinner.</i>

748
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,240
What do you really want?

749
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,120
Someone in the Hemaratsiri family
is not normal.

750
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,200
There's a sadist here!

751
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,160
We might have a chance
to get your mother out.

752
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,360
What do I need to do?

753
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,280
<i>If you don't leave,</i>
<i>I'll break Nate's bones.</i>

754
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,160
Then I'll break yours in return.

755
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,120
You'd really harm your own father?

756
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,520
Have you ever acted like a father to me?

757
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,360
<i>This is Alisa.</i>

758
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,120
You should get to know her

759
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,840
because…

760
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,520
she's about to become Mekhin's fiancée.

761
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,520
I just hope people don't start calling
Monmeena a gold digger.

762
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,040
A gold digger is better than a parasite.

763
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,400
I just want him to see exactly
what kind of hell he's in

764
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,840
<i>if he keeps standing by Mekhin's side.</i>

765
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,840
