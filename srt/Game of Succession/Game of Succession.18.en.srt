1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,440
And this won't end with
just being removed from the hospital.

2
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,840
You might've gotten away with it
if it weren't for the organ trafficking.

3
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,000
Met.

4
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,960
Or should I call the cops to drag you out?

5
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,200
Someone as rotten as you
will end up like me.

6
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,040
Father!

7
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,680
You killed my mother, didn't you?!

8
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,200
Monmeena was the reason your mother died.

9
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,880
<i>You didn't have to do this.</i>

10
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,920
<i>Would you let today</i>
<i>be the first day of our love?</i>

11
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,200
Get out, right now, before I lose
my patience and put a bullet in your head!

12
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,560
- Father!
- Go!

13
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,560
You betrayed me!

14
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,200
You broke our deal, then die!

15
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,960
- Meena!
- Mr. Yai!

16
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,720
All you care about now
is surviving, right?

17
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,240
Then, let Aunt Nuan take the fall.

18
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,880
Then, let's do it.

19
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,960
Where are you going, Mote? Talk to me!

20
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,720
Can we talk on our floor?

21
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,440
Why?

22
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,880
Are you afraid Pa and her son will
find out how broken our marriage is?

23
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,440
Did you think I didn't know

24
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,120
about you and Doctor Thiti?
I've always known!

25
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,640
But I thought that
maybe one day you'd come back to me.

26
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,360
I was so stupid to love you. To trust you.

27
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,160
How could you betray me like this?

28
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,560
How could you do this to me?! I've always
stood by your side! How could you?!

29
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,280
Can you calm down first?

30
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,760
Then we can talk.

31
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,240
You had the nerve to do this to me?

32
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,120
I can go even crazier.

33
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,920
Mote.

34
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,280
Let go!

35
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,240
Let go of me!

36
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,600
If I get hurt, you'll get hurt too!

37
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,440
And if I die, you're dying with me!

38
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,640
Help! Help me!

39
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,360
Let go of me! Let go!

40
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,840
Let go!

41
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,200
What?!

42
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,520
Stop! Let go, please!

43
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
That's enough! That's enough!

44
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,760
Please, let go! Please!

45
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,840
Oh.

46
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,960
Are you okay?

47
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,320
Damn it!

48
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,640
Call the doctor!
Do you want me to bleed out?!

49
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Yes! Right away!

50
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,920
You called for me?

51
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,840
What are you thinking?

52
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,480
Why are you working with Pramet?

53
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,520
Are you going to forgive him?

54
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,120
I'm destroying the Hemaratsiri family,
just like you wanted.

55
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,920
I'm waiting for you to prove

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,880
you can do what you said you would.

57
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,560
I support you in every way.
I even fell out with Dylan over it.

58
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,840
I hope you're not throwing it all away
over one woman.

59
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,240
What are you going to do?

60
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,320
About what?

61
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,440
Monmeena.

62
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,440
Now you've got everything you need

63
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,480
to destroy the Hemaratsiris.

64
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,600
So, what are you waiting for?

65
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,920
SHOCKING NEWS IN REAL ESTATE

TUNE IN AT 11:00 A.M.

68
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,280
ON THE QUALITY
THAILAND'S NO.1 BUSINESS NEWS PAGE

69
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,120
Mr. Yai, what are you about to do?

70
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,800
This way, Mr. Mark.

71
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,640
Mr. Mark. Mr. Mark.

72
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,960
Mr. Mark.

73
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,960
Mr. Mark. Mr. Mark.

74
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,560
Please leave for now.

75
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,720
Inthon, what is Mr. Yai planning to do?

76
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,080
Please leave.

77
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,760
But I want to know.

78
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,320
Something is going on, right, Inthon?

79
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,040
Right? What is Mr. Yai doing?

80
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,200
You'll find out soon, Ms. Meena.

81
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,040
Is it about him and Dylan?

82
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,880
I'll get you inside.

83
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,920
You don't have a problem
with my guest, do you?

84
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,720
Please.

85
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,320
Mr. Mark.

86
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,840
Can we talk for a second?

87
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,840
Mr. Mark.

88
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,040
Mr. Mark.

89
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,160
What deal did you make with Dylan?

90
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,840
Huh, Mr. Mark?

91
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,960
Let go, Meena. It's time.

92
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,720
Hey.

93
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,760
Whatever you're about to do,

94
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,120
don't do it
if it's not what you really want.

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,960
Don't do something you'll regret, okay?

96
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,160
Wait here if you want to talk.

97
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,760
Thank you so much, Mr. Mark,

98
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,120
for giving <i>The Quality</i>
the honor of hosting

99
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,800
this exclusive interview.

100
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,400
Let's start with the question
everyone's waiting to know.

101
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,960
Mark or Mekhin? Who exactly are you?

102
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,480
Mark Jongtraipattana
and Mekhin Hemaratsiri…

103
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,960
are both me.

104
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,200
I'm not Mr. Pramet's son.

105
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,800
I don't have Hemaratsiri blood,
and I'm not connected to their family.

106
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,360
I'm the biological son
of Chairman Wang Jongtraipattana.

107
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,040
Aside from that,

108
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,920
is there anything else you'd like to say?

109
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,400
Chairman Preeda Hemaratsiri, who was
believed to have died of a heart attack,

110
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,040
was actually murdered in his own home.

111
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,360
And I was framed for the crime,
which I did not commit.

112
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,400
What is he trying to do?

113
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,440
Can they even show these photos?

114
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,800
What the hell is he doing?

115
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,480
Why would he show Dad's picture like that?

116
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,840
When is he going to stop
causing problems for me?

117
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,320
Chairman Preeda isn't the first person
who died in that house.

118
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,960
There was Ms. Mei,
the eldest in-law of the family,

119
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,200
who founded the Honest Heart Foundation.

120
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
She also died there.

121
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,440
They said she fell down the stairs,

122
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,080
but the autopsy revealed
she died from suffocation.

123
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,800
Two people died in that house,

124
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,000
and both deaths were covered up.

125
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,560
Isn't that suspicious?

126
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,400
What are you trying to say?

127
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm just saying

128
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,040
the truth behind the Hemaratsiri family

129
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,880
is more complicated than anyone thinks.

130
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,960
Just like the murder of Poot,
my former employee.

131
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,160
I was framed as the killer.

132
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,720
Are you saying you know who did it?

133
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,480
I can't confirm it,

134
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,960
but I can say this for sure.

135
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,520
It was one of the Hemaratsiris.

136
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,880
Mr. Pramet?

137
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,800
It wasn't him. He couldn't kill anyone.

138
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,920
But he's a fugitive,

139
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,240
on the run for double murder.

140
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,280
The news about Mr. Pramet
killing his wife is false.

141
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,840
Right now, Ms. Nate, his wife,

142
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,120
and her ex-husband, Mr. Ou,
are both alive and living in Chiang Rai.

143
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,920
How could he expose
your mother's secret like this?

144
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,440
The reports of their deaths were lies.

145
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,040
Mr. Pramet is innocent. He was framed.

146
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,400
And this is proof
of everything I've just said.

147
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,280
Dad. Mom.

148
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,920
What is Mr. Yai thinking?

149
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,680
Mark must have made
some kind of deal with Pramet.

150
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,480
There's one more thing
I want to talk about.

151
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,280
<i>It's the biggest headline</i>
<i>in society right now.</i>

152
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,400
<i>The VIP queue scandal at Heaven Hospital.</i>

153
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
<i>You're probably wondering</i>

154
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,080
<i>if the leaked list</i>
<i>of privileged patients is real.</i>

155
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,120
<i>Today, I have the real list to prove it.</i>

156
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,400
What do you want from me?

157
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,480
What else do you want from me, Yai?!

158
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,040
The document you're looking at

159
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,160
details the actual cases of queue-jumping
in heart transplants.

160
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,440
These might be among the earliest cases.

161
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,280
This document clearly shows
the names of several individuals.

162
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,120
I'm afraid we can't air this.

163
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,400
Someone listed here is in the room.

164
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,760
One of the people who was prioritized
for a heart transplant 13 years ago…

165
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,720
was Monmeena.

166
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,920
She's right there.

167
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,160
And she can confirm

168
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,200
that she was the one
who received the transplant.

169
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,640
You're bold, aren't you?

170
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,920
I won't miss next time.

171
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
I didn't break my promise.

172
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,840
Because this isn't over yet.

173
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,920
What are you talking about?!

174
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,360
Just wait.

175
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,480
I'll end this soon enough.

176
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,320
And when that day comes,

177
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,680
take care of Monmeena.

178
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,680
I'm saying all this
because I want justice in our society.

179
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,200
Everyone in this family is cruel,

180
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,800
more power-hungry
and greedy than you could imagine.

181
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,520
It's time the world knew the truth.

182
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,800
How could he reveal all this about you?
What an asshole.

183
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,840
Meena!

184
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,640
Get me out of here.

185
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,880
Right.

186
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,440
If you want to cry,

187
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,520
just let it all out.

188
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,240
Do you want to go check on Ms. Monmeena?

189
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,520
Get out.

190
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,600
- But Mr. Yai--
- Get out!

191
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,960
All this time, he never loved me?

192
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,440
Was I the only one
who thought it was real?

193
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,040
I'm sorry.

194
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,440
Just give me one day.

195
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,520
I won't be like this tomorrow.

196
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,440
From now on,

197
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,080
would you let me take care of you?

198
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,440
The key…

199
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,000
Where did it go?!

200
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,920
Was it you, Nuan?

201
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,360
Did you take my money?!

202
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,600
Did I?

203
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,920
I don't know.

204
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,840
But if you really want to know whether
I took all your money and everything else,

205
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,720
then come find me.

206
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,800
I'm in your dad's room.

207
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,160
Why isn't Yai dead yet?

208
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,160
How long is he going to live
and keep ruining our family?

209
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,720
Him going on air like that

210
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,200
is basically accusing us
of covering up murders in our own family.

211
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,640
Damn it!
Our whole business is going to collapse.

212
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,440
Just wait.
I'll sue him into the ground. Parin.

213
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,320
You need to explain all of this
to the board and shareholders

214
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,760
before more rumors cause even more damage.

215
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,040
Let's go.

216
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,640
You filthy bitch!

217
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,160
What the hell?

218
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,520
Why haven't the police caught you yet?

219
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,000
What a pain in the ass!

220
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,840
Oh, uh…

221
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,840
Please excuse me.

222
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,360
After everything you've done,
how dare you show your face here?

223
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,280
You're shameless. Arrogant.

224
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,520
This family fed you,

225
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,440
gave you a place to live for years.

226
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,320
And this is how you repay us?
You ungrateful dog!

227
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,400
Say that again.

228
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,400
Just wait.

229
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,880
You two are next.

230
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,760
Why is he here?

231
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,000
To see those two?

232
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
Where's my money?

233
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,120
Where's my money?!

234
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,320
Why don't we work together again?

235
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,640
What are you talking about?

236
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,600
You saw what happened

237
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,000
when we fought each other.

238
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,560
If we want to survive this,

239
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,080
we have to team up.

240
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,840
You're still hoping to survive?

241
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,640
Mote.

242
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,640
Calm down and listen.

243
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,960
Monmeena's heart transplant
wasn't our idea.

244
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,880
Don't you remember?

245
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,920
Met asked us to help, and we said no.

246
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,040
So, he went to Dad.

247
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,800
And Dad gave the order

248
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,480
that if Met paid us
to bump her up the queue,

249
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,840
we had to do it.

250
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,120
Dad helped Met

251
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,120
because he's the eldest son.

252
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,680
The firstborn
is more important than anything.

253
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,720
Unlike a half-man like you.

254
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,360
Monmeena's parents are still alive.

255
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,640
If we can find her mother

256
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,960
and make her join us

257
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,000
to testify that we were forced into it,

258
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,560
that it was all Dad and Met's doing,

259
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,800
we could survive this.

260
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,920
All the blame would fall on Met alone.

261
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,440
And how do I know

262
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,080
you won't stab me in the back again?

263
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,000
You want to survive.

264
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,960
So do I.

265
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,200
If we don't trust each other,

266
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,640
who else can we trust?

267
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,280
Right?

268
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,960
Do you think I'm stupid enough
to fall for that again, Mote?

269
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,880
You betrayed me and made a deal with Yai.

270
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,440
You tried to walk away from this alone.
How could you do that to me, Mote?!

271
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,880
After everything I did for you!

272
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,040
You did all of it for yourself!

273
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,960
You're just another doctor,

274
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,600
desperate

275
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,040
to own your own hospital.

276
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,640
Everything you've done

277
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,960
was for yourself. Only for yourself!

278
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,680
You fool.

279
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,240
You idiot.

280
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,520
Don't speak about things
you don't understand.

281
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,040
Do you know

282
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,080
what someone like me

283
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,440
did to your dad?

284
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,720
What do you mean?

285
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,680
What do I mean?

286
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,040
Do you know…

287
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,160
what happened in this room

288
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,720
the night your dad died?

289
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,920
Mr. Pornchai?

290
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,360
I'll see you out.

291
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,600
Thank you.

292
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,320
But you said
the last case would be the final one.

293
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,560
I'm giving you an order. It's your duty.

294
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,120
I don't want to do it anymore.

295
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,040
It's too risky.

296
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,360
If anyone finds out, Mr. Mote and I,

297
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,400
and the hospital, will all be in trouble.

298
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,680
You have me to protect you.

299
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,600
What are you afraid of?

300
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,080
Are you planning to make
Mr. Mote the next chairman?

301
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,680
Huh?

302
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,120
You called Mr. Pornchai to draft the will.

303
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,720
You're planning to give the position
to Mr. Mote, aren't you?

304
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,200
You promised me that if I helped you,

305
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,360
you'd make Mr. Mote chairman of H Group.

306
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,040
I want to see the will to confirm it.

307
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,120
This is none of your business!

308
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,600
But you said it yourself,
Met lacks leadership.

309
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,800
You said Mr. Mote
was more suited for the job.

310
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,240
I believed you.
I did everything you asked.

311
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,080
This is the time for you to prove

312
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,720
you weren't just using me.

313
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,800
Nuanchan!

314
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,440
You arrogant bitch.

315
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,560
Just do what I told you to do!

316
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,720
If you're planning to have
Mr. Mote inherit H Group,

317
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,160
you could've just said so.

318
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,600
We're the only ones in the room.
Why get so mad?

319
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,080
I'll accept your VVIP case,

320
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,560
only if Mr. Mote
becomes the new chairman of H Group.

321
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,960
Mote can't be the chairman.

322
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,800
Why not?

323
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,720
Why can't he?

324
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,520
He's not fit for the role!

325
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,800
How is he not fit?

326
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,240
Your husband has a flaw.

327
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,280
Can't you see it?

328
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,040
What flaw? Just say it.

329
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,200
He doesn't want to be with women.

330
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,160
You sleep in the same bed every night.
How can you not see who he really is?

331
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,040
I don't see
how his preference for men is a problem.

332
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,320
- Nuan.
- If it is, then it's my problem.

333
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,040
Not yours.

334
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,600
And it has nothing to do with work.

335
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,880
Mr. Mote is fit to be
the next chairman of H Group.

336
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,800
He can't be chairman.

337
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,040
But you gave me your word.
You have to follow through.

338
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,880
If you're not backing down, neither am I.

339
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,320
If not,

340
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,640
I'll expose

341
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,200
every VVIP case myself!

342
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,240
Nuan, are you threatening me?

343
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,640
You arrogant bitch!

344
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,280
I meant every word.

345
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,600
I won't let you use me anymore.

346
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,440
I'll destroy H Group with my own hands,

347
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,960
using these VVIP cases!

348
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,440
Don't think I'm afraid.

349
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,000
Then try me.

350
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,280
Let's see who wins, you or me.

351
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,200
Who wins? If I don't win,

352
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,760
- neither do you!
- Let go!

353
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,360
- You must make Mr. Mote chairman.
- No!

354
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,120
Say it! Say you'll make him chairman!

355
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,560
No!

356
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Nuan. Nuan!

357
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,400
You…

358
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,720
Nuan…

359
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,760
Help… Help…

360
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,800
- Dad…
- Help…

361
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,680
Somebody help…

362
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,480
Say it.

363
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,440
Say you'll make Mr. Mote the chairman.

364
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,240
Say it.

365
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,840
I… I won't…

366
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,480
I won't… I won't.

367
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,200
I did all of that for you.

368
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,440
And now you say I did it all for myself?!

369
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,960
Nuan! You killed my dad!

370
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,160
You half-man! You shitty husband!

371
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,680
You asshole! You bastard!

372
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,600
Do you really think someone like you

373
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,480
could've gotten here without my help?!

374
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,080
And this is how you repay me,
betraying me, Mote?!

375
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,520
So, it was you who killed Grandpa
and blamed it on me.

376
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,719
Yai.

377
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,280
You killed your own father-in-law?
What a terrible human being.

378
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,320
Terrible husband and wife.
One is an ungrateful bastard,

379
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,199
and the other is a vile in-law.

380
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,080
You acted like saints,
pretending to be humble.

381
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:54,440
But now it's clear,
you're greedier than anyone else.

382
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,480
For a lowlife,
no matter how high they rise,

383
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,800
their true nature always shows.

384
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,160
You think you're above me?

385
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,520
You're no different from me.

386
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,400
You're just using your son

387
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,640
to climb to the top.

388
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,040
But look at your son.

389
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,400
He's just… pathetic.

390
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,080
Nuan! What is your problem?!

391
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,040
Stop it!

392
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,920
You're a murderer.
You're not getting away with it.

393
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,120
I didn't mean to. It was an accident.

394
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,520
You didn't mean to,
but you covered it all up so neatly.

395
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,840
Tell it to the police.

396
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,160
Stop right there.

397
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,440
You killed Grandpa.

398
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,560
You sent someone
to kill Poot and framed me.

399
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,920
Did you kill my mother too?

400
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,840
You both know
what happened to her, don't you?

401
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,000
What did you do to my mother?!

402
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,280
- I don't know.
- Liar!

403
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,560
Tell me.

404
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,520
Tell me!

405
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,960
Mote, help me. Mote…

406
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,120
Mote, help me…

407
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,240
Mote… Mote!

408
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,520
Let go!

409
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,920
How long are you going to keep me here?
When will you let me go?

410
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,920
Let go of me!

411
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,680
This is your last chance.

412
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,880
How did my mother die?

413
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,000
- I don't--
- Don't you dare say you don't know!

414
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,320
If I tell you the truth,

415
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,160
you have to help me avoid going to prison.

416
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,560
It depends on what your answer is.

417
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,480
That night,

418
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,000
Mei came to ask us
about the heart transplants.

419
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,000
The children in the foundation
are my responsibility.

420
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,160
I have Korn's lab results,
from the start until now.

421
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
And I have video footage showing

422
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,760
that Korn was perfectly healthy
before surgery.

423
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,440
And I heard…

424
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,640
you told the nurses
to prep another patient

425
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,800
for surgery the night before,

426
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,240
even before Korn's condition worsened
and he was deemed ineligible.

427
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,520
Does Heaven Hospital accept VIP cases?

428
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,560
Fine. If you won't tell me now,

429
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,080
then tell it to the ministry.

430
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,880
What's going on?

431
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,840
Dad, I need to tell you something
about the hospital.

432
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,080
Stop it, Mei.

433
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,760
I think the hospital's been
accepting VIP patients.

434
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,520
The kids in my foundation
were on the transplant list,

435
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,720
but kids from the hospital
got the hearts instead.

436
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,600
What kind of coincidence is that?

437
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,080
Your accusation
is damaging our reputation.

438
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,080
I've told you everything.

439
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,240
If you think I'm accusing you,
then go ahead and sue me.

440
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,520
You're so full of yourself.
Who do you think you are?

441
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,640
Pramote.

442
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,240
Let me handle this. Okay, Mei?

443
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,160
Thank you, Dad.

444
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,960
This is serious. We need to be careful.

445
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,880
Mei, bring all the evidence you have

446
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,080
to me.

447
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,680
Bring everything to me.

448
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,080
Don't make any copies.

449
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,680
For this matter, we can't let outsiders

450
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,600
know about our internal problems.

451
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,080
Why?

452
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,640
Just do as Dad says.

453
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,760
Can you promise me

454
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,120
that someone will be held accountable?
This won't just disappear?

455
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,240
Why do you need him to promise?

456
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,680
How else can I be sure
the evidence won't get destroyed?

457
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,640
How dare you accuse Dad?

458
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,720
How could you accuse him?!

459
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,920
How could you say that to him?!

460
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
- Go bring the evidence!
- Let go of me!

461
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,200
Mote!

462
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,080
Mote!

463
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,040
- Stop!
- Bring the evidence!

464
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,160
- I said stop!
- Come here!

465
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,800
- It hurts! I'll go to the police!
- Give me the evidence!

466
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,880
It was Mote?

467
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,760
Yes.

468
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,200
He pushed her down the stairs.

469
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,320
I've told you everything I know.

470
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,920
Now you have to help me.

471
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,440
There's no reason for me
to protect Mote anymore.

472
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,680
Mr. Yai.

473
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,120
We've located Mr. Pramote.

474
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,240
Once we have him,

475
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,560
we'll see

476
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,320
whose story holds up.

477
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,920
Whoever killed you…

478
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,440
I'll make them pay, Mom.

479
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,600
Meena!

480
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,240
Meena!

481
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,840
Calm down, Meena. I'm right here.

482
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,880
It's okay.

483
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,880
Meena. Meena, what happened?

484
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,640
Meena! What happened, Meena?
What happened?

485
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,440
What happened? Tell me what happened.

486
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,320
- Aunt Jai…
- Hmm? Yes, sweetie?

487
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,760
Aunt Jai…

488
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,800
Was that why

489
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,720
Mom had to be with Pramet?

490
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,360
To give me a new heart?

491
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,080
Was it, Aunt Jai? Is that right?

492
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,760
Meena, listen to me.

493
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,640
You were just a little girl.
It was a decision made by adults.

494
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,760
Don't blame yourself.
It wasn't your fault.

495
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,640
But I stole someone else's chance
to get a heart transplant, didn't I?

496
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,160
And how… How was that person…

497
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,760
How was that person
supposed to live, Aunt Jai?

498
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,560
How are they now, Aunt Jai?

499
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,760
No, no, Meena.

500
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,600
Don't blame yourself.
Don't blame yourself.

501
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,120
Don't blame yourself.
It wasn't your fault.

502
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,600
Listen to me, Meena.

503
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,040
You can't go back and change the past.

504
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,080
But what you can do

505
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,400
is live a life that honors
the second chance you were given.

506
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,240
Alright? Live it well, Meena.

507
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,920
Alright?

508
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,920
Meena, you don't have to go
through this alone.

509
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,480
You'll always have me
and Mom by your side.

510
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,120
Come on.

511
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,720
Don't cry. Don't cry, Meena.

512
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,680
It's not your fault.

513
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,000
It's not your fault.

514
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,480
Don't cry anymore.

515
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,800
Come on, let's eat. Sit down.

516
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,000
Here, these are all your favorites.

517
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,360
You two didn't have to do all this.

518
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,000
But I was worried about you.

519
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,800
Wow.

520
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,240
I was sad, not paralyzed.

521
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,600
You were bawling your eyes out, and now
look at you, running your mouth again.

522
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,920
Hey, hey.

523
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,960
That's enough, both of you.

524
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,360
Why don't you warm these up, Ti?

525
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,080
Come on, let me help.

526
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,000
Sit down.

527
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,440
- Just sit down. Let him do it.
- Sit down.

528
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,480
Keep your strength for the spoon and fork.

529
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,280
Who's the real loudmouth here?

530
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,360
- I'm out.
- Go warm it up.

531
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,320
The spoon is in there.

532
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,480
Hello.

533
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,080
Hello.

534
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,560
Dylan?

535
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,920
I was calling, but no one
seemed to hear me. Sorry for barging in.

536
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,680
Maybe we just didn't want you here.

537
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,760
I came to see Meena.
Just wanted to check on her.

538
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,800
I'll never forget
that I'm still alive today

539
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,960
because of the people
who sacrificed for me.

540
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,760
Come on. I'll hold it for you.

541
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,960
Thank you.

542
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,280
Should we go inside? It's getting hot.

543
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,360
Or do you want to stay out here?
I'll grab an umbrella.

544
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,960
There's no need.

545
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,480
You don't have to worry about me so much.

546
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,760
No way.

547
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,160
Your brother's super strict. He almost
didn't let you come here with me.

548
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,720
Nonsense.
Ti is just an overprotective brother.

549
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,600
He's not overprotective.

550
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,240
Everyone just wants to protect
the ones they love.

551
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,560
You should care about
the people who care about you.

552
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,720
Don't waste your thoughts
on those who don't.

553
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,640
- This is yours.
- Thank you.

554
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,400
PAITHONG ICE CREAM

555
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,200
Oh, stop. My treat.

556
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,760
To make up for taking a day off

557
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,600
and bringing me out to make merit.

558
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,520
Here.

559
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,520
Keep the change.

560
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,960
Thank you.

561
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,960
Then I should take a day off every day.

562
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,800
What? Stop joking around.

563
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,320
You'll get fired.

564
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,360
I don't have the money
to cover your living expenses.

565
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,720
I like your smile.

566
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,280
And I want to see you
happy like this forever.

567
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,320
What is this? Why are you buttering me up?

568
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,360
I'm still waiting for your answer.

569
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,400
Not rushing you, just want to make sure
you haven't forgotten the question.

570
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,520
For you, I can wait however long it takes.

571
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,840
Thank you.

572
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,200
- It's okay. Still edible.
- No!

573
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,320
- Don't eat it! No!
- Whoops!

574
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,200
- You--
- What a waste.

575
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,400
You're a JW executive.
You can't eat like that.

576
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,560
It's all messy now.
Give me a napkin. I'll wipe it for you.

577
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,720
You bought it for me.
I don't want to waste it.

578
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,720
I can buy you ten more scoops right now.

579
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,560
You know, having someone you love

580
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,040
and who loves you waiting at home

581
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,760
is the best thing in the world.

582
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,520
Couldn't agree more.

583
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,240
I can't imagine

584
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,520
how people get through tough times

585
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,640
with no one

586
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,960
beside them.

587
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,040
I feel bad for them.

588
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,560
Let's eat the mango sticky rice.

589
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,520
Yeah. Let's eat.

590
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,880
- Can you feed me?
- I'll feed you.

591
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,120
- Okay.
- Yeah, feed her.

592
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,040
Open wide.

593
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,280
- How is it?
- So sweet!

594
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,400
It's delicious, isn't it?

595
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,560
So rich.

596
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,240
Mr. Yai?!

597
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,320
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

598
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,960
Mr. Yai!

599
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,480
- Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!
- What happened, Meena?

600
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,800
- Meena!
- Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

601
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,440
Meena! What happened, Meena?! Ti!

602
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,480
Meena! Wait for me, Meena!

603
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,640
- Wait! What happened?! Who was it?!
- Mr. Yai!

604
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,560
Mr. Yai!

605
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,640
- Meena!
- It's Mr. Yai!

606
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,000
Mr. Yai?

607
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,400
- Where?
- I don't see Mr. Yai, Meena.

608
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,880
- Yeah, he's not here.
- It was him!

609
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,080
I saw him! He was really here!

610
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,720
Wait. Hold on, Meena.

611
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,640
Calm down. Why would Mr. Yai be here?

612
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,720
Ti, take her inside.

613
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,120
- Go. You're seeing things.
- Let's go.

614
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,600
- Get inside.
- Go.

615
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,880
The glasses. Mr. Yai's glasses.

616
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,680
The glasses.

617
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,680
Mr. Yai's glasses…

618
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,080
I'll go see him.

619
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,280
- Hey, Meena! Meena!
- Meena! Calm down.

620
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,360
- Ti, help me!
- Mr. Yai!

621
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,560
Don't go!

622
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,200
- Meena! Meena!
- Oh my God.

623
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,840
- Meena!
- Meena!

624
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,520
You can't go in, sir!

625
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,080
Why the hell are you stopping me?!
Shoot me then!

626
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,520
I'm going in!

627
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,960
How long

628
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,000
have you known Yai was your son?

629
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,560
You knew all this time and didn't tell me?

630
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,200
What the hell do you want, Wang?

631
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,360
You wanted to destroy
the Hemaratsiri family

632
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,920
because I once betrayed you?

633
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,080
That was a long time ago.
Haven't you let it go?

634
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,080
You think I'd forget what you did to me?

635
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,880
Never.

636
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,000
And I'll make sure you remember it
until the day you die,

637
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,840
every last thing you did to me.

638
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,080
What are you going to do?

639
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,840
H Group,

640
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,880
and everything that
belongs to the Hemaratsiris,

641
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,720
will be mine. All mine.

642
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,760
Wang, you asshole.

643
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,760
I helped you dodge all your charges,

644
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,840
and this is how you repay me?

645
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,360
You son of a bitch.

646
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,280
You helped me?

647
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,120
I was the one who helped you! Without me,

648
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,120
how would Yai have beaten Mote and Nuan?

649
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,000
And without me,

650
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,640
there wouldn't even be solid evidence
like the VVIP transplant list.

651
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,600
And I raised your son
just so you could use him like this.

652
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,520
You should be thanking me, Wang!

653
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,920
You…

654
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,760
You're as selfish as ever.

655
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,360
I should've killed you
when I had the chance!

656
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,920
Kill me? In that condition?

657
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,320
Can you even make it to tomorrow?

658
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,080
This is probably
the last time I'll ever see you.

659
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,120
So, I'll say goodbye now.

660
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,320
Rest in peace.

661
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,960
I'll burn the offerings for you, alright?

662
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,600
Hey!

663
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,760
Still kicking, are you?

664
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,040
Son of a bitch.

665
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,400
Met!

666
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,600
Meena was hospitalized?

667
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,800
Yes. She collapsed
in front of her house last night.

668
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,680
I need you to do something.

669
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,360
Don't worry about Meena.

670
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,040
Dylan is taking care of her.

671
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,880
Do you need anything else?

672
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,680
I'm good now. Thank you.

673
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,920
What? Why are you wearing…

674
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,920
Oh.

675
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,600
I was already in my pajamas.
I rushed over when I heard about you.

676
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,760
How are you feeling, Meena?

677
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,280
Much better.

678
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,120
But the doctor still won't let me go home.

679
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,200
Don't celebrate just yet.

680
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,440
Wait until the IV finishes,
so you'll have more energy.

681
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,600
Got it, Doctor.

682
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,880
Meena, I've been thinking…

683
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,800
You should go live
with your parents in Chiang Rai.

684
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,440
Stay with them for a while.

685
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,840
Change your environment, your lifestyle.

686
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,840
It might help you feel better.

687
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,880
I think it's a good idea.

688
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,080
It's better for your health too.

689
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,000
If you want, I can take you there.

690
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,640
I'll take time off work.

691
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,160
What do you think?

692
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,000
You should go, Meena.
You'll get to be with your parents too.

693
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,280
I've been thinking about it too.

694
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,160
I want to be with Mom.

695
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,280
But there's something I need to do first.

696
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,720
What is it? Do you need my help?

697
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,480
I think Ti should help me with this.

698
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,800
Go home, Inthon. It's late.

699
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,040
I said, go home without me.

700
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,760
Are you feeling better now?

701
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,400
Did you know I was hospitalized?

702
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,920
You seem to know a lot about me.

703
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,080
What do you want from me?

704
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,040
I want to know

705
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,240
why you told the press
I was one of the VIP patients at H Group

706
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,720
and why you told Pramet
my mom's still alive.

707
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,080
Why did you do that?

708
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,680
I only have one goal.

709
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,960
To burn the Hemaratsiris to the ground.

710
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,160
So, I'm just your pawn.

711
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,680
Meena.

712
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,040
You were my pawn from the start.

713
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,120
If not, why else would I ask you
to pretend to be my fiancée?

714
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,000
So, nothing?

715
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,640
Nothing between us was ever real?

716
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,360
Don't get too caught up in it, Meena.

717
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,800
Mr. Yai.

718
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,880
If this is all part of your plan,

719
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,160
just say so.

720
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,800
I'm ready to help you.
Just let me be by your side.

721
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,160
You're really committed to the role.

722
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,760
You were part of my plan, but not anymore.

723
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,480
When you're no longer useful,
I just don't want you anymore.

724
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,720
All I want now is the top spot and power.

725
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,960
You're no different from the Hemaratsiris.
You're selfish.

726
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,320
Exactly.

727
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,080
That's who I am.

728
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,600
So, when are you getting out of my life?

729
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,280
Or is there still some part of me
you just can't let go of?

730
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,480
You're disgusting.

731
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,000
Wang.

732
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,200
What are you doing here?

733
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,400
For an inspection

734
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,600
as one of H Group's shareholders.

735
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,120
I'll get more shares,

736
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,640
enough to make H Group mine alone.

737
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,920
Let Parin go, and tell me where Tri is.

738
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,960
<i>You can call me an ungrateful son,</i>

739
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,440
<i>but I won't let you use me</i>

740
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,560
<i>as an excuse</i>
<i>to keep doing these terrible things!</i>

741
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,720
Let's not see each other again, Mom.

742
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,080
His children

743
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,520
are willing to kill each other anytime,
just to get what they want.

744
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,680
Mote!

745
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,200
- Die!
- Watch out, Mr. Yai!

746
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,080
Meena!

747
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,880
If you can't make Meena happy,

748
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,760
then let her be with someone
who's ready to take care of her!

749
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,440
<i>You're three months pregnant.</i>

750
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,040
