00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,000
Good evening, Mr. Mekhin.

2
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,800
Let's dance.

3
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,600
Did you use the money I gave you?

4
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Was it enough? No? I'll transfer you more.

5
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,280
Okay? Ten thousand?

6
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,640
Mekhin?

7
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,960
I really want that land.

8
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,600
Sell it to me, will you?

9
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,240
What's wrong? I'm here to beg you.

10
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,280
SIGN: WISET

11
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,240
<i>You're the only one on my mind</i>

12
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,360
<i>No matter how much time flies</i>

13
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,680
<i>You taught me love</i>
<i>From the first day until now</i>

14
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,560
<i>Do you know I always miss you?</i>

15
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,800
<i>How it feels to be hurt by love?</i>

16
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,480
<i>I never forget that moment</i>

17
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,040
<i>Too sweet and bitter to handle</i>

18
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,360
<i>Is this what people call love?</i>

19
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,080
<i>I've met so many people</i>
<i>But your love still runs deep</i>

20
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,560
<i>No one can erase the memories I keep</i>

21
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,000
<i>You're still in my mind</i>

22
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,560
<i>You're still there</i>
<i>Like the first day you were by my side</i>

23
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,080
<i>I don't know why</i>

24
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,000
Watch out!

25
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,880
Hey! You!

26
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,160
You! Hey! Are you okay?!

27
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,600
Hey!

28
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,280
Female accident patient
in her fifties with tension hemothorax.

29
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,920
We've drained the air out.

30
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,480
- Nuan.
- Mote.

31
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,080
The patient is now
under the doctor's care.

32
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,520
- But she's a VVIP--
- Nuan.

33
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,480
I really need you today.

34
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,680
Heaven Age
is a mixed-use development project

35
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,520
that will make you realize
that Bangkok has passed its prime.

36
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,960
The new age is the age of Heaven,

37
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,000
the new city that will let you discover

38
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,240
that heaven is real,
and everyone can be in it.

39
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,520
In the Heaven Age project,
we have every kind of advanced facility.

40
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,080
Medical center.

41
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,200
Shopping mall. Entertainment complex.

42
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,160
Public park. School and university.

43
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,760
We cater to your every need.

44
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,600
Cut. That's a wrap. Well done.

45
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,880
Can you get that for me?

46
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,600
Thank you.

47
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,720
You did such a great job, Parin, my son.

48
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,440
You're the best. I'm so proud of you.

49
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,520
- Mom.
- What?

50
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,320
- There are people here.
- So?

51
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,160
It's not embarrassing.
A proud mom just hugged her son.

52
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,520
People will admire you even more.

53
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,080
Right?

54
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,720
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

55
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,200
See?

56
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,560
- Good boy.
- You flatter me all the time.

57
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,600
Well, my talented son
came up with a project this big.

58
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,160
It'd be strange if I didn't flatter him.

59
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,120
Among the Hemaratsiri children,

60
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,720
no one is as good as you.

61
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,320
Right, everyone?

62
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,040
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

63
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,040
You see? You're the best.

64
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,640
Mr. Met. Please wake up.

65
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,360
Mr. Met.

66
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,720
It's almost time for your meeting.

67
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,240
It's your big day.

68
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,840
You shouldn't be late, Mr. Met.

69
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,559
Please wake up.

70
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,520
Mr. Met! The water is spilled!

71
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,680
Then put it down.

72
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,520
Hey.

73
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,800
Hey. You need to get to the meeting.

74
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,960
Good morning, Ms. Apapat.

75
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
Is no one here yet, Aunt Bua?

76
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,800
Miss Triprapa has woken up.
She's in the chairman's room.

77
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,360
What a suck-up.

78
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,880
Your grandpa is retiring
as the chairman of H Group.

79
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,040
And today,

80
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,760
he'll choose the next chairman himself.

81
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,240
You know what you should do, right?

82
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,880
I'm ready for it.

83
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,720
But would Grandpa really choose me?
I'm not his eldest grandchild.

84
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,440
Who knows? There might be a surprise.

85
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,880
What do you mean?

86
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,040
Your public image is good, and the profit
you've made for the business is high.

87
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,360
People love you, and you're talented.

88
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,280
Your grandpa might surprise you

89
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,280
by making you the new chairman.
Nobody knows.

90
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,280
Good morning, Ms. Phat.

91
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,120
Am I too late?

92
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,680
You're a doctor.
We won't blame you for being late.

93
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,280
Thank you.

94
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,080
The chairman is here. Please head inside.

95
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,840
Thanks.

96
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,080
Have a seat.

97
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Is everyone here? Is Dad here?

98
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,000
Right on time.

99
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,840
Morning, Dad.

100
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,240
Have you…

101
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,720
decided who you want
to be the new chairman?

102
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,720
Didn't you call us here today because

103
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,080
investors are unsure
about H Group's current situation?

104
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,120
This might be the right time
for you to retire

105
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,360
and appoint someone as the new chairman

106
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,600
to restore trust
and lead our company forward.

107
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,760
You seem to be in a hurry, Mr. Met.

108
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,520
Do you have urgent business?

109
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,680
You're acting like you don't want to know.

110
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,880
I heard you hired a bunch of media outlets
to interview your son.

111
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,360
Why? Suddenly,

112
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,600
you're doing PR for your son?

113
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,720
Trying to turn dirt into a star?

114
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,200
Mr. Met, I didn't--

115
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,200
No matter how much you groom him,
he'll never be the chairman.

116
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,880
He'll only ever be the youngest grandson.

117
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,560
Enough.

118
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,640
Where's Yai?

119
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Pramet.

120
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,200
Where is Yai?

121
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
I don't know, Dad.

122
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,520
Why don't you know?

123
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,560
He's your son.

124
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,800
- I…
- How would he know?

125
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,040
Just because he's the eldest grandson,
you think he can do anything

126
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,200
and not take any responsibility?

127
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,240
With a chairman like that,
H Group is bound to go so, so far

128
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,880
- What the hell are you saying?
- It's the truth.

129
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,280
- Inthon.
- Inthon.

130
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,520
What happened? Where's Mr. yai?

131
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,560
Last night, Mr. Yai was shot.

132
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,360
What?

133
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,080
You've been shot.

134
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,840
I saved your life.
If I hadn't, you'd be dead.

135
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,160
Here. Water and painkillers.

136
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,320
Don't you remember?

137
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,800
Where are my men?

138
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,880
I don't know.

139
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,040
When you were shot,
everything turned to chaos.

140
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,440
Your men tried to go after the shooter
and disappeared.

141
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
‪Watch out!

142
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
Hey! Follow him!

143
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,320
<i>And you collapsed in front of me.</i>

144
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,880
<i>Then someone walked in</i>
<i>and tried to shoot you again,</i>

145
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,560
<i>but I saved you.</i>

146
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,440
You refused to go to the hospital,
and I didn't know where else to take you.

147
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,200
So, I brought you here.

148
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,960
Did you treat my wound?

149
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,280
My brother is a doctor.

150
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,680
I'll give him a painkiller
and anti-inflammatory meds.

151
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,000
He'll be fine after some rest.

152
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,240
Thank you, Ti.

153
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,800
You know who he is, don't you?

154
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,360
He's Mr. Yai, Mekhin Hemaratsiri,

155
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,280
the eldest grandson of H Group's chairman.

156
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,240
Why didn't you let me
take him to the hospital?

157
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,280
There was a shooting
at the club I was singing in.

158
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,160
If people find out I got him out of there,

159
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,080
don't you think
those shooters will come after me?

160
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,160
We should let him recover.
His men will come pick him up soon.

161
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,160
Why did you get involved
in the first place?

162
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,040
What were you thinking, Meena?

163
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,640
Wait.

164
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,120
Get some rest until you feel better.

165
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,400
- Move.
- Hey!

166
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,040
Well? So much for acting tough.

167
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,560
My phone.

168
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,040
‪Where's my phone?! I'll call my men!

169
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,480
Excuse me?

170
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,520
I saved your life
and got someone to treat your wound,

171
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,440
and now you're yelling at me?

172
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,320
Shouldn't you thank me first, Mr. Mekhin?

173
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,480
You know me?

174
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,560
Is there anyone on that street
who doesn't know you?

175
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,040
Then, what do you want?

176
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,440
First,

177
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,800
thank me.

178
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,000
Thank you.

179
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,720
I made you rice porridge. Hold on.

180
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,000
No. Just give me my phone. I'm not hungry!

181
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,160
Want me to feed you?

182
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,160
Your phone's charging.
Eat first, then I'll get it for you.

183
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,400
What do you really want?

184
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,720
You know me.

185
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,200
You wouldn't help me for free, would you?

186
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,440
Tell me what you want
and give me my phone.

187
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,560
Hey.

188
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,040
That hurts my feelings.

189
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,000
How much do you want?

190
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,880
Could you stop?

191
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,960
Okay.

192
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,520
If I could have anything in return,

193
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,280
what should I ask for?

194
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,360
If it's money, how much should I ask for?

195
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,960
One million?

196
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,000
Done.

197
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,280
Hey, wait.

198
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,320
I didn't confirm it.
I was just testing the waters.

199
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,000
Can you stop joking around?

200
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,760
You think your life
is only worth a million?

201
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,800
Isn't that too low?

202
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,040
Then, how much do you want?

203
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,280
Everything you have.

204
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,000
Cash, deposits,

205
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,640
house, land, gold, stocks,
funds, inheritance. Everything.

206
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,120
Isn't that too much?

207
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,880
If you can't give me that,
don't flaunt your wealth here.

208
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,080
Just eat.

209
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,760
And all I want is for you
to remember that you owe me.

210
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,560
Owe you?

211
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,280
Yeah. Who knows?

212
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,520
I might need a favor
from someone like you later.

213
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,240
If you're okay with that, just eat.

214
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,720
I'll get you your phone, okay?

215
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,480
Hello, Mr. Yai.

216
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,560
Mr. Yai!

217
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,320
Mr. Yai, wait a minute.

218
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,160
Are you just going to take off like that?

219
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,480
Don't forget. You owe me a life debt.

220
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,920
You'll have to repay me later.

221
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,800
I never go back on my word.

222
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,800
I'll talk to you later.

223
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
Please, Mr. Yai.

224
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,560
I'll be in touch, Mr. Yai!

225
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,920
Huh. Meena.

226
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,480
Wasn't that Mr. Mekhin Hemaratsiri?

227
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,280
Dismissed? But you haven't even announced

228
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,560
who the new chairman of H Group will be.

229
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,120
We don't even know if Yai is okay or not,

230
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,440
and all you care about
is who'll be the new chairman?

231
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,080
Huh, Pa?

232
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,040
I'm worried about our business.

233
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,720
We can't move forward

234
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
if we don't know who the next chairman is.

235
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,760
Investors have lost trust
because H Group's future

236
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,360
is uncertain.

237
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,400
Why? Because I'm not dead yet, huh?

238
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,040
‪Grandpa, please sit down.

239
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,680
Mom, that's enough.

240
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,000
Grandpa has already made his decision.

241
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,600
When Mr. Nont passed away,
you didn't even care this much.

242
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,600
That day, you wanted us to go on
with the meeting like nothing happened.

243
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,600
Why the hell do you have to bring Nont up?

244
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,720
Why? Mr. Nont was your son too.

245
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,920
Or was your youngest son
not as important as your eldest grandson?

246
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,800
Nont…

247
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,360
had been sick for months before he passed.

248
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,440
Everyone knew and accepted it.

249
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Yai was assassinated. It's different.

250
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,920
You don't love your children equally.

251
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,080
Pa.

252
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,320
You're just my youngest in-law.
Don't lecture me!

253
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,840
Yes! I'm just your youngest in-law! Yes!

254
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,680
Please stop. Grandpa isn't feeling well.

255
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,320
Please.

256
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,160
I'll excuse myself and get back to work.

257
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,960
I'll do more good than being here.

258
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,120
I'll get back to work, Dad.

259
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,400
Please excuse us.

260
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,000
Your family
fights among themselves every day.

261
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,640
Aren't they tired of it?

262
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,600
That's why
I don't bother staying for lunch.

263
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,360
Don't you want to be
the chairman of H Group too?

264
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,560
Why would I want something
they'll never give me?

265
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,120
It's a waste of time.

266
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,920
Ms. Nuanchan!

267
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,560
Ms. Nuanchan! You forgot your bag!

268
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,000
Thank you so much, Bua.

269
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,080
Yes.

270
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,000
You can do whatever you want.

271
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,480
But if the business runs into problems,

272
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,600
just don't blame it on Lek.

273
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,480
Why can't I blame him?

274
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,960
He's really incompetent.

275
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,880
What? Grandpa.

276
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,080
The profit reports already show

277
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,840
who in this house is capable
and who isn't.

278
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,240
Who are you talking about?

279
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,760
Among our family businesses,
both Heaven Home and the hospital

280
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,440
not only turn a profit

281
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,320
but also boost H Group's reputation.

282
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,840
But your "Lust Street" makes money
while dragging our name through the mud.

283
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,200
The family's reputation is ruined.

284
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,320
- Yeah?
- Mhm.

285
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,560
You don't know anything. Stop it!

286
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,520
Or is it not true?

287
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,360
Mr. Yai is here!

288
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,240
Chairman, Mr. Yai is back!

289
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,400
Hey, Yai. How are you?

290
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,160
He sold us the land.

291
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,160
What land?

292
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,360
The land you were too incompetent to get.

293
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,240
The land I needed
to build the Heaven Age empire.

294
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,560
You kept insisting
the owner wouldn't sell.

295
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,160
You said we'd have to build it elsewhere.

296
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,040
I told Yai to take care of it.

297
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Grandpa.

298
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,480
You sent Yai to do my job?

299
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,200
Yeah.

300
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,320
This isn't the first time
Yai has done this. In past projects,

301
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,880
Yai always got the job done for you.

302
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,800
If not, do you really think

303
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,600
your construction company
would always be this successful?

304
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,240
You can't get anything done on your own.

305
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,880
You need Yai to do everything for you.

306
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,520
You couldn't even handle this simple task,

307
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,400
and you think
you're fit to be the chairman? Idiot.

308
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,320
Grandpa, how could you do this?

309
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,720
This was my job.
You should've let me handle it!

310
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,440
Remember this, Lek.
Never give up so easily.

311
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,560
Do whatever it takes to get what you want.
Learn from Yai.

312
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,240
Learn to be like Yai. Got it?

313
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,200
Take notes if you need to.
Need a pen? I'll lend you one.

314
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,240
Do you know who did it?

315
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,400
No, Grandpa.

316
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,640
But I think they knew me well enough
to know exactly where I'd be.

317
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,480
But don't worry.

318
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,840
No matter who did this,

319
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,000
when it's my turn,

320
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,680
I won't show mercy to any of them.

321
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,200
<i>This isn't the first time</i>
<i>Yai has done this.</i>

322
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,240
<i>In past projects,</i>

323
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,680
<i>Yai always</i>

324
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,400
<i>got the job done for you.</i>

325
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,800
<i>If not, do you really think</i>

326
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,240
<i>your construction company</i>

327
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,120
<i>would always be this successful?</i>

328
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,720
<i>Remember this, Lek.</i>

329
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,760
<i>Never give up so easily.</i>

330
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,400
<i>Do whatever it takes to get what you want.</i>

331
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,160
<i>Learn from Yai.</i>

332
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,440
I'm not okay with this, Mom.

333
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,560
Why did Grandpa
have to involve Yai in my work?

334
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,400
Grandpa loves him

335
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,680
and wants him to be respected,
because he's making him the new chairman!

336
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,920
Parin, compose yourself.

337
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
You will be the chairman.

338
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,080
You won't lose to Yai.

339
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,000
I'll do whatever it takes to help you.

340
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,760
Even if I have to die,
or kill someone, I'll do it.

341
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,760
I won't show mercy to any of them.

342
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,480
Mr. Yai is so damn cool.

343
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,320
At that moment,
all I could do was look down.

344
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,040
I didn't dare look at anyone.

345
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,880
Just thinking about it
gives me goosebumps.

346
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,320
Hey, who do you guys think
wanted Mr. Yai dead?

347
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,400
Who stands to gain the most
from Mr. Yai's death, Aunt Bua?

348
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,440
- Mr. Lek!
- Mr. Lek!

349
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,280
Correct.

350
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,960
Mr. Lek wants to be chairman,

351
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,160
and Ms. Apapat
is doing everything to support him.

352
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,400
And yet Chairman Preeda
still favors Mr. Yai the most.

353
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,600
Well… aren't his own kids
good enough for the job?

354
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,280
Think before you speak.

355
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,440
Look at his children.

356
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,360
The youngest died, so I won't count him.

357
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,560
The middle child is a doctor.

358
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,600
He does nothing but work.

359
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,320
And the eldest son, Mr. Pramet?

360
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,960
Look at him.

361
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,400
He's a playboy who's always drunk.

362
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,080
He's a womanizer and everything. Do you
really think the chairman would trust him?

363
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,000
Out of everyone in this family,
Mr. Yai is the most qualified.

364
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,080
- True.
- True.

365
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,160
That means

366
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,160
if Mr. Yai becomes chairman,

367
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,000
we'd be the right-hand men
of the chairman, right?

368
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm the right-hand man.

369
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,800
You guys are the left-hand men.

370
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,760
So, you can clean his ass!

371
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,000
Wait, wait.

372
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,320
The left hand cleans his ass.
So, what does the right hand do?

373
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,600
Oh, yeah. What does the right hand do?

374
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,400
I can use it to slap you again.

375
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,720
Until that day comes,

376
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,640
I just hope
nothing happens to Mr. Yai again.

377
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,280
Meena. Why did Mr. Yai Hemaratsiri
come to our house?

378
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,800
It was nothing, Aunt Jai.

379
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,600
He got shot in front of me last night,

380
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,640
so I saved his life.

381
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,880
I didn't want to watch
someone die right in front of me.

382
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,440
I don't believe
you helped him for nothing.

383
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,040
You hate that family.

384
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,840
What are you planning, Meena?

385
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,560
Ti.

386
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,480
I rushed home as soon as my shift ended.
I was worried about you.

387
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,560
You're making me and Mom worry.

388
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,600
Meena.

389
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,160
People like us don't have the power
to negotiate with them.

390
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,960
Stay away from the Hemaratsiris,

391
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,840
and you'll be safe. Trust me, okay?

392
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,800
You need to trust me.

393
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,120
Stay away from the Hemaratsiris.

394
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,640
<i>Mr. Yai.</i>

395
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,640
<i>Your father is asking for you.</i>

396
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,000
<i>He said he wants to talk to you.</i>

397
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,560
Drink with me.

398
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,960
No.

399
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,760
What do you mean, no?

400
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,240
Will you die just
from having a drink with me?

401
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,960
- Mr. Met!
- Come on.

402
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,040
- No!
- Drink!

403
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,840
Are you not going to do as I say,
even once?!

404
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,720
Yai. Yai! Perfect timing.

405
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,880
Come and drink with me.

406
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,480
- I won't drink.
- Why not?

407
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,440
It's time to celebrate.

408
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,880
This is a special day.

409
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,400
Drink with your father.

410
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,560
What's so funny?

411
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,040
Go ahead and celebrate all you want.

412
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,800
This guy.

413
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
Just because you're Grandpa's favorite,

414
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,520
don't think you're guaranteed
to become H Group's chairman.

415
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,360
It's me. I'm his eldest son.

416
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,880
I can take that position anytime I want.

417
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,680
You should be grateful that
I'm not even trying to take it from you.

418
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,080
You've given everything
for Grandpa's company,

419
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,040
risked your life countless times,

420
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,280
because you're after
that position too, aren't you?

421
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,400
I get it. I know how you feel.

422
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,640
That's why I'm letting you have it, Yai.

423
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,320
All I ask is that
when you become chairman,

424
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,080
you appreciate my generosity.

425
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,240
If I ever need something,
can't you make it happen for me,

426
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,680
son? That's all I ask.

427
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,360
Remember this.
The moment H Group falls into my hands,

428
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,520
you

429
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,800
and your woman

430
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,440
won't get a damn thing.

431
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,920
If you don't work,

432
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,040
you shouldn't be a burden to others.

433
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,400
Yai!

434
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,159
Don't, Mr. Met!

435
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,840
Mind your own business!

436
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,440
Don't sacrifice anything for me

437
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,080
because Grandpa
would never make you chairman.

438
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,520
Yai…

439
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,159
If it weren't for me,

440
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:45,159
you would never become
the chairman of H Group, you fool!

441
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,200
‪Ghost!

442
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,160
Ghost! Oh, Mr. Yai.
You almost gave me a heart attack.

443
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,320
- Aunt Bua.
- Yes?

444
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,320
Could you cook something for me?

445
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,240
Of course. I'll do it.

446
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,560
This is Nate, my wife.

447
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,520
She's moving in.

448
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,080
- Wife?
- Yes, wife.

449
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,000
You're my wife.

450
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,600
And Nate is also my wife.

451
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,560
But the difference is,

452
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,360
I chose Nate myself.

453
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,840
I never chose you.

454
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,600
I don't care how many mistresses
you have outside this house,

455
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,800
but you're not bringing them in!

456
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,760
This is Mom's home! Get out!

457
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,400
- Did you just tell me to get out?
- Yai!

458
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,760
This house is mine!
I can do whatever I want!

459
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,840
If you don't want to be here, then leave!

460
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,360
Go!

461
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,680
It's okay, son.

462
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,920
And don't even think about
hanging that woman's picture in this room.

463
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,720
Hang it somewhere else.

464
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,760
Well?

465
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,720
Dear, it's fine.

466
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,480
I put up with that woman's presence
for over 20 years.

467
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,120
I don't want to see her face again.

468
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,240
Put it somewhere else.
Or I'll get rid of it!

469
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,360
Rice porridge, your favorite.

470
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,920
No matter how many times I make it,

471
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,280
it will never compare to the ones
Ms. Mei, your mother, used to make.

472
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,360
I will become the chairman.

473
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,600
No one can stop me.

474
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,600
What do you want to talk about
at this hour, Grandpa?

475
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,800
Take a seat.

476
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,280
How's your wound?

477
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,920
It's not serious.
I'll be perfectly fine in a few days.

478
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,360
You've been through worse, huh?

479
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,120
Yes.

480
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,720
I've always made you do risky jobs.

481
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,560
I hope you're not mad at me.

482
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,440
Not at all, Grandpa.

483
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,160
In fact, I'm glad you trust me.

484
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,240
Out of all my descendants,

485
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,480
you are the only one

486
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,720
I can trust with my work.

487
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,920
And you've never let me down.

488
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,400
Our H Group

489
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,440
is as successful as it is today

490
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,840
because of your contributions.

491
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,400
I did everything for you.
For the Hemaratsiri family.

492
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,560
You're skilled and sharp.

493
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,040
You've learned quickly
how to manage the system.

494
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,880
You know
how to handle people with precision.

495
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,080
You know when to defend
and when to go on the offensive.

496
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,560
Someone like you

497
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,120
is fit to be the next chairman.

498
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,760
Do you want to be the chairman?

499
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,200
I do.

500
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,280
If I get the position,

501
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,320
I'll do my best. I won't let you down.

502
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,920
Good.

503
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,640
I know you can do it.
And you can do it better than anyone.

504
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,320
Thank you for believing in me, Grandpa.

505
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,720
But I can't let you be the chairman.

506
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,280
You're skilled.

507
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,680
You meet all the qualifications.

508
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,760
The only thing you don't have

509
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,600
is Hemaratsiri blood.

510
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,240
The one who leads H Group
must be from the Hemaratsiri family only,

511
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,280
not an outsider like you.

512
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,240
Am I not your grandson?

513
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,200
Your mother was already pregnant

514
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,880
when she married Met.

515
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,440
That damn Chairman Song knew all along

516
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,480
that Mei, his daughter, wasn't pure.
And he tricked me,

517
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,920
made me trust him, and let Met marry Mei.

518
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,720
I only found out the truth
after the ceremony was over.

519
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,960
DOUBLE HAPPINESS

520
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,760
Is something wrong with you?

521
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,280
I didn't want to ruin
our family's reputation

522
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,160
any further
because of your mother's disgrace.

523
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,480
I kept this secret to myself.
I never told anyone.

524
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,720
Even Met doesn't know.

525
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,200
I could never leave such
an important position to a child of sin.

526
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,880
Hemaratsiri's fortune belongs
to the Hemaratsiris and no one else.

527
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,360
Tomorrow, I'll announce

528
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,080
that I've chosen Lek as the new chairman.

529
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,680
I've proved myself
to be a true Hemaratsiri all along.

530
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,800
I've been carrying out your orders
for over ten years.

531
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,320
Look at this!

532
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,440
I was willing to do anything, risk my life
for this family, time and time again.

533
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,560
Isn't this enough for you
to accept me as one of you?

534
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,800
You belong to this family,
but not by blood.

535
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,520
Blood?

536
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,520
Is your blood worth more than the man
who's risked his life for you?

537
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,760
Don't waste your time
hoping for the impossible.

538
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,880
Even after you die,
you still won't have my blood.

539
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,360
From now on,

540
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,120
you must serve Lek
just as you've been serving me.

541
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,400
Watch his back.

542
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,400
Do whatever it takes

543
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,640
to make Lek respected and admired

544
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,720
by everyone in H Group.

545
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,400
That's all I get to do?

546
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,360
If you can't do it,

547
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,760
then you have no place here anymore!

548
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,240
I've had to serve

549
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,840
and clean up after you all.

550
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,520
My hands got dirty
so yours could stay clean.

551
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,040
Mekhin!

552
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,520
You've only ever used me.

553
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,520
You've treated me like a dog,

554
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,920
a servant whose only purpose is to serve
the Hemaratsiris until the day I die.

555
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,320
‪Just because I'm not
‪your flesh and blood?!

556
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,480
Do you want to die now? Sparing you
and your mother's lives that day

557
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,600
was already a great mercy.

558
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,720
Excuse me.

559
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,640
I invited Mr. Pornchai here tonight

560
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,960
to draft my final will.

561
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,040
Parin will be the new chairman.

562
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,520
And you will get nothing.

563
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,280
Thank you so much.

564
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,680
Thank you!

565
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,160
Hey, what's the rush?

566
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,680
Stay and talk to me, Yai.

567
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,480
- Yai! You ungrateful brat!
- Mr. Met.

568
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,680
- I'll get you!
- That's enough, Mr. Met!

569
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,840
I'll get you, Yai!

570
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,320
Do you think I'm not worthy

571
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,880
of being chairman?!

572
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,640
- Mr. Met.
- Look at me! Come and look at me!

573
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,640
Yai!

574
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,720
Someone like you… I'll kick your ass.

575
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,640
Why did I even raise you?

576
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,560
Give me more to drink!

577
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,960
Pour me another!

578
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,320
I need a drink! Get me one!

579
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,360
Goddamn it.

580
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,040
DUANGJAI MANGO STICKY RICE

581
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,040
Hot, hot, hot.

582
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,520
I've prepared everything, Aunt Jai.
We're ready to open.

583
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,880
You worked late into the night

584
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,880
and woke up early
to help me with all this.

585
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,600
You must be exhausted.

586
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,080
I'm fine, really.

587
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,040
But if you're feeling generous,

588
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,680
can I have a day off?

589
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,000
Please?

590
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,480
Of course.

591
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,560
But if you're not going to the shop,
where are you headed?

592
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,800
I'm going to see Mom.

593
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,560
Hey. Is the chairman awake?

594
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,680
He hasn't come out yet.

595
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,040
Then I'll wake him up myself.

596
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,760
- Aunt Bua.
- Yes?

597
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,640
Is that Grandpa's soy milk?

598
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,760
Yes.

599
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:55,960
Let me.

600
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,520
Thank you, Miss Tri.

601
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,560
He always finishes it when his
favorite grandchild serves it to him.

602
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,680
You're being too kind.

603
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,760
Thank you.

604
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,720
Grandpa.

605
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,920
Grandpa?

606
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,200
I'm going in.

607
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,520
Grandpa?

608
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,120
What? He's still asleep?

609
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,600
Is he feeling unwell?

610
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,160
Grandpa.

611
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,640
Grandpa?

612
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,640
Grandpa! Grandpa!

613
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,800
Miss Triprapa, what happened?

614
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,360
Grandpa! Grandpa!

615
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,960
- Grandpa…
- Chairman!

616
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,760
Chairman!

617
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,920
- This is terrible!
- Grandpa!

618
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,440
Chairman! How did this happen?

619
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,680
Mr. Met! Mr. Met! Please wake up!

620
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,400
Mr. Met! Mr. Met!

621
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,360
Hey! What are you yelling about?!

622
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,760
The chairman is dead.
Someone murdered him.

623
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,200
Wake up, Mr. Met!

624
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,080
Mr. Yai! Something terrible has happened!

625
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,080
Someone murdered your Grandpa.

626
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,440
He's bleeding out in his bed upstairs.

627
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,040
Mr. Yai?

628
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,640
Mr. Yai?

629
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,320
Everyone! Everyone!

630
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,920
Open the main gate.

631
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,480
The ambulance will be here soon.

632
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,840
What happened, Ms. Nate?

633
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,080
- The chairman…
- What about him?

634
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,880
Don't ask questions right now.
Just hurry up and open the gate!

635
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,200
Mom…

636
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,880
BAAN SUKCHAI FOUNDATION

637
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,400
Please take care of Meena.

638
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,520
Don't worry.

639
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,840
I'll do my best to look after her.

640
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,640
Why do I have to go live with her?

641
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,000
This is what's best for your future.

642
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,640
From now on, I'll be your family, Meena.

643
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,680
Come live with me.

644
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,600
HEMARATSIRI HOUSE

645
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,360
Are you sure about this, Meena?

646
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,920
I'm sure.

647
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,240
I want to see my mom again.

648
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,520
Ms. Nate! Ms. Nate!

649
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,760
Ms. Nate!

650
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,640
I called the police
and requested an ambulance.

651
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,840
Okay. Let's get back inside.

652
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,760
Right.

653
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,400
- Open the gate.
- Yes. Let's go.

654
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,680
Hurry.

655
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,680
How is it?

656
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,560
The deceased was in his seventies.

657
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,120
Time of death is estimated
around 8 or 9 p.m.

658
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,600
Bring the body
to the forensic science office.

659
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,080
- Dad…
- Dad…

660
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,640
Dad…

661
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,520
Grandpa…

662
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,480
Dad…

663
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,240
Grandpa…

664
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,960
- Grandpa…
- Dad!

665
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,000
Grandpa…

666
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,480
Grandpa…

667
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,520
I can't believe something like this
happened in our own home.

668
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,440
This shouldn't have happened.

669
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,680
Whoever did this to Dad
is truly despicable.

670
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,720
Without Grandpa,

671
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,040
how are we supposed to go on, Mom?

672
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,520
He shouldn't have left us like this.

673
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,560
Officer, please, find the murderer
as soon as posible.

674
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,400
After examining the crime scene,

675
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,800
I'll need to question each of you
at the station.

676
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,520
Yes.

677
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,320
Everyone will probably think the murderer

678
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,600
is one of us in the family.

679
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,840
What's wrong with that?

680
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,560
Anyone in this room

681
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,160
could be the murderer.

682
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,720
<i>Wait for the rain to stop first.</i>
<i>Let's get inside.</i>

683
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,000
Are you inviting me inside?
I'd like you in the Hemaratsiri house

684
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,280
as my fiancée.

685
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,560
You can't just bring
some unknown woman into this house, Yai.

686
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,120
I'm just doing what my "father" did.

687
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,720
Monmeena. I'm your daughter.

688
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,160
<i>Who knows?</i>
<i>She might be keeping something from you.</i>

689
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,080
- Like what?
- Like having had a child.

690
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,320
His name is Ou. He's a gang leader
involved in morally questionable business.

691
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,240
Then we should lure Ou out
and take him down.

692
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,760
Will it be okay
if Miss Monmeena finds out about this?

693
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,680
<i>Everyone in this house is a hypocrite.</i>
<i>Everyone but me.</i>

694
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,800
Because if I were to kill someone,
no one would even know about it.

695
