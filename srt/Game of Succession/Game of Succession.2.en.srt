1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,880
If I ever need something,
can't you make it happen for me, son?

2
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,960
The moment H Group falls into my hands,

3
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,520
you won't get a thing.

4
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,880
Yai!

5
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,120
I could never leave such
an important position to a child of sin.

6
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,880
Tomorrow, I'll announce

7
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,040
that I've chosen Lek as the new chairman.

8
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,080
You've treated me like a dog,

9
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,280
a servant whose only purpose is to serve
the Hemaratsiris until the day I die,

10
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,120
just because
I'm not your flesh and blood?!

11
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,560
Grandpa!

12
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,480
<i>Mr. Yai! Something terrible has happened!</i>

13
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,120
Someone murdered your grandpa.

14
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,520
Whoever did this to Dad

15
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,960
is truly despicable.

16
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,080
<i>I'll need to question each of you</i>
<i>at the station.</i>

17
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,120
According
to the preliminary autopsy results,

18
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,240
the chairman
likely passed away last night.

19
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,360
May I ask, where were
you last night, Mr. Pramet?

20
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,840
I was at the penthouse.

21
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,920
My private floor.

22
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,440
Is there anyone who can verify that?

23
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,600
Last night, I was with Mr. Pramet.

24
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,000
Are you Mr. Pramet's wife, Ms. Nate?

25
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,920
Based on my intel,

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,960
Mr. Pramet hasn't registered
a new marriage certificate.

27
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,440
I'm only his mistress.

28
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,360
I'm not part of this family.

29
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,320
How was your relationship
with the chairman?

30
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,440
Met.

31
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,640
Who said you could bring
your illegitimate wife to this table?

32
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,840
- Dad.
- Get out.

33
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,360
- Dad.
- Get out!

34
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,120
<i>I didn't get to see him often.</i>

35
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,160
Most of the time, whenever Mr. Met
had to discuss business with the chairman,

36
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,520
he would go alone.

37
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,960
As the eldest son,
were you close with Chairman Preeda?

38
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,560
Do you think every son
has to be close to his father?

39
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,080
You have to marry Mei, no matter what.

40
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,880
I won't do it.

41
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,720
I've done everything
you've ever asked of me.

42
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
Can I have just this one thing?

43
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,720
I only want what's best for you.

44
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,760
Why do you have to be so stubborn?
You fool!

45
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,560
- You foolish son!
- Dad!

46
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,040
- You foolish son!
- Yeah!

47
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm a fool!

48
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,240
No matter what I do,
it'll never be good enough for you.

49
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,600
Someone like him

50
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,000
wasn't particularly close
to any of his children.

51
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,960
Dad had a quick temper. He got mad easily.

52
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,400
No one could ever impress him.

53
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,360
You're incompetent!

54
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,520
You couldn't even handle
a simple task properly!

55
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,280
Don't ever expect
to rise to a higher position.

56
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,440
I just thought we didn't have to humiliate
our business partners like that.

57
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,840
We could have just collaborated.

58
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,880
How do you expect to run a business with
that kind of thinking? Enough talking.

59
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,080
You can just take care of the hospital.

60
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,400
I'll ask just one thing of you.
Don't mess it up.

61
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,080
I barely spoke to him.

62
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,120
My job keeps me busy.

63
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,320
With my position,
I only manage Heaven Hospital.

64
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,600
I'm always caught up with work,

65
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,040
and the only person I see
is my wife, who works there too.

66
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,200
The ones who clashed with Dad the most

67
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,040
were Mr. Pramet and Mr. Apapat.

68
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,560
And lately,

69
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,000
Mr. Apapat has been playing
a bigger role in managing H Group.

70
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,240
What is Mr. Apapat's position in H Group?

71
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,800
I'd really like you
to reconsider Parin's project.

72
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,640
I think it's very promising.

73
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,240
It'll generate a lot of profit.

74
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Are you part of the company's management?

75
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,800
The data is complete nonsense.

76
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,440
Enough of this.
Stay out of my management affairs.

77
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,960
You're better off being a housewife.

78
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,480
I just don't want you
to make a rash decision.

79
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,560
But I've already made up my mind.

80
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,720
Stop bringing it up.

81
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,480
- But--
- No buts.

82
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,520
It's okay, Mom.
I respect Grandpa's decision.

83
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,320
That night, I locked up
the house at the usual time.

84
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,400
And once I finished up,

85
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,360
I went straight to bed.

86
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,640
I found out in the morning,
just like everyone else.

87
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,160
Do you know who was the last person
with the chairman that night?

88
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,200
I don't know.

89
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,080
The CCTV footage shows that the lawyer,
Pornchai, was the last person to see him.

90
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,360
But…

91
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,560
I don't see anyone else
entering his room after that.

92
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,160
The CCTV didn't capture it.

93
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,800
Is it broken,
just like in those crime dramas?

94
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Someone intentionally turned it off.

95
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,760
Does the earlier footage show
who entered the control room?

96
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,000
It doesn't.

97
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,360
And where were you that night?

98
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,159
I was in the employee residence, as usual.

99
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,440
I'm Mr. Yai's personal bodyguard.

100
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,600
Among the family,
who did the chairman love the most?

101
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,720
I don't know who he loved the most.

102
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,720
It was probably Mr. Yai or Ms. Triprapa.

103
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,400
But as for who he hated the most,

104
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,720
I think that's pretty obvious.

105
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,320
I can't imagine anyone

106
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,040
doing something that horrible to him,

107
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,480
not after everything
he's done for this family.

108
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,920
Have you ever argued with the chairman?

109
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,960
Not even once. Dad was so kind to me.

110
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,960
If there was anyone
who clashed with him all the time…

111
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,640
Well…

112
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,520
It was Mr. Pramet and his son.

113
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,400
The only one who never disappointed him

114
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,080
was my son, Parin.

115
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,200
He's always been reliable and made
a huge profit for our business.

116
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,520
My dad died when I was young.

117
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,200
Grandpa was the one who raised me.

118
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,240
Did you ever have disagreements with him?

119
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,320
No.

120
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,080
I did everything Grandpa told me to do.

121
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,680
I never caused any problems,

122
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,480
unlike that detested grandson,
who only brings trouble.

123
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,600
Detested grandson?

124
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,680
It's Yai.

125
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,960
We're cousins, but we're not close at all.

126
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,440
We work in different businesses.

127
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,600
I run Heaven Home,
while he manages H Club.

128
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,760
H Club? The one
on your family's entertainment street?

129
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,160
Right.

130
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,720
He's in charge of it.

131
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,040
I think you get the idea.

132
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,040
People in power

133
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,200
never really value anyone. They just
keep causing problems for the family.

134
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,760
So, Mr. Mekhin
wasn't close to the chairman?

135
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,760
I don't know. I never cared.

136
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,240
But the person closest to Grandpa

137
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,280
must have been Triprapa, Yai's stepsister.

138
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,320
If I weren't so busy with work,

139
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,400
I would have been the one
taking care of Grandpa all the time.

140
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,440
You were also the one
who found his body, weren't you?

141
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,440
Yes.

142
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,240
I was bringing food to his room.

143
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,600
And that's when I saw him…

144
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,040
Other than Yai,

145
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,880
he was the one who always took care of me.

146
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,960
Dad.

147
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,000
Why did you have to take her in?

148
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,880
I didn't want her.
Her mom didn't want her.

149
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,800
Just leave her somewhere.

150
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680
Shut your mouth.

151
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,160
You're testing my patience, Met.

152
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,440
Even if they only have
one drop of Hemaratsiri blood,

153
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,280
they're still family.

154
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
I won't allow anyone from our family

155
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,640
to be left on the streets.

156
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,040
So annoying.

157
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,440
What a burden.

158
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,560
Did you go to see him that night
before he went to bed?

159
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,360
I didn't.

160
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,600
Are you sure?

161
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
I am.

162
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,640
But when I walked past his room,

163
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,600
I saw Yai and Mr. Pornchai
going in to talk to him.

164
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,240
I heard Yai talking to him,
but I didn't know what it was about.

165
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,960
You heard it? It must have been loud.

166
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,240
Was there a problem?

167
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,080
It sounded like there was an argument

168
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,960
between Yai and Grandpa.

169
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,560
Yai doesn't talk much.

170
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,440
He has power and people under his control.

171
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,640
I don't know what he's thinking.

172
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,480
I don't really talk to him so often.

173
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,560
But Yai is really scary.

174
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,400
He's even stricter than Dad.

175
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,120
He must think he's better than everyone.

176
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't know if he had the guts to do it.

177
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,520
But with his cold and cruel demeanor,

178
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,600
I wouldn't be surprised

179
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,040
if he turned out

180
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,360
to be the murderer.

181
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,040
Yes, I had an argument
with Grandpa last night.

182
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,320
What was it about?

183
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,640
Nothing important.

184
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,960
As always, we had some disagreements
about how to run the business.

185
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,280
He was very strict about work.
Everyone in the family knows that.

186
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,160
Was that all?

187
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,880
Does it need to be more?

188
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,440
That means you were the last person
to see the chairman alive.

189
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,480
It wasn't me.

190
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,120
When I left, Mr. Pornchai
stayed behind to talk to him.

191
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,760
Mr. Pornchai?

192
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,600
What are we supposed to tell everyone

193
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,960
about how Dad was murdered
in his own house?

194
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,520
Even when he was ill,
the board put a lot of pressure on us.

195
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,320
But now, a murder
has happened in the house.

196
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,320
H Group will be greatly impacted.

197
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,800
To protect Grandpa's legacy

198
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,960
and our family's reputation,

199
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,880
should we announce
that he died from his illness?

200
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,800
You're so smart. Good idea.

201
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,680
Everyone knows he wasn't well.

202
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,400
They shouldn't question it.

203
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,520
Would it be wise?

204
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,040
Wouldn't it be worse
if the murder were to be uncovered?

205
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,200
But if the stock price drops,
will you be able to fix it?

206
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,720
But Grandpa died--

207
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,840
The dead are gone,

208
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,600
but we're still here, alive.
Do we have to go down with him?

209
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,000
What do you think, Yai?

210
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,240
The stock price will drop
no matter what we tell them.

211
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,480
But death from illness

212
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,200
definitely sounds better than murder.

213
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,880
That's right.

214
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
If we tell them it was murder,

215
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,560
everyone will probably think
the killer is one of us.

216
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,600
What's wrong with that?

217
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,280
Anyone in this room

218
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,600
could be the murderer.

219
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,440
That's enough, Yai.
Let the police handle this.

220
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,840
How should we announce
Grandpa's health complications?

221
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,320
You're a doctor, aren't you?
Any ideas, Nuanchan?

222
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,960
I…

223
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,600
A sudden heart attack.

224
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,400
No one would doubt it.

225
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,160
Older people

226
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,920
tend to have this condition.

227
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,120
Right.

228
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,120
Let's go with that.
There's always trouble. What a headache.

229
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,040
I'm not comfortable with this, Yai.

230
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,000
It's not fair to Grandpa.

231
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,440
This is business, Tri.

232
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,520
We need to do what benefits us most,

233
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,079
even if…

234
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,359
it's not the right thing to do.

235
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,440
You've been using me.
You've been treating me like a dog,

236
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,720
a servant whose only purpose is to serve
the Hemaratsiris until the day I die,

237
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,160
just because
I'm not your flesh and blood?!

238
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,560
Sparing you
and your mother's lives that day

239
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,640
was already a great mercy.

240
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,040
Excuse me.

241
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,200
Is everything alright, Chairman?

242
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,720
I invited Mr. Pornchai here tonight

243
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,560
to draft my final will. Prin…

244
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,800
will be the new chairman.

245
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,880
And you will get nothing!

246
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,880
There's no update
on the shooter at the club, Mr. Yai.

247
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,200
The CCTV footage was lost.

248
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,720
I reviewed all the footage
from the area and found nothing.

249
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,720
We have a mole.

250
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,040
That's what I think.

251
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,600
Whoever wants you dead
probably has some power.

252
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,280
We need to find him.

253
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,680
I want to know
if he's part of this family or not.

254
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,320
Hey, watch this, guys. Come down, girl.

255
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,360
- Let go of me! Hey!
- I'll bring you to heaven.

256
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,800
- Let go! Get off of me!
- Let's go, girl.

257
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,080
- Let go!
- Don't play hard to get.

258
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,560
- Let go!
- Hey!

259
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,800
What was that?

260
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,160
Hey, softy.

261
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,280
Wait, Mr. Yai!

262
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,080
That's enough. I'm fine now.

263
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,360
MK 33 BANGKOK

264
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,000
Thank you for helping me.

265
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,640
You should take a few days off.

266
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,040
I'll talk to the manager.

267
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,720
He won't cut your pay.
He'll even cover your medical bills.

268
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,880
Wait.

269
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
What now?

270
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,560
It's pouring. You shouldn't go now.

271
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,320
It's dangerous to drive.

272
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,400
I'll be fine.

273
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,800
Wait for the rain to stop first.
Let's get inside.

274
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,120
Are you inviting me inside?

275
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,800
What? Don't get the wrong idea.

276
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,120
You saved my life,

277
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,520
and I just wanted to return the favor.

278
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,400
You're something, aren't you?

279
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,240
Go ahead, drive home in the rain
all you want. I warned you.

280
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,480
What?

281
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,280
Weren't you going to let me wait inside?
I was just asking. I didn't refuse.

282
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,720
Dry your hair.

283
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,280
I'm not that fragile.

284
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,840
I know. But you can still get sick,
whether you're fragile or not.

285
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,240
Just dry it.

286
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,760
Again, I appreciate what you did.

287
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,760
No need to thank me.

288
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,400
You're an employee of H Club.

289
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,120
As the owner, it's my responsibility
to take care of problems.

290
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,680
So…

291
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,080
We're even, after what happened that day.

292
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,040
No. You almost died that day.

293
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,880
How could you compare it
to your little act of help?

294
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,480
And where is everyone?

295
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,640
Aunt Jai's shop should still be open.

296
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,360
And Ti should be at the hospital,
working his shift.

297
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
What about your parents?

298
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,480
I don't have parents.
Aunt Jai is the one who raised me.

299
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,320
What is it?

300
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,840
<i>I found Mr. Pornchai's car, Mr. Yai.</i>

301
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,600
I'll be there.

302
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,440
Hey, wait. It's still raining.

303
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,320
Hey, you! Wait!

304
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,120
This is the CCTV footage from
the penthouse on the night of the murder.

305
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
That's…

306
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,720
Someone followed Mr. Pornchai
when he left the penthouse.

307
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,960
Then Mr. Pornchai
wasn't involved in the murder,

308
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,640
but he was abducted by someone.

309
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,800
He could already be dead.

310
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,920
Then we need to find his body.

311
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Yes, Mr. Yai.

312
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,000
We haven't been able
to reach Mr. Pornchai.

313
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,360
What about his house?

314
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,840
We checked. No one was home.

315
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,640
There were no signs of struggle or any
attempt to escape. He just disappeared.

316
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,680
We figured he vanished
after leaving the penthouse.

317
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,720
Mr. Mekhin, are you aware

318
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,720
of the business he and the chairman
were discussing that night?

319
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,720
No idea.

320
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,360
I was furious,
so I stormed off before that.

321
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,560
Have you found any other evidence?

322
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,040
We're doing our best to gather more,

323
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,360
but we haven't found
anything else at the crime scene.

324
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,360
Also,

325
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,520
everyone in your family is a suspect.

326
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,760
I can't reveal too many details.

327
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,880
Then make it quick.

328
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,280
We don't want to be suspects
any longer than necessary.

329
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,680
We'll double our efforts
to find Mr. Pornchai.

330
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,320
He's probably the key

331
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,680
to understanding what happened that night.

332
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,360
BANG YI KHAN POLICE STATION

333
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,400
Someone is more interested
in the chairman's murder than us.

334
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,440
Tell our men to find Mr. Pornchai
before the police do.

335
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,280
He must be holding onto the will.

336
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,120
Before Grandpa died, he was drafting
a new will with Mr. Pornchai.

337
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,040
He would've definitely given you
the chairman position.

338
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,080
Don't worry.

339
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,560
We're not the only ones
looking for the will.

340
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,400
Tell our men to make fast.

341
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,120
I need to have the will
before anyone else.

342
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,720
Yes, Mr. Yai.

343
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,760
The police still
haven't found the will, Mom.

344
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,840
But I think it's with Mr. Pornchai.

345
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,280
I think Grandpa was discussing the will
with him that night.

346
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,680
It's serious now.

347
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,440
He was probably planning to appoint Yai,
his favorite grandson, as chairman.

348
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,760
Before Grandpa died,
he humiliated me and praised that jerk.

349
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,560
I won't let that happen.

350
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,440
Only my son can become the chairman.

351
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,120
I won't give it up either.

352
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,680
I've endured too much to get this far.

353
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,400
It's good that he's dead.

354
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,880
Now, the opportunity is ours.

355
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,120
You can't just sit around, Parin.

356
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Don't worry.

357
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,280
I'll find Mr. Pornchai and the will
before the police do.

358
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,760
H Group's stock price dropped drastically
after news of the chairman's passing.

359
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,680
I think we should announce
the new chairman as soon as possible

360
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,440
to restore investor confidence

361
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,360
before we suffer irreparable damage.

362
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,320
He must've stated it in his will.
This shouldn't be complicated.

363
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,240
Well…

364
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,920
The lawyer insisted that

365
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,560
we can only read the will after 100 days.

366
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,440
Really?

367
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,680
Yes. Our family is fine with that.

368
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,800
We're still mourning Dad's death.

369
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,360
We're not ready
to focus on the will just yet.

370
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,880
I hope you all understand.

371
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,560
But it's impossible
to wait 100 days before announcing

372
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,520
the new chairman.

373
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,280
Then I think we should appoint
an acting chairman.

374
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,560
It should be someone with fresh ideas,

375
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,520
to give the company a more youthful image.

376
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,840
I disagree.

377
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,280
We should find someone respectable,

378
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,400
both in skill and experience,

379
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,880
to act as chairman.

380
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,800
We should consider Mr. Pramet

381
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,200
or Mr. Pramote.

382
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,080
I think Mr. Pramet is the best choice.

383
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,680
He's the chairman's eldest son.

384
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,760
People won't question his succession,

385
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,080
so we can avoid unnecessary drama.

386
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,080
Not to mention, we have Mr. Yai,
who built the business

387
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,440
into a success

388
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,880
and is there to support his father.

389
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,800
I personally have no objections.

390
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,240
I'm already overwhelmed
with work at the hospital.

391
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,800
So, I think Met is best suited
to be the acting chairman.

392
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,440
Are there any objections?

393
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,960
Well…

394
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,920
I need to thank
all of you for your support.

395
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,480
I promise

396
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,680
I'll lead H Group

397
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
through this crisis.

398
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,320
Thank you.

399
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,120
Oh.

400
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,960
Thank you for the nomination.

401
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,880
It's not a big deal.
We've known each other for a long time.

402
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,320
I'll never forget you. Thank you.

403
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,680
- Thank you. Okay.
- Enjoy your vacation.

404
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,320
I just realized that
this position requires connections.

405
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,400
I didn't have to do
any of what you're implying.

406
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,120
Just being here was enough to make
everyone believe I'm the right man.

407
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,000
Is that what you think?

408
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,080
For someone like you,

409
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,760
without a son like Mr. Yai,
no one would even care about you.

410
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,080
Your contribution to the family business

411
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
must seem like a few grains of sand
in the board's eyes.

412
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,360
What are you saying?

413
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,320
You're relying on your son
for everything you have today.

414
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,360
And yet you call yourself the right man?

415
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,640
What's wrong with relying on my son?

416
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,680
My son is good enough for me to rely on.

417
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,640
Unlike you,

418
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,200
who's desperate to rely on your son

419
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,920
but can't

420
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,600
because he's an idiot. You fool.

421
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,760
You jerk.

422
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,840
Asshole.

423
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,840
You should quit, Meena.

424
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,160
I'm worried about you.

425
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,040
Do as she says.
It's too dangerous to work there.

426
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,560
You should just help out at our shop.

427
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,080
But being a singer at H Club pays well.

428
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,200
I still don't have a permanent job.

429
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,920
I can't keep

430
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,280
living off your money.

431
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,120
And what if something
like that happens again?

432
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,800
You won't be lucky every time.

433
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,960
Since Mr. Yai handled it,

434
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,400
I don't think it'll happen again.
Trust me.

435
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,480
You shouldn't lower your guard,

436
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,640
espacially with Mr. Yai.

437
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,640
Ti, Mr. Yai may seem scary,

438
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,640
but he saved me.

439
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,000
And I don't plan
on doing this job forever.

440
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,320
I applied for an accountant position.

441
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,000
If I get the job,

442
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,600
I promise I'll quit the club.

443
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,120
That's good to hear.
You've been through so much.

444
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,360
You were always working part-time jobs
when you were in school.

445
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,920
I just want to earn good money,
so I can take care of you.

446
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,720
And I want to get Mom out of that house.

447
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,160
You still haven't given up?

448
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,560
How many times have you been hurt
because of what you've done for her?

449
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,600
This stubborn girl
will never listen to you, Mom.

450
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,280
It'll all go over her head.

451
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,240
- Hmm.
- Stop it.

452
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,440
That hurts, Ti.

453
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,800
INSTANT LOAN

454
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,120
- Take that.
- Ouch.

455
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,160
What's wrong, Mom?

456
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,760
Are you okay?

457
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,520
It's nothing. I'll just go to the kitchen.

458
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,560
Why are you siting here?
This table is for the bosses.

459
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,720
Oh, well…

460
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,480
Nate is with me.

461
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,440
I can tell her to sit wherever I want.

462
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
What is your problem?

463
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,000
Didn't Dad tell her not to sit with us?

464
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,400
Bringing someone like this to the table

465
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,840
just ruins our appetite, Uncle Met.

466
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,200
Bua, put those two plates away.

467
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,600
Put them away!

468
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,280
I can just eat in the kitchen.

469
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,400
No!

470
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,760
Sit down. I'm in charge here.

471
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,160
Anyone who has a problem can leave.

472
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,960
What the hell are you standing for? Sit!

473
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,440
Yes.

474
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,920
Pampering her like this,

475
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,200
you might as well make it public

476
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,360
that the acting chairman
chose a pathetic nobody as his wife.

477
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,840
I didn't ask for your opinion.

478
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,639
I can do whatever I want. Stay out of it.

479
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,679
Follow him!

480
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,360
Max, stay here.

481
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,880
Search for anything useful.

482
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,040
Right away.

483
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,360
Inthon.

484
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,320
Didn't you say you lost your appetite?

485
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,440
When did I say that?

486
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,800
Wow.

487
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,440
I never said it.

488
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,040
RUEANROT

489
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,600
What do you need to talk about?

490
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,960
I'd like you to be
in the Hemaratsiri house

491
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,800
as my fiancée.

492
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,600
What did you just say?

493
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,400
I want you to be my fiancée.

494
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,320
Are you insane?

495
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,760
We've only met a few times,
and now you want to get engaged?

496
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,280
When did you even fall in love with me?

497
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,200
You're nuts. Who said I love you?

498
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,520
Why do you want to get engaged?

499
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,040
It's necessary.

500
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,120
How is that necessary?

501
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,880
I don't want to marry someone
they arranged for me,

502
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,840
so I want you to pretend to be my fiancée
and get it over with.

503
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,240
I'm not asking you to do this for free.

504
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,120
Name your price.

505
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,840
I thought too highly of you.

506
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,680
Being rich doesn't give you
the right to look down on people.

507
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,800
I'm not lookng down on you.
I'm paying you to work for me.

508
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,920
Do you want a new house?

509
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,200
The one you live in is pretty old.

510
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,680
You're disgusting.
Not only are you looking down on me,

511
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,520
but you're looking down on my family too.

512
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,160
I don't need money
from this ridiculous job.

513
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,000
You're the one being ridiculous.
A job is a job.

514
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,120
Are you looking down on other jobs?

515
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,280
We need to get going, or we'll be late
for the chairman's funeral.

516
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,200
Think about my offer.

517
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Chairman Preeda's funeral?

518
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,880
Please have some water.

519
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,960
Please.

520
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,800
Thank you for your time, sir.

521
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,200
Right. My condolences.

522
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,320
Please, have a seat.

523
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,120
- Nate.
- Right.

524
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,960
Careful.

525
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,120
Minister Ratthachai.

526
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,320
Thank you very much
for attending Dad's funeral.

527
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
I couldn't miss this.

528
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,520
I'm sorry for your loss.

529
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,960
Why didn't you practice
crying like that for a scene?

530
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,600
I don't see why
I should waste my time on that.

531
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,080
I'll never be able to steal the spotlight
from those foxes.

532
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,320
I'm sorry for crying too much.

533
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,120
Since the day he passed away,
I haven't been able to stop.

534
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,440
Why did you have to be clumsy now, Nate?

535
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Clean it up. Quickly.

536
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,760
Mr. Yai, Miss Monmeena is here.

537
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,320
What do you want?

538
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,320
I'm Meena.

539
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,280
Monmeena.

540
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,440
I'm your daughter.

541
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,920
What are you talking about?

542
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,880
You've got the wrong person.

543
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,680
Mom.

544
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,800
I never blamed you.

545
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,480
I understand you.

546
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,080
I've always wanted to meet you, you know?

547
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,600
Mom, do you know?

548
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,320
I graduated. I have a job now.

549
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,920
Come live with me. Please.

550
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,280
I'll take care of you.

551
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,720
Why?

552
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,120
I don't see anyone in that family,
not even Mr. Pramet,

553
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,880
proud to have you as one of them.

554
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,720
Not a single one of them respects you.

555
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,200
Why do you keep tolerating them?
I don't understand.

556
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,760
- Please, Mom.
- What's wrong with you? Enough.

557
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,960
- What are you talking about?
- Mom.

558
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,080
I told you I have no idea who you are.

559
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,960
Don't ever let me see your face again.

560
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,640
How can you say that? I'm your daughter!

561
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,760
- Mom.
- Nate.

562
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,720
- Let go.
- Mom.

563
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,880
Nate!

564
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,080
Please, Mom.

565
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,800
- Where are you?
- Go away! Go hide!

566
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,400
I said hide!

567
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,000
Nate!

568
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,840
Why the hell didn't you pick up my calls?

569
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,440
What are you doing here?

570
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,400
I'm cleaning up the broken glass.

571
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,120
Mr. Met, you should go back inside.

572
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,400
They must be looking for you.

573
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,400
Next time, let me know
before going anywhere. Got it?

574
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,240
You need to be there when I call you.

575
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,680
Yes.

576
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,840
Follow me.

577
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,760
Now!

578
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,960
Dumbass.

579
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,400
Mom…

580
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,840
Don't!

581
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,240
- Don't do it!
- Silence!

582
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,480
Do you want to get hurt?! Quiet!

583
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,160
Hey!

584
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,520
What are you doing to her?!

585
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,880
What?! Run!

586
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,880
Aunt Jai! Aunt Jai!

587
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,040
Meena.

588
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,160
Aunt Jai.

589
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,520
- Are you hurt?
- I'm not. I'm okay.

590
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,560
- Let's go to the hospital, Aunt Jai.
- It's fine.

591
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,760
How is this fine?

592
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,720
I'm going to the police.

593
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,880
You can't do that. Don't, Meena.

594
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,760
Why not?

595
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,720
I told you not to.

596
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,240
Stop asking questions. Let it go.

597
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,600
Aunt Jai.

598
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,720
If you don't tell me what happened,

599
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,600
I'll call the police.

600
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,720
The police can't do anything.

601
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,840
These people are basically mafia.

602
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,560
The police are in league with them.

603
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,920
I owe a loan shark one million baht.

604
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,320
One million?

605
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,840
I only borrowed 400,000 baht from them.

606
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,040
But with interest piling up

607
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,120
over time,

608
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,000
it's turned into a million.

609
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,800
Aunt Jai, why didn't you tell me and Ti?

610
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,840
I… I didn't want to worry you both.

611
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,880
But we have jobs now.

612
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,160
It's okay, sweetie.

613
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,480
I'd just be a burden. Don't do this.

614
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,040
Aunt Jai.

615
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,040
Listen to me.

616
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,600
You're not a burden.

617
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,880
I'll take care of it for you.

618
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,040
You don't have to.
I don't want to drag you into this.

619
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,040
It's not a burden.

620
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,160
Not at all.

621
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,000
Sweetie.

622
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,440
I'm scared. They're dangerous.

623
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,360
What on earth makes you so happy

624
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,440
that you decided to drink here?

625
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,400
You brought your mistress to the funeral.
Do you care what people will say?

626
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,840
Wait for me upstairs.

627
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,040
You should keep that gold-digger
where no one can see her.

628
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,280
Who knows?

629
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,920
She might be hiding something from you.

630
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,040
Like…

631
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,680
Like what?

632
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,200
Like having had a child.

633
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,480
What are you trying to say?

634
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,240
I'm just warning you.

635
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,800
The moment
you make her your legitimate wife,

636
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,160
we'll have to share
our family fortune with her.

637
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,600
What if she has a child?

638
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,760
Why are you even
thinking about that nonsense?

639
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,240
I already told Nate
to cut ties with her old family.

640
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,160
There's no way they'd be part of this.

641
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,400
So that means she really did have a child?

642
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,200
How the hell should I know
if she did or not?

643
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,520
Why does it matter? I don't care.

644
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,600
Never mind.

645
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,320
Do whatever you want.
Just don't let it make the news.

646
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,960
Stop meddling in my life.

647
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,360
I'm warning you.

648
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,400
Be nice to me.

649
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,760
If you don't want trouble
with the chairman of H Group.

650
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,520
You know your time
in that position is limited.

651
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,480
You're so annoying.

652
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,280
Mr. Yai, there's a problem
at Miss Monmeena's house.

653
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:26,960
<i>Will you say you love me?</i>
<i>Don't leave me hanging</i>

654
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,920
<i>Please hold me in your arms</i>

655
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,680
<i>Will you say you love me?</i>
<i>Don't leave my heart empty</i>

656
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,640
<i>Make my day turn out happy</i>

657
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,720
<i>Would you save me?</i>

658
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,080
Please.

659
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,560
I thought I was clear

660
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,360
that I won't accept your ridiculous offer.

661
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,040
<i>I didn't intend to insult you that day.</i>

662
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,600
<i>I'm sorry if it bothered you.</i>

663
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,720
<i>Is that all?</i>

664
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,560
I'd like you to reconsider my offer.

665
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,920
- I said no.
- Don't you wanna see your mom?

666
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,480
Your mom lives in my house.

667
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,160
Am I right?

668
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,480
I think this offer is important enough

669
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,960
for you to reconsider it.

670
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,720
Think of it as a mutual agreement.

671
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,440
You get something out of it.

672
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,120
So do I.

673
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,000
Win-win.

674
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,240
<i>I really have to go save my mom.</i>

675
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,800
<i>I'm sorry, Aunt Jai, Ti.</i>

676
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,440
I'LL BE AWAY FOR SOME TIME
PLEASE DON'T CONTACT ME

677
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,080
Join us, Yai.

678
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,920
Who are you bringing with you?

679
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,280
This is Monmeena, my fiancée.

680
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,560
Fiancée?

681
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,600
Fiancée? What is this, Yai?

682
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,600
What game are you trying to play, Yai?

683
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,160
This is not a game.

684
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,880
Monmeena will live here as my fiancée.

685
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,520
We're getting married soon.

686
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,040
Mr. Yai, what wedding?
You said we were just getting engaged.

687
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,360
I hope all of you
will treat Monmeena, my fiancée,

688
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,320
as a member of the Hemaratsiri family.

689
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,400
Not a chance. I won't let this slide.

690
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,280
You can't just bring
some unknown woman into the house, Yai.

691
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,760
Why? Are you surprised?

692
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,200
I'm just doing what my "father" did.

693
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,320
- Yai, you…
- Uh…

694
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,120
Mr. Yai. Mr. Met.
You two should calm down.

695
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,000
You were always busy with work,

696
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,560
so how do you two even know each other?

697
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,000
Monmeena works at H Club.

698
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,960
The day I was shot, she saved my life.

699
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,040
And then we got to know each other better.

700
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,160
Love bloomed from helping each other
and getting close?

701
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,240
What's your job at H Club?

702
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,320
Uh…

703
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,720
I'm a regular singer at H Club.

704
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,040
So, she sings for a living.

705
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,160
You have good taste, Mr. Yai.

706
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,360
Well, you shouldn't
criticize his choices, Mr. Met.

707
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,440
Your son is in love.
You should be supportive.

708
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,200
After all,

709
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,680
Mr. Yai finally found
someone who suits him.

710
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,880
What nonsense are you babbling about, Pa?

711
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,560
If your mouth is empty,
stuff some pudding in it.

712
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,040
Why don't you do it yourself?

713
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,160
Don't you know I hate pudding?!

714
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,640
You dumbass.

715
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,840
Any more questions?

716
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,640
Mr. Mekhin.

717
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,240
Don't you want to explain
what you just said?

718
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,360
We agreed to pretend to be engaged.
We never said anything about a wedding.

719
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,000
I did it to make it convincing.

720
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,560
Once I become chairman,
our agreement ends anyway.

721
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,640
You won't be here long enough to marry me.

722
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,920
Yeah? Well,
I don't want to marry you either!

723
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,360
Once I get my mom out of here,
you'll never see me again.

724
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,240
Get your mom out of here?

725
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,880
How do you plan to do that?

726
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,360
I… I don't know.

727
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,520
I haven't thought about it.

728
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,840
Hey, can you take me to my mom?

729
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,560
Which floor is she on? I've met everyone,

730
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,640
but I still haven't seen my mom.

731
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,600
Don't be hasty.
It's not as easy as you think.

732
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,720
And did you forget our agreement?

733
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,560
If you want to see your mom,
you have to do everything I tell you.

734
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,600
Follow me.

735
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,720
What are you doing? I said follow me.

736
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,640
Right. I'm coming.

737
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,600
Here, we live on separate floors.
Each family gets their own for privacy.

738
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,880
This is my floor.

739
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,200
Over here is the living room.
The office and bedroom are upstairs.

740
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,960
And there's no one else living in here?

741
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,960
Normally, I'm here alone.

742
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,320
No one comes to this floor
unless I tell them to.

743
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,120
So, it's just the two of us
on this floor?!

744
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,000
Why?

745
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,960
I'm not going to do anything to you.

746
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,240
And don't think about
doing anything to me.

747
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,640
That means my mom is on the same floor

748
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,880
as Mr. Pramet.

749
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,320
Every floor has a security system.

750
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,880
Each one has different codes and keys.

751
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,600
So,

752
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,880
one wrong move

753
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,960
and it could be your last.

754
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,800
Just like Chairman Preeda, right?

755
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,200
They say he didn't die from an illness.

756
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,880
Is that true?

757
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:43,080
Just know that his death
is still a mystery.

758
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,960
But as you can see,

759
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,280
everyone in this house is a hypocrite.

760
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,440
Anyone can be a murderer.

761
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,720
Anyone but me.

762
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,680
Because if I were to kill someone,

763
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,000
no one would ever find out.

764
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,280
Well, at least
I'm not a fake fiancée to a murderer.

765
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,800
You have no idea what your mom
is going through in this house.

766
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,440
She's a mistress no one respects.

767
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,280
And she has to put up
with an emotionally unstable husband.

768
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,160
If I announce that I'm getting married,

769
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,200
the board will trust me more. And you?

770
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,320
You'll get closer to your mom.

771
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,320
I'll have to refuse.

772
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,760
I don't want to be part of your business.

773
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,520
Even without your help,

774
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,280
I'll find a way to get my mom out of here.

775
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,280
What about your aunt?

776
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,240
How are you going to help her?

777
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,880
I heard she owes
a loan shark a million baht.

778
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,080
Where are you going to get that money?

779
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,360
Let me tell you. These thugs hate waiting.

780
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,080
One day,

781
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,880
they might decide to hurt your aunt.

782
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,520
Now, follow me.

783
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,280
Wait for me.

784
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,080
Did you find anything?

785
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,600
I got the name of the guy
who abducted Mr. Pornchai.

786
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,920
Here.

787
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,240
His name is Ou. He's a gang leader.
He runs questionable jobs.

788
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,320
But we don't have much on him yet.

789
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:02,960
What are the police saying?

790
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,280
Our informant said

791
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,160
they've found nothing either.

792
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,320
As for the knife
used to stab the chairman,

793
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,080
there were no fingerprints.

794
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,320
It's going to take time
before the police find anything new.

795
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,200
Then we should lure Ou out
and take him down.

796
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,000
Get ready for that.

797
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,720
Right.

798
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,080
Mr. Yai.

799
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,960
Will it be okay
if Miss Monmeena finds out about this?

800
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,920
It can't be helped.

801
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,640
I need to get Grandpa's will soon,
no matter what.

802
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,640
If you keep acting recklessly like this,

803
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,400
you can pack up and leave in the morning.

804
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,120
You're just like Mei, your mother.

805
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,240
The audacity to look down on others.

806
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,000
A greedy coward like you

807
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,240
has no right to talk about my mother.

808
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,000
- You!
- What?!

809
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,880
It's good that
those two families are fighting.

810
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,960
This is our time to shine.

811
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,360
A speck of dirt belongs to the ground.

812
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,160
It can never be the star.

813
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,120
<i>I can smell a gold-digger</i>
<i>from a mile away.</i>

814
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,520
Don't be surprised
if there's a sudden wedding.

815
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,120
Mekhin.

816
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,960
You brought me here
to try on wedding dresses?

817
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,480
I thought we were faking our engagement.
Why do we need to do this?

818
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,560
<i>I told my family I was going to marry you.</i>

819
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,160
<i>Monmeena belongs to me now.</i>
<i>I can do whatever I want with her.</i>

820
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,080
