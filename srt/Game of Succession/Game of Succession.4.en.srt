1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,080
Dirt will always be dirt.
It'll never be a star.

2
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,040
<i>You reek of someone lucky</i>
<i>to marry into wealth.</i>

3
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,000
If there's a sudden wedding,
don't be too surprised.

4
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,040
Mekhin.

5
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,920
You're just like that Mei, your mother.

6
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,040
Always looking down on people,
always mocking everyone.

7
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,960
Disgusting!

8
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,840
<i>A greedy, cowardly man like you</i>

9
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,040
has no right to speak about my mother.

10
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,800
- Hey!
- What?!

11
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,680
The more those two families
tear each other apart,

12
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,720
the better for us to shine.

13
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,320
If you keep acting recklessly like this,

14
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,080
you can pack up and leave in the morning.

15
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,760
Dragging me here
for a wedding dress fitting?

16
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,280
You said we're only fake-engaged.
What's the point of this?

17
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,360
<i>I already told my family</i>
<i>we're getting married.</i>

18
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,960
<i>Monmeena is mine now.</i>
<i>I can do whatever I want.</i>

19
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,000
Mr. Yai, there's trouble at the club.

20
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,360
What now? Can't you handle it yourselves?

21
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,600
You'd better see for yourself.

22
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,680
Please drink, sir.

23
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,440
- Hey, Lily.
- Yes, sir?

24
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,840
Out of all your five fingers,
which one do you like best?

25
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,760
- My pinky finger.
- And why is that?

26
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,760
I love making promises.

27
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,760
What a joke.

28
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,080
Wanna make a promise with me?

29
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,600
You know which one I like?

30
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Which one?

31
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,400
I like all of them.

32
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,680
- Why?
- So I can grab you with my whole hand.

33
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,120
Come on. Let's drink.

34
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,920
Harder.

35
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
Harder!

36
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,640
Is this how you take care of me?

37
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,120
- Mr. Pramet.
- What?

38
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,680
Please, let's go back to the VIP room.

39
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,640
Huh?

40
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,440
You really don't know
I'm the father of the owner of this place?

41
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,680
Where the hell are you moving me?!

42
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,680
Get out!

43
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,400
You're here. My ungrateful son.

44
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,920
Your father is drinking here,
and you can't even take care of me?

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,560
Why are you so damn stingy?

46
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,240
Do as he says. Bring out
the most expensive liquor and serve it.

47
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,280
But sir…

48
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,840
You can see he's just wasting it.

49
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,560
What are you mumbling about?
Your boss gave the order.

50
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,440
You idiot, go!

51
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,200
If you don't hand over H Club to me,

52
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,720
I'll come here every damn night
until you go bankrupt.

53
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,160
You can come every night if you want.

54
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,920
Do you really think annoying me
will accomplish anything? A useless man

55
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,360
can only beg for scraps
of the money I make.

56
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,120
You and me…

57
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,800
What the hell is your problem?

58
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,720
What?!

59
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,880
Drink up, then.

60
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,160
And if you want to use the word
"father" to pressure me, go ahead.

61
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,760
In the end,

62
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,160
you'll get nothing anyway.

63
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,360
Make sure he finishes it.
Don't let him leave until he does.

64
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,920
Yai!

65
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,600
Let go of me, so I can keep drinking.

66
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,360
Lily! Where the hell are you? Come here!

67
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,360
Pour me a drink! Now!

68
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,120
Hey, I said I brought my car.

69
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,920
Where are you taking me to drink again?

70
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
- Let go of me.
- Mr. Pramet.

71
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,920
Nate, my love. Come here.

72
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,760
Take better care of your husband.
Don't cause trouble at my club again.

73
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,920
What the hell are you talking about?

74
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,640
He has his mistress here.
Let her deal with him.

75
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,960
- Mr. Met.
- My love.

76
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,840
Mr. Met!

77
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,360
Help me up!

78
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,240
Mr. Met.

79
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,680
- Get up.
- No!

80
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,840
Please get up now.

81
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,320
I'll be watching closely to see

82
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,280
how long you can

83
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,280
keep up this act about Monmeena.

84
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,400
You…

85
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,920
Were you waiting to treat my wounds?

86
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's just like treating a dog at home.
Sit down quickly. I'm sleepy.

87
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,440
Sit down.

88
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,920
Let me see.

89
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,000
Excuse me.

90
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,360
I think your mother remembers you.

91
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,080
She's just pretending not to.

92
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,360
What do you mean?

93
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,640
Tell me.

94
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,520
I'm tired. I need to shower.

95
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,040
Mr. Yai, wait. Hold on.

96
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,640
What did you just say? Are you saying
my mother remembers me now?

97
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,040
Mr. Yai!

98
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,040
You never speak clearly.

99
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,920
When are you going to hand over the will?
He's been pressing you for it.

100
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,160
Yeah, yeah. Stop nagging.

101
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,880
I'll give it to him
when the time is right.

102
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,320
Just keep your mouth shut
and don't let anyone know where I am.

103
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,720
Isn't this your final deal?
Why don't you just get it over with?

104
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,560
Then you'll be free from him
and won't have to keep hiding like this.

105
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,560
I got it, alright?

106
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,200
You didn't call me here
just to rush me, did you?

107
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,840
The guys say there's an undercover cop
sniffing around your case.

108
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,600
And it's not even the officer
investigating the Hemaratsiri case.

109
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,200
Those rich folks

110
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,120
must be fighting
over their inheritance already.

111
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,400
Tell our people to keep an eye on things.

112
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,520
If anything happens,
let me know immediately.

113
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,160
Of course, I'll let you know.
Just make up your mind quickly.

114
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,640
<i>Hello, Meena?</i>

115
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Did you get Daddy's birthday cake?

116
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,760
Will you come home
and blow out the candles?

117
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,080
After I finish this job,

118
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,040
I'll come back and stay with you
for a long time. I won't leave anymore.

119
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,400
That's great. I won't be naughty.
I'll wait for you to come home.

120
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,600
Is that your dad? Can I talk?

121
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,840
Are you still busy?

122
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,280
It's getting really late.
You'll miss Meena's birthday cake.

123
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,640
You and Meena go ahead and celebrate.
Don't wait for me.

124
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,480
Are you sure?

125
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,680
We're all waiting for you.

126
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,240
I love you and Meena very much.

127
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,000
I love you too.

128
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,240
Stay safe at work.

129
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,720
Bring me the will,
and your daughter will be free.

130
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,880
Your daughter's life
or the will you stole…

131
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,000
<i>What's more important?</i>

132
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,360
Hasn't your man contacted you yet?

133
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,320
It's only been a few days, Mom.
Yai hasn't found the will either.

134
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,600
Stop lowering yourself
to compare with him.

135
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,400
Excuse me.

136
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,160
I told Mr. Pramote that you have guests.

137
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,200
It's alright. We're all family here.

138
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,200
- You may leave.
- Yes, ma'am.

139
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,520
Good day, Uncle Mote. Please have a seat.

140
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,400
Well,

141
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,760
what brings you here today, Mr. Mote?

142
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,600
You're always so busy
with the hospital, aren't you?

143
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,920
I truly am as busy as you say, Ms. Pa.

144
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,080
So, I'll get straight to the point.

145
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,440
I need you both

146
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,400
to stop Met's lounge project.

147
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,200
What power does a mere sister-in-law
have to stop him, Mr. Mote?

148
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,120
You're Met's own brother,
and he won't even listen to you.

149
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,280
You and Parin are close to Ms. Tasanee,

150
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,720
the landowner
of that plot we tried to buy.

151
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,880
When I tried to purchase more land,

152
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,720
it was Parin
who helped with the connection.

153
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,960
This time, just persuade her not to sell.

154
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,000
She might listen.

155
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,160
It's not that I don't want to help, Uncle.

156
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,360
But you know
how short-tempered Uncle Met is.

157
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,760
Why should my mother and I
get involved in your war?

158
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,920
So that you can become
the chairman of H Group.

159
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,880
No matter how terrible
Met's management is,

160
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,960
with his right to the position

161
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,920
and his son Yai backing him,

162
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,080
the chairman position you desire

163
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,240
won't be yours.

164
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,360
If Yai successfully
establishes his lounge project,

165
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,680
their family's power will be unchallenged.

166
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Pa,

167
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,320
do you think when that happens,

168
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,760
your lives will remain comfortable?

169
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,800
If you help me, I'll ensure
the hospital board supports you

170
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,920
in becoming the new chairman
of H Group instead of Met.

171
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,920
To be powerful, you need strong allies.

172
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,720
Don't you agree?

173
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,320
I never imagined
Uncle Mote would be like this.

174
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,240
This is good, though.
Now we have another ally.

175
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,760
Don't be foolish
and trust the second house too much.

176
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,520
This family,

177
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,760
if they get what they want,
they won't care about anyone else.

178
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,560
So, you're saying
Uncle Mote can't be trusted?

179
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,000
That's a risk for the future.
We should be cautious.

180
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,280
But right now,

181
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,359
someone is willing to fight Yai for us.
Why would we refuse?

182
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,240
And what about Ms. Tasanee?
Are you going to help Uncle Mote?

183
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Of course. Not just help.

184
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,120
I'll convince her to hate Yai so much

185
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,400
that Met's lounge project
will crumble entirely.

186
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,720
Even if the second house betrays us later,

187
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,240
I'll know how to sway
the board in your favor.

188
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,280
Yes?

189
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Dr. Thiti.

190
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,520
Are you Monmeena's brother?

191
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,440
Yes, I am. She is my foster sister.

192
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,200
So, we are all connected. Ever since
Mr. Yai brought Monmeena into the house,

193
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,840
everyone has assumed she's clinging to him

194
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,040
because she's just a nightclub singer.

195
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,520
No one knows her brother is a doctor.

196
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,760
Yes, I've heard rumors about
how people are talking about Meena.

197
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,360
How long have they been together?

198
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,960
She must be quite bold
to move into a man's house like that.

199
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,920
If I tell you, don't tell anyone,

200
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,200
not even Aunt Duangjai.

201
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,040
The truth is,

202
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,080
I'm Mr. Yai's fake fiancée.

203
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,600
Yes, it's been a while.

204
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,000
But Mr. Yai said
he met her when he got shot,

205
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,080
which wasn't even a month ago.

206
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,360
Yes, Meena didn't tell me much about it.

207
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,760
It's nothing, actually.

208
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,480
I'm just afraid
there's some kind of trick.

209
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,760
I'm not worried about Mr. Yai
being tricked by Monmeena.

210
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,440
He's too shrewd
to fall for a woman's schemes.

211
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,680
But Monmeena, on the other hand,
might be the one being deceived.

212
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,200
That's the real concern.

213
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,200
If you know anything, you can tell me.

214
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,400
Maybe we can protect Monmeena
before it's too late.

215
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,440
Well? What do you think?

216
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,960
I think there's probably
nothing to worry about.

217
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,080
- Really?
- Dr. Thiti.

218
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,000
Aren't you making your rounds?

219
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,600
Yes, I am.

220
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,480
If you ever feel troubled about anything,
you can always talk to me.

221
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,080
Get back to work.

222
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,520
Excuse me, then.

223
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,240
Let them work.

224
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,720
If you interfere too much, they'll get
nervous and won't be able to do their job.

225
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,840
And do you know
what I was talking to Dr. Thiti about?

226
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,920
Where is the will?

227
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,840
Don't try anything stupid.
My men are waiting outside.

228
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,040
If you mess around,
I'll make sure you're dead.

229
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,760
The young master
of the Hemaratsiri family looks weak

230
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,840
and mouthy, doesn't he?

231
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,320
Unlike the other master.

232
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,720
If I'm not afraid of Mekhin,

233
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,520
why would I be afraid of you?

234
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't want to waste my time
with a kid like you.

235
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,440
Yes,

236
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,640
the will you're looking for is with me,

237
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,880
but I'm not giving it to you easily.

238
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,800
We need to make a deal.

239
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,640
- What do you want?
- You need to help me get rid of Mekhin.

240
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,760
It's what you want too, isn't it?

241
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,600
This will make your job easier.

242
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Hey.

243
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,520
And how do I know
that the will is really with you?

244
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,520
You can call the cops to chase me,
like what they're doing right now.

245
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,160
But I'm telling you now.

246
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,520
If you refuse my offer,

247
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,080
you'll never get your hands on that will.

248
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Fine.

249
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,160
I'll help you get rid of Yai
in exchange for the will.

250
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,880
May I know why you called me
to see you, Ms. Nuanchan?

251
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,480
Have a seat.

252
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,320
I spoke with Dr. Thiti, your brother.

253
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,960
Are you going to tell me the truth

254
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,960
about what you and Mr. Yai are planning?

255
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,680
I don't know
what you discussed with Dr. Ti,

256
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,280
but the truth is,
Mr. Yai and I love each other.

257
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,320
That's why we're together.

258
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,320
You do realize Mr. Yai
is already engaged to someone else, right?

259
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,040
I do, but he told me he doesn't love her.

260
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,960
And does he love you?

261
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,760
I've known Mr. Yai since he was a child.

262
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,960
He's not someone who falls in love easily.

263
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840
And… Excuse me for saying this.

264
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,160
But a nightclub singer like you?
Doesn't that seem a bit strange?

265
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,280
You'd better tell me the truth.

266
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,760
The truth is, I love Monmeena.

267
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,000
Falling in love
with someone at first sight

268
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,600
isn't strange at all, is it?

269
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
And since you've known me
since I was a child,

270
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,600
you should also know I don't like
people interfering in my personal matters.

271
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,120
But if it'll put your mind at ease,

272
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
fine.

273
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,200
What was that?
Who gave you permission to kiss me?

274
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,760
You're acting like it was your first kiss.

275
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,920
Don't forget, your job is to convince
everyone that you're my fiancée.

276
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,320
- But--
- Make it worth the price.

277
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,080
Everything is in the agreement already.

278
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,200
And don't worry. I won't fall for you
just because of one kiss.

279
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,640
Worth the price, my ass. Why do I
have to waste my kiss like this?

280
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,360
Mr. Yai!

281
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,280
You have dinner
with the minister today, right?

282
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,680
People keep inviting me
to meals these days.

283
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,960
But no matter what,

284
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,320
I still prefer your cooking.

285
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,320
Today, may I go to the mall
to pick up a few things?

286
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,160
I'll get groceries

287
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,880
and some personal items for you.
Some things are running low.

288
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,920
Why don't you have Aunt Bua go instead?
Why do you need to go yourself, huh?

289
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,520
Last time, we let the maid handle it,
and you weren't satisfied.

290
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,320
I know your preferences best.

291
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,200
If I go myself, there won't be any issues.

292
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,120
Fine.

293
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,480
But go quickly and come straight back.

294
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,440
And don't meddle with anyone.
I don't like that. Understand?

295
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,520
Yes, I'll be quick.

296
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,800
How about a cup of coffee upstairs first?

297
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,680
Where's Aunt Bua?

298
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,680
Isn't she the one
who usually prepares my meals?

299
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,680
Well…

300
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,920
What? What is it?

301
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,440
Well, it's nothing.

302
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,720
She has some errands
to run with Ms. Monmeena,

303
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,400
so she asked us
to prepare your meal instead.

304
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,520
What kind of errands?

305
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,920
Aunt Bua, you scared me.
You were so quiet.

306
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Well, you turned around so suddenly
that you startled me too. I'm sorry.

307
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,240
Where is everyone?

308
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,560
They're working upstairs
in the dining area.

309
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,040
Ms. Nate asked me to give this to you.

310
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,840
<i>Meet me at the supermarket</i>
<i>later this morning.</i>

311
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,120
What kind of driving is this?

312
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,080
Are they trying to mess with me?

313
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,600
I lost her.

314
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,960
A premium lounge
targeting foreign customers,

315
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,160
featuring a high-end jazz bar

316
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,000
and an integrated theater.

317
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,320
The adjacent space
is connected to a hotel as well.

318
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,680
If this project succeeds,

319
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,920
the value will be enormous.

320
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,160
I already said so.
Once the announcement goes public,

321
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,400
people will be buzzing about it.

322
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,000
Turning it into a hub of vice like this…
Is that really a good idea?

323
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,280
Besides, the land acquisition
isn't even complete yet.

324
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Exactly.

325
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,080
Are you sure it will be completed
on schedule, as Mr. Met claims?

326
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,480
Otherwise, it'll be a huge embarrassment.

327
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,920
What would a daughter-in-law like you
know about management?

328
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,360
The moment the project is approved
and the land is ready,

329
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,760
the construction won't take long.

330
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,440
But what if the landowners refuse to sell?

331
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,960
They've already agreed
to sell the land for this project.

332
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,040
We just need to finalize the contract.

333
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,080
But wasn't our initial agreement
to acquire that land

334
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,240
for a new hospital?

335
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,200
So, is this even legal?

336
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,040
Mr. Yai, have you spoken
to the landowner about this?

337
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,280
I've already arranged a meeting
with Ms. Tasanee, the landowner.

338
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,120
Over the years,

339
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,920
I've never had issues
closing business deals.

340
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,800
But still, dealing in legitimate business
and gray businesses are different.

341
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,520
You may not be used to handling deals

342
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,720
without influence and power before.

343
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,960
It's a big project.

344
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,160
Rushing it might not be wise.

345
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,400
Parin.

346
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,520
That's going too far.

347
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,880
But didn't it take years of consideration
for our hospital project?

348
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,400
If we take a little more time,
I don't think it would hurt.

349
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,360
Perhaps we should wait
until the lands are ready

350
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,320
before meeting again?

351
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,080
Yes, that would also allow us to evaluate
the qualifications of the project leader.

352
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,120
What's with all these pointless meetings?

353
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,400
That sounds like a good idea.

354
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,520
Let's wait
until the land purchase is finalized.

355
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,720
Then, everyone will see
that I can lead H Group

356
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,360
with transparency.

357
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,080
And if you fail to acquire the land
or push the project forward?

358
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,720
If I can't even handle that,

359
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,320
then I won't involve myself
in H Group's business any further.

360
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,600
Restless, huh? Are you that scared of me?

361
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,200
What do I have to be scared of?

362
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,800
Everything I said today was the truth.

363
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,200
Or is it just because
I was born into the third household

364
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,960
that I have to bow to you in everything?

365
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,840
You're acting tough today.

366
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,600
Why?

367
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,120
You think you're close
to getting what you want now?

368
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,040
You think I don't know what you're up to,

369
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,200
both with the lounge

370
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,120
and the will?

371
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,360
What are you talking about?

372
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,160
You sent people to search for the will.

373
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,640
Why did you suddenly stop? Can't find it?

374
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,800
Go ahead and play your game.

375
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,720
Let's see who gets to the will first.

376
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,080
You think I can't beat you?

377
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,480
Just wait and see, Yai.

378
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,440
Someone like you…

379
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,120
No matter how many lifetimes you live

380
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,240
or how many times
you change your hairstyle,

381
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,239
you'll never beat me.

382
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,920
Yai!

383
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,920
<i>I can't let the child</i>
<i>of some nobody rise to power.</i>

384
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,120
<i>The assets of Hemaratsiri</i>
<i>belong only to Hemaratsiri blood.</i>

385
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,440
Tomorrow, I'll officially
appoint Lek as the new chairman.

386
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,400
I won't be a servant
to this family for the rest of my life.

387
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
A so-called outsider like me

388
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,240
will be the one to rule Hemaratsiri.

389
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,800
I called you here because there's
something I need to discuss with you.

390
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,000
Mom, you've always
remembered me, haven't you?

391
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,320
Mr. Yai wasn't lying to me.

392
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,360
Digging up the past won't help anyone.

393
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,320
We haven't seen each other in so long.

394
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,320
I didn't raise you. Please,

395
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,960
don't make things harder for both of us.

396
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,640
Why?

397
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,920
Because you love Mr. Pramet?
I don't see a single good thing about him.

398
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,240
Even if I explained, you wouldn't get it.

399
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,400
You can't explain,
or you just have nothing to say?

400
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,640
What's so good about him?

401
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,280
All he does is use violence. I don't see
a single redeeming quality in him.

402
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,720
Why did you leave me for him?
I don't understand.

403
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,640
Even if he's a bad person,
this is the life I chose.

404
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,080
And I have no regrets.

405
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,280
I'm happy with him.

406
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,920
You don't need to worry about me.

407
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,320
Just consider your real mother dead.

408
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,560
Leave this family now.

409
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,640
- Let go of me.
- You're standing right in front of me.

410
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,680
How can you say my real mother is dead?

411
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,840
I said she's dead, so she's dead.

412
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,280
- Let go!
- Mom… Mom…

413
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,520
- Mom…
- Let go of me.

414
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,520
Let go!

415
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,680
What is this?

416
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,480
Mom.

417
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,320
Don't call me mom.

418
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,120
And from now on, stay out of my life.

419
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,640
Mom… Mom…

420
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,200
What should I do?

421
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,760
Ms. Pa, are you heading home?

422
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,920
A jobless woman like me should go home
when there's nothing left to do.

423
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,360
Are you two heading to the hospital?

424
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,120
Yes, Mr. Mote has
a surgery scheduled this evening.

425
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,200
Our family is far better suited
for hospital expansion.

426
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,080
If they turn that lounge project
back into the original plan, it'd be good.

427
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,040
You really think so, Ms. Pa?

428
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,440
It's a shame

429
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,560
Mr. Met won't continue the plan.

430
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,960
Ms. Pa, please help talk to Parin

431
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,880
and the board.

432
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,360
Mr. Mote has put years of effort
into the hospital project.

433
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,480
Whatever Mr. Met decides, I'll follow.
I don't want any trouble.

434
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,480
I'll let everyone decide what's best.

435
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,640
Excuse me.

436
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,280
Excuse me.

437
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,320
Such a fake. He even lies to his own wife.

438
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,240
Hey.

439
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,920
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

440
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,360
Did I rip your skirt?

441
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,320
- What should I do?
- Let me help you.

442
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,200
Thank you so much for helping me.

443
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,680
Is everything okay?

444
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,080
It's nothing.
We just bumped into each other.

445
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,640
Angpao, have you apologized to her yet?

446
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,040
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you so careless? I'm so sorry.

447
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,080
It's okay, ma'am.

448
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,400
- I'm really sorry.
- It's alright.

449
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,120
Go play over there, okay?

450
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,880
Don't force yourself to walk.
It'll get worse.

451
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,160
Peerapon, before you pick me up,
can you stop by and buy a pair of pants?

452
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,560
Size S.

453
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,200
Waist 24. Hips probably no more than 34.

454
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,720
Any color is fine.
I'll send you the location. Thanks.

455
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,840
Why are you making that face?
Did I get your size wrong?

456
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,480
No, you got it right.
I just don't want to trouble you.

457
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,040
I can find something nearby myself.
It shouldn't be too hard.

458
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,520
And how are you going to return my suit?
It wouldn't be right to return it now.

459
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,920
How about this? You come with me first,
and we'll figure out the rest later.

460
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,280
- Okay?
- Fine.

461
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,000
Let's go.

462
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,800
You really got my size exactly right.

463
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,640
I buy clothes for my mom often,
so I picked up the skill.

464
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,800
Thank you so much.
As for the pants, I'll pay you back.

465
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,360
And I'll get your suit dry-cleaned
before I send it back.

466
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,720
Can I have your address?

467
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,120
How about my phone number instead?

468
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:20,840
It's just to return your suit. Wouldn't
that be inconvenient? I can just mail it.

469
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,760
Actually, I just moved here
from another city.

470
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,880
I don't have a fixed address yet.
I keep bouncing between hotels.

471
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,160
It'd be easier
if we just set a time to meet.

472
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,760
Really? I hope it's not too much trouble.

473
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,960
Not at all. It's no trouble at all.

474
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,000
Plus, I'd get to make a new friend.

475
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,640
I don't know many people here yet.

476
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,760
MAX

477
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,800
Alright then, we'll set up a time later.

478
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,720
Alright.

479
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,320
I'm Dylan, by the way.

480
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,280
My name is Dylan.

481
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,080
Oh, okay.

482
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,760
And you?

483
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,000
Meena. Monmeena.

484
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,360
Monmeena…

485
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,120
Nice to meet you.

486
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,360
Yeah, I should get going.

487
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,960
Alright.

488
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,200
I've been waiting for a while,
but Ms. Meena still hasn't come back.

489
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,800
If Mr. Yai finds out, I'm dead.

490
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,320
- She didn't tell you where she was going?
- No, not at all.

491
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,600
Ms. Monmeena, where have you been?

492
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,240
And where did that suit come from?

493
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,120
It's my friend's.
Nothing important. Let's go inside.

494
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,800
Yes, sir.

495
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,960
<i>I was beginning to think</i>

496
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,200
you'd never answer my call, Ou.

497
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,960
Did you really think ignoring my calls
would stop me from finding you?

498
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,520
Fine.

499
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,240
Maybe I should just
send my men to track you down

500
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,200
and put a bullet in your head.
How does that sound?

501
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,360
I'm sorry, sir. It's my fault.

502
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,920
You came to me with this offer, Ou.

503
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,000
You said you'd do this one last job,

504
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,120
and in return,
I'd let you walk away from this life.

505
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,400
So, why the hell haven't you delivered
the Hemaratsiri will yet?

506
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,600
Are you trying to play me?

507
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,800
No, sir. I'm not tricking you.

508
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,720
It's just it's not ready yet.
But I'll get it to you.

509
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,600
Trust me.

510
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,480
Trust you?

511
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,360
Listen to me, Ou.

512
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,520
If I don't get what I asked for,

513
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,440
you're going to suffer so much,
you'll be begging me to kill you.

514
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,920
Chairman Wang, please stop smoking.
It's not good for your treatment.

515
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,760
This will only make it harder
to manage your condition.

516
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,080
Doctor.

517
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,920
You talk like I just have a cold.

518
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,600
Lymphoma

519
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,800
doesn't just go away, Doctor.

520
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,160
If I weren't rich, I'd be dead by now.

521
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,520
So, just let me do what I want.

522
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,400
By the way, Doctor…

523
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,960
Postpone my next chemo session.

524
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,240
I'm not ready yet.

525
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,640
But what if it spreads?

526
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,600
I know my body well, Doctor.

527
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,080
I won't die that easily.

528
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,960
But if I do,

529
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,400
you're coming with me.

530
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,640
<i>Did you make it home safe?</i>

531
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,280
<i>If the jacket's a hassle, don't worry.</i>

532
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,560
<i>Just keep it.</i>

533
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,720
Stop right there, Ms. Monmeena.

534
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,120
Why are you eating instant noodles?

535
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,240
Stop it now.

536
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,000
Just tell me what you want,
and I'll make you something proper.

537
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,280
It's fine, Aunt Bua. This is easy.

538
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,480
No, no. Let me cook for you.

539
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,560
I'll make something for Mr. Yai, too.

540
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,720
All he does is drink at the club,

541
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,600
then comes home and eats nothing,

542
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,040
complaining about stomach pain.

543
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,600
I tell him to see a doctor,
but he never listens.

544
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,800
Come on. Let me take care of this.

545
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,200
- Aunt Bua.
- Yes?

546
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,680
What does Mr. Yai like to eat?
Can you teach me how to make it?

547
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,360
Ou is definitely scheming about the will.

548
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,440
He keeps trying
to get close to Ms. Monmeena.

549
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,480
Does he really think
he can just reach his daughter?

550
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,080
What should I tell the men to do, sir?

551
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,320
If he wants to see Monmeena so badly,

552
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,640
I'll take her to him myself.

553
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,280
I'll show him what happens
when you play dirty.

554
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,040
Just make sure our men are ready.

555
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,360
Understood.

556
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,880
But… don't you think
this will be too hard on Ms. Monmeena?

557
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,360
<i>Eat more food than you drink,</i>
<i>or your stomach will hurt.</i>

558
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,280
<i>Eat a little, sweetheart.</i>
<i>You need your strength.</i>

559
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,040
Didn't your father refuse
to let you eat anything today?

560
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,000
Why doesn't Dad love me?

561
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,800
Why doesn't he love us?

562
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,120
He never talks to me,

563
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:39,960
never plays with me.

564
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,320
He just beats me every day.

565
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,320
Why do you even care about him?

566
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,920
Don't forget that you have me,
and I love you more than anything.

567
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,560
I will always take care of you
and protect you forever.

568
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,080
Promise me you won't leave me, Mom.

569
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,800
Come on.

570
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,320
I promise. I will never leave you.

571
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,800
And whenever you cry,

572
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,080
I'll always make you
congee just like this.

573
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,440
Come on. Let's eat.

574
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,440
<i>It's all set, sir. Tomorrow morning,</i>
<i>the plan will go smoothly.</i>

575
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,960
You work out, Mr. Yai?

576
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,440
It helps with stress.

577
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,080
Oh,

578
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,680
and I told Aunt Bua to prepare breakfast.
Once you're ready, come eat with me.

579
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,960
Hurry up, or it'll get cold.

580
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,800
You want me to have
breakfast with just you?

581
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,560
Or are we meeting
some of your relatives again?

582
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,680
No.

583
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,880
You'll need the energy. You're meeting
an important business partner today.

584
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,320
Me? Why not take Ms. Triprapa
or someone else from your house?

585
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,040
Why are you taking me?

586
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,560
I don't even know anything about business.

587
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,360
Besides, I have plans today.
I promised a friend I'd return something.

588
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,440
What's that?

589
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,880
- A men's suit?
- Yes.

590
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,120
Whose is it?

591
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,760
A friend's. I'm returning it today.

592
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,320
Low-quality stitching.

593
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,240
Not worth wearing. You have plenty
of suits at home. Why borrow one?

594
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,240
Come on, Mr. Yai.

595
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,520
It was an emergency,
and my friend helped me out.

596
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,560
Either way, you're coming with me today.

597
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,240
Dress properly,
something worthy of our family name.

598
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,840
Excuse me? "Worthy of our family name"?
Watch your words.

599
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,080
If you're in such a rush,
have Max return it for you.

600
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,480
What was that men's suit Monmeena had?

601
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,640
Whose is it?

602
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,000
I'm not entirely sure, sir.

603
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,600
She said it belonged to a friend.

604
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,120
A friend?

605
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,800
I told you to watch her at all times.

606
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,920
You seriously don't know who he is?

607
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:06,360
I was too busy keeping Ms. Triprapa away.

608
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,520
So, I lost track of her for a bit, sir.

609
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,360
One woman, and you can't even handle it?

610
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,120
How do you expect me
to trust you with bigger jobs?

611
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,520
Should I replace you?

612
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,560
It won't happen again, sir.

613
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,960
I'll keep a closer eye on Ms. Monmeena.
I know you care about her a lot.

614
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,520
What?

615
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,480
Who said I care about her?

616
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,560
Don't talk nonsense.

617
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,240
Did I say something wrong?

618
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,400
Clearly, Mr. Yai is both worried
and possessive over Ms. Monmeena.

619
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,760
Why is he mad at me
for stating the obvious?

620
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,800
What you understand isn't wrong.

621
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,760
Then what did I say wrong?

622
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,520
Your mistake
was saying it out loud, idiot.

623
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,520
Move.

624
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,520
Wait for me.

625
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,280
Mr. Yai.

626
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,320
I really don't think
I can pull this look off.

627
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,560
Maybe you should just go without me.

628
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,000
Wait.

629
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,880
This is…

630
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,000
fine.

631
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,720
Do I really have to meet
your business partner?

632
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,720
This whole lie is getting out of hand,
don't you think?

633
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,880
You keep dragging me into these events,

634
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,600
and if people actually
start believing this nonsense,

635
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,840
what happens when I leave your family?

636
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,840
Stop overthinking.
Get in the car. I'm driving today.

637
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,640
Thank you.

638
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,280
What's wrong?

639
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,800
I left my phone in the car.
Go grab it for me.

640
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,400
- I need to meet our partner first.
- Alright.

641
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,400
Meena!

642
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,360
<i>Enough stalling.</i>
<i>If you don't bring me the will soon,</i>

643
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,240
<i>your daughter</i>
<i>might not be so lucky next time.</i>

644
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,320
Meena.

645
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,120
What's wrong? You look pale.

646
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,280
Do you need to go to hospital?
If you feel bad, we should go.

647
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,080
I'm fine.

648
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,840
Business is more important.
I was just shocked.

649
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,960
- I just need a moment to calm down.
- Don't say anything.

650
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,760
There's no place
in this world for the weak.

651
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,920
If you don't step over others,

652
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
you'll be the one crushed beneath them.

653
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:44,360
You knew Dad was going
to give me everything, so you killed him.

654
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,160
If anyone wanted him dead, it was you!

655
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,320
Bastard!

656
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,200
<i>Love doesn't matter.</i>

657
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,960
What matters is the will.

658
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,320
Find him. Kill him.

659
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,520
<i>And bring me the Hemaratsiri will.</i>

660
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,160
Who's stopping you from exchanging
the will for your daughter?

661
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,320
You don't want to know.
You wouldn't be able to handle the truth.

662
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,720
<i>Big figures in this family</i>
<i>are about to fall.</i>

663
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,040
And that could mean dead.

664
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,880
Has your fortune teller
checked your future yet?

665
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,320
