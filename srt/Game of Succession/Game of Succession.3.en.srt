1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,400
People might even suspect
that someone in this very family

2
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,680
killed Dad.

3
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,920
And so what?

4
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,240
Everyone sitting here
has the potential to be the murderer.

5
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,040
<i>Let's wait until the rain dies down.</i>

6
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,800
<i>Come inside and wait.</i>

7
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,160
Are you inviting me into your house?

8
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,080
Move into the Hemaratsiri house,

9
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,360
as my fiancée.

10
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,640
You can't just bring some nobody
into this house, Yai.

11
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,200
I'm only doing what you did, Dad.

12
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,520
I'm Monmeena, Nate's daughter.

13
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,920
<i>Who knows?</i>

14
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,240
<i>Maybe they're hiding secrets from you.</i>

15
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,160
- Like what?
- Like having had a child before.

16
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,320
His name is Ou, leader of a gang
involved in shady business.

17
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,320
Then we need to lure him out
and take care of him.

18
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,840
But what if Ms. Monmeena finds out?

19
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,120
<i>Everyone in this house</i>
<i>is a wolf in sheep's clothing.</i>

20
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,080
Except me.
Because if I were to kill someone,

21
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,880
I'd never let it become a scandal.

22
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,440
This is the bedroom.
You'll be staying here.

23
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,480
I'm staying here?
Then, where are you staying?

24
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,360
This is my room.
Obviously, I'm staying here.

25
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,400
Are you crazy? No way.
I'm not sleeping with you.

26
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,840
You're staying in my room.

27
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,160
I can guarantee your safety.

28
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,680
But if we sleep in separate rooms,

29
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,880
if something happens to you
in your sleep, I won't know.

30
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,200
I see. With that kind of threat,
I guess I have no choice.

31
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,160
But remember. We're just roommates.

32
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,960
Wait. Where's my stuff?
Where's my luggage?

33
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,160
All of this…

34
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,680
is mine?

35
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,640
I wasn't sure what you liked,
so I bought everything.

36
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,480
These designer brands…

37
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,280
Are they even suitable for me?

38
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,760
You're my fiancée now.

39
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,800
Your appearance reflects mine,
so everything has to be the best.

40
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,960
No more old, shabby clothes.

41
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,680
Do you know how to drive?

42
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,240
If you need to go anywhere, use this.

43
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,240
I can't accept this. It's too much.

44
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,400
I'm not giving it to you permanently.

45
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,360
I'm lending it to you as my fiancée.

46
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,360
You need to keep up appearances. Take it.

47
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,640
I get it.

48
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
But there won't be
any issues later, right?

49
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,560
If I wreck these things,

50
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,400
I can't afford to pay for them.

51
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,840
Don't worry about that.

52
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,440
The one thing I have more
than enough of in this world is money.

53
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,640
Now, there are two rules for living here.

54
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,800
Rule number one.
Don't touch each other's things.

55
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,800
I won't touch your things, and you,

56
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,400
don't touch my personal belongings.

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,640
- And rule number two?
- Rule number two, the most important one.

58
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,680
Act like you don't exist.

59
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,720
Stay out of my business.

60
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,080
Fine.

61
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,680
It's not like I want to be
involved with you anyway.

62
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,800
That's good.

63
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,160
Wait, where are you going?

64
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,600
Rule two.

65
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,760
Got it. I'm invisible.

66
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,080
So strict.

67
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,080
He's acting like a school disciplinarian.

68
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,920
<i>Meena, where are you?</i>
<i>Call me back. I'm worried.</i>

69
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,960
You? Sleeping with a scented candle?

70
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,760
Doesn't that make
the atmosphere a little weird?

71
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,080
It's called incense.

72
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,640
You'll have to deal with it.

73
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,640
The scent helps me sleep
without needing medication.

74
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,280
I see. Someone like you

75
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,760
must be under a lot of stress.

76
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,560
What are you doing?

77
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,960
Going to sleep, obviously.

78
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,800
Sleep on the floor.

79
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,880
What?

80
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,720
Just because we share a room
doesn't mean we share a bed.

81
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,320
I'm a clean freak.
I don't like sharing my bed with anyone.

82
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,160
Fine.

83
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,760
Hey.

84
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,000
You said you light it just for the scent.

85
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,240
I don't like sleeping with bright lights.

86
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,200
They keep me awake.

87
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,760
Sweet dreams, Mr. Mekhin.

88
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,720
Good morning.

89
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,360
It's nice to have a new face in the house.

90
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,760
And you look lovely.

91
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,360
Come, join us for breakfast.

92
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,799
Dirt will always be dirt.

93
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,159
No matter how much you try,
it'll never be a star.

94
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,040
You reek of someone lucky
to marry into wealth.

95
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,760
Are you going to stand there
towering over me?

96
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,560
Or do I need to pull out
your chair for you? Huh?

97
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,440
No need. I can manage just fine.
Wouldn't want to trouble you, Father.

98
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,760
That's Yai's seat. Sit somewhere else.

99
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
I'm Mr. Yai's fiancée.

100
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,960
Sitting next to him should be fine, right?

101
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,280
Sorry we're late, everyone.

102
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,160
There was so much to handle

103
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,640
with the Heaven Age launch event.

104
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,120
It's today, right, Parin?

105
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,640
Congratulations.

106
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,880
But your aunt and I won't be attending.
We have a surgery case.

107
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,800
I heard you invited a lot of guests.

108
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,720
The hospital board was talking about it.

109
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,720
I invited all my contacts from H Group.

110
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,080
This is a big project.

111
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,760
I want everyone to see how successful

112
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,880
our family is.

113
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,320
What nonsense are you talking about?

114
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,720
You talk like it's your own work.
This project only succeeded

115
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,520
because of Yai, didn't it?

116
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,760
That's not true.

117
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,400
This was Lek's project from the start.

118
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,240
Of course, he deserves the credit.

119
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,360
One project, yet you leech off
the family's shared funds?

120
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,960
Try using a little less.

121
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,720
Dad just passed away, but you're
already draining the family finances.

122
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,000
Who exactly are you accusing, Mr. Met?
Yourself, perhaps?

123
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,880
Don't think I don't know
where that money is going.

124
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,840
Botox, spa treatments,

125
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,160
bribing the media,

126
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,560
paying investors to back your useless son,

127
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,360
so he can steal someone else's position.

128
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,760
And what about your new car?

129
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,320
That's family money too, isn't it?

130
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm the head of this family.
I deserve a nice car.

131
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,800
You expect me to drive
some cheap junk like you do?

132
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,960
Brother.

133
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,080
That's enough.

134
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,000
This is a family meal.

135
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,720
Can't you keep it civil?

136
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,840
And you, stop pretending
to be neutral, Mote.

137
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,160
You're here just for your own gain, right?

138
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,640
Met.

139
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,520
Fine.

140
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,480
As the head of this house,

141
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,400
I'll make things easier for all of you.

142
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,720
From now on,

143
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,520
eat whatever, wherever you want.

144
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,320
Eat whenever you want.

145
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,280
No more forced family meals.

146
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,600
This is getting ridiculous.

147
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,800
Be sane for once.

148
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,880
- What's your problem?
- Mote.

149
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,720
Huh.

150
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,160
Meh.

151
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,800
Looking at you all makes me sick.

152
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,760
Aunt Bua, clean up.

153
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,360
Looks like no one
has the appetite to eat anymore.

154
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,480
Yes, ma'am.

155
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,600
Do all billionaires
have to be this dysfunctional?

156
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,120
Another fight.

157
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,680
Why are they always mad at one another?

158
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,200
Ever since Mr. Preeda passed,

159
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,200
it's been non-stop.

160
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,400
Right. This whole house is going insane.

161
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,600
Hey.

162
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,640
If you're done with the plates,
finish the kitchen work.

163
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,720
There's a lot to do. Stop gossiping.

164
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,280
Yes, ma'am.

165
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Miss Monmeena,

166
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,880
do you need something?

167
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,520
Does Ms. Nate,

168
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,680
Mr. Pramet's wife,
never come to the dining room?

169
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,960
I haven't seen her.

170
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,680
I just moved in here,

171
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,600
so I wanted to get to know everyone.

172
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,160
She usually doesn't
come down to see anyone.

173
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,000
She mostly stays on Mr. Pramet's floor.

174
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,120
The sixth floor?

175
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,760
Yes.

176
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,040
But don't go near there.

177
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,720
He's extremely possessive,

178
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,640
especially about Ms. Nate.
You can't talk to her.

179
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,240
Why not?

180
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,080
Before this, the maid
assigned to Mr. Pramet's floor

181
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,200
was recently fired

182
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,920
because she got too close to Ms. Nate.

183
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Mr. Pramet forbids her from everything.

184
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
What does he forbid?

185
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,000
She's not allowed to have friends.

186
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Not allowed to leave the house.

187
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,680
Not allowed to contact anyone.

188
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,080
Not allowed to get close to anyone.

189
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,120
Not allowed.

190
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,000
Poor thing.

191
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,440
She's living in her house,
but it's like she's trapped in a prison.

192
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,240
If only you worked
as hard as you gossiped.

193
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,320
Go!

194
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,760
Ms. Monmeena,

195
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,040
there's no need to worry.

196
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,720
Mr. Mekhin openly acknowledges you.

197
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,960
You'll never have to deal
with anything like that.

198
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,840
I suppose you're right.

199
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,400
- But--
- Shut it!

200
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,240
Both of you will deal with me
at the end of the month.

201
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,880
- Let's work.
- Yeah.

202
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,520
Every floor has a password lock?

203
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,880
Then, what am I supposed to do?

204
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,760
How can I get to my mother?

205
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,560
Ms. Apapat.

206
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,400
- Jum.
- Yes, ma'am.

207
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,880
Tonight, you'll be attending
the launch event with me,

208
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,920
as Mr. Yai's fiancée.

209
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,640
What?

210
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,440
But Mr. Yai didn't say anything
about me going to an event.

211
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,320
It's the duty of everyone in this family.

212
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,440
Not taking responsibility for anything?

213
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,800
Please shed your old skin
and become a refined lady of high society.

214
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,200
Don't bring shame to the family.

215
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,920
Parin,

216
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,160
what's wrong with you?

217
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,280
Today is important. Stay calm.

218
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,920
You can't lose your temper.

219
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,720
How can I stay calm?

220
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,600
Grandpa just died,

221
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,400
and Yai already acts like
he owns everything.

222
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,440
His father, too.

223
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,800
Now they control everything.

224
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,720
The old board members listen to them,

225
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,840
even though this project is mine.

226
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,800
And they won't stop interfering!

227
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,120
Have you forgotten what I promised you?

228
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,560
That you'll make me head of Hemaratsiri,

229
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,120
and everyone in this house will bow to me.

230
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,560
Exactly.

231
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,560
So, don't worry.

232
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,680
I have a way to bring Yai down.

233
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,680
Today,

234
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,600
just focus on doing your part.

235
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,280
Understood?

236
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,960
Heaven Age will include a medical center,

237
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,680
shopping mall, entertainment district,

238
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,480
public parks,

239
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,319
schools, and universities.

240
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,040
I hope all of you
will support this project.

241
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,280
Thanks, Mom.

242
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,520
How are you holding up?

243
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,720
Tired.

244
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
They asked a lot of questions.

245
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,320
I've been repeating the same pitch
so many times.

246
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,080
Even if you have to say it
a thousand times, do it.

247
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,520
Everyone must know
this project was your idea.

248
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
No one else should take the credit.

249
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
Understood.

250
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,360
Mom,

251
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,600
why did you bring Yai's fiancée here?

252
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Look at her. She's getting swarmed
by those old board members.

253
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,640
The more spotlight she gets, the better.

254
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,800
You're absolutely gorgeous,
perfect for Mr. Mekhin.

255
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,560
Are you Mr. Mekhin's fiancée?

256
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,040
Well…

257
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,160
I happened to be there
when he was ambushed.

258
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,640
I stepped in to help him.

259
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,840
Why don't you tell them the truth?

260
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,760
That you slept your way to the top.

261
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,760
So, you finally landed a billionaire?

262
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,000
Got yourself engaged to a tycoon?

263
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,680
Before,

264
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,160
you were a leech who drained me dry.

265
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,800
Are you Ms. Meena's ex?

266
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,360
Ex?

267
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,240
More like a kept woman.

268
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
This woman

269
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,280
used to be a nightclub singer

270
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,440
who scammed men for money.

271
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,720
I bet that designer outfit

272
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,000
was paid for by your new "daddy".

273
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,920
Were you a sugar baby?

274
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Does Mr. Mekhin know about this?

275
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,160
Everyone, please…

276
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,800
Please calm down.

277
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,800
This is a private matter
between Monmeena and Mekhin.

278
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,880
Ms. Apapat, did you know about this?

279
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,280
Well…

280
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,960
I don't want to say too much.

281
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,520
As elders, we can only watch
and hope for the best.

282
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,560
Especially since Mekhin
handles the family funds.

283
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,720
If he's being deceived--

284
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,440
Yes, I worked in a nightclub,

285
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,800
but only as a singer.

286
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,040
I was never anyone's sugar baby,
nor did I scam anyone.

287
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
And I don't even know this man.

288
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,880
How can you say that?

289
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,720
Don't put your filthy hands on my woman.

290
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,360
Mekhin…

291
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,280
Yes, Monmeena was a singer at my club.

292
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,360
But she also saved my life
when I was attacked.

293
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,400
Without her, I wouldn't be here today.

294
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,240
So, show her some respect.

295
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,720
And I can assure you,

296
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,240
Meena has never been involved
with anyone before me.

297
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,920
So, to anyone spreading false claims

298
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,160
or rumors, I won't let it slide.

299
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,240
What about the claims that you're using
family funds to spoil your fiancée?

300
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,680
That's completely untrue.

301
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,440
Every baht I've spent is my own money,
not the family's money.

302
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,400
But you're the eldest grandson of H Group.

303
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,400
Will your family accept this engagement?

304
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,960
These days, no one judges people
based on their background.

305
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,800
Actions speak louder than bloodline.

306
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,880
And Meena has always been kind to me,
taken care of me,

307
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,000
and is the only woman
I've ever wanted to marry.

308
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,800
Oh.

309
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,480
So,

310
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,600
if there's a sudden wedding,
don't be too surprised.

311
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,040
<i>Breaking news to the business world.</i>

312
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,880
<i>Mr. Mekhin Hemaratsiri</i>

313
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960

<i>Ms. Monmeena Areerat.</i>

315
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,360
Marriage?

316
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,600
Meena is marrying Mr. Mekhin?

317
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,080
Still unreachable.

318
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,840
Is this real, Ti?

319
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,480
Meena never told me anything.

320
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,720
So, that means…

321
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,240
she disappeared from our home

322
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,960
to be in the Hemaratsiri family?

323
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,800
This morning, you bring some
random woman into the house.

324
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,440
By evening, you're announcing
to the whole country

325
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,400
that you're marrying
a damn nightclub singer?

326
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,600
Have you no shame for our father's legacy?

327
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,120
Mr. Met, would you like
to have dinner now?

328
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,080
Are you insane? I'm this stressed,
and you expect me to eat?

329
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,040
Damn it…

330
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,400

00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,120
You have to let me go.

00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,400
Hey!

339
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,520
I asked you a short question.
No long answers needed.

MEKHIN HEMARATSIRI ANNOUNCES HIS MARRIAGE

348
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,480
Meena…

349
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,720
Mekhin…

350
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,840
I should be the one thanking you, sir,
for clearing the way for our club.

351
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
Yai!

352
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,040
Yes, sir.

353
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,480
I would love to personally
host you at H Club sometime.

354
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,680
Let me return the favor.

355
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,840
Yes. Thank you.

356
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,520
What do you want?

357
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,360
More money?

358
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,080
Just go anywhere you want.

359
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,760
I didn't come here just for money.

360
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,440
I came to confront you.

361
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,040
What were you thinking,
bringing her to the event?

362
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,360
Are you not ashamed?

363
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,520
The board members
found out the singer's background

364
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,600
and won't stop calling me.

365
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,720
They're worried you're blowing

366
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,000
the family's money on her.

367
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,960
What will they do about it?

368
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,440
If the board loses trust in you,

369
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,040
they'll turn to Parin and his mother.

370
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,640
Do you want me to lose my seat
as chairman to that brat?

371
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,920
So, you're afraid…

372
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,840
of losing the position.

373
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,560
You don't need
to lecture me about business.

374
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,160
Go home and cuddle with your mistress.

375
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,480
Watch your mouth, Yai!

376
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,960
Who the hell do you think you are?

377
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,760
You think you're better than me?

378
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,080
You're just like that Mei, your mother.

379
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,000
You must've inherited more
of your mom's blood than your dad's.

380
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,320
Always looking down on people,
always mocking everyone. Disgusting.

381
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,680
I'll say this one last time.

382
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,200
A greedy, cowardly man like you

383
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,160
has no right to speak about my mother.

384
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,920
We'll see…

385
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,640
if I can do more
than what you think I can.

386
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,760
Get out.

387
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,440
How the hell did you turn out
so stupid, Met?

388
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,360
Do you even have a brain in there?

389
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,320
Well? Do you?

390
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,720
I'm sorry, Dad.

391
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,240
You kept asking for more tuition money.

392
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,400
More cars.

393
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,880
More condos.

394
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,440
I gave you everything.

395
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,440
And yet these are the grades you bring me?

396
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,640
Dad, I really tried.

397
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,280
I want to study music,

398
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,880
but not this business degree.

399
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,880
Music?

400
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,200
Can a starving musician

401
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,840
run a family business?

402
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,440
Can you?

403
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,400
Dad! Enough!

404
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,200
You are the eldest son of this family.

405
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,120
How can you be this useless?

406
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,160
Even your younger brothers
are better than you.

407
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,520
What do you even bring to this family?

408
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,000
Mark my words. I'll give everything

409
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,360
to Mote and Nont.

410
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,600
If you keep being this worthless,

411
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,920
don't expect to get a damn thing.

412
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,840
Remember this.

413
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,800
There is no place
in the Hemaratsiri family for failures.

414
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,840
If you have to break yourself to improve,

415
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,920
then so be it!

416
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,480
How the hell

417
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,960
did you let the construction company
lose tens of millions?

418
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,680
I'm sorry, Dad.

419
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,320
Look at Mote.

420
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
He has never caused me any trouble.

421
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,640
All he does is expand
our business and make it prosper.

422
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,960
You're a black sheep

423
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,560
and a disgrace to this family.

424
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,000
Apart from bearing your blood,

425
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,480
I'm not useful to you at all?

426
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,480
I've never done anything right
in your eyes?

427
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,880
If so, then why didn't you make Mote
run the family from the start?

428
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,640
Why force me into this?

429
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,680
Met!

430
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,600
Don't think for a second
that I won't do that.

431
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,400
Wait and see. One of your brothers
will step over you to take your place.

432
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,720
Let's go.

433
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,200
Brother…

434
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Dad said that out of anger.

435
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,520
Don't take it to heart.

436
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,280
He still loves you the most.

437
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,400
Mind your own damn business, Nont.

438
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,040
Just get out of my sight.

439
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,720
Mr. Nont, let's go.

440
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,440
Let's go.

441
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,640
Damn it!

442
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,320
Please, Mr. Met, calm down.

443
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,680
Stay the hell out of my business.

444
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,640
I just want to clean your wound.

445
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,480
- Come on.
- Leave me alone!

446
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,600
‪Hey!

447
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,640
- You!
- Son!

448
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,640
- No! Don't do it!
- What's your problem?

449
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,120
- What the hell?!
- Stop!

450
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
You can hurt me all you want,

451
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,920
but don't lay a hand on my son.

452
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,000
A coward like you
only knows how to hurt me and Mom.

453
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,960
Mark my words,
when I take over this family,

454
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,480
I'll make sure you have no place in it.

455
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,040
Oh yeah?

456
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,440
- Is that what you think?
- Stop!

457
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
You think you can bring me down, huh?

458
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,920
Yai!

459
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,000
Fine!

460
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,720
If this family refuses to see my worth,

461
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,360
I won't do anything to anyone anymore.

462
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,960
I'll be the black sheep of the family.

463
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,680
Monmeena.

464
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,360
Monmeena?

465
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,920
Let me take it.

466
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,080
Ms. Monmeena.

467
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,480
Ms. Monmeena, wait.

468
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,600
Let me take that to Ms. Nate instead.

469
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,000
It's fine. I've come all the way up here.

470
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,800
But…

471
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,720
But if Mr. Pramet finds out…

472
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,760
Didn't you say

473
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,520
he went drinking
and won't be home tonight?

474
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,680
That's true, but…

475
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,360
I'm just bringing tea to Ms. Nate.

476
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,480
Let's bring it to her
and leave immediately.

477
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,960
- Let's go.
- Yes.

478
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,240
What are you doing here?

479
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,720
I asked what you're doing here.

480
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,680
I just wanted to introduce myself
to Mr. Pramet and Ms. Nate.

481
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,800
Now that I'm part of this family,

482
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,120
I thought it'd be nice to bring them tea.

483
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,400
You claim you came to see the homeowners,

484
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,400
yet you were creeping around like a thief.

485
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,320
A little suspicious, don't you think?

486
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,440
Don't lie to me.
What were you actually looking for?

487
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,400
I was looking for someone, obviously.
I don't know where everybody's gone.

488
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,600
What are you doing here?

489
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,880
This is my house.

490
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,920
You, on the other hand,
are just a parasite.

491
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,240
Why can't I talk to my father?

492
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,080
If you're looking for Mr. Met,

493
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,560
he has business tonight. He won't be home.

494
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,040
You should leave.

495
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,320
Wait.

496
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,360
But I haven't even spoken with you.

497
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,560
Going back now is--

498
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,160
Ms. Tri, you should head back.

499
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,000
If Mr. Met returns,
I'll tell the maid to inform you.

500
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,600
As for you,

501
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,840
Mr. Met does not allow others
to wander around this floor.

502
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,080
If you have anything to discuss,
do it at the dining table next time.

503
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,040
Please.

504
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
So, what were you really doing
on my father's floor?

505
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,640
I already told you.

506
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,400
I just wanted to visit
Ms. Nate and Mr. Pramet.

507
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,760
If that's the case,
why not just call for them?

508
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,400
I saw you sneaking around,

509
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,920
acting suspicious.

510
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,360
What do you really want from this family?

511
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,200
Ms. Tri,

512
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,880
I already explained.
I just wanted to meet them.

513
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,040
Stop lying to me.

514
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,040
What were you trying to steal?

515
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,320
I didn't lie, Ms. Tri.

516
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
Then why don't you tell me the truth?

517
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,320
What's going on here?

518
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Well…

519
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,000
I saw her sneaking around suspiciously,

520
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,280
so I tried to find out what she was doing.

521
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,280
I just wanted to get to know

522
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,920
your father and gain his approval,

523
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,800
but Ms. Triprapa keeps misjudging me.

524
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,960
Hey.

525
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,600
You don't need to bother.

526
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,960
You've already seen
what my relationship with him is like.

527
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,600
Trying to win his favor
is a waste of time.

528
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,960
It was my mistake.

529
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,520
You warned me, but I didn't listen.

530
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,080
I'm sorry.

531
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,280
Anything else, Tri?
If not, I'll take Meena to the room.

532
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,719
Alright.

533
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,600
Mr. Yai.

534
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,720
I think something is wrong
with my mother's situation.

535
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,160
What the hell were you thinking,
going up there alone?

536
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,640
What if you had run into Pramet?

537
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,960
I just wanted to see my mom.

538
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,000
I asked for your help, and you ignored me.

539
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,880
If you keep acting recklessly like this,

540
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,280
forget the six-month contract.

541
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,760
I'll kick you out in the morning.

542
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,200
I was just worried about my mother.

543
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,240
Worry about yourself first.

544
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,160
If this plan falls apart,

545
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,480
don't even dream
of seeing your mother again.

546
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,560
Mr. Yai!

547
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,040
That arrogant, power-hungry man.

548
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,080
Don't ever think
I'll be nice to you again.

549
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,240
If you ever get shot,
I won't lift a finger to help you!

550
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,840
This guy…

551
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,040
One moment, he's a pain,
the next, he's acting all caring.

552
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,720
Is he possessed or something?

553
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,440
OPEN 24 HOURS
HEAVEN HOSPITAL, READY TO SERVE

554
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,240
Heaven Hospital

555
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,720
is on track to become
an all-inclusive wellness center.

556
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,840
We plan to provide services
in four languages,

557
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,720
Thai, Chinese, English, and Arabic,

558
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,440
to cater to international patients.

559
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,880
And that's not all.

560
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,720
We will also have
a specialized cancer center,

561
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,680
a heart center,

562
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,080
and a long-term VVIP patient ward.

563
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,760
But that location is in the city center.

564
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,960
I'm afraid the investment required
must be enormous.

565
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,400
That won't be a concern.

566
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,920
The budget is not as high as expected

567
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,600
because nearly half of the land

568
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,640
already belongs to the Hemaratsiri family.

569
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,280
If everyone agrees,
I will proceed with the next steps.

570
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,480
Mote.

571
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,480
Met?

572
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,280
So, you're using family land
to build a hospital without my knowledge?

573
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,480
Don't you think that's a bit much?

574
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,600
I proposed this project to Dad
back when he was still here.

575
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,840
And he approved it himself.

576
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,600
Well, as luck would have it,

577
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,120
I, the new chairman,
have just canceled it.

578
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Met.

579
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,920
Be reasonable.

580
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,000
This has been in motion for a long time.

581
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,720
Everything is already set in place.

582
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,680
Preparations are one thing,

583
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,240
but no money has been invested yet.

584
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,680
I've decided. This land will be repurposed

585
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,960
for a premium cocktail lounge.

586
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,080
That's a much better fit
than your hospital.

587
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,080
You're shutting down a hospital project

588
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,720
for a cocktail lounge?

589
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,120
Think about it.

590
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,520
To gain public trust,

591
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,640
a hospital requires years
of PR, marketing,

592
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,560
recruiting doctors and nurses,

593
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,640
and hundreds of millions
in medical equipment costs.

594
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,760
Just training staff alone

595
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,960
will cost a fortune.

596
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,600
But with my lounge,

597
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,480
we won't even need to recruit drink staff.

598
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,680
We just spread the word

599
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,000
that we pay more per drink
than other places,

600
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,040
and they will come flocking.

601
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,720
And we don't have to think much.

602
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,720
Just book some celebrity performances
to draw people in.

603
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,840
Our lounge

604
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,880
will become the networking hub
for business tycoons,

605
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,520
politicians,

606
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,000
the police, the military, and traders.

607
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,640
Easy money.

608
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,200
See?

609
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,920
Why would we invest a lot
and gain just a little?

610
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,280
Mr. Met.

611
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,000
- Perhaps we should discuss--
- What? Yai?

612
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,840
What the hell?

613
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,440
My apologies that Mr. Pramet

614
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,440
interrupted your meeting.

615
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,400
Actually, the lounge project

616
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,920
has been under discussion
within the family for quite some time.

617
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,800
We've gathered substantial data

618
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,920
supporting the idea of converting
the hospital project into a lounge.

619
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,880
Most importantly, Mr. Pramet

620
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,240
and the Hemaratsiri family

621
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,120
will guarantee the success of this plan

622
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,760
by appointing me as the lead executive

623
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,920
in charge of all major projects.

624
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,720
- Yai--
- And as for Mr. Pramet,

625
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,840
who lacks any relevant experience,

626
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,240
he will not interfere
in any executive matters.

627
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,240
His outburst earlier

628
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,600
was merely a moment of excitement.

629
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,560
Right, Dad?

630
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,600
- Brother…
- What now?

631
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,000
Drop the lounge project.

632
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,680
Money isn't everything.

633
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,880
A hospital benefits people and society

634
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,400
far more than a bar.

635
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,920
Hey,

636
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,400
stop pretending to be a saint.

637
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,400
It makes me sick.

638
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,080
Dad may have called me stupid,

639
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,600
but I'm not blind.

640
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,040
And you and your wife…

641
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,240
Stop using family money
to buy your social status.

642
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,440
What is it?

643
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,440
You crave admiration?

644
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,400
Want people to bow to you

645
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,960
because you're nothing but the middle son,

646
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,240
smart but invisible at home?

647
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,640
- Enough!
- What?

648
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,480
You still don't get it, do you?

649
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,360
Dad only used you to put me down.

650
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,880
That's it.

651
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,600
If he wanted you to run the business,
he would've handed it to you long ago,

652
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,000
before Parin and Yai even got involved.

653
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,840
Shut that filthy mouth!

654
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,040
Stop it, both of you! That's enough!

655
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,120
Mr. Met,
let's take this conversation home.

656
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,480
Pathetic fools.

657
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,640
Mote…

658
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,440
And you? What the hell do you want?

659
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,800
This project is mine.

660
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,560
You're the one exploiting my name
for your shady deals.

661
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,600
Stop it now,

662
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,120
or I'll personally strip you
of your acting chairman position.

663
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
Yai!

664
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,880
You ungrateful bastard!

665
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,480
Did you know our family
was supposed to build a new hospital

666
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,120
on our Sukhumvit land?

667
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,400
Why? What happened?

668
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,720
Pramet scrapped the project.
He's building a cocktail lounge instead.

669
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,160
And he's already bragging
that he's got investors lined up.

670
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,120
I heard everyone
in the meeting was stunned.

671
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,840
But that land was Grandpa's, wasn't it?

672
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,240
What's Uncle Met playing at,
stirring up chaos like this?

673
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,120
Let him do whatever he wants.

674
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,880
Anyway,

675
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,320
a lounge suits a lowlife

676
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,680
like him better.

677
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,800
The more those two families
tear each other apart,

678
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,960
the better for us to shine.

679
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,400
We need to take this chance
and make a move.

680
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,720
I've already set things in motion.

681
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,000
Now, we just wait for the good news.

682
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,640
How's the search going?

683
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,560
There's still no solid lead

684
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,120
on Attorney Pornchai or the will.

685
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,800
But I'm sure

686
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,480
someone besides Officer Charan,

687
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,920
who's trying to solve your Grandpa's case,

688
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,040
is after them as well.

689
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,600
Hurry up, then.

690
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,400
I need to find him before anyone else,

691
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,240
especially Yai.

692
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,480
We'll find the will before Yai does.

693
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,560
Mr. Yai.

694
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,960
Where are you taking me?

695
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,360
You woke me up at dawn, dragged me out,

696
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,880
and still won't tell me anything.

697
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,920
You'll know when we get there.

698
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,360
What? Got too much to do at home?

699
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,400
Or were you planning
to sneak around your real mother?

700
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,720
She didn't seem too eager to talk to you.

701
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,600
Don't start with me.

702
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,320
If you keep talking nonsense,
I'll just go back to sleep now.

703
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,920
Don't be stubborn. Just come with me.

704
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,840
I promise it's all part of your duties
as my fake fiancée.

705
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,640
Please.

706
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,360
It's an honor
to have you here, Mr. Mekhin.

707
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,040
Of course, I have to choose
the best for my fiancée.

708
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,880
I'll need your help.

709
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,440
I'd like her to be
the most beautiful bride.

710
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,640
- Mr. Yai, it's not funny.
- And…

711
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,880
she's not good at picking outfits.

712
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,720
Please assist her.

713
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,960
Money isn't an issue.

714
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,960
Absolutely.

715
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,760
Please wait a moment
while we prepare the fitting room.

716
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,600
Mr. Yai.

717
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,640
Are you insane?

718
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,480
Dragging me here
for a wedding dress fitting?

719
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,680
You said we're only fake-engaged.
What's the point of this?

720
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,760
To make it look real.

721
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,840
I already told my family
we're getting married.

722
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,080
If we don't go through the motions,
they'll see right through it.

723
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,440
This isn't making it look real.

724
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,000
It's overacting.

725
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,040
You can't just play around
with a wedding dress and a woman.

726
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,640
You think it'll jinx you?

727
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,160
What's wrong?

728
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,240
Afraid you'll never get married for real?

729
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,040
What year is this now?

730
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,480
Looks like you want to try one on.

731
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,960
The fitting room is ready.
Shall we proceed?

732
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,320
Let's go.

733
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,240
Alright.

734
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,520
This way, please.

735
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,560
Right here.

736
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,200
Not bad. You look like a real bride.

737
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,600
And I look like a real groom too, don't I?

738
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,760
Dressed like that, you obviously do.

739
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,080
You two look absolutely stunning together.

740
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,040
Seeing you two like this,

741
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,480
I can already picture your actual wedding.

742
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,520
It would be absolutely beautiful.

743
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,120
Maple, get her some water.

744
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,200
It's alright.

745
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,280
I just choked on my own breath.

746
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,280
Alright, then.

747
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,440
Anyway, we'd love some photos of you.

748
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,440
May we take a few photos?

749
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,680
Of course.

750
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,600
I'd love to send them
to my family as proof.

751
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,480
Thank you.

752
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,640
Maple, Sunny,

753
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,640
fix their poses.

754
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,080
POST
MEKHIN HEMARATSIRI

755
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,920
"Wedding soon.

756
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,160
If anyone wants to object, do it now.

757
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,720
Otherwise, this woman will be mine."

758
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,880
What on earth is this caption?

759
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,360
You're driving me crazy.

760
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,920
With this caption,
won't people start questioning

761
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,080
why you suddenly
turned into a lovesick fool?

762
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,320
Do you actually want us
to end up in the news?

763
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,840
Let them speculate.
Let them spread rumors.

764
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,280
I sacrificed my reputation for you.

765
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,440
You should be grateful.

766
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,480
I have business at the club.

767
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,600
Want to go home by yourself
or have Max pick you up?

768
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,840
It's fine. I don't want
to deal with you guys today.

769
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,680
Go do your job. I can get home on my own.

770
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,080
You really think posting
a wedding picture with Ms. Monmeena

771
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,200
will bait Ou into taking action?

772
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,360
We'll find out soon enough.

773
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,840
But I'm sure he'll make a move soon.

774
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,680
From the results,

775
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,400
you're perfectly healthy.

776
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,400
Your heart is functioning normally.
Nothing to worry about.

777
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,360
That's because

778
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,560
I have such a great doctor
taking care of me.

779
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,200
Wait.

780
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,160
Are you still mad at me?

781
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,520
I came all the way to see you, you know.

782
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,960
I only let you come
because you were a patient.

783
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,960
Doctor.

784
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,680
I'm sorry for leaving home
without telling you.

785
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,120
Just don't do it again.

786
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,960
My mom and I are worried about you.

787
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,960
And…

788
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,320
How is Aunt Duangjai?

789
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,600
She's fine.

790
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,840
But she's been worried about you.

791
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,160
You've been ignoring her calls,

792
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,760
and you never called back.

793
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,240
I just felt too ashamed

794
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,880
to face her.

795
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,480
I didn't mean to disappear like that.

796
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,640
Then, tell me the truth.

797
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,880
How did you end up as Mr. Yai's fiancée?

798
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,160
Today, there are even pictures
of you trying on wedding dresses.

799
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,400
It's nothing. We just started dating,

800
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,320
got engaged, tried on wedding dresses.

801
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,120
That's it. Totally normal, right?

802
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,080
If you and Mr. Yai aren't truly in love,

803
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,080
and this is just for some other reason,

804
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,800
I think you should stop now.

805
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,360
The Hemaratsiri family
is a battlefield right now.

806
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,320
Siblings are fighting over money.
The situation will only escalate.

807
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,720
I don't want you caught in the crossfire.

808
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,880
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM ROOM

809
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,360
This family is far too dangerous
for people like us.

810
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,400
I think you should stop now

811
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,080
before it's too late.

812
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,880
Trust me. I care about you.

813
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,000
Because I love you. I've always loved you.

814
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,400
What do you mean?

815
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,200
I love you

816
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,520
like a big brother
loves his little sister.

817
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,680
I only want the best for you.

818
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,080
You scared me.

819
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,320
I love you and Aunt Duangjai too.

820
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,920
Now, will you finally tell me the truth?

821
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,640
How did you end up as Mr. Yai's fiancée?

822
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,120
And don't bother lying.

823
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,800
I can always tell when you're lying.

824
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,960
If I tell you,

825
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,040
don't tell anyone.

826
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,840
Not even Aunt Duangjai.

827
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,720
Mekhin, give me back
my daughter right now.

828
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,840
And what right do you have to threaten me?

829
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,240
Monmeena is mine now.

830
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,400
I can do whatever I want.

831
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,120
Mekhin.

832
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,520
My offer is simple.

833
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,320
Bring me the will,

834
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,760
and your daughter will be free.

835
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,040
Think carefully.

836
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,760
Your daughter's life

837
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,640
or the will you stole.

838
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,960
Which is more important?

839
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,200
How exactly do I know

840
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,160
that my daughter is safe in that house?

841
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,440
You don't.

842
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,560
It's just a matter

843
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,720
of how quickly you get me that will.

844
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,320
Move fast, and she stays unharmed.
Move slow…

845
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,040
Well, I'm not a patient man.

846
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,400
If you double-cross me,

847
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,080
I won't let you live.

848
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,800
Then, hurry up.

849
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,560
I'm not good at waiting.

850
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,360
Turn off the lights when you're done.

851
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,360
And be quiet.

852
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,400
I'm sensitive to light and noise.

853
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,200
Mr. Yai!

854
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,400
What happened to you?

855
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,520
Go to sleep. I'll turn off the lights.

856
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,000
Wait.

857
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,120
You're going to shower with that wound?

858
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,200
It's just a little one.

859
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,120
No way. Come here.

860
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,480
Don't be stubborn.

861
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,720
I know you won't listen to me.

862
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,560
Wait for me here.

863
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,960
I used to wonder

864
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,640
why you had
an entire pharmacy in your room.

865
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,760
Now I get it.

866
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,320
Do you even realize you shouldn't
let wounds like this get wet?

867
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,280
No matter how small,
you need to take care of them properly.

868
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,880
No matter how dangerous your job is,

869
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,080
you need to take care of yourself.

870
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,360
Don't let yourself end up like this

871
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,320
and make me clean up after you.

872
00:55:59,120 --> 00:55:59,960
So stubborn.

873
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,960
Let me see the wound.

874
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
How did you even get hurt like this?

875
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,480
I'm not great at this.

876
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,640
Do it yourself.

877
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,320
So, did you cause trouble

878
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,680
at the hospital today?

879
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,600
What are you talking about?

880
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,080
Don't tell me
you sent someone to spy on me?

881
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,400
You were at my family's hospital.
Of course, I'd know.

882
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,480
What were you acting so suspicious for?

883
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,760
Did you do anything at the hospital?

884
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,400
The truth is…

885
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,920
I'm Mr. Yai's fake fiancée.

886
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,200
He's helping me get into that house

887
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,120
so I can take my mother away. That's all.

888
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,120
So?

889
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,720
What exactly
were you doing at the hospital?

890
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,400
I went to see my brother.

891
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,560
You know him.

892
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,600
Dr. Thiti,
the one who treated your wounds.

893
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,760
Did you…

894
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,480
tell him about our agreement?

895
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,240
I know what should and shouldn't be said.

896
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,880
I won't tell anyone about our deal.

897
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,080
And that woman at your house…
Is she the aunt who raised you?

898
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,160
Yes.

899
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,240
Ever since my mom abandoned me,

900
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,520
Aunt Duangjai has been
the one taking care of me.

901
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,360
She's the person
I owe the most in this world.

902
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,840
And your father?

903
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,280
You never mention him.

904
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,160
I don't know who my father is.

905
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,600
I don't even remember his face.

906
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,240
All I know is that

907
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,120
he left me and my mother
when I was little.

908
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,160
A man like that isn't worth remembering.

909
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,680
He's just a selfish coward.

910
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,600
<i>I'll be watching closely,</i>

911
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,400
to see how long you can keep up
this act about Monmeena.

912
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,640
I think your mother remembers you.
She's just pretending not to.

913
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,400
What do you mean?

914
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,880
The will you're searching for is with me.

915
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,920
But I'm not handing it over so easily.

916
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,160
What do you want?

917
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,200
I want you to help me eliminate Mekhin.

918
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,680
No matter how many times you're reborn,

919
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,840
you'll never beat me.

920
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,000
Yai!

921
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,160
<i>You're right in front of me.</i>

922
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,280
How can you say my real mother is dead?

923
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,400
Don't call me mother.

924
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,000
And from now on, stay out of my life.

925
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,560
<i>Let me help you.</i>

926
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,200
<i>If Ou wants to see Monmeena so badly,</i>

927
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,000
I'll take her to him myself.

928
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,680
I won't die so easily.

929
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,120
<i>Because if I go down,</i>

930
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,440
<i>you're coming with me.</i>

931
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,560
I forgot my phone in the car.
Go get it for me.

932
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,320
Meena!

933
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,880
