1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,240
I'd congratulate you.
But my condolences to Monmeena.

2
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,640
I can still throw a punch here.

3
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,760
I found out that Mr. Met
hired bodyguards to keep watch tomorrow.

4
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,120
I don't know if we'll see each other again

5
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,440
after helping your mother escape.

6
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,760
It all depends on how much
your plan impresses me.

7
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,960
Don't alert Pramet. It'll ruin our plan.

8
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,480
- Where are you going?
- If you don't let go, I'll expose you.

9
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,160
- It's Chairman Wang.
- Chairman Wang?

10
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,760
Wang?

11
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,480
If you try to do anything,
your daughter will pay the price.

12
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,000
She was my first and last love.

13
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,480
I wish you could see her.

14
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,960
Who took Nate?!

15
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,400
Kill Ou, and bring me
Meena and Pramet's wife.

16
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,640
Follow him.
Parin must be involved in this.

17
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,040
Yes.

18
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,360
Is he one of Pramet's men
or Mr. Yai's enemy?

19
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,480
I have no idea.

20
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,000
Mom. Mom, don't worry.

21
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,680
I'll protect you.

22
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,560
- Meena!
- Stop the car!

23
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
Let's go, Mom!

24
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,840
Mom! Hurry! Run!

25
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,240
- Mom!
- Nate!

26
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,480
- Run, Mom!
- Meena!

27
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,400
- Mom.
- Nate!

28
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,240
Get back in the car!

29
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,040
Mom! Mom, get up!

30
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,720
Mom, we have to run. Mom! Come on!

31
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,440
Mom? Mom!

32
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,800
Let go of my mom!

33
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,680
- Meena! Enough!
- Let go of her!

34
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,160
- Don't touch her!
- Meena, stop!

35
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,440
Listen to me. This man…

36
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,200
He's Ou, your real father.

37
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,560
What do you mean? Father?

38
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,520
Are you saying he's the one

39
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,800
who abandoned both of us?!

40
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,840
Meena. I can explain everything.

41
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,200
- But we have to get away now.
- From who, huh?

42
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,760
Mekhin and Chairman Wang.

43
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,760
And why do I have to run? Mr. Yai came up
with the plan to get Mom away from Pramet.

44
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,160
Why do I have to run?

45
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,520
I'll tell you everything later.

46
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,280
But we have to get of of here now!

47
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,200
I won't go anywhere!

48
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,120
I'll wait for Mr. Yai here.

49
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,080
He's the one I can trust,

50
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,760
unlike an irresponsible father like you!

51
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,120
Meena.

52
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,600
Meena, I beg you. We have to go.

53
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,440
Nate, trust me. We have to run.

54
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,240
If we don't, none of us will survive.

55
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,080
How can you trust him, Mom? He came
out of nowhere and ruined our plan.

56
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,200
What do you really want?

57
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,720
I never meant to hurt you.

58
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,280
I still want us to be a family again.

59
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,760
If that's what you really wanted,
you wouldn't have left us behind.

60
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,880
Get in. Let's go.

61
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,640
Don't move if you don't want to die.

62
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,320
- Meena!
- Mom!

63
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,280
Mr. Parin! Mr. Parin, please help us!

64
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,760
- Mr. Parin!
- Mr. Parin!

65
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,360
Please help! Help us, Mr. Parin!

66
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,200
Did you get the will?

67
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
Not yet, sir.

68
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,920
What is this? Are you working together?

69
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,400
Ou.

70
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,400
I let you see your wife and daughter,
as promised. Now, give me my will.

71
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,960
Hand the will to Mr. Parin.

72
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,920
Who would carry the will around?

73
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,440
An important document like that
must be kept in a safe place.

74
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,680
Ou, did you plan
to betray me from the start?

75
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,280
If my wife and daughter survive,
you'll have your will.

76
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,160
Lead Mr. Parin
to the place you hid the will.

77
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,000
Let my wife and daughter go,
and I'll go with you.

78
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,320
You're in no position to negotiate.

79
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,440
- Take them all.
- Run!

80
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,400
Meena!

81
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,080
Mr. Yai!

82
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,680
Yai!

83
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,560
Get Meena and Nate out of here.

84
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,120
- Go!
- Get in!

85
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,400
- Go, Mom!
- Meena!

86
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,440
- Hurry!
- Mom!

87
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,120
Hey! Ou!

88
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,000
Ou!

89
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,600
Hey! Damn it!

90
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,760
Shit.

91
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,960
Tell them to put the guns away.

92
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,840
Tell them.

93
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,480
Drop the guns.

94
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,840
Shit! Where did Ou go?!

95
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Yes, Mom?

96
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,120
I'll be there in five minutes.

97
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,640
Damn it!

98
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,200
You badly hurt our men.
Don't you think you're crossing the line?

99
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,360
You double-crossed me by working
with Parin. Not shooting your secretary

100
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,240
in the head
is the highest honor I've given you.

101
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,960
Dad ordered Ou to get that will
in the first place.

102
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,320
Everything will be ours,
the will and Ou's life.

103
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Hey!

104
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,480
I want to keep Ou alive.

105
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,240
Ou owes me.

106
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,360
How much does he owe you? I'll handle it.

107
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,200
I'm asking you to spare him.

108
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,080
You want me to spare Ou's life

109
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,680
because he's Monmeena's father, don't you?

110
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,040
Can you do what I ask?

111
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,280
- What if we can't?
- Shut up when grown-ups are talking.

112
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,360
Dylan.

113
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,600
Don't be rude.

114
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,160
Chairman Wang.

115
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What do you expect to gain
from meddling with the will?

116
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,120
If you just want revenge on Pramet,
you don't have to do anything.

117
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,320
Chairman Preeda would never
make him the chairman of H Group.

118
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,920
It's because
I don't want you to lead H Group.

119
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,480
Why?

120
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,800
Are you scared

121
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,920
that once I take charge,

122
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,640
Hemaratsiri will become so powerful
you won't even be able to compete?

123
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,520
That's why you're trying to undermine me?

124
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,360
You're talented and perfect.

125
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,080
But unfortunately,
you have a father like Pramet.

126
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,520
That's why you shouldn't be in charge
of the Hemaratsiri family.

127
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,080
Listen.

128
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,440
I built H Group from the ground up
into what it is today.

129
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,920
I won't let your grudge
with Pramet get in my way.

130
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,480
Some people

131
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,560
deserve to be where they truly belong.

132
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,160
But Mr. Parin is so certain

133
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,560
that Chairman Preeda
will give everything to him.

134
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,120
- Not you.
- He's delusional.

135
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,880
Everyone knows that I'm the one
who should be running H Group, not him.

136
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,440
What if that's not the case?

137
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,280
What if the will actually states
that Parin will have everything?

138
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,000
H Group is mine,

139
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,840
no matter what that damn will says.

140
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,040
I'll spare Ou as you requested.

141
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,040
Dad!

142
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,640
As for the will, I won't interfere.

143
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,680
But Mr. Parin won't stop here.

144
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,800
If you ever need my help, I'm all ears.

145
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,080
Then, I'd like to refuse.

146
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,280
Because there's no guarantee

147
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,800
that if I trust you,

148
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,680
you won't change your colors
like a lizard again.

149
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,560
If we're done, please excuse me.

150
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,760
Where's Mr. Yai? Why isn't he home yet?

151
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,480
I don't know.

152
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,760
- Aunt Bua.
- What?

153
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,839
- Where's Yai?!
- He hasn't come back.

154
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,000
Give me the will!

155
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,080
My God!

156
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,960
You're barking like a mad dog.
You lost Ou, didn't you?

157
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,120
No matter how hard you try,
you'll never have H Group!

158
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,080
Grandpa's will grants everything to me!

159
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,920
What makes you so sure
your name is really in the will?

160
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,520
Mr. Pornchai confirmed it.
Why would he say it if it weren't true?

161
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,160
He didn't want to die, you fool.
He wanted you to save him,

162
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,720
so he had to lie
that your name was in the will.

163
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,840
You've already seen how Grandpa loved
and trusted me. And you still have hope?

164
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,600
You haven't even seen
the will with your own eyes.

165
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,600
This is how naive you are, Parin.

166
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,280
That's why Grandpa
kept telling you to learn from Yai.

167
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,000
Yai!

168
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,720
Why shouldn't I have the right to hope?
I am the flesh and blood of Hemaratsiri!

169
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,840
My goodness!

170
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,720
Flesh and blood?

171
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,160
Flesh and blood? Flesh and blood?

172
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,160
Pathetic flesh and blood… Get off me!

173
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,320
Parin.

174
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,200
Parin! Yai!

175
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,120
Yai! What are you doing to my son? Parin!

176
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,920
Parin…

177
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,320
Remember this, both of you.
H Group is mine!

178
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Don't you ever cross
my fucking line again!

179
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,640
- Mr. Yai!
- Get off of him!

180
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,560
Mr. Yai, that's enough.
Mr. Pramet is waiting. Hurry.

181
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,120
If you two don't stop causing me trouble,

182
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,080
you'll all be fucking dead
when I reach my limit!

183
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,200
- Mr. Yai, please.
- Go!

184
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,480
- Mr. Yai.
- Parin.

185
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,160
Parin, my son. Parin.

186
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,920
- How's Poot?
- The bullet grazed his shoulder.

187
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,160
He's not in serious condition.
I told him to get some rest.

188
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,520
Are Ms. Meena and Ms. Nate safe?

189
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,720
Inthon is looking for them.

190
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,640
- Amen. Please be safe.
- Yai!

191
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,360
Take this!

192
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,000
Mr. Yai!

193
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,160
Yai!

194
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Come here, you bastard!

195
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,240
Where the hell did you take my woman?
Where is Nate?!

196
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,800
Yai!

197
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,880
Yai. Yai.

198
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,640
Yai… You dare hurt your own father?

199
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,440
- Yai.
- Mr. Yai!

200
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,320
Mr. Met is your father.
You can't do this to him.

201
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,320
You…

202
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,680
Yai!

203
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,160
You shouldn't have let Monmeena
take Nate away. How ungrateful of you!

204
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,760
I did plan to get her away.

205
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,120
But Ou interfered
and took Nate and Monmeena.

206
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,040
Who's Ou? Where did he take Nate?!

207
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,640
Ask Parin yourself.

208
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,440
He was the one
who let Ou take them from me.

209
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,520
That's not true.
Don't blame my son like that.

210
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,280
Did Lek really send someone
to take Nate away?

211
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,760
Why did you do that?

212
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,600
You knew how much Mr. Met loves Nate.

213
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,800
Max, help him!

214
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,240
Where is Ou?
Where did he take Nate?! Tell me!

215
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,760
Stop!

216
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,880
Ou is Nate's husband
and Monmeena's father.

217
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,320
Who are you to be so possessive
of another man's wife?

218
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,240
Her husband just took her back
from the likes of you!

219
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,280
You fucking brat!

220
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,960
- Stop!
- Father!

221
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,680
- Met!
- Stop, Father! Don't!

222
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,480
- Tell me! Tell me!
- That's enough!

223
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,200
- Father!
- Tell me, you brat!

224
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,680
- Enough, Father!
- Parin.

225
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,440
- Mr. Met!
- Stop! Enough of this!

226
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,440
- Tell me where!
- Father!

227
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,640
- Get off!
- I said stop!

228
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,040
- You!
- Father!

229
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,880
- Father!
- Met!

230
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,840
Come here.

231
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,280
- Come here.
- Father!

232
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,960
Yes.

233
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,400
I tracked the van's GPS
to Ou's safe house.

234
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,800
I don't see anyone following me right now.

235
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,160
Keep watching. I'll be there soon.

236
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,040
Yes, Mr. Yai.

237
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,880
Why did you listen to Mekhin?

238
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,920
He's arrogant and doesn't even respect us.

239
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,280
Why did you give in?

240
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,240
One day you'll understand.

241
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
One day? One day?!

242
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,040
And when exactly will that be, Dad?!

243
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,240
What do you really want
from the Hemaratsiris?

244
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,760
I'm tired. Get out of my room. Go!

245
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,440
Would you like me
to send someone after Ou?

246
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
Yes.

247
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,520
And keep an eye on him.

248
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,880
I gave Mekhin my word

249
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,040
that Ou and his family would survive.

250
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,320
But Ou could turn on us at any time.

251
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,960
He can't do that.

252
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,200
Eat something, you two.

253
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,800
We'll have to stay here for a while.

254
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,880
I'll find a way to get us back

255
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,320
to our country home in Chiang Rai.

256
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,480
There's nothing that is ours.

257
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,360
I know this is hard to accept right now,

258
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,160
but I'll make it work. Trust me, Nate.

259
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,080
Don't you want to know
how I ended up as Pramet's mistress?

260
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
I believe you had your reasons.

261
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,800
I just want you and Meena
to forget everything that happened.

262
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,960
But I can't forget.

263
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,000
I had to put up with that horrible man.

264
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,840
I had to satisfy his every demand
just to pay off my debt.

265
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,080
Can you see?

266
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,200
Can you see all this?

267
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,560
Every day has been hell for me.

268
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,040
My heart shattered when I had to send
my daughter to an orphanage.

269
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,880
But I had to,
for Meena to get the surgery!

270
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,240
And every day, I kept thinking…
if you hadn't left us,

271
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,160
we wouldn't have had
to go through this nightmare!

272
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,680
Why did you leave us? Why?!

273
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,040
Nate, I'm sorry.

274
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,560
I'm so sorry.
Please, let me make it right.

275
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,160
Please, let me take care
of you and Meena again.

276
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,720
Back away. Make it right?

277
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,880
How can you possibly make it right?

278
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,240
I spent over ten years without parents.

279
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,560
Do you know how much it hurt
like a knife stabbing me over and over

280
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,960
when I found out my mom
had to be some rich asshole's mistress?

281
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,880
I blamed myself every single day,
thinking it was because of me!

282
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,240
I was sick, so Dad and Mom left me!

283
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,280
Do you know that I agreed
to trade my entire life?

284
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,880
Do you know why?
Because I wanted to be with my mom.

285
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,720
- I'm sorry.
- No!

286
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,760
While we were suffering
through a fate worse than death,

287
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,640
where were you? Where were you?!
Say it! Where were you?!

288
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,480
Please. Please, give me
a chance to make it right.

289
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,440
Please, let me fix what I've done!

290
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,880
I'll fix my mistakes!
Let me take care of you two again!

291
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,360
It's been more than ten years
since you abandoned us.

292
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,360
And now you want to act like a father?

293
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,680
Want to take care of this family?!

294
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,640
And you expect both of us
to forget the pain we've been through

295
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,040
all those years?
Do you think it's that easy?!

296
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,960
Do you think it's easy?!

297
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,240
We don't want someone
so irresponsible taking care of us.

298
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,320
Mom and I can live on our own.

299
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,600
Meena.

300
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,400
I'll go with you.
We'll start a new life together.

301
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,000
Just the two of us.

302
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
Meena! Nate!

303
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,880
- Mom!
- Meena!

304
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,520
Stop! No!

305
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,760
- Let go! Don't touch her!
- Meena!

306
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,400
Don't touch my mom.

307
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,960
This scar looks like…

308
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,560
A surgical scar.

309
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,000
I never wanted to abandon you and Meena,

310
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,080
but I needed money
to pay for our daughter's surgery.

311
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,320
So, I became Chairman Wang's hitman.

312
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,160
But I messed up.

313
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
Move!

314
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,560
Move aside!

315
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,000
Hey!

316
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,680
It took me a month
to regain consciousness.

317
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,400
I spent a year in physical therapy
just to be able to walk again.

318
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,120
Once I fully recovered,

319
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,880
I tried looking for you and our daughter.

320
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,560
I rushed back to our home,
but no one was there anymore.

321
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,760
After a year of searching,
I found nothing.

322
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,800
Then, Chairman Wang ordered me

323
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,360
to kidnap a lawyer named Pornchai

324
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,680
and steal the Hemaratsiri family's will.

325
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,280
And then Mekhin captured you
to use as leverage against me.

326
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,240
He didn't capture me.

327
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,160
I agreed to play his fake fiancée

328
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,480
to help him avoid
marrying a woman he didn't love,

329
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,240
in exchange for helping
my mom escape that hell.

330
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,880
Mekhin lied to you.

331
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,120
He came to you because
he already knew you're my daughter.

332
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,240
It was all part of his plan.
He went as far

333
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,360
as ordering a car to almost hit you
to threaten me for the will!

334
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,680
Meena!

335
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,080
You're lying. I don't believe you.

336
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,880
Mr. Yai would never do that to me.
You're lying!

337
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,360
Then ask him yourself.
Who's lying, me or him?

338
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,600
Mr. Yai.

339
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,920
Tell me…

340
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,480
that he's the one who lied.

341
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,560
Not you.

342
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:40,400
Can you tell me, Mr. Yai?

343
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm sorry.

344
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,280
See? He admitted it.

345
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,840
Meena.

346
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,280
I admit that I came to you
because you're Ou's daughter.

347
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,480
But after our time together…

348
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,160
- I didn't think…
- No.

349
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,680
You didn't even need me

350
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,600
to help you avoid marrying Ms. Arisa.

351
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,560
You lied to me
about being forced to marry someone.

352
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,400
- No. No.
- I had my reasons, Meena.

353
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,040
So, you used me as bait,

354
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,440
just to get the will, didn't you?
Tell me you didn't!

355
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,880
He can't answer you because he lied!

356
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,400
And helping me get my mom out of there

357
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,280
was part of your plan too,
wasn't it? Mr. Yai!

358
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,800
I really wanted to help you, Meena.

359
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,760
You planned to take my wife
and daughter hostage. You bastard!

360
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,520
I really wanted to help you and Nate.

361
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,960
You tried to use my daughter
as a pawn, you son of a bitch!

362
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,280
You were never just a pawn to me, Meena.

363
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,720
He fooled you.

364
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,160
I never fooled you, Meena.

365
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,240
Believe me.

366
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,760
Trust me.

367
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,560
Were you having fun?
I said, were you having fun?!

368
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,480
Watching me believe your lies…
Was it fun for you?!

369
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,760
Did you enjoy watching me
play the fool?! Tell me!

370
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,760
Were you having fun?!

371
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,360
I put my life in your hands.

372
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,640
I gambled everything.

373
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,040
Do you know why? Because I believed

374
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,760
we were honest with each other!

375
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,080
But you crushed the loyalty I gave you,

376
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,320
just to serve yourself.
How could you do that, Mr. Yai?!

377
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,320
- Meena…
- How could you do that?!

378
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,440
How could you?!

379
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,640
How could you do that?

380
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,680
I'm not a Hemaratsiri by blood.

381
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,600
I'm not Pramet's son.

382
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,360
My mom was already pregnant
before she married him.

383
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,720
And Grandpa had been using me
as the family's lapdog my whole life.

384
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,000
I helped build H Group into what
it is today, I gave them my loyalty.

385
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,320
And before he died, he cut me off with
the will that gives everything to Parin!

386
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,360
That's why I had to destroy it.
To fight for my own justice.

387
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,360
So, you used me

388
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,720
to fight for your own justice.

389
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,520
So, now I'm your lapdog, huh, Mr. Yai?

390
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,920
Meena…

391
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,280
- Am I your lapdog now?! Answer me!
- Meena.

392
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,360
I won't be your lapdog anymore.

393
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,040
The agreement between us ends now.

394
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,200
I dont want to see you ever again.
Remember that!

395
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,120
- Go away! Go!
- Meena.

396
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,040
Meena.

397
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,160
Uh…

398
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,320
Meena.

399
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,600
Nate!

400
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,960
Meena!

401
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,640
- Meena, wait.
- Get off of me!

402
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,880
Meena.

403
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,000
Meena!

404
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,480
Mr. Yai!

405
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,080
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

406
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,680
- Mr. Yai!
- Meena, don't touch him!

407
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,120
We don't know where he's injured.
I'll call an ambulance!

408
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,440
Inthon, call an ambulance from a hospital
that isn't owned by H Group.

409
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:46,240
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai! Please be okay. Wake up!

410
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,680
Please be okay, Mr. Yai. Can you hear me?!

411
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,080
Wake up, Mr. Yai!
Please be okay. Stay with me, Mr. Yai.

412
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,720
Mr. Yai… Mr. Yai…

413
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,640
Why do you care
whether Mekhin is alive or dead?

414
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,400
Sir, Mr. Mekhin is--

415
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,240
- Why are you so concerned about him?
- Dylan!

416
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,000
Another hospital
has sent an ambulance for him.

417
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,960
Find out which hospital he's at. Tell them
to do everything they can to save him

418
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,640
Yes, sir.

419
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,680
And where's Monmeena now?

420
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,600
- Mr. Yai!
- Meena.

421
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,000
- Let go!
- Meena.

422
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,760
- Let go of me!
- Meena, don't!

423
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,240
- Mr. Yai!
- Meena!

424
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,520
- Meena!
- Let go of me! Let go!

425
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,240
Ms. Meena, I'll follow them.

426
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,280
I'll go with you!
I'll go with you, Inthon!

427
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,200
No!

428
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,840
No!

429
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,560
If Pramet sees you, he won't let you off.

430
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,120
Mekhin will be under a doctor's care soon.
He'll be alright

431
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,560
Let go of me!

432
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,960
I'm not going anywhere until Mr. Yai
is safe! Take my mom and hide somewhere!

433
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,440
- Let me go!
- We have to run before Pramet finds us!

434
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,720
Let go!

435
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,480
- Ms. Meena.
- Let go! Let go!

436
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,760
- Meena!
- Get off!

437
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,680
Meena!

438
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,640
Ou! Ou! Let her go.

439
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,600
Let's go! Hurry!

440
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,280
Being near Mekhin
will only put her in danger.

441
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,040
Why does she care so much about him?

442
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,480
Can't you really see how she feels?

443
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,680
Or you don't want to admit it?

444
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,320
If she stays involved with Mekhin,

445
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,960
her life will be nothing but trouble.

446
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,080
Damn it.

447
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,840
Go, go.

448
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
The patient's family
will have to wait outside, please.

449
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,880
Mr. Yai…

450
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,640
Inthon, keep me updated
on Mr. Yai's condition.

451
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,040
And take good care of him.

452
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,760
Yes, Aunt Bua.

453
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,800
Hey, pick up the pace. The family
will be here to eat any minute now.

454
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,360
Hurry up. Faster.

455
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,120
Carry it out.

456
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,600
- Bua!
- Gosh.

457
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,960
- Where is Yai?!
- I don't know.

458
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,240
You really don't know,
or are you lying to me?

459
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,240
I really don't know.

460
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,720
How could you not know?!

461
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,720
You've been more loyal
to Mei and Yai than to me.

462
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,480
- Tell me where Yai is!
- I really don't know.

463
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,520
Was it you who kept passing
the intel to Yai? Is that right?!

464
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,520
It wasn't me.

465
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,800
Where's my Nate?! Where's Nate?!

466
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,040
Tell me!

467
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,680
I don't know!

468
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,200
Father!

469
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,840
Father! Aunt Bua
has nothing to do with this!

470
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,800
Bullshit!

471
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,240
She's always worked for Yai!

472
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,920
Didn't Yai say someone
took Nate and Monmeena away?

473
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,600
Whether she works for him or not,
Aunt Bua wouldn't know.

474
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,000
What do you expect
from someone who doesn't know?

475
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,000
- Damn it!
- Father.

476
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,880
You don't know. You don't know.

477
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,160
Then who does? Who?!

478
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,200
Careful! That hurts!

479
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,840
I'm sorry, ma'am.

480
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:16,560
Pramet, you mad dog. Be careful.

481
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,600
My son's handsome face is all beat up.

482
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,480
Pramet, you scumbag.

483
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,080
After all this, did you get the will?

484
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,520
- Mom!
- Did you get it?

485
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,720
Mr. Met.

486
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,640
You could have killed us!
What the hell is wrong with you?

487
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,040
What the hell?

488
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,800
What the…? Hey!

489
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,640
- Mr. Met! Mr. Met!
- Uncle!

490
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,800
- Mr. Met!
- Tell me.

491
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,080
Why did you help Ou?

492
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,800
- Get off my son.
- What did you want from him?! Tell me!

493
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,480
I don't know.

494
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,400
He doesn't know anything. Let him go!

495
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,320
Liar!

496
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,080
Tell me right now, Parin.

497
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,720
What did you want from him?!

498
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,080
There was nothing!
We didn't take anything from him!

499
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,200
- Let go of my son!
- Get off!

500
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,600
He planned to expose you!

501
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,080
He'll tell everyone
you took his wife from him.

502
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,280
I didn't want the horrible things you did
to ruin our family's reputation.

503
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,840
So, I had to help him!

504
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,960
Then, where is he, huh? Where is Ou?!

505
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,880
I don't know!

506
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,680
- Where is Nate? Tell me where she is!
- Mom!

507
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,600
- Parin!
- Let go of my son now!

508
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,400
- Let go of my son right now!
- Get off me!

509
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,200
You bitch!

510
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,920
Mom! Damn it!

511
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,720
I'm done with this!

512
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,440
If you don't stop,
I'll smash your head in with this!

513
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,320
Want to try me?!

514
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,600
Noppachai…

515
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,920
If he finds out about the will,
he'll find a way to get rid of it.

516
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,280
Good. The crazier Pramet gets, the better.

517
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,200
He's getting help from Mr. Noppachai.
He'll track down Ou in no time.

518
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,960
You need to find Ou first.

519
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,400
If you don't, he will kill him,
and the will disappears forever!

520
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:37,840
Kill Ou?

521
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,720
Did you find a way to get the will?

522
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,920
Wait.

523
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,080
I've waited long enough.
How much longer do I have to wait?!

524
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,600
Wait.

525
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,160
If you're willing to wait,

526
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,520
I'll place H Group in your hands.

527
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,080
Trust me. Everything will go smoothly.

528
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,720
But… Hey! Damn it!

529
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,320
What did Chairman Wang say he'd do?

530
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,800
If I knew, I wouldn't be standing here.

531
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,880
You're pathetic!

532
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,520
This is all because of your arrogance.
You went to Mr. Wang without telling me.

533
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,760
That's why you failed like this.

534
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,680
I didn't fail.

535
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,040
Admit it. You failed.
You screwed everything up.

536
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,760
I said I didn't fail!

537
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,560
If you really didn't fail,
we'd have the will by now.

538
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,600
That's enough!

539
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,640
You dare raise your voice at me?

540
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,440
I'll handle this myself.

541
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,920
Parin. Parin, don't walk away from me.

542
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,400
Parin, come back. Parin!

543
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,160
Would you like something to eat,
Ms. Monmeena? I can go buy it for you.

544
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,320
Yes.

545
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,240
- Are you Ms. Monmeena?
- Yes.

546
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,160
A woman named Nate
is waiting for you in the parking lot.

547
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,320
Thank you.

548
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,160
- Meena.
- Let go of me.

549
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,840
- Meena!
- Let go!

550
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,640
Why did you have to tie her wrists?
I'm so sorry, Meena.

551
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,960
Hey! What do you want?

552
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,120
You're a bold one.

553
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,840
You're in my hands now,
and yet you're not afraid.

554
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,080
What good would it do me
to act like prey in front of the hunter?

555
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,680
I think not. Say what you want. I'm busy.

556
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,640
Meena, don't be rude.

557
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,600
And savages like you
expect me to be polite?

558
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:36,160
You need to help me stop Mekhin
from taking control of H Group.

559
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,080
Your enemy is Pramet, not Mr. Yai.

560
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,640
I didn't ask for your comment.

561
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,640
I'm ordering you to work for me.

562
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,880
There's no way I'll betray Mr. Yai.

563
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:03,640
Even with Ou's
and your mother's lives at stake?

564
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,280
Someone of your caliber

565
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,880
wouldn't be desperate enough
to solve a problem with violence, right?

566
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,520
Meena…

567
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,480
Not me, but Pramet.

568
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,000
Pramet is furious
now that your mother's disappeared.

569
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,760
And with his money and power,

570
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,920
he'll find your parents soon enough.

571
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,560
And he'll make your mother suffer

572
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,360
until the day he dies.

573
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,800
If you don't want your parents
running for the rest of their lives,

574
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,160
I can help you.

575
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,040
You're probably used to betraying others,
but I won't do it.

576
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,800
Some people don't understand
until it's too late.

577
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,720
I hope you don't wait until it's too late.

578
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,600
Is that all? Then I'll take my leave.

579
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,840
Dylan.

580
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,960
Take her back.

581
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:22,880
Yes.

582
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,720
Thank you.

583
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,000
She's a bold one.

584
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,760
Keep a close eye on Ou.

585
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,400
I'll use him to force her daughter
into working for me.

586
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,120
Do you want me to capture Ou and Nate?

587
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,440
No need.

588
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,360
Just send Ou's location to Pramet.

589
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,160
If we do that,
Pramet will definitely kill Ou, sir.

590
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,520
That's exactly what I want.

591
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,480
PATIENT DROP-OFF AND PICK-UP POINT

592
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:37,880
Meena.

593
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,800
What does your father want from me?
Why is he trying to undermine Mr. Yai?

594
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,280
I don't know, and I don't care.

595
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,360
Whatever he wants,
my job is to follow his orders.

596
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,560
And you shouldn't think about standing up
to him. Because he'll win every time.

597
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,560
- Not every time.
- Every time.

598
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,600
All this time, there hasn't been a single
time when he didn't get what he wanted.

599
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:08,080
Anyone who challenged him
met a tragic end.

600
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,160
Why are you following me?

601
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,280
I want to see Mekhin suffer.

602
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,160
Do you want him to find out
I've met with your father?

603
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,840
If you change your mind and agree
to help my dad, call me.

604
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,560
Where were you, Ms. Monmeena?

605
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,000
How is he doing?

606
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,800
He's safe now.

607
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,240
The CT scan and a full check-up
showed no broken bones.

608
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,560
Really?

609
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,040
Yes.

610
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,680
But the doctor said he still
has bruises and swelling all over.

611
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,160
Luckily, none of his vital organs
were harmed.

612
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,000
Mr. Pramet attacked him last night,
and now he's been hit by a car.

613
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,600
Because of me and my mom?

614
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,920
Yes.

615
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,800
Aunt Bua said Mr. Pramet was furious
and almost killed him.

616
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:37,840
Why do you care about him so much?
He hasn't exactly been kind to you.

617
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,160
Mr. Yai is straightforward and honest.

618
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,040
But in that house,
they always make him the villain.

619
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,200
I just want you to know, everything he did
was for you, Ms. Monmeena.

620
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,120
I believe he's honest.

621
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,720
Take a break.

622
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,120
I'll stay with him until he wakes up.
Don't worry.

623
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,160
And you're not mad at him
for lying to you anymore?

624
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,360
He'll be happy that you're
the first person he sees when he wakes up.

625
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,360
I'll wait outside, then.

626
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,600
Right.

627
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,800
- You don't stand a chance against Mekhin.
- That's because I haven't tried.

628
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,200
I don't want you
getting involved with that woman.

629
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,960
Why are you bringing a gun, Father?

630
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,800
I'm going to blow his head off,
you dumbass!

631
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,160
- Nate!
- Don't do it!

632
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,000
Nate! Stop!

633
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,520
- Mom! Mom!
- Father!

634
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,960
- No!
- Mom!

635
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,800
Father!

636
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,560
Once the will is read, I'll expose
the truth behind your image.

637
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,680
Without the will, you have nothing.

638
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,400
You'll always be beneath me.

639
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,360
Dad said if something happened,
to grab the steel box under the rubble.

640
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,640
<i>So, I guess that's the will.</i>

641
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,280
There's no original copy
of the will anymore.

642
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,600
If Mr. Mekhin finds out
the truth about your betrayal,

643
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,320
you might lose him forever.

644
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,440
Meena.

645
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,320
