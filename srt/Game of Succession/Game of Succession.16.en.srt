1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,720
<i>I'd like to appoint Mark</i>

2
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,760
<i>as the new Executive Chairman</i>
<i>of Jongtraipattana,</i>

3
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,960
<i>effective immediately.</i>

4
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,120
<i>You're the Mr. Yai I love.</i>

5
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,040
I might look so much like him,
it's got you confused.

6
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,480
<i>Mr. Joe informed us that Mr. Parin</i>

7
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,680
<i>hired him in connection to Poot's murder</i>

8
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,960
<i>six months ago at H Club.</i>

9
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Why the hell did he turn himself in?

10
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,560
There must be someone behind this.

11
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,040
Who?

12
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,640
I will never hand

13
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,600
the Jongtraipattana family
over to you, Dylan!

14
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,280
I'm not trying to take anything from you.

15
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,720
Take whatever Dad gave you.

16
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,760
But you have to let me have Monmeena.

17
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,840
I'm happy to be your future sister-in-law.

18
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,960
It's unbelievable how Poot's death

19
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,960
has opened so many doors for us.

20
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,600
There must be something fishy
behind those two,

21
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,160
about the deaths of Chairman Preeda

22
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,880
and Mei.

23
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,960
Parin! Parin!

24
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,600
Why are you yelling so early?

25
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,040
What is it?

26
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,040
The board isn't happy about the lawsuit
Mark filed against the company.

27
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,640
And?

28
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,720
Pramote called a meeting
without telling us.

29
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,560
We need to stop him!

30
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,880
The meeting's already over.

31
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,480
Why wasn't the chairman informed
about such an important meeting?

32
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,520
The board wanted a free discussion.

33
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,160
They didn't want to feel pressured,

34
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,040
so I didn't tell you.

35
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,480
But this whole thing isn't Parin's fault.

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,880
It's clearly Chairman Wang's setup
to bring us down.

37
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,800
Actually, Mr. Mote tried to defend him.

38
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,600
Chairman Wang insists

39
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,880
he never discussed anything with you.

40
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,680
So, now, it looks like

41
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,280
you acted alone, announced the project,
and held the event by yourself.

42
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,480
The board sees you

43
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,400
as reckless.

44
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,320
So,

45
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,920
you'll have to take responsibility.

46
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,400
So, what's the conclusion?

47
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,760
The conclusion is…

48
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,960
If you can't fix this

49
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,840
within a week,

50
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,480
you'll have to show your spirit.

51
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,520
Pramote's trying to take your place.

52
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,520
I'm not blind, Mom. It's obvious.

53
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,720
And you're still this calm?

54
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,000
Mom!

55
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,520
I'm on my way.

56
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Who are you going to see?

57
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,200
It's Arisa, isn't it?

58
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,680
You're about to be crushed,

59
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,840
and you're still chasing after some girl?
Are you out of your mind?

60
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,480
Can you just stop?

61
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,960
I don't want to hear it!

62
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,320
The reason I feel like I'm going crazy

63
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,920
- is because you keep telling me--
- I'm your mother!

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,120
When I speak, you listen!

65
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,160
Parin! Parin! Come back here! Parin!

66
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,400
I told you to keep an eye on them.

67
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,400
What, are you deaf and blind?
How did you find out this late?

68
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,720
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

69
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,520
Useless. Just like your father.
Absolutely useless!

70
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
- I'll get back to work now.
- Then go!

71
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
By now, Pa must be having a heart attack.

72
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,640
Looks like
Parin's not getting out of this one.

73
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,000
In the end, he'll have to resign.

74
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,200
All thanks to the one he still trusts…

75
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,040
You.

76
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,680
If Pa finds out you switched sides,

77
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,280
she'll come after you.

78
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,520
As long as I keep my position,

79
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,560
there's nothing she can do to me.

80
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,960
I'm just a nobody.

81
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,480
I know how to survive.

82
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,080
So, this is what
a two-faced person looks like.

83
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,320
Thanks to you, Aunt Nuan.

84
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,480
I learned from the best.

85
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,560
Tri!

86
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,800
Enough banter.

87
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,680
And what if Chairman Wang
double-crosses us?

88
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,720
By then,

89
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,280
Parin will already
be kicked off the throne.

90
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,320
And you

91
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,880
will be the only one
eligible to take over as chairman.

92
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,920
The position that should've
been yours from the start.

93
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,440
As for you,

94
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,160
if I ever find out
you've betrayed me and Mote,

95
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,200
even if you're his niece,

96
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,480
I won't spare you.

97
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,040
Yes.

98
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,480
And that task I gave you?

99
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,080
It's all been taken care of.

100
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,800
Restoring life
to underprivileged children,

101
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,720
giving them heart surgery

102
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,200
so they can live a normal life again,

103
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,760
has always been my mission.

104
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,280
I've worked with
the Honest Heart Foundation for years.

105
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,040
But an important mission like this
wouldn't be possible

106
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,280
without crucial support,

107
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
like from Dr. Thiti.

108
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,080
Dr. Thiti, please come forward.

109
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,120
Dr. Thiti is an exceptional cardiologist,

110
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,160
and I believe he'll help bring joy

111
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,200
back to these children's lives.

112
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,480
Now, let's have everyone gather
for a group photo, please.

113
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,400
H-HOSPITEL X HONEST HEART

114
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,520
Did you see Pramote's news?

115
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,160
Look how much attention he's getting!
You need to come back right now!

116
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,400
Yes.

117
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,400
- I'll head back as soon as I'm done.
- Parin…

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,120
Arisa!

119
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,040
Parin, come back here right now!

120
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,680
Parin!

121

<i>The number you dialed cannot be reached…</i>

123
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,600
How dare he turn off his phone on me?

124
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,920
It's that Arisa's fault!

125
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,520
Are you okay? Why do you look like that?

126
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,080
Please let me stay like this for a moment.

127
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,880
Okay.

128
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
You must be exhausted.

129
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,600
The board is pressuring me to resign
over the lawsuit with Mark.

130
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,040
If I lose my position,

131
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,600
my mom will be disappointed.

132
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,400
And your father…

133
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,160
He'd never approve of us either.

134
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,360
Why don't you try talking to Mr. Mark?

135
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,000
He came back for revenge.

136
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,200
He wouldn't agree to anything.

137
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,160
So, you still believe Mr. Mark is Yai?

138
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,440
I grew up with him.

139
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,000
There's no way I wouldn't know.

140
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,960
One look in his eyes,
and I knew it was him.

141
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,760
If he really is Yai,

142
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,760
then you should know how to deal with him.

143
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,040
You said you grew up together.

144
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,400
You should know

145
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,080
how to handle him.

146
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,520
Family

147
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,840
always knows each other best.

148
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,280
And how to deal with one another.

149
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,840
As expected,

150
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,640
Parin's down to one option.

151
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
Resign, for the sake of honor?

152
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,960
That's the last thing he'd do.

153
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,400
I know.

154
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,240
But Pramote's probably getting impatient,
hungry for the chairman's seat.

155
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
So, now he's rushing to force Parin out.

156
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,440
In terms of family hierarchy,

157
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,400
Pramote is way at the bottom
for Chairman Preeda.

158
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,760
There's no way he has any chance.

159
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,200
Even if he's at the bottom,

160
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,440
don't you think Chairman Preeda could see

161
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,320
that if he left the company to Pramet,
it'd fall apart?

162
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,800
He would've chosen Pramote instead.

163
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,840
That's what everyone thought,
except Chairman Preeda.

164
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,680
Then he must've had another reason.

165
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,840
You have some idea what it is,

166
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,360
don't you?

00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,280
I apologize for not informing you
in advance, Doctor.

170
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,480
I just wanted to introduce
a talented doctor to everyone.

171
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,480
Let's just say

172
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,440
I was proudly showing off
my brilliant student.

173
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,840
Thank you, Professor.

174
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,200
I'm just doing my job, helping patients.

175
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,280
I never cared about recognition.

176
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,400
Honestly, I admired this foundation
from the very beginning.

177
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,640
That's why I joined this hospital.

178
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,840
I knew I wasn't wrong about you.

179
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,320
Thank you, Professor.

180
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
I'll do my best to live up to your trust.

181
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,720
- Nuan.
- I need to talk to you.

182
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Sure. Dr. Thiti,
please check on Nont again.

183
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,640
His surgery is scheduled in three days.

184
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,640
Yes, Professor.

185
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,880
So, what is it, Nuan?

186
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,440
I just wonder. Was that livestream

187
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,160
meant to boost the hospital's image,

188
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,320
or was it about introducing Dr. Thiti?

189
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,320
Well…

190
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,320
I brought Dr. Thiti in because
I'll be working closely with him.

191
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,600
Having a talented doctor on the project

192
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,200
adds credibility to the foundation,

193
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,600
and the hospital gets some good press.

194
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,840
Nuan, if you were a heart expert,

195
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,560
it would be you.

196
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,360
Don't take it the wrong way, my love.

197
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,840
But until now,

198
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,800
our hospital has never needed
to promote our doctors.

199
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Just having you
was enough for credibility.

200
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,040
When you do things behind my back,

201
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,520
it makes me wonder
if you're hiding something.

202
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,160
I know

203
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,200
you don't like
taking a backseat to anyone.

204
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,600
But this project isn't big enough
for someone as brilliant as you.

205
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,720
Then what kind of project
would be big enough?

206
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,520
The announcement
of the new hospital director.

207
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,200
Really, Mote?

208
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,600
Of course. I already planned
to give that position to you.

209
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,960
Thank you, Mote.

210
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,160
I love you so much. Thank you.

211
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,000
H-HOSPITAL X HONEST HEART
FOR UNDERPRIVILEGED CHILDREN

212
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,680
He humiliated and went after Parin.

213
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,480
So, why hasn't anything
happened to Pramote?

214
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,080
What exactly is Mr. Yai up to?

215
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,400
Why the frown?

216
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,560
Feeling stressed? At this time of day,
you should be relaxing.

217
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,120
Why do I get the feeling
you're buttering me up

218
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,000
because you want something?

219
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,760
I love how well you read me.

220
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,240
I see through you.

221
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,440
If you already know that,

222
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,160
will you tell me what I want to know?

223
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,680
And what is it you want to know?

224
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,680
Mark's plan.

225
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,160
Sorry? Didn't quite catch that.

226
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,960
I know you heard me.

227
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,079
Well, if I hear it clearly,
maybe I'll tell you.

228
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,760
I want to know what Mark plans
to do to the Hemaratsiri.

229
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,000
And what if I say I can't tell you?

230
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,720
Then I'll resign as your secretary…

231
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,280
and terminate our agreement.

232
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,680
No need to be so hasty, gorgeous.

233
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,560
If you lie, I really will walk away.

234
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,400
Mark's mother.

235
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,280
This is about Mark's mother.

236
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,440
Your brother really
doesn't know how to knock.

237
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,440
You're here for Dylan, right?

238
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,720
Then I'll excuse myself.

239
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,840
If you need anything, just call me.

240
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,440
Okay.

241
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,800
Why did you call me here?

242
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,920
Not just to watch
that little love scene, I hope.

243
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,080
You'll be seeing more of that.

244
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,840
I called you because
someone wants to talk to you.

245
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,400
Something about his mother…

246
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,280
My mother's death was ruled an accident,

247
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,680
but I'm sure it was murder.

248
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,320
So, I figured the foundation
might have some evidence,

249
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,280
something that could reveal the truth.

250
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,720
I already sent people to investigate,

251
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,880
but they couldn't access everything.

252
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,560
Have you seen the news?

253
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,800
About the Honest Heart Foundation?

254
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,880
And what does that have to do with me?

255
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,720
Oh, right. I forgot, you're not Mr. Yai.

256
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,320
Why are you still here?

257
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,600
Or did I manage to grab your attention?

258
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,280
Dylan said you wanted to talk to me
about something important?

259
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,840
If you're trying to destroy Hemaratsiri

260
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,280
because of the will…

261
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,640
Don't bother hiding who you are anymore.

262
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,080
It's obvious from how you want
to destroy H Group that you're Yai.

263
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,720
Smart.

264
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,320
That's more like the chairman of H Group.

265
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,680
If you were dumb, that'd be a shame.

266
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,960
But you came here alone, with no backup?

267
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,720
Gotta admit, that's bold.

268
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,440
Yai, I didn't kill Poot.

269
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,960
You knew, didn't you?

270
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,280
You knew it? Then why…

271
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,960
Did you set up Joe to frame me?

272
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,840
Was that you, huh?

273
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,360
What do you want from me, Yai?

274
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,480
Is it the chairman's seat?

275
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,240
Even though you know Uncle Mote
and the board would never accept you.

276
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,720
You're not Hemaratsiri blood.

277
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,080
Why are you so stubborn? Even if I'm out
of the picture, there's still Uncle Mote.

278
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,680
Just give it up, Yai!

279
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,080
I can help keep you in the seat.

280
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,680
Take it easy.

281
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,280
All I want is for you
to answer a few questions.

282
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,360
Or would you rather resign with dignity?

283
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,160
If you can do what you say,

284
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,880
then ask.

285
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,920
Lungs sound clear.

286
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,360
Vitals are stable. No signs of concern.

287
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,800
He's still okay for surgery,
right, Doctor?

288
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,720
There shouldn't be a problem.

289
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,480
Thank you so much.

290
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,480
Hang in there, Nont.

291
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,560
So, I'll be able to go to school?

292
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,480
I can run and play
like the other kids, right?

293
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,800
Yes, Nont.
You'll definitely get to go to school.

294
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Professor.

295
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
Hello, Doctor.

296
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,040
Hello. How's he doing?

297
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,840
He's stable overall.

298
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,520
Just a little fatigued.

299
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,440
But I believe he'll be fine
for tomorrow's surgery.

300
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,640
Hang in there, Nont.

301
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,400
Actually, Nont's the patient I've been
trying to get on a surgery schedule.

302
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,440
But after reaching out to several places,
no hospital would take his case.

303
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
There are hundreds of Thai children
waiting for surgery.

304
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,280
If not an early death,
they're left to live in pain.

305
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,760
Luckily, we got a slot
through your foundation.

306
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,440
I personally added Nont's name
to the list for you.

307
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,320
What do you mean?

308
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,840
Because you cared about him,

309
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,600
he got an early surgery slot.

310
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,760
Don't worry.

311
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,160
I didn't bump anyone off the list for him.

312
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,800
It's prioritized based on
medical condition. And Nont's case

313
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,840
is urgent.

314
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,800
Thank you so much, Professor.

315
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,400
Thank you so much.

316
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,120
I'll do my best to support you.

317
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,880
I like you.

318
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,400
Doctor Ti.

319
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,880
Hello, Mr. Pramote.

320
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,160
You're looking much better.

321
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,440
It's all thanks to you

322
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,840
for helping me.

323
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,160
You should thank Doctor Ti.

324
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,120
He cared so much about you
that I had to step in and help.

325
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,600
I was afraid my favorite student
might just wither away.

326
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,520
You nearly withered away
out of love for your sister?

327
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,680
Come on, give me a hug.

328
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,360
We're in front of the professor. Behave.

329
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,240
Come on. I missed you.

330
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,880
Such a tease.

331
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,760
It's wonderful.

332
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,080
You two aren't even blood-related,
yet you love each other so much.

333
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,560
There are only two women
I love most in this world.

334
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,120
My mom and Meena.

335
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,680
I heard you're Dylan's secretary now.

336
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,560
So, are you planning
to upgrade from secretary to…

337
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
Wife?

338
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,680
Mr. Yai is gone.

339
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,320
I should move on, right?

340
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,880
Dylan's not bad.
He's the son of a chairman, too.

341
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,760
I've never missed a chance
to level up in life.

342
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,440
You're right about me, Mr. Pramote.

343
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,600
What are you saying, Meena?

344
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,760
He didn't mean it like that, right?

345
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,360
Of course not.

346
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,600
I didn't mean it that way.

347
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,200
Sorry if I made you misunderstand.

348
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,720
I just meant Dylan

349
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,280
is from a rival family,

350
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,280
but he's not a bad guy.

351
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,760
If you two want to date or be together,

352
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,600
I wish you both well.

353
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,440
Ti, if you ever need anything,

354
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,880
just let me know.

355
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,600
Thank you.

356
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,080
- I'll take my leave then.
- Yes, sir.

357
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,840
I didn't know
you were that close with Mr. Pramote.

358
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,520
I'm his favorite student.

359
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,600
Anyway, what's so urgent
that you had to rush over?

360
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,880
It's very urgent.

361
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,800
SOMTAM - HOTPOT

362
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,920
Take this to table one.

363
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,480
Doctor!

364
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,200
Eat properly.

365
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,080
You want me to investigate
Professor Pramote?

366
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,520
Keep your voice down.

367
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,920
If someone recognizes us here,
you'll be the one in trouble.

368
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,920
It's just a bit of digging.

369
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,360
Not a crime.

370
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,960
Look at my mouth, just investigating.

371
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,240
Why do you even want to know?

372
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,480
Well…

373
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,400
It's Mekhin again, isn't it?

374
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,960
You think Mark is Mekhin, don't you?

375
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,320
Mr. Yai's mother might've been killed
by someone in the Hemaratsiri.

376
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,960
I believe her death

377
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,480
is linked to the Honest Heart Foundation.

378
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,840
I just want information
from ten years ago,

379
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,880
the year she died.

380
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,200
Only three people involved
with the foundation

381
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,880
were Mr. Pramote,

382
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,120
Ms. Nuanchan, and Ms. Triprapa.

383
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,000
But I couldn't access
any of that information.

384
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,640
Doctor…

385
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,880
please help me.

386
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,200
Please.

387
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,560
Professor Pramote helped me,

388
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,160
helped you, and helped my patient.

389
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,000
I can't do something
suspicious behind his back.

390
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,640
Doctor,

391
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,840
if your professor is a good person,
then what are you afraid of?

392
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,920
And if you find proof
that clears his name,

393
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,960
wouldn't that be even better?

394
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,560
If something really is wrong, you'd be
the one to confirm his innocence.

395
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,960
Please?

396
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,720
Please.

397
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,040
Please help me.

398
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,040
Wait, Dr. Ti.

399
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,080
Check, please.

400
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,200
Here's 500 baht. No change needed.

401
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,840
Doc!

402
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,800
- Where's Parin?
- He left for work early this morning.

403
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,200
Yes, Tri?

404
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,240
<i>Aunt Pa, did you see the news online?</i>

405
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
What news?

406
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,680
Jum.

407
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,040
Here, ma'am.

408
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,320
PARIN HEMARATSIRI PUTS 300 M
ON THE TABLE TO END FUED WITH JW GROUP

409
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,960
Truly impressive,
the only grandson of the family.

410
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,880
He's risking his own fortune

411
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,280
to fix the damage.

412
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,600
Such spirit.

413
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,680
He clearly takes after you, Ms. Pa.

414
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,280
The inheritance from Dad
must be gone by now.

415
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,800
If you ever feel tight on cash

416
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,720
and want to sell your shares, let me know.

417
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,040
Parin didn't want to lose a little,
only to end up losing everything.

418
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,920
Because when it comes
to the chairman's seat,

419
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,120
even if you sell everything you have,
you still won't get it.

420
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,720
I need to go check on the Chairman.

421
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,480
Excuse me, Director.

422
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,600
I didn't think
he'd really spend that much.

423
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,760
If he's got the money to pay, let him.

424
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,480
We still have plenty of chances.

425
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,520
Why did you pay JW's damages?

426
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,640
To make them drop the lawsuit.

427
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,120
That was 300 million!

428
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,040
To keep this position,

429
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,440
I'd say it was worth it.

430
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,280
We never gain anything
without losing something first.

431
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,040
And that fortune?

432
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,160
It was never truly ours.

433
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,400
So, why cling to it?

434
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,680
Where did you get this idiotic idea?

435
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,200
ARISA

436
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Don't walk away from me.

437
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,680
Talk to me, now!

438
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,480
Parin! Parin!

439
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,200
Parin!

440
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,520
Please feel free to walk around.

441
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,440
Alright.

442
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,680
Parin.

443
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,240
Are you okay?

444
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,760
I saw the news. I was worried
it might cause problems with your mom.

445
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,840
This was the only way to keep the position
my mom and dad wanted for me.

446
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,080
So, it's you!

447
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,560
You're the reason
my son made such a foolish decision!

448
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,120
Mom…

449
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,280
Mom,

450
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,520
I think you're misunderstanding.

451
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,240
I haven't accepted you
as my daughter-in-law. Don't be so quick.

452
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,360
Mom, please. Show her some respect.

453
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,440
She's only with you
to protect her father's interests.

454
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,400
Don't be so naive!

455
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,880
That's enough, Mom. Let's go home.

456
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,840
Don't mess with my son.

457
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,160
I'll never accept you
as part of this family!

458
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,880
- Enough, Mom. Let's go home!
- I'm not going!

459
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,240
I need to tell her
she's not worthy of you!

460
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,160
Enough!

461
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,200
Stay away from my son. Remember that!

462
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,040
Don't come near him again!

463
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,160
- You need to break up with Arisa.
- No!

464
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,480
If you don't, I'll destroy her.

465
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,800
If you lay a hand on Risa,

466
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,280
I'll never come back here again!

467
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,040
I've done everything you asked.

468
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,800
I told my lawyer to withdraw the lawsuit.

469
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,200
I'm ready to answer your question now.

470
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,240
What's the first one?

471
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,840
Who connected Poot's death
to Chairman Preeda's?

472
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,520
Yes, sir.

473
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,360
I'll make sure Mr. Pramote handles it.

474
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,080
Don't worry.

475
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,360
Yes, of course.

476
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,480
Wait, why hasn't Nont
been taken into surgery yet?

477
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,600
The nurse said it's been postponed.

478
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,440
The donated heart wasn't viable.

479
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,960
Please tell Nont

480
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,239
to wait a bit longer.

481
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,400
- Nont…
- Why is it like this?

482
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,880
Please wake up.

483
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,159
HEART RATE 90/60

484
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,159
Doctor! Please help!

485
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,640
- Please save my son!
- Nont!

486
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,480
Nont!

487
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,320
Emergency heart attack!

488
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,560
Wake up, baby!

489
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,920
Nont!

490
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,640
Wake up!

491
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,760
Nont.

492
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,440
Ma'am.

493
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,360
Please wait outside.

494
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,320
- Ma'am.
- Stay strong.

495
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,320
- We'll get through this together.
- Wait outside.

496
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,240
Hang in there.

497
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,840
Nurse, continue CPR.

498
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,840
Yes, Doctor. CPR.

499
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,320
CPR now.

500
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,200
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

501
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,840
eight, nine, ten, 11, 12…

502
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,720
Doctor, how's my nephew?

503
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,880
The surgery went well, sir.

504
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,720
Thank you so much, Dr. Mote.
If it weren't for you,

505
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,640
my nephew wouldn't have survived.

506
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,560
My pleasure, sir.

507
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,960
Thank you so much.

508
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,120
Make sure he gets plenty of rest.

509
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,720
His heart should return to normal,
and soon,

510
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,320
he'll be running around like before.

511
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,120
- Thank you again.
- My pleasure.

512
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,040
Don't worry.

513
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,360
We'll take the best care of him.

514
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,640
Thank you, both of you.

515
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,520
- I'll take my leave now.
- Alright.

516
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,760
Excuse me.

517
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,760
Was there a heart transplant
scheduled for today?

518
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,720
Yes.

519
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,640
But not for Nont.

520
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,160
Doctor Ti…

521
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,680
The donated heart wasn't viable,

522
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,040
so we couldn't proceed
with Nont's surgery.

523
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,480
But someone else
received a transplant. Why?

524
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,200
Was there a new donor
that happened to arrive?

525
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,400
And what if there was?

526
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,880
What's so strange about that?

527
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,480
Every case is different.

528
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,000
You're a doctor. You know that.

529
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,280
Some patients just have to wait.

530
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,920
No need to get emotional about it.

531
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,640
- Nuan!
- I care about every patient.

532
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,440
As for Nont, he can wait.

533
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,840
Our hospital is taking good care of him.

534
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,040
If a compatible heart becomes available,

535
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,760
we'll operate immediately.

536
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,400
What's the point of overreacting?

537
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,440
I understand.

538
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,600
I'm sorry.

539
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,920
- Dr. Ti.
- Mr. Mote.

540
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,560
Dr. Ti, calm down. I'm on my way.

541
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,760
Don't do anything foolish.

542
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,000
Are you talking to someone?

543
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,520
- A ghost in the elevator?
- Monmeena.

544
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,480
Wow… My future brother-in-law
calling me by my full name.

545
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,720
Don't risk your life over foolish things…

546
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,360
- of--
- Of who?

547
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,080
Mine?

548
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,680
I always end up risking my life
for the foolish things.

549
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,480
Especially when
it comes to someone I love.

550
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,240
I only switched
the surgery schedule for your benefit.

551
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,800
You should've discussed it with me first
before making that decision.

552
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,640
I told you it was an emergency.

553
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,520
But that child could've waited.

554
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,560
We could've operated after Nont.
I was the one doing the surgery.

555
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,600
You had no right to decide in my place.

556
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,720
I had no right?

557
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,480
I got you to where you are, despite your
father's objections. Did you forget that?

558
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,760
Your precious Dr. Thiti
may have a pretty face,

559
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,240
red lips,

560
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,520
and a smile that melts your heart,

561
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,560
but he's not the one who'll put you
in the chairman's seat. Did you hear me?

562
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,040
Are you ready
to throw away all your dreams

563
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,680
for Dr. Thiti?

564
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,320
I need to go check on the patient.

565
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,280
Nont…

566
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,200
He's going to be okay. Trust me.

567
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,520
Since the foundation started,

568
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,120
only one child
gets heart surgery each year.

569
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,160
Dr. Ti, I thought you said
you wouldn't investigate it.

570
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,520
I had to see for myself
if they were truly good people.

571
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,840
And I think I found
what you were looking for.

572
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,160
Dr. Ti.

573
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,120
I need a word with you.

574
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,000
You should head back first.

575
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,000
I just sent the info to your email.

576
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,840
Then I'll get going.

577
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,560
Excuse me.

578
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,960
INTHON

579
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,960
SOMEONE'S FOLLOWING MS. MEENA
I'M TRACKING THEM

580
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,600
<i>Someone's following Ms. Meena.</i>
<i>I'm tracking them.</i>

581
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,440
If anything happens to Meena,
call me immediately.

582
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,680
MONMEENA

583
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,120
Hello, Meena?

584
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,000
<i>Mr. Yai, help me!</i>

585
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,760
- <i>Who are you? Let go of me!</i>
- Meena.

586
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,040
- Meena--
- <i>Mr. Yai!</i>

587
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,400
INTHON

588
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,960
Inthon, where are you?

589
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,600
Inthon?

590
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,480
WHEEL ALIGNMENT

591
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,880
You were that worried about me,
weren't you, Mr. Yai?

592
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,200
Inthon, is that you?

593
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,400
Open the door!

594
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,000
I figured out you had Inthon follow me

595
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,600
ever since I showed you the info
about the Honest Heart Foundation.

596
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,320
Mr. Yai would know me well enough
to know I'd never stop digging.

597
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,680
How did you mess it up?

598
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,480
You're the one who messed up.

599
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,680
You underestimated the woman
who used to live with you.

600
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,800
The one who knows you better than anyone.

601
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,640
DYLAN

602
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,960
Your little detective game ends here.

603
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,240
You wouldn't want Dylan to be upset now.

604
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,000
If it were you,
I'd give you a lifetime extension.

605
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,440
Just answer it.
I don't want trouble with Dylan.

606
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,880
So? Did you find your brother yet?

607
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,960
I did.

608
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,360
I'm comforting him right now.

609
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,720
Is something wrong?

610
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,360
Where are you right now?

611
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,080
I'm at the hospital. With Dr. Ti.

612
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,400
He's not doing well.

613
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,240
It's been a tough day.

614
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,760
<i>Is something urgent?</i>

615
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,440
I miss you.

616
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,320
We just saw each other,
and you already miss me?

617
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,400
I need to be with Dr. Ti now.
Talk later, okay?

618
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,520
Okay.

619
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,920
What deal did you make with Dylan?

620
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,480
What are you talking about?

621
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,280
You agreed to date Dylan

622
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,800
just so you could work at JW, didn't you?

623
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,040
You're good at guessing. Or maybe…

624
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,200
you made a deal with Dylan about me too?

625
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,720
You really did, didn't you?

626
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,600
Meena…

627
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,120
Mekhin, your fiancé, is dead.

628
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,800
Your family's free now.

629
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,200
Why not live the life
you always dreamed of with them?

630
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,520
Why are you clinging to me?

631
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,040
Because I have a new dream now.

632
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,600
I want to be with my parents,
and with you.

633
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,640
Mr. Yai,
no matter what you're trying to do,

634
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,080
I'll support you all the way.

635
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,240
Let me stay by your side.

636
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,360
No.

637
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,480
You can't be involved in this.

638
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,480
For 13 years, your mother took care
of The Honest Heart Foundation.

639
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,160
It's helped
one underprivileged child a year

640
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,120
receive a heart transplant,

641
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,760
in partnership with Heaven Hospital,

642
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,000
which the Hemaratsiri family owns.

643
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,200
Twelve children received transplants
without issue.

644
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,720
Everything went well.

645
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,200
But the last case

646
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,840
was in the same year your mother died.

647
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,400
You think those are connected?

648
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,360
Dr. Thiti is searching
for the name of that child now.

649
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,920
We'll find out who it was.

650
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,560
I can't let you be part of this.

651
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,280
Are you worried about me?

652
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,640
So, you really won't stop digging?

653
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,040
I just want to help you.

654
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,440
If you're helping me out of guilt…

655
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,880
It's love.

656
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,880
I'm helping you because I love you.

657
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,800
Whatever it is you're going to do,

658
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,560
tell me first. Don't go charging in.

659
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,920
Yes. I promise.

660
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,720
I promise, Mr. Yai.

661
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,400
Let me help you.

662
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,200
Thanks, Inthon.

663
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,160
And about Dylan…

664
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,280
I'll make sure
he never finds out about us.

665
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,400
I won't let you
screw this up like the will again.

666
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,600
But don't take too long.

667
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,080
Dylan really knows how to treat a woman.
I might change my mind.

668
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,400
Take her home.

669
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,200
Yes.

670
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,520
Drive safe.

671
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,360
Go on.

672
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,040
Oh.

673
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,160
Are you waiting
to have dinner with your eldest son?

674
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,960
I've been waiting for you.

675
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,040
Sit down.

676
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,680
Hey.

677
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,640
I had them make all your favorite dishes.

678
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,320
Just say what you want.
I'm ready to listen.

679
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,920
I've waited my whole life for the day
I can crush Hemaratsiri under my feet.

680
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,280
Don't let your pathetic love

681
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,000
ruin everything. Got it?

682
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,160
Have you ever cared how I feel?

683
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,360
Your feelings

684
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,240
are a weakness that stands
in the way of our family's greatness.

685
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,840
And stepping on broken families,

686
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,400
that's greatness?

687
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,400
Because I'm the head
of the Jongtraipattana family.

688
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,520
If I want something, I'll get it.

689
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,400
Anyone who stands in my way, my enemy,

690
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,040
will be destroyed.

691
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,080
You abandoned Mom. You abandoned me.

692
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,240
Just to climb over
everyone else in this family

693
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,360
for recognition.

694
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,520
To prove how great you are.

695
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,680
But do you know what?

696
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,480
You're the worst head of the family.

697
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,400
The worst father
and the worst husband anyone could have.

698
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,760
Dylan!

699
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,680
All you ever do is whine.

700
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,760
When will you finally get what you want?

701
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,040
Power? A woman?

702
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,880
You want everything, but you can't
fight for any of it. And you know what?

703
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,680
Monmeena doesn't want you
because you're pathetic!

704
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,720
Oh yeah?

705
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,760
You mean like him?

706
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,840
Do I have to run for my life like he did?
Is that what you call strength?

707
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,360
I'm drowning in money,

708
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,320
and I still have to fight,
to destroy others, for what?

709
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,040
To you,
the Jongtraipattana might be everything.

710
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:49,720
But to me,
this family is nothing but hell.

711
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,640
And you want me to worship it? Fine!

712
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,680
Long live this fucking family!

713
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,920
Happy now?

714
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,480
Dylan! What the hell is wrong with you?

715
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,640
What the hell is wrong with you?

716
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,200
Go ahead! Beat me to death!

717
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,520
Even if you kill me,
I'll still think the same way.

718
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,880
Is there anything related to me?

719
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,240
How's the plan progressing?

720
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,840
Why ask me,

721
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,440
when your secretary
keeps you updated on everything?

722
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,880
I thought

723
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,560
maybe you'd want a moment
to talk to your family.

724
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,280
Suddenly feeling fatherly?

725
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,480
Trying to enjoy
some warm family bonding time?

726
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,160
I know

727
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,160
Chairman Preeda used you
to build a future for his descendants.

728
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,960
You must feel lonely.

729
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,560
So, now you want to make up for 30 years

730
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,320
of letting me rot under their feet?

731
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,000
Watching Mom suffer under Pramet?

732
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,080
Living in hell,
thinking Pramet was my father?

733
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,160
This scar on my chest

734
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,760
won't heal with fake warmth.

735
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,600
I loved Mei.

736
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,840
Do you hear me?

737
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,040
She was the only woman I ever loved.

738
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,640
If you loved her so much,

739
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,040
why did you let her stay with Pramet?

740
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,080
- I was waiting for the right time.
- Waiting?

741
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,520
- I had to wait, do you understand?
- Wait until what?

742
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,000
Until I became useful?

743
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,240
Until I got strong enough
to destroy them for you?

744
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,440
It started
the moment you interfered with the will.

745
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,960
Made deals with Parin.

746
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,360
Cornered me into working with you.

747
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,720
Now that I'm staying with you,

748
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,960
I finally see the truth.

749
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,560
it was all your plan.

750
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:28,160
Push me down, then pull me up,

751
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,080
just so I'd owe you.

752
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,680
That's the reality

753
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,080
of the one at the top of this family.

754
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,840
It's me!

755
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,560
What a father you are. Truly impressive.

756
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,360
That Preeda

757
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,480
was cruel.

758
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:02,400
He used me
because I wasn't his blood. But you?

759
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,440
I am your blood.

760
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,360
And you still used me.

761
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,080
That makes you worse than him.

762
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,760
You want a warm family moment?

763
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,800
Fine.

764
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,520
You want a family meal?

765
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,880
Try it. It's good.

766
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,680
This won't end
with just being fired from the hospital.

767
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,080
You might've gotten away with it
if it weren't for the organ trafficking.

768
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,240
Met.

769
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,000
All you care about now
is surviving, right?

770
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,520
Then let Aunt Nuan take the fall.

771
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,160
Then it's settled.

772
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,120
Or should I call the cops
and drag you out by your hair?

773
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,120
You brat!

774
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,360
Mom!

775
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,200
Dad!

776
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,840
You killed my mother, didn't you?

777
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,360
Monmeena is the reason your mother died!

778
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,040
<i>You didn't have to do this.</i>

779
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,400
<i>Can today</i>

780
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,080
<i>be the first day of our love?</i>

781
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,160
Get out of here,

782
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,360
before I lose it
and put a bullet in your head!

783
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,720
- Dad.
- Go!

784
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,720
You betrayed me!

785
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,360
You broke our deal, then die!

786
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,120
- Meena!
- Mr. Yai!

787
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,040
