1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,040
Is it true

2
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,280
that you're not a Hemaratsiri by blood?

3
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,240
<i>We'll have Mr. Mekhin</i>
<i>take a DNA test with Ms. Triprapa,</i>

4
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,880
<i>Mr. Pramet's daughter,</i>

5
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,880
<i>who already confirmed her DNA with him.</i>

6
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,240
Once the result is out,

7
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,200
you won't have a place here anymore.

8
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,720
Hemaratsiri will fall by my hands.

9
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,200
You're just a whining loser.

10
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,480
A coward like you should focus

11
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,440
on keeping the position
you never deserved.

12
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,440
<i>The suspect is Mr. Mekhin Hemaratsiri.</i>
<i>Put your hands up.</i>

13
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,720
You're under arrest.

14
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
- Where are you going?! No!
- Meena!

15
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,400
- Meena!
- You can't go!

16
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,880
The hospital project will never happen.

17
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,880
You'll have to speak with
the new chairman of JW Group.

18
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,280
Yai?

19
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,840
- Impossible.
- This can't be real.

20
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,320
He's not dead?

21
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,360
You've got some nerve
showing your face here, Mekhin!

22
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,680
Murderer!

23
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,400
Guards, arrest him. Call the police.

24
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,520
That's enough, Mark.

25
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,480
Seems like
there's been a misunderstanding.

26
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,640
This is Mark,

27
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,600
my eldest son.

28
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
Mark?

29
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,440
But I thought
you only had one son, Mr. Dylan?

30
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,040
And how many sons I have…

31
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,040
Why would you know?

32
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,320
Anyway, my family business
is none of your concern.

33
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,920
Today, I brought both of my sons

34
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,680
to congratulate Mr. Parin
on his appointment

35
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,520
as Executive Chairman.

36
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,360
Congratulations, Mr. Parin.

37
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,280
Congratulations.

38
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,880
Mr. Mekhin!

39
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,800
Who let you in here?

40
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,960
Guards, escort her out!

41
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,600
Don't.

42
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,600
Come with me.

43
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,800
Hey.

44
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,000
Let me go!

45
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,680
Who's Mark? That was Mr. Yai.

46
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,920
That's Mark. He's my half-brother.

47
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,360
No, that's Mr. Mekhin.

48
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,920
Excuse me.

49
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,640
It seems Hemaratsiri

50
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,880
is about to breach the agreement
on the cocktail lounge project.

51
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,720
There had to be changes.

52
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,480
Mr. Pramet is still a fugitive.

53
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,160
Mekhin too.

54
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,480
The board unanimously
voted for the change.

55
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,000
This feels like a kid's tea party.

56
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,640
We're talking billions in investment,

57
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,360
and you're making changes
without even consulting your partners?

58
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,960
That is

59
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,480
a serious lack of business etiquette.

60
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,160
You weren't here
when I made the deal with your father.

61
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,480
This doesn't concern you.

62
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,800
The land was secured between Hemaratsiri
and Jongtraipattana for a cocktail lounge.

63
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
That's why we partnered with you.

64
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,000
But now the project has changed.

65
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,160
That's a breach of agreement.

66
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,760
We're pulling out
of the partnership with H Group.

67
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,360
Starting tomorrow,
all construction must stop immediately.

68
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,720
You can't!

69
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,640
You can't.

70
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,160
Even if you're Chairman Wang's son,

71
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,800
you don't have the authority
to make that call.

72
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,200
You always think you know everything, huh?

73
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,200
And who told you
I don't have the authority?

74
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,640
I'd like to appoint Mark

75
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,640
as the new Executive Chairman
of Jongtraipattana,

76
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,920
effective immediately.

77
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,160
We'll issue a full press release
by the end of the day.

78
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,080
But…

79
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,760
let's not steal the spotlight.

80
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,160
Let's celebrate
Mr. Parin's big promotion today.

81
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,040
Congratulations.

82
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,200
How did Parin's promotion ceremony

83
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,520
turn into the debut
of Chairman Wang's long-lost son?

84
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,440
And not only did he steal the spotlight,

85
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,720
he scrapped the project
we were all banking on.

86
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,000
That was a declaration of war.

87
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,240
Maybe Yai isn't dead after all.

88
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,560
Maybe Mark is Yai.

89
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,120
If that's true,

90
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,240
why would Chairman Wang
make him Executive Chairman?

91
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,080
- This camera, please.
- Over here, too.

92
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,120
Thank you very much.

93
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,360
Please move in closer.

94
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,040
Let's move in a little.

95
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,760
- Nice, sir.
- That's great.

96
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,640
Over here too, please.

97
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,680
One more shot.

98
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,640
- Dylan, smile.
- This camera, please.

99
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,480
- Smile for this one, too.
- Sure.

100
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,280
Thank you all.

101
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,920
Please excuse us.

102
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,120
Thank you so much.

103
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,480
They're leaving.

104
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,040
Mark.

105
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,960
I'll drive myself back.

106
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,440
We need to talk about your promotion.

107
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Not now.

108
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,560
Mark!

109
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,440
- Dad!
- Get in the car.

110
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,000
I said I'll drive myself.

111
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,520
Yes, sir.

112
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,320
- Go.
- Mr. Yai.

113
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,800
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

114
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,920
Where have you been?

115
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,920
You've got the wrong guy.

116
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,120
You're Mr. Mekhin.

117
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,040
You're the Mr. Yai I love.

118
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,840
I don't know who you're talking about.

119
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,680
But…

120
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,520
I must just look a lot like him.
That's probably why you're confused.

121
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,480
Then show me your back.

122
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,640
Prove that you're someone else,

123
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,680
not my Mr. Yai.

124
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,280
He had a scar on his back.

125
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,800
I've never had a woman
approach me so boldly.

126
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,200
Honestly, it caught my attention.

127
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,280
But it makes you look cheap.

128
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,800
Try something a little more charming.

129
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,920
What you just did

130
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,520
makes me want to run.

131
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,080
Please leave.

132
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,440
You can't lie to someone who loves you.

133
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,360
Dad.

134
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,760
Why didn't you tell me
about appointing Mark as Chairman?

135
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,200
Afraid he'll steal everything?

136
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,880
With everything under my name,

137
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,880
I have more than enough.

138
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,800
Feeling left out?

139
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,400
Are you really that weak, Dylan?

140
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,280
I'm your son.

141
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,960
I'm family. I should've known first.

142
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
- Not at the same time as everyone else.
- Being emotional

143
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,480
make you look weak, Dylan.

144
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,320
If being strong like you

145
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,000
means leaving someone who loved you
like Mom to die alone,

146
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,480
I'd rather be weak.

147
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,560
No wonder

148
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,440
Monmeena didn't choose you.

149
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,520
A man with no ambition, so weak…

150
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,040
What kind of woman would ever want you?

151
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,320
A power-hungry bastard like you
will die alone.

152
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,080
I'll never hand

153
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,280
the Jongtraipattana family
over to you, Dylan!

154
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,200
For once, Dad…

155
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
That is

156
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,840
the smartest thing you've ever said to me.

157
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,200
Let's get you upstairs to rest, sir.

158
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,920
Did you know
about your promotion before the event?

159
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,040
I found out the same time as you did.

160
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,640
Then, congrats, Mr. Chairman.

161
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,520
It's temporary. Don't worry.

162
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,080
I'm not trying to take anything from you.

163
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,920
Take whatever Dad gave you.

164
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,960
I'll leave you alone.

165
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,720
Especially anything from this family,
I never wanted it.

166
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,760
But you have to let me have Monmeena,
like you promised.

167
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,760
PARIN

168
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,720
Parin?

169
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,560
If that's Parin, don't answer it.

170
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,079
But Dad,

171
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,200
Parin went through a lot today.
I just want to check on him.

172
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,960
I saw the livestream.

173
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,720
He lost control of everything,

174
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,440
got publicly humiliated at his own event.

175
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,280
Think about it. Every board member,
every reporter, every employee

176
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,560
saw how incapable he is.

177
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,840
You shouldn't have let the press
take photos with him.

178
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,360
He'll get everything back under control.

179
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,800
Please, just let me talk to him.

180
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,880
If I don't give you permission,
you can't speak to him.

181
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,280
<i>Your dad's probably upset.</i>
<i>I'll fix everything myself.</i>

182
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,600
<i>Take it slow. Fix it step by step.</i>
<i>I'm rooting for you.</i>

183
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,920
Didn't you say you'd handle things
with Chairman Wang without any problems?

184
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,880
But you acted on your own.

185
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,920
If I hadn't talked
to Chairman Wang myself,

186
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,880
do you think I'd have dared
to host such a big event?

187
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,320
Then, that means Chairman Wang
planned to humiliate us at the event?

188
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,400
Looks like you got played by him.

189
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,240
Your own press conference

190
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,520
turned into a circus.

191
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,720
And now our stocks have dropped 5%

192
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,120
because of your poor judgment.

193
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,160
Fix this

194
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,440
before it gets worse.

195
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,000
Rookie.

196
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,960
Damn it!

197
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,880
<i>Then show me your back.</i>

198
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,040
Prove that you're someone else,

199
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,760
not my Mr. Yai. He had a scar on his back.

200
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,120
You can't lie to someone who loves you.

201
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,600
Hey!

202
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,640
SIX MONTHS AGO

203
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,240
You're finally awake.

204
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,440
I thought you'd given up.

205
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,040
Why did you save me?

206
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,960
<i>That night, Triprapa overheard a heated</i>
<i>argument between Mekhin and Grandpa.</i>

207
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,080
<i>It was about Grandpa not appointing him</i>
<i>as Chairman of H Group.</i>

208
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,000
<i>And the next morning,</i>

209
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,560
<i>Grandpa passed away.</i>

210
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,440
<i>What Mekhin did</i>

211
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,160
<i>was unforgivable</i>
<i>to all of us in the Hemaratsiri family.</i>

212
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,240
<i>We urge the police</i>
<i>to capture Mekhin and bring him to justice</i>

213
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,360
<i>for all the crimes he's committed.</i>

214
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,880
That Parin is sharp.

215
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,720
He's already linked you
to two murder cases.

216
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,920
But I can help prove

217
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,880
your innocence

218
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,880
if you agree to work with me

219
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,920
and take down Hemaratsiri.

220
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,160
You're so desperate,

221
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,800
you'd ally with someone
cast out of the family

222
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,680
when you still have me?

223
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,160
- Mr. Dylan, please.
- Don't you dare!

224
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,880
You can't do this, Dylan.

225
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,560
You're too weak.

226
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,520
Weak? Always with the "weak"!

227
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,200
You want to see me ruthless?

228
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,280
Dylan, that's enough!

229
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,600
You can't kill your own brother!

230
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,040
What the hell are you talking about?

231
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,400
- Damn it!
- Hey.

232
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,600
Let go of me!

233
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,240
Do you even hear what you just said?!

234
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,800
Mekhin is your half-brother.

235
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,600
He's my son with Mei.

236
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,640
You had someone else?

237
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,200
The one who came after was your mother.
Learn the truth.

238
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,920
I'm sorry

239
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,000
it took this long to bring you home.

240
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,800
I'm not your son.

241
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,640
Don't you dare
drag my mother into this filth.

242
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,880
Dad, if you're just using him
to destroy Hemaratsiri,

243
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,080
then throw money at him!

244
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
A guy like him wouldn't refuse.

245
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,400
You don't need to make up
some ridiculous story.

246
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,240
Then I'll prove

247
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,000
what I said is the truth.

248
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,640
How?

249
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,280
DNA PATERNITY TEST REPORT

250
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,800
MR. WANG JONGTRAIPATTANA
MR. MEKHIN HEMERATSIRI

251
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,600
PROBABILITY 99.9996%

252
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,160
What is it?

253
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,080
Chairman would like to see you.

254
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,280
What's the matter?

255
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,320
Do you like the weapon I've given you?

256
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,720
The JW chairman position?

257
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,280
It's what I deserve.

258
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,280
As the rightful heir
to the Jongtraipattana family, right?

259
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,280
It's just a fitting tool
to bring down Hemaratsiri.

260
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,840
Nothing more.

261
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,800
If you succeed,

262
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,200
you won't stop at leading Jongtraipattana.

263
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,520
- But as the heir--
- What did the lawyer say?

264
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,840
Everything is ready.

265
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,640
- Then we begin tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

266
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,240
I'll excuse myself.

267
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,080
You can't run from the truth.

268
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,760
You're the one who should accept it.

269
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,920
I'm only here

270
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,800
because we share the same goal.

271
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,520
To destroy Hemaratsiri.

272
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,120
Carry out everything as Mark instructed.

273
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,280
Report all progress to me.

274
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,040
Yes, sir.

275
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,080
Now that everyone's back together,

276
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,200
I won't lose anyone again.

277
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
MARK JONGTRAIPATTANA
ELDEST SON OF CHAIRMAN WANG

278
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,120
That's clearly Mr. Yai.

279
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,640
Interested in my older brother, are you?

280
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,320
You asked me here tonight
because of Mark, didn't you?

281
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,960
What are Mr. Yai
and Chairman Wang planning?

282
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,120
How many times do I have to tell you?

283
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,160
Mark is my brother.
He just got back from the States.

284
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,480
You saw his background
on the website, right?

285
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,680
Online profiles can be faked.

286
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,720
It's not hard to doctor photos
and make up a résumé.

287
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,280
Then why look at them at all
if you don't believe them?

288
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,560
But if Mark is Mekhin,

289
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,040
why would he do this?

290
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,600
Revenge.

291
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,560
I've seen firsthand how cunning

292
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,440
and vengeful both Mr. Yai
and Chairman Wang can be.

293
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,120
These two families only care about money,

294
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,240
power, and revenge.

295
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,560
Leaving his old life behind

296
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,800
wouldn't be hard for Mr. Yai.

297
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,880
You haven't forgotten Mekhin?

298
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,400
Maybe if we danced,

299
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,480
I'd start talking a little more.

300
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,120
Dance?

301
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,760
Your eyebrows are all knotted.

302
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,120
You'll get wrinkles too soon.

303
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,920
You probably just smudged all my makeup.

304
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,680
You're still beautiful.

305
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,720
I like seeing you smile.

306
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,000
I still remember the first time we met.

307
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,360
Even if

308
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,120
you haven't smiled much since Mekhin,

309
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,440
I want you to be happy.

310
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,600
It's not just about Mr. Yai.

311
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,640
It's about survival.

312
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,440
I haven't worked since everything
happened with the will and my parents.

313
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,320
I'm stressed, uncertain about the future.

314
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,160
If I had a steady job,

315
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
a fresh start, things might be better.

316
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,920
Why do I get the feeling

317
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,600
you're baiting me to give you a job?

318
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,640
And let me guess.

319
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,880
It has to be a job
that keeps you close to Mark, right?

320
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,480
Just breathing

321
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,880
and you already know what I'm thinking?

322
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,840
But it's true that I haven't been working.

323
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,240
Look into it if you don't believe me.

324
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,800
I already know.

325
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,040
Ever since you left the hospital,

326
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,040
all you've done is search for Mekhin.

327
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,400
You've been checking up on me?

328
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,920
I can get you that job.

329
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,560
But you'll have to agree to one condition.

330
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,800
Mr. Mark and Yai must be the same person.

331
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,640
I'll hire some IT experts
to dig into those websites.

332
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,000
If they're fake, we'll report it
and trace Mark's real background.

333
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,840
If it gets that far,

334
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,920
Yai's done for.

335
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,520
What's up?

336
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,440
Parin, have you seen the news?

337
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,560
You're screwed.

338
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,080
<i>This morning, Joe, the Knife Man,</i>
<i>turned himself in to police,</i>

339
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,160
<i>claiming he was hired</i>
<i>by Mr. Parin Hemaratsiri to kill Mr. Poot.</i>

340
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,320
<i>This raises serious doubts</i>
<i>about whether Mr. Mekhin Hemaratsiri,</i>

341
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,360
<i>previously accused of the murder,</i>

342
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,880
<i>may actually be innocent.</i>
<i>We'll keep you updated.</i>

343
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,600
<i>Excuse me.</i>

344
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,680
What is going on?
How is this even possible?

345
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,160
Who is this Joe?

346
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,600
Do you even know him?

347
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,240
Can you stop yelling, Mom?!

348
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,960
<i>Pardon me.</i>

349
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,280
What is it?

350
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,200
<i>Deputy Captain Charan is here to see you.</i>

351
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,240
Let him in.

352
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
I assume you've seen the news.

353
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,120
Mr. Joe informed us that Mr. Parin
hired him in connection to Poot's murder

354
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,880
six months ago at H Club.

355
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,360
I'll need you to come
to the station for questioning.

356
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,040
That's a lie! Officer, don't believe him.
He's framing my son!

357
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,680
Whether it's true or not, Mr. Parin
still needs to be questioned. Please.

358
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,800
How do you even know

359
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,480
that Joe is really the killer?

360
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,400
Joe turned himself in
with a photo of Poot's stabbed body,

361
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,880
taken at the scene
and allegedly sent to his client.

362
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,000
You're not in charge
of this case, are you?

363
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,640
It's been transferred to me.

364
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,800
Our investigation also found that

365
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,440
you're friends with Officer Methas
and helped him get his promotion.

366
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,600
He is now also under review

367
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,600
for possible involvement
in Mr. Poot's death.

368
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,440
If you have no further questions,
let's go.

369
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,560
I'm innocent.

370
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,240
Don't worry, Mom. I'll be back.

371
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,080
Parin, no…

372
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,120
No! My son didn't do it.

373
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,040
He didn't do it. He was framed.

374
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,679
My son didn't do it!

375
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,199
Calm down, Aunt Pa.

376
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,280
Parin will be fine.

377
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,880
MEKHIN MIGHT BE INNOCENT

378
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,920
I don't get it.
Why would Joe suddenly turn on Parin?

379
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,360
Especially when we…

380
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,760
Whatever the reason,
if the cops dig deeper

381
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,960
and he blurts out my name,
what the hell am I supposed to do, Nuan?!

382
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,639
Mote, Mote, calm down. Don't worry.

383
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,120
I'll take care of it.
I'll pay them off if I have to.

384
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,040
It's going to be okay. Don't panic.

385
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,280
Why the hell did he turn himself in?!

386
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,240
There must be someone behind this.

387
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,520
Who is it?!

388
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,240
Who?!

389
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,880
<i>Yes, Mr. Mark?</i>

390
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,400
Where's the coffee I ordered?

391
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,640
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

392
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,680
I ordered black coffee, didn't I?

393
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
You again?

394
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,920
Black coffee's too bitter.
I thought I'd find you something smoother.

395
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,200
Life should have a little flavor.

396
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,320
I've never met a woman
who insists this much.

397
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,520
The other day, I didn't take my shirt off.

398
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,800
And today, you storm your way in here?

399
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,400
Reserved, are you?
I was just touching you.

400
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,360
Get out,

401
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,680
before I call security to drag you out.

402
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,920
Go ahead.

403
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,160
I don't think you'd fire
your top-level executive assistant.

404
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,400
There you are.

405
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
Babe, I've been looking all over for you.

406
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,440
I was just
introducing myself to your brother.

407
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
Introducing?

408
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,160
This is Monmeena.

409
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,520
She will be my secretary
and my girlfriend starting today.

410
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,880
I have to be your girlfriend?

411
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,760
And not just pretending.

412
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,560
You'll need to act
like we're truly in love.

413
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,120
I…

414
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,160
I don't care how you feel.

415
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,840
But if you want to work at my company,

416
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,520
there's only one status you can have.

417
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,160
Fine.

418
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,880
I'll be your girlfriend,
as someone in love with you.

419
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,160
I'm happy to be your future sister-in-law.

420
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,800
I need to talk with Dylan.
Can you give us a moment?

421
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,880
Wait for me in the room.

422
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,320
I'll be there soon.

423
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,520
Alright.

424
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,800
We're holding a press conference tomorrow.

425
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,320
I'll have my secretary
send you the talking points.

426
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,680
You don't look too thrilled.

427
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,120
Why? Your little brother's in love.

428
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,520
As a brother,
shouldn't you be happy for me?

429
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,640
You really can't

430
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,960
win a woman's heart,

431
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,680
so you have to force her
into being your girlfriend?

432
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,720
This is the beginning.

433
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,760
Sooner or later, I'll have her heart.

434
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,760
Don't forget.

435
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,440
You gave up your right to her

436
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,200
the day you became Mark Jongtraipattana.

437
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,280
<i>Are you out of the police station yet?</i>

438
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,240
<i>Did you really do it or not, Parin?!</i>

439
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,760
MOM

440
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,760
Risa, you know I didn't do it, right?

441
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,800
Yes.

442
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,240
I believe

443
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
you had nothing to do with it.

444
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,840
Your father must be furious with me.

445
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm afraid
he won't let me be with you anymore.

446
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,800
No matter what my father says,

447
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,920
I'll be by your side.

448
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,360
You don't have to worry about that.

449
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,080
That handsome face of yours
is looking a little run-down now.

450
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,040
If you keep stressing out,

451
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,320
you'll age before your time.

452
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,840
Here, eat something.

453
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Just a little food to keep you going.

454
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,560
Parin…

455
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,600
I'll always be here with you.

456
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,720
Risa…

457
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,960
Parin…

458
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,360
It's okay.

459
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,440
I'm here now.

460
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,400
Risa…

461
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,880
When's he coming back?

462
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,920
That's Ms. Arisa's car.
They must've been together.

463
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,120
Thanks, Risa.

464
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,800
Oh.

465
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,160
You were almost thrown in jail,

466
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,520
and you still had the nerve to go out
with a woman instead of coming home?

467
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,000
I'm tired. I want to rest.

468
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,560
Don't walk away from me, Parin!

469
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,960
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

470
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,600
I was terrified you'd mess up,
terrified you'd go to jail, everything.

471
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,320
And you think she matters more than me?

472
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,440
You're just scared you won't get
to be the mother of H Group's CEO!

473
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,840
You're scared you'll lose your status,
be looked down on.

474
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,480
But you're never afraid
of how much pain I'm in,

475
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,120
how exhausted I am,
how much pressure I'm under!

476
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,120
Who taught you to talk
to your mother like this? Was it Arisa?!

477
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,080
Risa has nothing to do with this.

478
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,680
You're the one who raised me this way.

479
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,320
You're the one
who commands me and lectures me.

480
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,160
You think you know everything.
You control every part of my life!

481
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,720
Parin! Parin!

482
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,560
Please, calm down, ma'am.

483
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,480
Breathe in…

484
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,680
and out…

485
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,640
Breathe, ma'am.

486
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,280
<i>This is the beginning.</i>
<i>Sooner or later, I'll have her heart.</i>

487
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,240
<i>Don't forget.</i>

488
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,960
<i>You gave up your right to her the day</i>
<i>you became Mark Jongtraipattana.</i>

489
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,360
- A glass of red wine, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

490
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,720
Still drinking whiskey, I see.

491
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,840
Excuse me?

492
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,480
Sorry. You just look
so much like my brother.

493
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,520
I thought you might be him.

494
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,560
Have we met before?

495
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,680
Triprapa Hemaratsiri.

496
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,880
Ms. Triprapa.

497
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,880
I'm not surprised you don't remember me.

498
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,080
That day, you were too busy
canceling our business deal.

499
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,360
Why say it like I'm the villain
who came to ruin your plans?

500
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,160
The truth is, I was just addressing
a breach of business etiquette.

501
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,440
H Group violated our agreement,
and I had to act.

502
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,720
Sure, your side may not be happy,
but if I hadn't acted,

503
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,320
my father would've been far less pleased.

504
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,880
That may be so.

505
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,720
But a few words from you
ruined a massive project.

506
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,480
And you became
the center of media attention

507
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,480
as the secret son of Chairman Wang,

508
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,000
hidden away all this time.

509
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,840
That's understandable.

510
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,080
The more I look at you,

511
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,920
the more I think of Yai.

512
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,560
Who?

513
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:47,120
I meant Mr. Mekhin,
the eldest Hemaratsiri heir.

514
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,560
The former eldest. Turns out
he's not even blood-related, right?

515
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,600
Ever since I returned,
people kept mistaking me for him.

516
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,680
I'm starting to question
if I'm Mark or Mekhin.

517
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,880
Are you worried about something?

518
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,320
People think
I'm the one who started the rumor

519
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,320
that Yai wasn't a real Hemaratsiri.

520
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,240
I'm scared he'll think

521
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,800
I did it out of malice.

522
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,680
If Mekhin were still alive,
I think he'd understand.

523
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,640
Yes.

524
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,440
I hope he knows how much I love him.

525
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,120
About the hospital project,

526
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,840
I'd like us to revisit the discussion.

527
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,400
Whatever JW wants,

528
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,760
I'll help negotiate.

529
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,800
I'm afraid
you might lose more than you gain.

530
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,440
If I get to work with you,

531
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,000
I'd say it's worth it.

532
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,600
Thank you.

533
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,360
I'll think about it.

534
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,040
And…

535
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,520
Please tell your family
to prepare their lawyers.

536
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,160
I'm holding a press conference tomorrow.

537
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,680
Whoa!

538
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,760
What's wrong
with Chairman Wang's secretary?

539
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,400
How many times do I have to call her?

540
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,080
Parin! Parin!

541
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,800
Look at this!

542
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,800
<i>Good day. I'm Mark Jongtraipattana,</i>

543
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,440
<i>CEO of JW Development.</i>

544
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,240
<i>I'm Dylan Jongtraipattana, Deputy CEO</i>

545
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,960
<i>of JW Development.</i>

546
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,480
<i>I'd like to formally announce</i>

547
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,840
<i>that JW Development</i>

548
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,320
<i>will terminate all business partnerships</i>
<i>with H Group from now on.</i>

549
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,240
It's over! It's all ruined!

550
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,600
Mom! Stop yelling
and let me finish listening first.

551
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,080
<i>Due to H Group's breach of contract</i>
<i>with JW Development,</i>

552
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,720
<i>we have filed a lawsuit seeking damages.</i>

553
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,400
Parin…

554
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,720
The court papers.

555
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,960
They're suing for 300 million.

556
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,360
Three hundred million?!

557
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,520
And we have to demolish
all structures on their land

558
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,200
and return it as a cleared site.

559
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,320
They're really going for the kill.

560
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,000
Damages, demolition costs.
It's not a small hit.

561
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,960
Are you going to accept this, Parin?

562
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,080
There's a signed agreement
about the cocktail lounge.

563
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,520
If we fight, we'll lose.

564
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,880
You'd better deal with this quickly.

565
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,920
I know, Mom!

566
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,240
Tri, go get Uncle Mote and Aunt Nuan.
Emergency meeting. Now.

567
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,280
I've been wanting to visit you,
Chairman Wang.

568
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,360
Today I came to offer my congratulations

569
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,520
on your eldest son taking the reins.

570
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,120
Congratulations.

571
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,560
You didn't have to go to all this trouble.

572
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,760
It's no trouble at all.

573
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:43,640
The fact that you allowed me this meeting
is already a great honor.

574
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,680
Ever since I learned
what Met did to you back then,

575
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,800
I've had nothing but respect for you.

576
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,680
In fact, I'd love to hear
your advice on doing business.

577
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,600
What do you want?

578
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,480
I was hoping you'd consider

579
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,720
changing the cocktail lounge project
into a hospital instead.

580
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,600
And what do I get in return?

581
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,800
A premium hospital for VVIP clients.

582
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,440
If you support this project,

583
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,360
in addition to your shares,

584
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,080
I'll give you 30% of the net profit.

585
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,520
I promise it'll be far more profitable

586
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,400
than the cocktail lounge.

587
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,800
You're here negotiating this deal.

588
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,600
Does Parin know about it?

589
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,720
This project will be under my management.
I'll handle him.

590
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,560
But Parin
still holds all the power in H Group.

591
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,040
Won't that cause trouble later?

592
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,760
I have ways of handling that.

593
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,920
If you agree to this deal,

594
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,160
I'll take care of the board myself.

595
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,840
That smile… So, it went well?

596
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,680
How's your side with the board?

597
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,120
I gathered more than half
who are unhappy with Parin.

598
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,360
Good. Chairman Wang
should be close to giving us an answer.

599
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,680
He's probably just weighing the benefits.

600
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,880
Looks like we're going to get
squeezed hard again for this one.

601
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,200
But it's worth it.

602
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,840
This project is my ticket
to becoming the CEO of H Group.

603
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,160
And it won't be long
before Parin's out of the picture.

604
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,360
That CEO seat at H Group
is finally within your reach, Mote.

605
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,960
I'm going to make it mine.

606
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,960
Everything is going to be yours.

607
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,800
Parin still has no idea
that Pramote is sabotaging him.

608
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,080
Pramote is worse than a snake.

609
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,440
Yeah.

610
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,560
I used to think
he was the weakest in the family,

611
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,920
until he hired someone to kill me
and Poot and staged the whole thing.

612
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,240
If Parin hadn't sent Methas that day,
things could've turned out much worse.

613
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,240
And if Mark really is Mekhin,
what would you do?

614
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,240
So what? He's not blood-related to us.

615
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,480
He can't do anything to Hemaratsiri.

616
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,840
He ordered your death.

617
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,440
That's enough. Who sent you to kill Poot?

618
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,440
No one. I did it on my own.

619
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,400
Hey!

620
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,760
I asked who sent you to kill Poot.

621
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,680
I told you, I did it myself.
You deaf or what?

622
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,200
It's unbelievable how Poot's death

623
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,360
has opened so many doors for us.

624
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,760
It's your time now, Mote.

625
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,760
And Joe? Did you shut him up?

626
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,680
I've paid him off.

627
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,600
He won't rat you out. No way.

628
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,960
Interesting.

629
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,120
There must be something fishy
behind those two…

630
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,880
About the deaths of Chairman Preeda

631
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,200
and Mei.

632
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,360
I want to know
what Mark plans to do to Hemaratsiri.

633
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,880
This is about Mark's mother.

634
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,640
Don't bother hiding who you are anymore.

635
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,240
It's obvious from how you want
to destroy H Group that you're Yai.

636
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,960
So, this is what
a two-faced person looks like.

637
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,440
I learned from the best. You, Aunt Nuan.

638
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:20,800
Tri!

639
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,560
I'm ready to answer your question now.

640
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,760
Who connected Poot's death
to Chairman Preeda's?

641
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,280
<i>I always end up risking my life</i>
<i>for the stupidest things.</i>

642
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,400
Especially when
it comes to someone I love.

643
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,760
<i>Hello, Meena?</i>

644
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,680
<i>Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai, help me!</i>

645
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,840
<i>Who are you people?</i>

646
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,280
Mekhin, your fiancé, is dead.

647
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,400
<i>Why are you clinging to me?</i>

648
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,800
The Jongtraipattana family

649
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,000
is full of absolute bullshit and drama!

650
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,000
What, trying to enjoy
some warm family bonding time?

651
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,760
Try it. It's good.

652
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,760
