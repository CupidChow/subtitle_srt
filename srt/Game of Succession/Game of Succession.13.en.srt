1
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,280
She sold herself to be here,

2
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,920
and now she's pretending to be the victim.

3
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,400
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

4
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,520
<i>Today, I will oversee</i>

5
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
<i>the voting process</i>

6
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,360
<i>for the new Chairman of H Group.</i>

7
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,080
As soon as my parents are safe,

8
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,720
I'll tell you the truth.

9
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,080
<i>You're more capable than I thought.</i>

10
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,480
By now,
everyone must've seen the real will.

11
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,080
How do you have the real will?

12
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,840
We've found the official will
of Mr. Preeda Hemaratsiri.

13
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,640
You don't have
any more objections, do you?

14
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,400
<i>You've completely destroyed Mekhin's life.</i>

15
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,840
Your father would be proud

16
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,960
to see you earn that seat

17
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,960
through your own merit.

18
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,400
A seat that no matter how hard Yai tries,

19
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,000
he'll never claim.

20
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,200
How is this possible?!

21
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,800
<i>I trusted you with everything.</i>

22
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Why did you betray me?
Why did you betray me, Meena? Why?!

23
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,520
"Parin Hemaratsiri

24
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,400
has become the new Chairman of H Group."

25
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,640
How did you manage
to get the will to Parin, Dad?

26
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,520
Dad?

27
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,480
Mr. Parin is here, sir.

28
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,480
Congratulations,

29
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,040
Mr. Chairman.

30
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,840
Everything went smoothly, thanks to you.

31
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,880
I appreciate you keeping your word.

32
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,519
So, how did Mekhin react?

33
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,080
He's now a complete loser.

34
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,840
I don’t know how you managed
to get Monmeena to take the will from him,

35
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,960
but Mekhin was furious.

36
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,720
He nearly killed her with his own hands.

37
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,880
I have to be somewhere.

38
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,120
Well, I’m listening.

39
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
You definitely didn’t help me
become Chairman

40
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,080
out of mercy, did you?

41
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,400
What do you want in return?

42
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,120
I’ve chosen the right side.

43
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,200
To fully avenge what Pramet did,

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,760
you must ensure Mekhin
loses all his power in H Group.

45
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,840
Why do I get the feeling

46
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,560
your desire to destroy Mekhin
has nothing to do

47
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,200
with your grudge against Uncle Met?

48
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,760
It’s better for everyone

49
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,760
and it makes your position
as Chairman more secure.

50
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,200
It’s already secure,
even with him still around.

51
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,440
And your request--

52
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,640
My needs

53
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,840
are not requests.

54
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,960
Helping me get hold of the will

55
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,000
doesn't give you power over me, Chairman.

56
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,720
Mekhin is a wounded beast.

57
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,000
But everyone still thinks
he's king of the jungle.

58
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,360
And you…

59
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,080
You’re just a fox,
everything handed to you by the will.

60
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,120
Do you realize that?

61
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,760
I have other matters to attend to.

62
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,960
Please excuse me.

63
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,440
How long until I’m appointed
as estate manager?

64
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,120
How much longer will it take?

65
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,480
Mr. Yai.

66
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,760
Can you let me explain?

67
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
When did you find out
your parents are still alive?

68
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,400
Back at the hospital.
I never meant to betray you.

69
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,040
But…

70
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,120
Chairman Wang threatened me

71
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,000
with my parents' lives.

72
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,360
You have to believe me, Mr. Yai.

73
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,840
I've never seen dedication like yours.

74
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,600
You sold yourself

75
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,840
just to repay a debt of gratitude.

76
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,480
If I were your parent, I’d be so proud
my daughter was such a great actress,

77
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,080
good enough to fool someone like me
into believing

78
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,200
- she loved me.
- No, Mr. Yai.

79
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,080
I didn't fool you.

80
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,400
Everything I did for you

81
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,240
came from love. I love you.

82
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,600
My feelings were real.

83
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,880
I’ve always been honest with you.

84
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,400
Do you hear me, Mr. Yai?

85
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,080
If you were really honest with me,

86
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,800
why didn't you tell me the truth?

87
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
I love you…

88
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,560
but I couldn’t risk losing my parents.

89
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,480
You didn’t think I could protect you?

90
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,320
If you’d told me the truth
from the beginning,

91
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,600
none of this would have happened.

92
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,160
Mr. Yai…

93
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,960
Mr. Yai, I'm sorry.

94
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,200
You can make me do anything.

95
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,760
I only want to make things right with you.

96
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,040
You can tell me to do anything.
I'm all in, Mr. Yai. Please.

97
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,320
But I'm asking you.

98
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,560
Please give me a chance
to prove that I really love you.

99
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,280
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

100
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,640
Please…

101
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
I've lied to you,

102
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,360
and now you've betrayed me.

103
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,480
We're even.

104
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,000
We're done, Meena.

105
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,640
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!
Please listen to me!

106
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,000
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

107
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,320
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

108
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,560
Meena!

109
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

110
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,720
Mr. Yai…

111
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,960
Don't you think this is too much?!

112
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,000
Meena followed my dad's orders.
She's not at fault!

113
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,000
Nosy. Just like your father!

114
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,880
What the hell do you all want from me?!

115
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,320
You're such a sore loser!

116
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,320
What did you just say?

117
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
A loser who takes it out on a woman.

118
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Stop!

119
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,440
Inthon, Max, get Dylan out of here!

120
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,320
- Let go. Let go!
- Stop!

121
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,120
Are you all ganging up on me? Let go!

122
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,760
Did Meena call you to pick her up?

123
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,200
You’ve already destroyed Yai,

124
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,760
so now it’s time to leave, right?

125
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,800
No!

126
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,440
I didn’t ask anyone to come get me.
I’m telling the truth, Mr. Yai!

127
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,920
You can go or stay, I don’t care.

128
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,160
Leave. Go on your way.

129
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,920
I’m not going anywhere!

130
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,040
I’ll stay right here with Mr. Yai.

131
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,160
With the man I love.

132
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,120
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

133
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,120
Mr. Yai! Please wait for me!

134
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,320
Meena!

135
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,840
- Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!
- To H Club.

136
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,480
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai. Mr. Yai.

137
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,280
Listen to me, Mr. Yai.

138
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,160
Mr. Yai. Mr. Yai!

139
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,920
- Meena.
- Dylan, let go of me.

140
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,920
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai, please.

141
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,760
- Mr. Yai, please listen to me.
- Meena, enough!

142
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,280
- Dylan! Please, listen to me, Mr. Yai!
- That's enough, Meena.

143
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,640
- Dylan!
- Stop!

144
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,560
Let go! Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai! Dylan!

145
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,720
Mr. Yai! Please listen to me! Mr. Yai!

146
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,560
Let go of me!

147
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,440
You caused Yai to lose everything,

148
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
and you still have
the audacity to stay here?

149
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,000
Do you really think
Yai will accept a traitor like you?

150
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,840
Ms. Triprapa.

151
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,360
Did you hear Mr. Yai
ask me to leave even once?

152
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,880
- Shameless.
- Yes, I'm shameless.

153
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,840
I’ll be shameless as long
as I’m with the one I love!

154
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,120
Except for Mr. Yai himself, no one can
kick me out of this place. Remember that!

155
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,000
Mr. Mekhin.

156
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,480
H Club’s financial report for this month,

157
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,200
to be submitted to the estate,
is ready for your signature.

158
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,760
I'm not sending
a single baht to the estate.

159
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,440
- Didn't you hear what I said?
- Right.

160
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,400
Mr. Parin won’t let that slide.
He’ll use his authority to force you.

161
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,040
The authority is still in my hands.

162
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,040
It’ll take a few more months
before they get court approval.

163
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,040
Inthon.

164
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,000
Make an appointment
with the H Group board here. Tonight.

165
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,000
I'll cut off their lifelines.

166
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,720
I'll let them see that without me,

167
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,400
H Group will collapse.

168
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,000
Poot, wait.

169
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,800
I've never seen these three before.

170
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,240
They’re new.
The manager brought them in today.

171
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,080
Where are you taking them?

172
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,400
This group is for welcoming
Mr. Yai’s VVIP guests.

173
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,880
What?

174
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,040
A whole new group?

175
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Yeah.

176
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,680
I heard the guests requested
something extra special.

177
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,120
Go ahead. Show them in.

178
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,160
Yes. Let's go, girls.

179
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,840
If Mr. Parin has all the power now,
will Mr. Yai be okay?

180
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,680
- What are you saying?
- Well…

181
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,280
We work for Mr. Yai.

182
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,200
If he goes down, we go down too.

183
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,880
Poot.

184
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,080
Mr. Yai won’t fall that easily.

185
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,640
- Don't worry, okay?
- Yeah.

186
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,040
But Mr. Parin

187
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,680
already holds legitimate power
according to the will.

188
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,280
For the land around the cocktail lounge
project you bought,

189
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,760
if I plan to expand it
into a full-service entertainment complex,

190
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,800
I’ll offer you three times the land value.

191
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,880
That’s hundreds of millions.

192
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
And I’ve never made a promise
I couldn’t keep.

193
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,960
That’s not even counting
what I’ll earn from foreign tourism.

194
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,960
Is the growth guaranteed?

195
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,200
Ten percent every quarter.

196
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,200
The real power still comes
from the board’s decisions.

197
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,120
Even if he’s the chairman,
if the board doesn’t approve,

198
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,120
Parin won’t be able to do anything.

199
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,440
That's true.

200
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,280
We should choose our leader
based on ability,

201
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,480
not just a piece of paper.

202
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,160
Cheers.

203
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
Oh.

204
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,360
Wow. These girls are looking good.

205
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,880
Good evening.

206
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,560
These three girls
will be taking care of you tonight, sirs.

207
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,000
Let's go, girls.

208
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,040
Okay.

209
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,160
Would you like another drink, Mr. Yai?

210
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,600
- How is it going tonight?
- Busy. Lots of guests.

211
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,560
Good. Keep an eye on things.

212
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,800
Of course.

213
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,599
Manager.

214
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,560
Where are you taking those two?

215
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,720
I'm bringing them to Mr. Mekhin's room.

216
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,880
What? But Poot
already brought three girls there.

217
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,400
He said you handpicked them yourself.

218
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,520
That's impossible.

219
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,160
I just brought these two.
I didn’t send anyone else.

220
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,760
Please excuse me.

221
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,960
Then who were the other three?

222
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,320
Max, the police are here.

223
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,920
This is the police! Turn the lights on!

224
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,720
Turn them on!

225
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,240
Officer, how can I help you?

226
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,920
We’ve received a report

227
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,280
that this place
is forcing girls under 18 years old

228
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,560
to provide sexual services.

229
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,360
- Search the premises!
- Wait.

230
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,160
You can’t do that without a warrant.

231
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,280
Not cooperating

232
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,160
means you're obstructing
a police investigation.

233
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,360
Search!

234
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,640
- Pour one for Inthon.
- Yes, sir.

235
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,880
- Mr. Yai!
- What is it?

236
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,360
The police are here.

237
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,560
Someone accused us of sexual exploitation.

238
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,480
Apologies. There's an emergency.

239
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,200
Please, everyone, follow me to the back.

240
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,000
Please.

241
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,240
This way. Quickly, please.

242
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,160
Are you Mr. Mekhin Hemaratsiri,
owner of this establishment?

243
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,440
Is there a problem?

244
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,600
It was reported that girls under 18

245
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,560
are being sexually exploited here

246
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,880
and that H Club profits from prostitution.

247
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,480
There are no minors working here.

248
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,240
And we do not engage in prostitution.

249
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,200
Regardless,

250
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,320
I'll need to see the ID
of every employee here.

251
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,680
This way.

252
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,200
Please hurry. Quickly.

253
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,000
Everyone.

254
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,640
The police are searching
the front entrance.

255
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,680
You'll have to leave
before they make it to this area.

256
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,560
But our cars are in the front parking lot!

257
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,480
Then give me your car keys.
I’ll have our guys drive them to you.

258
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,640
Hurry. Hurry.

259
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,480
How are we supposed to get out of here?

260
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,160
- Ms. Apapat?
- Are you coming with me,

261
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,920
or are you going down with Mekhin?

262
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,160
Well?

263
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,320
Let’s go. We have to move.

264
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Show your ID.

265
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,040
Captain.

266
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,960
This girl was born in 2007.

267
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,480
She's under 18.

268
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,720
Mr. Mekhin.

269
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,160
You’ll need to come with us
to the station for questioning.

270
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,600
You know I’d never risk everything
by exploiting minors.

271
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,440
This was staged to frame me.

272
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,880
If that’s true, then you were reckless.

273
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,600
That’s how they managed to set you up.

274
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,520
So, just get me out of here first.

275
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,240
I’ll clear everything up right after.

276
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,000
How am I supposed to help you?

277
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,320
You were arrested in the act.

278
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,560
<i>There’s a victim, there’s evidence,</i>
<i>it all points to you.</i>

279
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,680
If I help you,
I’m dragging myself into this mess.

280
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,080
Oh, and I heard Chairman Preeda’s will

281
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,800
doesn’t even mention your name, right?

282
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,880
The roles in this game have changed.

283
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,920
Sir, it's your turn.

284
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,080
Checkmate.

285
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,920
Oh, I’m with a guest right now.
Can’t talk. Later.

286
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,720
Thank you

287
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,840
for helping out with the club tonight.

288
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,200
Just make sure you keep your promises.

289
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,160
I'll keep supporting you
just like Grandpa always did.

290
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,440
Oh, you said you’d take over
H Club in three days.

291
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,000
Would Mekhin really
let that happen so easily?

292
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,200
Even if he doesn’t,
there’s nothing he can do.

293
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,040
- Well then, cheers.
- Cheers.

294
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,640
Parin.

295
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,520
Congratulations on becoming
the new chairman of H Group.

296
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,920
I was thrilled when I heard the news.

297
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,360
Then you shouldn't have waited.
You could’ve called me anytime.

298
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,200
Don't be upset.

299
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,760
I wanted to call, but I was afraid

300
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,920
you'd be busy
handling the whole succession process.

301
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,360
I was worried about you, so I held back.

302
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,840
Is that true?

303
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,000
Everything I said is true.

304
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,080
So, don't tell me

305
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,560
you're here because I didn’t call you.

306
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,200
I came to ask your father
for help with Yai.

307
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,480
See? You’re here for business.

308
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,960
Not for me.

309
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,120
I'm sorry. I really am busy.

310
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,320
What happened?

311
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,000
Who brought them here?

312
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,120
The manager brought those girls in.

313
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,440
I didn't know.

314
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,040
I checked the CCTV.

315
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,040
No one brought them in.

316
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,600
You’re the only one who contacted them.

317
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,680
You betrayed Mr. Yai.
Who are you working for?

318
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,120
I only work for Mr. Yai!

319
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,840
I've never betrayed him.

320
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,440
If you won't tell me,

321
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,640
then die.

322
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,520
- Hey.
- I never betrayed Mr. Yai.

323
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,720
What did you say?

324
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,240
I never betrayed Mr--

325
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,080
- Inthon.
- Who ordered you to do it?

326
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,760
Don't shoot me.

327
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,720
And what did Father say?
Will he be able to help Mekhin?

328
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,160
Are you worried about Yai?

329
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,000
Yes. I’ve known him for a long time.
We’re close.

330
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,720
I think of him as a big brother.

331
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,560
So, why wouldn’t a sister like me
worry about him?

332
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,080
Right?

333
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,880
What about me?

334
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,520
To you, what am I?

335
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,760
Hello, Father.

336
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,240
<i>Risa, where are you now?</i>
<i>Are you almost home?</i>

337
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,000
I’m almost there.

338
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,440
Father called. I have to go.

339
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,040
Let's talk later.

340
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,400
Really, Inthon? What do we do now?

341
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,680
Okay, keep watching.

342
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,880
Keep me posted.

343
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,600
- Aunt Bua.
- Yes?

344
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,040
Did you see the news about Mr. Yai?

345
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,080
He was taken
to the police station last night.

346
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,160
What are we supposed to do now?

347
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,920
Mr. Mote and the others won’t go help him.

348
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,000
Ms. Tri will.
She’ll definitely help Mr. Yai.

349
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,800
Yes. I’ll inform her.

350
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,960
Wasn't it too risky?
I think it was too risky.

351
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,080
Uncle Mote! Do you want
the whole world to find out about this?

352
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,040
But H Club is our lifeline.

353
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,000
If the news gets out and it gets
shut down, what are we going to do?

354
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,800
I just asked Mr. Noppachai

355
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,320
to detain Yai to buy me some time

356
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,800
until we can vote him out
at today’s meeting.

357
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,680
Who's that?

358
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,200
Parin!

359
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,080
Parin, Uncle Mote.
Did you hear what happened to Yai?

360
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,080
I'm talking to Uncle Mote

361
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,800
about getting help form Mr. Noppachai.

362
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,560
Then ask him to release Yai now.

363
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,480
Sexual exploitation
is a serious charge, Tri.

364
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,560
Don’t act rashly.

365
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,560
If the media finds out
and makes it the headline,

366
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,000
we’ll all be in huge trouble.

367
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,480
Don't worry, Tri. We'll get Yai out.

368
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,280
Ms. Tri.

369
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,320
I suspect this was Mr. Parin’s plan
to get Mr. Yai arrested.

370
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,080
What the hell are you saying?

371
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,240
How is it, Inthon?

372
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,840
Ms. Tri? Okay.

373
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,000
Inthon wants to report
something to you, miss.

374
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,440
What is it?

375
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,920
That girl has been
confirmed to be a minor.

376
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,240
The evidence is crystal clear,

377
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,960
so you’re in serious trouble.

378
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,560
How many times do I have to say it?

379
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,480
The number one rule at H Club is that
no minors are allowed to work here.

380
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,040
Saying that won’t help you now.

381
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,840
If we keep digging,

382
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,640
you could be facing even more charges.

383
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,080
Trust me, unless you want
everything you’ve built to go to waste.

384
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,280
Was it Parin?

385
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,480
I heard he’s got a police friend
he’s trying to get promoted.

386
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,760
So, it's you.

387
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,480
You're defaming a police officer.

388
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,240
I knew right away
from checking your financial records

389
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,200
how your friendship with Parin

390
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,440
works in favor of both sides.

391
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,800
Captain, Ms. Triprapa Hemaratsiri
is here to see you.

392
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,600
Tell her I'm busy.

393
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,000
But she said there'll be a problem
if you don't meet her.

394
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,240
I won't be able to help you.

395
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,880
Being from an influential family

396
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,800
doesn't guarantee you any privileges.

397
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,320
And if you're pressuring me
with your last name,

398
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,680
then be ready to explain it to the media.

399
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,160
We're here to bring
more evidence to you, Captain.

400
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,240
I figured it’d make your job easier.

401
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,480
Inthon.

402
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,600
VOICE RECORDING

403
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,560
<i>Captain Methas said it's an easy job.</i>

404
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,520
<i>Just show the police</i>
<i>a fake ID to prove we're minors.</i>

405
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,760
<i>He's paying 50,000 baht each. Wanna do it?</i>

406
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,480
<i>H Club owner was arrested.</i>

407
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,240
<i>Did that captain pay you? I'm waiting.</i>

408
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,760
Staged messages like these

409
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,120
are easy to fabricate.

410
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,880
But we can check the ID numbers, right?

411
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,440
Numbers don't lie. Right, Captain?

412
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,520
In that case, Mr. Noppachai will surely
cut ties with a troublemaker like you.

413
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,920
If you refuse to help Yai,

414
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,520
I'll have to tell the press too.

415
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,360
Yai!

416
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,040
Thank you so much, Tri.

417
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,280
Without you, I'd be in trouble.

418
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,800
I can do anything to protect you.

419
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,320
We have found no evidence
that Mr. Mekhin is guilty as charged.

420
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,800
You can take him home.

421
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,760
I can't go home yet.

422
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,880
You're the one who needs to fix

423
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,680
my ruined reputation.

424
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,680
Is there any truth to the news
that Mr. Mekhin's H Club

425
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,160
is sexually exploiting minors?

426
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,840
Captain Methas will provide
the answer to that.

427
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,160
Has Mr. Mekhin been found guilty
as the police accused him of?

428
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,040
Right now, Mr. Mekhin is innocent.

429
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,080
Based on the claim
that the girl was a minor,

430
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,760
we found it wasn’t true.

431
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,320
She's of legal age,

432
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,520
and she offered the service willingly

433
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,480
without any knowledge
or involvement from H Club.

434
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,239
What about the person who tipped you off?

435
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,760
- Right.
- Who was it?

436
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,320
We're still investigating
who filed the report.

437
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
We suspect it was a false tip

438
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,880
intended to defame Mr. Mekhin.

439
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,080
I believe this was an attempt
to undermine me,

440
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,880
by staging a crime to ruin
the reputation of me and H Club.

441
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,159
I’ll find whoever did this,

442
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,480
to protect H Group's name.

443
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,480
But we've been informed by H Group
that the board has decided

444
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,360
to remove you from every position
just 20 minutes ago.

445
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,440
Right.

446
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,480
- Yes.
- Did you know about this?

447
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,760
Have you been informed?

448
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,639
What really happened?

449
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,639
Mr. Yai, we need
to go to H Group right now.

450
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,159
I'll talk to the board and use
these voice recordings as evidence.

451
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,520
They’ll reconsider their decision.

452
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,520
That won't work, Tri. Lek and Uncle Mote
used this scandal to get rid of me.

453
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,760
If the board agreed, it means they’re
satisfied with whatever they were offered.

454
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,160
There’s nothing we can do.

455
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,840
Then, what are you going to do?

456
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,280
I'd like to thank all of you
for working with me to remove Mekhin.

457
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,600
Terrible behavior
that damages the company,

458
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,120
like sexual exploitation, is unacceptable.

459
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,360
Punishing even executives

460
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,160
will boost H Group’s image.

HEAVEN HOME FINANCIAL STATEMENT

464
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,320
Someone just sent me a file.

465
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,960
Why is it titled

466
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,280
"Manipulated Financial Documents

467
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,760
of Heaven Home"?

468
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,920
<i>The file I sent to all of you</i>
<i>is part of the financial data</i>

469
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
<i>that Heaven Home executives</i>

470
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,360
<i>have been manipulating</i>

471
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,480
<i>to send to H Group's central account</i>
<i>for the last five years.</i>

472
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,440
It's not true! He's lying!

473
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,160
<i>And soon, I’ll show you all the proof</i>

474
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,800
<i>of how much you’ve lost</i>
<i>to these corrupt people.</i>

475
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,760
Mr. Yai, are you hungry?

476
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,320
You should go shower. I asked
Aunt Bua to make some rice porridge.

477
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,480
You did a lot for me today, Tri.

478
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,320
I was happy to.

479
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,120
Thank you so much, Tri.

480
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,800
Why are you still here?

481
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,920
Your presence here
only brings more pain to Yai,

482
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,280
since everything he’s gone through
was because of you.

483
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,560
Is Yai's porridge ready?

484
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,880
Yes, I'm going up to serve it.

485
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,680
Let me take it to him.

486
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,640
Uh…

487
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,600
Thank you.

488
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,040
<i>The roles in this game have changed.</i>

489
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,280
<i>Sir, it's your turn.</i>

490
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,640
Yai, the porridge is ready.

491
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,400
I'll be right behind you, Tri.

492
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,240
Tri…

493
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,280
Yes?

494
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,680
I'll be right behind you.

495
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,240
Yes.

496
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,880
HEAVEN HOME FINANCIAL STATEMENT
AND REPORT FROM AUTHORIZED AUDITOR

497
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,040
There are statements from the last
three years to be checked by the auditor.

498
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,200
Why didn’t you get it done?

499
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,920
According to the plan, we would
check it after the will was read.

500
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,160
We were going to expose this
once Mr. Yai became chairman.

501
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,520
We need to deal with these documents fast.

502
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,600
I’ll hold the press conference and remove
all of them from their positions.

503
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,560
Then I’ll call the auditor in.

504
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,320
No.

505
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,600
Lek and the others know about this.

506
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
We can’t let any outsiders in now.

507
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,400
But how can we do it
without the auditor, Mr. Yai?

508
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,640
I want to help, but this isn't my thing.

509
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,240
I can help.

510
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,440
Stay out of this.

511
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,880
You can't handle this alone.

512
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,280
I said stay out of it.

513
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,920
Why don’t you kick her out
of the penthouse already?

514
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,720
Why are you letting her
be such a nuisance here?

515
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,600
Get some rest, Tri.
You've already helped me a lot today.

516
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,640
Why is it so hard to bring Yai down?

517
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,120
We ousted him. I thought he was done.

518
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,080
Now he’s throwing a damn bomb at us!

519
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,840
And these people won’t stop calling me!
When will you stop?!

520
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,720
What took you so damn long?!
Get out so we can talk!

521
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,720
Parin, you need to do something,

522
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,840
or you'll be thrown off that chair.

523
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,760
You need to destroy
whatever documents Mekhin has.

524
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,120
How are we supposed to know
where he keeps them?

525
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,640
I think I know where they are.

BALANCE SHEET OF 2020

528
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,960
Poot betrayed us.
He’s working for Mr. Lek.

529
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,400
What should we do with him, Mr. Yai?

530
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,320
Forget that for now. I'll handle him.

531
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
We need to focus on these documents.

532
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,000
I tried comparing them with older
statements the auditor commented on.

533
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,880
But I don’t know
how I’m supposed to check them.

534
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,120
We're not the experts. How are we
supposed to explain any of this?

535
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,240
Without an auditor, this will be our
weakness at the press conference, Mr. Yai.

536
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,160
- The expenses--
- What did I tell you?

537
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,840
Need to have reference documents.

538
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,000
You need to look for unusual expenses
in the reference documents,

539
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,360
to find signs of irregular transactions.

540
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,920
I know you all can’t spot what’s off.

541
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,080
You need my help.

542
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,200
Mr. Yai, please let Ms. Meena help.

543
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,280
Please, Mr. Yai.

544
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,680
I know it's hard for you to trust me,

545
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,280
but I’m the only one who can help you now.

546
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,160
Here's your coffee.

547
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,720
Mr. Yai, you've been questioned
at the police station all day.

548
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,160
You must be exhausted.

549
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,880
Get some rest. I'll handle this.

550
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,040
Uh, hey, I need to go.

551
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,560
Yai.

552
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,560
Yai?

553
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,000
What are you doing, Tri?

554
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,040
I love you, Yai.

555
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,240
I have for a long time.

556
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,480
I love you the way a woman loves a man.

557
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,240
Please don't reject me.

558
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,040
We can't love each other like that, Tri.

559
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,120
You're my little sister.

560
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,760
Yeah?

561
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,840
I know you know we could be together.

562
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,720
What are you talking about?

563
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,600
All this time, I’ve always been
by your side, helping you.

564
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,920
If you give me a chance,

565
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,520
I'll help you become chairman of H Group.

566
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,040
We'll take everything from Parin

567
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,720
and rule Hemaratsiri together.

568
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,760
Do you realize what you’re saying?

569
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,240
It's because I love you.

570
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,080
But we can't be together, Tri!

571
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,280
We are siblings.

572
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,760
We're not siblings.

573
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,640
You're the son of Ms. Mei and another man,

574
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,400
not Father's son.

575
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,840
We're not related by blood.

576
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,440
You’re furious that Grandpa used you.

577
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
That Parin got handed H Group

578
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,000
that you spent your whole life building.

579
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,400
I’m the one who’ll help you
get back at all of them.

580
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,200
Just give me a chance to love you

581
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,280
and be by your side as your wife.

582
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,680
Tri. Tri, listen to me.

583
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,520
I've always seen you as a sister,
and that will never change.

584
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,160
So, stop thinking like this.

585
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,200
If you still want me in your life,
stop this nonsense now.

586
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,000
And I’ll pretend it never happened.

587
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,080
Okay?

588
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,200
Is it because of her?

589
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,840
Monmeena fooled you

590
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,600
and made you lose H Group.

591
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,920
And you're still choosing her over me?!

592
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,920
Does she have to die
for you to finally see me?!

593
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,360
Even without Meena,

594
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,400
I'll never love you that way.

595
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,320
Fine.

596
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,920
If you don't love me,
you'll never have H Group.

597
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,200
Because I'm the only Hemaratsiri by blood.

598
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,360
If you don't love me,
you'll have nothing left.

599
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,760
Even if that’s true,

600
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,320
I'd still be happier
than being with you the way you want!

601
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,040
You'll regret
what you're doing to me today!

602
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,880
I managed to get Grandpa
to accept me, Mom.

603
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,160
Yai! Grandpa just announced
you’ll be in charge of H Club!

604
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,000
Father was furious
when you took H Club from him.

605
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,680
You're the best, Yai!

606
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,240
Ouch. Tri. Tri.

607
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,400
Does it hurt a lot?

608
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,920
It did when you shook it.

609
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,680
You're all beat up,
but it was worth it, right?

610
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,760
Yes, Aunt Bua.

611
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,520
Are you sure

612
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,280
you don't have any stab wounds
you haven’t noticed?

613
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,960
We'll go to the hospital
when you pass out then.

614
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,920
Don't worry, Ms. Mei.

615
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,040
I’ll patch him up. He’ll be good as new.

616
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,600
I’ve always troubled you.

617
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,720
Not at all.

618
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,960
I’m happy to patch you up for life.

619
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,520
But on one condition.

620
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,480
You have to take care of me
and protect me forever.

621
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,120
I'll do my best
to protect you, my little sister.

622
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,920
I promise.

623
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,560
And I'll always
stay by your side. I promise.

624
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,640
Oh.

625
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,560
I have no one left, Mom.

626
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,520
Are you sure your men can take him down?

627
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,320
We’ve come too far, Uncle Mote.
We can’t let Yai ruin our plan.

628
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,560
Tri.

629
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,240
What happened?

630
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,040
You're sending these men to take
the documents from Yai, aren't you?

631
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,240
That kind of pathetic tactic
won’t take him down.

632
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,240
Triprapa.

633
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,680
If you want Yai out of H Group,

634
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,720
just let everyone know that
Mr. Mekhin isn't a real Hemaratsiri.

635
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,800
Thank you, Uncle Mote.

636
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,200
Did you really hear

637
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,440
Grandpa say that?

638
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,320
You’re not just trying to trick us

639
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,760
into backing off the documents, are you?

640
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,400
You think Yai sent me here to play you?

641
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,960
Everyone knows

642
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,520
how much I used to idolize Yai.

643
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,720
You would’ve gone to war
with the whole world for him.

644
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,000
You were like Yai’s loyal dog.

645
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,520
It really used to be like that.

646
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,080
But a loyal dog
that gets its heart crushed

647
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,120
will bite back with everything it has

648
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,560
to show that stupid master

649
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,760
the costs

650
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,520
of betraying the love of that loyal dog.

651
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,360
You don't love Yai as a brother, do you?

652
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,960
When I came to ask Father
to take me in as his daughter,

653
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,560
Grandpa made us do a DNA test
to prove I was his child

654
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,960
before allowing me into the family.

655
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,560
If I don't help you,

656
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,160
no one can prove
that Yai’s not a Hemaratsiri by blood.

657
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,560
You want something in return, don’t you?

658
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,200
The position of vice chairman of H Group.

659
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,400
Don’t worry,
I’m not here to steal control.

660
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,080
I don’t have
the powerful connections you do.

661
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,200
You know I’m telling the truth.

662
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,880
I have no father left. I have no Yai.

663
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,040
I’ve been running
the foundation for years.

664
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,640
I know all the inner workings.

665
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,480
I just want a change
in career path, for once.

666
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,520
Aren't you going
to support me, Uncle Mote?

667
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,720
You’re actually really capable.

668
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,520
You shouldn’t be stuck
in a thankless job at the foundation.

669
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,880
She should work with you.

670
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,840
Keep her close.
If she tries anything funny,

671
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,960
it won’t be easy.

672
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,200
In exchange
for getting rid of a thorn like Yai,

673
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,080
we all know that’s a fair deal.

674
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,520
Being chairman of H Group
is Mr. Yai’s lifelong dream.

675
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,920
Even if it takes him a lifetime

676
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,960
to forgive me, I’ll wait.

677
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,040
When will Mr. Yai
get the chance to fight back?

678
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,040
That depends on us.

679
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,320
We need to find proof of their crimes.

680
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,040
Give me the numbers
on Heaven Home’s land purchases.

681
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,000
- Aunt Bua.
- Yes?

682
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,600
- I'd like some strong coffee.
- Right away!

683
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,320
Ms. Monmeena has been going
through the documents all night.

684
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,920
She feels truly guilty toward you.

685
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,200
So, she’s doing everything she can
to make it right.

686
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,720
I found it! I found it!

687
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,400
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai.

688
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,920
I found proof of fraud at Heaven Home.

689
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,400
How serious is it?

690
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,880
Enough to land them in prison.

691
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,160
Is it true

692
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,400
that you’re not a Hemaratsiri by blood?

693
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,360
<i>We'll have Mr. Mekhin</i>
<i>take a DNA test with Ms. Triprapa,</i>

694
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,000
<i>Mr. Pramet’s daughter,</i>

695
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:43,000
<i>who already confirmed her DNA with him.</i>

696
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,320
Once the result is out,
you won’t have a place here anymore.

697
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,840
Hemaratsiri will fall by my hands.

698
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,320
You’re just a whining loser.

699
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,560
A coward like you should focus on
