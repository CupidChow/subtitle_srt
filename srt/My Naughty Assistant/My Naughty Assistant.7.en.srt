What did you do last night?

69
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,400
Have you memorized your lines?

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Can you act or not?

71
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,800
I...

72
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,360
This paragraph.

73
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,520
Well.

74
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
I really want to fix you.

75
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,520
Could you give me
another chance, Director?

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,760
Well, you can do nothing.

77
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,760
Can't even speak your lines.

78
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,160
Just tell me if you don't want this job.

79
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,040
Don't waste our time here.

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,640
Got it?

81
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,880
Even can't memorize the lines.

82
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,760
How will you get acting jobs?

83
