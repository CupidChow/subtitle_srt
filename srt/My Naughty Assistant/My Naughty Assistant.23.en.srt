Duoduo, what happened?

I...

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,760
The show business has
both good and evil people.

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,080
The problem with the dual contract
will be solved.

Rumors about Enchen on the Internet

have been spread maliciously.

to prevent him from getting online.

At least it's much better than
just sitting around and doing nothing.

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,920
The audience won't buy it.

29
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,600
Now we can only
wait for the court ruling

30

and wait for it to blow over.

Hello.

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,640
What?

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,440
Mr. Liang.

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,360
She's here.

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,960
Miss Zhang Duoduo.

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,600
It's been a long time.

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,600
Duoduo.

39
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,560
Don't see me as your enemy.

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,040
As a talent of our company,

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,040
you took it on yourself
to write a song for someone who flopped.

42
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,640
Isn't it improper?

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,240
What a pity.

44
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,240
What exactly do you want?

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,320
Why do you keep
messing with me and Enchen?

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,800
I don't want anything from you.

47
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,240
What do you want?

48
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,320
It's simple.

49
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,040
I don't care about these songs

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,120
and I won't hold you responsible either.

51
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,000
I just want you
to follow me to the United States.

52
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,680
and never see him again.

five minutes to think about it.

Xing Enchen will completely flop.
