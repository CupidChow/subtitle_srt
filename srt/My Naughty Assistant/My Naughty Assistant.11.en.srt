It was all my fault.

37
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:17,920
It has nothing to do with him.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,720
After all, it involves
a huge penalty and a dual contract.

39
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,720
I can't do anything about it.

40

I signed the contract.

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,440
It has nothing to do with Enchen.
