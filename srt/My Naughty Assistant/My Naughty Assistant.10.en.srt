Mr. Xing.

The lawyer is here.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,920
Ms. Wang.

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,240
It's clearly stated on the contract.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,040
We don't have a big chance

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,880
to win it.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,000
What happened?

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,480
Enchen.

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,040
This contract for reasonable avoidance
of individual income tax,

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:05,800
did you sign it?

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,520
Yes.

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,000
You're always dozy.

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,320
And you even have
no basic knowledge of the law?

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,880
It's a dual contract.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,280
Do you know how bad it is?

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,280
We will be criminally responsible.

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,160
I signed it.

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,040
Not your problem.

Lawyer,

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
I signed it.

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,840
It has nothing to do with Enchen.

35
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,720
I will bear all the legal consequences.

36
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,640
It's not a joke.

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
I won't take on the case.

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,040
Sorry.

39

I'll see what we can do.

44

There's got to be a way.

45
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,800
Linda, come in.

46
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,000
Hand over your work with Linda.

47
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,920
Leave me alone.

48
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,640
You go back.

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,560
I...

50
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,240
Duoduo, what happened?

51
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,760
Jiawei.

52
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
I messed up.

53
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,800
That man gave you trouble?

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,520
I will fix him.

55
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,640
It was all my fault.

56
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,080
I didn't read it carefully.

57
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,240
I shouldn't have signed that contract.

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,640
I was going to pick up
someone at the airport

59
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,080
when it was given to me.

60
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,680
And Linda wasn't there that day.

61
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,200
I didn't want to be late,

62
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,480
so I signed it without consideration.

63
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,520
I'm here for you.

64
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,920
