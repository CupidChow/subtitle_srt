1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Command controller? Yeah .

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
No. 119: The person who will come out when you call.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
ah .

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Me, when the house gets fired➡

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I've always remembered the people who answered the phone.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
With a gentle and solid voice.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I think that voice saved us.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So I do that too ➡

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I hope I can do a job that will support someone else.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Big sister?

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Ah... Ah, yes.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
yeah? What, then, what will the bank do?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hmm, I wonder if it means changing jobs.

14
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:59,907
How to become a command controller ➡

15
00:00:59,907 --> 00:01:02,907
It seems like I have to become a firefighter first.

16
00:01:02,907 --> 00:01:05,907
I'm going to study for another exam this year ➡

17
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:08,907
You never thought of it.

18
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,772
(PC) (Male) That's right. I think it's fine. ➡

19
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:17,772
Once again, the book is published ➡

20
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:20,772
We will schedule a meeting.

21
00:01:24,772 --> 00:01:28,772
(PC) (Male) No no. Thank you for your continued support.

22
00:01:36,772 --> 00:01:38,772
(Mobile phone) (Vibrator sound)

23
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:49,772
(Mobile phone) (Vibrator sound)

24
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:58,772
(Haruka) "I decided to renovate the second floor of the house."

25
00:01:58,772 --> 00:02:00,772
"It's just like the bag I got when I was a child" ➡

26
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:03,772
"Can I clean it up over here?"

27
00:02:03,772 --> 00:02:18,772
♬～

28
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,772
(Takachiho) Eh, as mentioned by Section 2 ➡

29
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:24,772
There are continuing to be more emergency requests unique to winter.

30
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:26,772
Let's tighten our minds. (Everyone) Yes.

31
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,772
Also, those who haven't done their health checks yet.

32
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:34,772
Dojima-san too, right?

33
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:38,772
I'm fine. (Takachiho) It's not okay.

34
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:41,438
Anyway, everyone should go early.

35
00:02:41,438 --> 00:02:43,105
(Everyone) Yes.

36
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:47,772
good morning . (Everyone) Good morning.

37
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:49,772
Now let me introduce it.

38
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:52,772
Starting today, I'm Uesugi-kun, who will be a member of Section 3 of the Command Division.

39
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,772
This is Uesugi Subaru from Chuo Police Station.

40
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:57,772
thank you .

41
00:02:57,772 --> 00:03:00,772
(Everyone) Thank you very much. (Takachiho) Then Tanaka-kun.

42
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:03,772
Eh, it will be implemented within the Yokohama Fire Department from next year.

43
00:03:03,772 --> 00:03:06,772
Up to the point that it's part of job rotation ➡

44
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:09,772
You all know... That's fine, right?

45
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,772
To improve cooperation within the fire department ➡

46
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:15,772
Try to transfer departments and tasks regularly.

47
00:03:15,772 --> 00:03:17,772
Well, that's the attempt.

48
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:20,105
(Takachiho) So I'll be using Minowa as an instructor.

49
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:21,772
Wow. (Uesugi) What?

50
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:23,772
Huh? (Uesugi) But it's been a perfect day for four days ➡

51
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:27,772
I've been training though. (Takachiho) Because it's actually different from training.

52
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,772
Understood .

53
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:34,772
(Takachiho) Well, I hope you all take good care of me today.

54
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:36,772
(Everyone) Please.

55
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:38,772
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

56
00:03:38,772 --> 00:03:40,772
(Yogure) Fire department No. 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

57
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:42,772
(Speaker) (Male) That car and bicycle collided on the road right now➡

58
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,772
The woman on the bicycle fell down and fell down.

59
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:46,772
It's an accident. (Speaker) Ah, yes.

60
00:03:46,772 --> 00:03:50,772
Please tell me your address. (Speaker) Yokohama 305 somehow manages to 12. ➡

61
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,772
I remember that much. (Yogo) Umm ➡

62
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:55,772
Is that the car number? (Speaker) That's right, the car that hit me. ➡

63
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:58,772
I'm running. Ah, but I don't say this to the police.

64
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,772
No, I'll contact the police here.

65
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:02,772
First, please tell me your address. ➡

66
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:04,772
I want to get an ambulance straight away. (Speaker) (Ringtone)

67
00:04:04,772 --> 00:04:08,772
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

68
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,772
(Speaker) (Female) I think it's an emergency.

69
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:13,772
yes . What happened? (Speaker) Ugh, mother ➡

70
00:04:13,772 --> 00:04:16,772
Umm, it looks like I fell in front of the house and hit my head ➡

71
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:20,772
It seems like I can't move, so can I ask an ambulance?

72
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:22,772
Understood . The ambulance heads out ➡

73
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:25,772
Please tell me your address. (Speaker) (Ringtone)

74
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:29,772
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

75
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:31,772
(Speaker) (Morikawa) Ah, um, it's a fire. If you're thinking of making tempura ➡

76
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,772
Something suddenly started to heat up from the pot ➡

77
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:36,772
Even if you run out of gas it won't go away.

78
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:38,772
Please tell me the address the fire truck heads to.

79
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:40,772
(Speaker) Ah, uh, Sasadocho 5-20, Konan Ward.

80
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:44,772
Sasadocho, Konan Ward, 5-20. Who's your house?

81
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:49,772
(Speaker) Ah, it's me. This is Morikawa. (Uesugi) Yes, it's Morikawa-san.

82
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:51,772
Yes, I just sent the fire truck to head.

83
00:04:51,772 --> 00:04:53,772
Is the only pot burning?

84
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:56,772
(Speaker) Yes... That's right. Ah, can I pour this water on it?

85
00:04:56,772 --> 00:04:58,772
No, that's even more dangerous and not good.

86
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:00,772
Is there a fire extinguisher nearby?

87
00:05:00,772 --> 00:05:02,772
(speaker) not there. I'll use it if there is.

88
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:04,772
is that so . (Minowa) Uesugi-kun.

89
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:07,772
So are you got towels or sheets? (Speaker) Oh, if it's a towel.

90
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:09,772
So let it wet thoroughly with water ➡

91
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:11,772
Squeeze thoroughly so that the water does not drip.

92
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:14,772
(Speaker) Ah, yes. Please wait a minute. ➡

93
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,772
Um...

94
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:19,772
Make sure the pot is big enough to cover it completely. ➡

95
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:21,772
Once you squeeze it out, you'll have towels hang on the pot.

96
00:05:21,772 --> 00:05:24,772
(Speaker) I just wet it and squeezed it down. Um...

97
00:05:24,772 --> 00:05:27,772
Place the towel over the pot. It feels like it covers the entire pot.

98
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:30,772
(Speaker) Yes, I'll give it a try. (Uesugi) Don't get burned➡

99
00:05:30,772 --> 00:05:32,772
take care . (Speaker) (Sound of fire extinguishing)

100
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:35,772
(Speaker) Ah, it's gone. It looks like the fire has gone out.

101
00:05:35,772 --> 00:05:37,772
Then just put the towel on. ➡

102
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:40,772
Just to be sure, leave the kitchen and wait for the fire truck to arrive.

103
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:42,772
(Speaker) Yes. thank you .

104
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:46,772
Yes, I'll cut it off. yes .

105
00:05:51,772 --> 00:05:54,772
I have time. (Minowa) That's helpful.

106
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,772
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

107
00:05:57,772 --> 00:06:01,772
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

108
00:06:01,772 --> 00:06:09,772
♬～

109
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:33,772
Ah... Shall we go!

110
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:36,772
Oh... so good drinking.

111
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,772
I have to heal quickly.

112
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:41,772
Well then.

113
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,772
Drink protein quietly.

114
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:53,772
But the response to the tempura fire just now was amazing.

115
00:06:53,772 --> 00:06:57,772
It was like a fire rescue team.

116
00:06:57,772 --> 00:06:59,772
Did you think so when you saw that?

117
00:06:59,772 --> 00:07:01,772
yes .

118
00:07:01,772 --> 00:07:03,772
So you still have a long way to go.

119
00:07:03,772 --> 00:07:05,772
Huh?

120
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:11,772
Ah, thank you for your hard work. Your hard work.

121
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:18,772
What's wrong? Job rotation.

122
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,772
Ah yes. Job rotation.

123
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:25,772
Is that really just that?

124
00:07:25,772 --> 00:07:29,772
Ah... that's all.

125
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:32,772
yeah? Huh?

126
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:34,772
What... Hey... What?

127
00:07:34,772 --> 00:07:36,772
Oh... Oh, it's close.

128
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:39,772
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

129
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:43,772
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

130
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:46,772
(Speaker) (Male) Ugh, firefighters... (Uesugi) Yes.

131
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:49,772
(Speaker) Isn't firefighter radio digital now? ➡

132
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:51,772
Why did you make it digital?

133
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,772
(Uesugi) Huh? Um, this is... (Speaker) Could you please return it to analog?

134
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:57,772
(Speaker) Um, I love listening to the fire service radio ➡

135
00:07:57,772 --> 00:08:00,772
I've been listening to it for a while now. I hear that voice every day➡

136
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,772
I was really looking forward to it... (Uesugi) Ah...

137
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:06,772
Can I cut it off? (Minowa) Let's wait a little longer.

138
00:08:06,772 --> 00:08:10,772
(Speaker) It's become digital so I haven't been able to listen to it for the last 10 years or so ➡

139
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:12,772
I miss it so I can't help it.

140
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:15,772
Wow, there were some strange people. (Speaker) Risk of personal information leakage ➡

141
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:17,772
I know the reason for reduction.

142
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:20,772
Eh, this is an emergency line so if it's not a fire or emergency ➡

143
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:22,772
I'll cut it off. (Speaker) No, ah... ah. ➡

144
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:24,772
Well... not yet.

145
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:27,772
This is the first memorable junk call.

146
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:29,772
Do you also take this kind of thing every day?

147
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:32,772
No, it's not every day... No, maybe every day, maybe every day.

148
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:34,772
Can't you do it?

149
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:37,772
No, but it's all fires or emergency situations ➡

150
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:40,772
That's tough. Peace is the best.

151
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:43,772
Ha... Something easy and nice.

152
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:46,772
(Minowa) That much. (Speaker) (Ringtone)

153
00:08:46,772 --> 00:08:49,772
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

154
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:54,772
(Speaker) (Mison) It's Misono, but emergency! My right leg suddenly hurts and I can't walk!

155
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:58,772
It's Misono-san. Where are you here now?

156
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:02,772
This is Misotatsu. (Speaker) It's a crosswalk at Yamashita Bridge! ➡

157
00:09:02,772 --> 00:09:06,772
When I tried to cross it, it hurts. I can't stand it!

158
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:08,772
It's the crosswalk of Yamashita Bridge.

159
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:10,772
Is it Misotatsu? (Uesugi) Misotatsu?

160
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:14,772
(Minowa) Misono Tatsuo. And Misotatsu. He's a frequent requester.

161
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:17,772
Frequently...Do you mean you're coming over and over again?

162
00:09:17,772 --> 00:09:20,772
yes . It was definitely impossible to move at the intersection of Yamashita Bridge ➡

163
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:22,772
I'll ask for emergency care.

164
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:25,772
Since they say they can't move, they have no choice but to get an ambulance.

165
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:27,772
Well, by the time I arrive, I said "I can walk" ➡

166
00:09:27,772 --> 00:09:29,772
I'm going home though. (Uesugi) For those people ➡

167
00:09:29,772 --> 00:09:31,772
There's no need to send an emergency team. (Minowa) But I have to put it out ➡

168
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,772
Even the lever doesn't move, that old man.

169
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:36,772
(Sara) Will the pain go away? (Speaker) Not pulling Not pulling. ➡

170
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:38,438
it hurts! I can't move... ➡

171
00:09:38,438 --> 00:09:42,772
If you're somewhere like this you'll be hit!

172
00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:44,772
(Sara) I just sent him to an ambulance.

173
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:47,772
(Speaker) Ah, yes. So I'll wait.

174
00:09:47,772 --> 00:09:49,772
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

175
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:52,772
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

176
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:55,772
(Speaker) (Sounding)

177
00:09:55,772 --> 00:09:59,772
hello . This is the fire department in Yokohama No. 119.

178
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:02,772
Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

179
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:05,772
(Speaker) (Female) Um... it's an ambulance.

180
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,772
yes . (Speaker) Not right now ➡

181
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:11,772
It would be fine in about 30 minutes.

182
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:18,772
Ah... um, ambulances can't do that.

183
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:21,772
Isn't it necessary right now?

184
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:25,772
(Speaker) I... I'm thinking about dying...

185
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:29,772
Huh? (Speaker) also has the first person to discover the body ➡

186
00:10:29,772 --> 00:10:32,772
I don't like moms... so...

187
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:38,772
Well... Let's calm down first. That's what it means to die.

188
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:42,772
(Speaker) It's tough... I'm alive. ➡

189
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,772
It doesn't make any sense...

190
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:46,772
is that so… .

191
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,772
Umm... um... (Speaker) (Sounding)

192
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:53,772
Where are you currently?

193
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:56,772
(Speaker) House... Bathroom.

194
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:58,772
It's at home.

195
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:00,772
Um, then um...

196
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:02,772
Can I get my address?

197
00:11:02,772 --> 00:11:05,772
Kasuhara: It's not good yet. (Speaker) Yuunagicho, Isogo Ward ➡

198
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:11,772
4th Street 7 - 403. So, definitely come. ➡

199
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:14,772
I'll finish this too. Eh, wait a minute. No good.

200
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:17,772
(Speaker) (Currency of a call) I see... me...

00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:32,772
Isogo Emergency Order is made to participate.

204
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:35,772
The siren in the ambulance could also be the trigger.

205
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:38,772
Tell the emergency team about the situation frequently. (Commuting controller) Yes.

206
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:42,772
(Speaker) (Announcement) I'm answering the phone right now...

207
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:47,772
(Speaker) (Ringtone) Please. Go out.

208
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:51,772
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

209
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:55,772
Kasuhara: If you're connected, prioritize calming things rather than listening.

210
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:57,772
yes .

211
00:11:57,772 --> 00:12:00,772

214
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:08,772
Umm, for now...

215
00:12:08,772 --> 00:12:11,772
Not... uh...

216
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:16,772
sorry . (Speaker) What?

217
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:21,772
I didn't even listen to you about it earlier.

218
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:26,772
I've only been asking about what I wanted to ask.

219
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:33,772
If you like, please let me know what you're talking about.

220
00:12:33,772 --> 00:12:36,772
I'll listen.

221
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:41,772
(Speaker) (Sounding)

222
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:43,772
Yokohama Fire Department Understood.

223
00:12:43,772 --> 00:12:46,772
Misotatsu: He walked home without getting in the ambulance.

224
00:12:46,772 --> 00:12:51,772
(Sara) I understand. (Uesugi) No... I understand.

225
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:56,772
If you don't want to talk, there's no need to force yourself to talk.

226
00:12:56,772 --> 00:13:00,772
But I'll keep this call together.

227
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:06,772
(Speaker) Um... it's fine now. ➡

228
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:11,772
I got a phone call and something calmed down.

229
00:13:11,772 --> 00:13:13,772
Really?

230
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:19,772
(Speaker) Yes. The ambulance is fine now.

231
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,772
Understood .

232
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:32,772
But if anything happens, please feel free to call us.

233
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:34,772
(Speaker) Yes.

234
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:39,772
So I'll cut this one off.

235
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:42,772
Is this the fire service job?

236
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:51,772
Woo...

237
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:55,772
Was it your first time reporting a self-inflicted injury?

238
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:57,772
yes .

239
00:13:57,772 --> 00:14:05,772
I was panicked because I had to find out where she was.

240
00:14:05,772 --> 00:14:08,772
If only I could respond more calmly.

241
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:13,772
(Takachiho) Yes. However, Kasuhara prevented the worst case scenario.

242
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:17,772
Rather than wasting ambulance participation

243
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:21,772
You can cherish the outcome.

244
00:14:21,772 --> 00:14:27,772
This job also requires being close to the hearts of the reporter.

245
00:14:27,772 --> 00:14:29,772
yes .

246
00:14:29,772 --> 00:14:48,772
♬～

247
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:51,772
What's irritated?

248
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:55,772
(Uesugi) I'll send you an emergency team to report something inappropriately ➡

249
00:14:55,772 --> 00:14:59,772
What's more, is there such a counselor?

250
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:03,772
If the reporter needs it, I'll do it.

251
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:09,772
Are you saying it seriously? Are you the type to be close to your heart?

252
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:11,772
If you deal with them every time, you won't be able to fully understand them.

253
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:14,772
We need to be more determined.

254
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:18,772
But you have to be careful about listening.

255
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:21,772
Careful.

256
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:27,772
It's difficult because it's not easy to handle.

257
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:30,772
I think I did well, but ➡

258
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:34,772
I don't know if that would work with other reports.

259
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:38,772
There is no absolute correct answer to the listening.

260
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:42,772
Are you letting your squad participate in that fluffy feel?

261
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:45,772
That's fine for me.

262
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:54,772
(Commuting controller) Please tell me the address where you can drive the ambulance to.

263
00:15:54,772 --> 00:15:58,772
(Uesugi) Yes. Does your lower abdomen hurt? (Speaker) (Male) Yes... That's right.

264
00:15:58,772 --> 00:16:01,772
When did the stomachache start? (Speaker) Umm ➡

265
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:06,772
It's been about two hours ago, but I haven't left for the past week...

266
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:08,772
Isn't it coming out? What's that meant it wasn't out?

267
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:11,772
(Speaker) Um... the bigger one.

268
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,772
This guy seems just constipation though.

269
00:16:15,772 --> 00:16:20,772
No, it's pretty good that it wasn't out for a week. Continue.

270
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,772
Is it okay to say you need an ambulance?

271
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:28,772
(Speaker) Yes! Here... This is the first time I've had such a pain...

272
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:31,772
I see.

273
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:34,772
Understood . I'll send you to the ambulance ➡

274
00:16:34,772 --> 00:16:37,772
Please tell me the address. (Speaker) (Ringtone)

Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

276
00:16:40,772 --> 00:16:45,772
(Speaker) (Female) Haa haa... Um... it's painful... What should I do? What should I do?

277
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:50,772
What happened? Please calm down.

278
00:16:50,772 --> 00:16:56,772
(Speaker) Ah... um... my heart is pounding... haa haa...

279
00:16:56,772 --> 00:16:58,772
Please calm down.

280
00:16:58,772 --> 00:17:00,772
Do you know where you are currently?

281
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:03,772
(Speaker) What?

282
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,772
(Speaker) (Symbol) Something around me...

283
00:17:05,772 --> 00:17:08,772
(Speaker) (Heavy breath)

284
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:13,772
Let's take a deep breath.

285
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:16,772
(Speaker) Haa haa... Yes...

286
00:17:16,772 --> 00:17:20,772
Suck slowly. (Speaker) (Inhale sound)

287
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:25,772
Let's vomit slowly. (Speaker) (Speed ​​out sound)

288
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:29,772
(Speaker) (Speed ​​out sound) It's fine.

289
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:31,772
It's okay once you're able to talk ➡

290
00:17:31,772 --> 00:17:34,772
After that, you will have your name and ➡

291
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:37,772
Can I ask about your age?

292
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:40,772

Kada-san, it's fine. Because I'm with it.

296

I'm going to the ambulance right now, so can you tell where it is?

297
00:17:56,772 --> 00:18:05,772
(Speaker) Ah... uh... Yokohama It's my first time... Shu... in job hunting.

298
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:10,772
There's no need to hurry, so let's look into where there is.

00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:15,772
I'm blessed with good seniors and good bosses.

338
00:23:15,772 --> 00:23:19,772
I see. It's the job that Yuki wanted to do.

339
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:21,772
Yeah .

340
00:23:21,772 --> 00:23:23,772
I'm doing it properly ➡

341
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:27,772
I wanted to tell my sister too...

342
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:34,772
(Haruka) I think Yuki is busy, but come back once in a while.

343
00:23:34,772 --> 00:23:37,772
Yes, that's right.

344
00:23:37,772 --> 00:23:39,772
I would have liked to have a phone call though.

345
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:41,772
(Iida) Is it the Uesugi incident?

346
00:23:41,772 --> 00:23:43,772
I asked the general affairs guy.

347
00:23:43,772 --> 00:23:46,772
It was Iida who promoted him to the command division.

348
00:23:49,772 --> 00:23:53,772
It's been over two years since Uesugi came to our house.

349
00:23:53,772 --> 00:23:56,772
It's good that I'm able to move around on site quite a bit. ➡

350
00:23:56,772 --> 00:23:59,772
Something... I'm not used to it all strangely.

351
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,772
You know? ah .

352
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:05,772
It's the most dangerous time.

353
00:24:05,772 --> 00:24:07,772
It's a good opportunity ➡

354
00:24:07,772 --> 00:24:09,772
That the scene isn't the only main character ➡

355
00:24:09,772 --> 00:24:12,772
I was thinking of showing it.

356
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:14,772
Yes, two raw.

357
00:24:14,772 --> 00:24:17,772
Take your time.

358
00:24:17,772 --> 00:24:20,772
(Kaneshita and Iida) So tired.

359
00:24:25,772 --> 00:24:29,772
What about you? In a sense, it's a pioneer.

360
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:31,772
What? Job rotation.

361
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:34,772
It's not like they're rotating.

362
00:24:36,772 --> 00:24:40,772
Don't want to go back to the scene anymore?

363
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:44,772
It's not like I want to go back or don't want to go back.

364
00:24:46,772 --> 00:24:49,772
If you're worried about that accident ➡

365
00:24:49,772 --> 00:24:52,772
That's not your fault.

366
00:24:57,772 --> 00:25:00,772
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

367
00:25:00,772 --> 00:25:03,772
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

368
00:25:03,772 --> 00:25:06,772
(Speaker) (Male) Ugh... emergency.

369
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:10,772
what's wrong? (Speaker) The president is in the store...

370
00:25:10,772 --> 00:25:13,772
Mr. President. President, what happened?

371
00:25:13,772 --> 00:25:16,772
(Speaker) Blood... Blood...

372
00:25:16,772 --> 00:25:20,772
blood? Are you bleeding? Do you know where it comes from?

373
00:25:20,772 --> 00:25:22,772
(Speaker) Mmm... Chest.

374
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:26,772
chest? Is it from your chest? (Speaker) Yes... Yes.

375
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:28,772
(Uesugi) What circumstances did the chest bleed?

376
00:25:28,772 --> 00:25:32,772
do you understand? (Speaker) Ah....

377
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:34,772
Could you hear it? What is the situation?

378
00:25:34,772 --> 00:25:36,772
I would like to know. (Speaker)...Here it.

379
00:25:36,772 --> 00:25:40,772
what? (Speaker) stuck...

380
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,772
Huh? (Yogure) The location of the call is Totsuka Ward ➡

381
00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:45,772
Around the Southern Taipei. (Takachiho) Information is shared with the police.

382
00:25:45,772 --> 00:25:47,772
roger that . (Uesugi) Was it stabbed? ➡

383
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:50,772
The president, um... did you get stabbed in the chest?

384
00:25:50,772 --> 00:25:52,772
Relax and first ensure the safety of the reporter.

385
00:25:52,772 --> 00:25:54,772
What is your consciousness? Don't know if you're aware?

386
00:25:54,772 --> 00:25:57,772
Also, the address...Do you know the address there?

387
00:25:57,772 --> 00:26:01,772
(Speaker) Ah, no... a bit. (Uesugi) The company name can be used.

388
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:03,772
You understand, right? If it's the company name. (Speaker) Ah, no...

389
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,772
Uesugi-kun might not be able to say it right now... (Uesugi) Why don't you understand?

390
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:10,772
You're being stabbed, right? I have to get an ambulance to go quickly!

391
00:26:10,772 --> 00:26:12,772
All that's left is I'll do it.

392
00:26:21,772 --> 00:26:23,438
I've changed my phone.

393
00:26:23,438 --> 00:26:27,772
I would like to ask a few questions, so please ask ➡

394
00:26:27,772 --> 00:26:31,772
You can just answer "Yes" or "No." ➡

395
00:26:31,772 --> 00:26:37,772
If that seems difficult to say that, "Yes" or "No" but that's fine.

396
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:41,772
Is the person who stabbed the president still there?

397
00:26:41,772 --> 00:26:44,772
(Speaker) Yes...

398
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:46,772
(Dojima) You who reported it ➡

399
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,772
Are you in a safe place now?

400
00:26:49,772 --> 00:26:51,772
(Speaker) No...

401
00:26:51,772 --> 00:26:53,772
(Dojima) Is the person who stabbed him nearby?

402
00:26:53,772 --> 00:26:55,772
(Speaker) Yes.

403
00:26:55,772 --> 00:26:59,772
Can you move to a safe place?

404
00:26:59,772 --> 00:27:02,772
(Speaker) No... (Dojima) Is it difficult?

405
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:06,772
Ah, I'll change the question.

406
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:09,772
Is the boss stabbed a man?

407
00:27:09,772 --> 00:27:11,772
(Speaker) Yes.

408
00:27:11,772 --> 00:27:13,772
(Dojima) Are you still aware?

409
00:27:13,772 --> 00:27:15,772
(Speaker) No...

410
00:27:17,772 --> 00:27:19,772
(Yogo) Dojima-san. ➡

411
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:21,772
This is a list that is open.

412
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:24,772
From above, Izakaya and pharmacy used car dealer.

413
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:33,772
Are you a used car dealer?

414
00:27:33,772 --> 00:27:36,772
(Speaker) Yes. (Dojima) Is it S&COMPANY?

415
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:38,772
(Speaker) Yes... yes.

416
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:42,772
(Dojima) I understand. ➡

417
00:27:42,772 --> 00:27:46,772
A police car and an ambulance are heading over there.

418
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:49,772
You can still keep the phone connected. ➡

419
00:27:49,772 --> 00:27:53,772
If you feel it's dangerous, please cut it immediately.

420
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,772
(Speaker) Yes.

421
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:58,772
(Speaker) (Calling sounds)

422
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:07,772
There are likely inquiries from the news.

423
00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:09,772
I will contact the general affairs department.

424
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:15,772
Well, it's difficult right now.

425
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:27,772
(TV) (Caster) Used car dealerships are available at around 5:30pm today...

426
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,772
Ah, there's breaking news.

427
00:28:29,772 --> 00:28:33,772
(TV) (Caster) We received a call of 9119 that the president had been stabbed. ➡

428
00:28:33,772 --> 00:28:37,772
The man believed to be the culprit was arrested on the spot. ➡

429
00:28:37,772 --> 00:28:41,772
The victim, President Shikada Yoshinori, was taken to the hospital, but ➡

430
00:28:41,772 --> 00:28:44,772
He was later pronounced dead. ➡

431
00:28:44,772 --> 00:28:48,772
At the time of the crime, the company was open and there were several employees.

432
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:51,772
There were no other injuries besides the CEO who was stabbed. ➡

433
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:56,772
The police are currently investigating the exact motives of the perpetrator...

434
00:28:56,772 --> 00:29:00,772
What do you think is the scariest thing about this job?

435
00:29:03,772 --> 00:29:06,772
I'm arrogant.

436
00:29:06,772 --> 00:29:08,772
Accuracy...

437
00:29:08,772 --> 00:29:11,772
No matter how used to it, you have experience?

438
00:29:11,772 --> 00:29:14,772
There is no report that can be done the same thing.

439
00:29:14,772 --> 00:29:18,772
It's a big difference between knowing that and not knowing it.

440
00:29:29,772 --> 00:29:32,772
(Shell)

441
00:29:35,772 --> 00:29:39,772
⚟ (Footsteps)

442
00:29:41,772 --> 00:29:45,772
Sorry about that earlier.

443
00:29:45,772 --> 00:29:48,772
Uesugi.

444
00:29:48,772 --> 00:29:53,772
You're that. Humans are too licked.

445
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:55,772
Huh?

446
00:29:55,772 --> 00:29:59,772
(Dojima) If there are 100 reports, there are 100 backgrounds.

447
00:29:59,772 --> 00:30:03,772
To you who have lived for just over 20 years.➡

448
00:30:03,772 --> 00:30:07,772
There's no way we can respond perfectly.

449
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,772
yes .

450
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:11,772
I lived just over 60 years, even me ➡

451
00:30:11,772 --> 00:30:15,772
Sometimes I get surprised.

452
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,772
So what should I do?

453
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:28,772
I'll just listen. The voice of the reporter. Sound.

454
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:35,772
Then use your imagination to choose words from your own drawings.

455
00:30:35,772 --> 00:30:40,772
I hope that it is right.

456
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:46,772
Repeat this and develop your response ability. ➡

457
00:30:46,772 --> 00:30:49,772
That's the only thing.

458
00:30:53,772 --> 00:30:57,772
You should go to sleep when you can. The night is long.

459
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:17,772
♬～

460
00:31:17,772 --> 00:31:23,772
♬～

461
00:31:23,772 --> 00:31:25,772
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

462
00:31:25,772 --> 00:31:28,772
(Commuting control) Firefighter No. 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

463
00:31:28,772 --> 00:31:30,772
(Speaker) (Female) Umm... on behalf of a woman!

464
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:38,772
It's changed. What's wrong?

465
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:43,772
(Speaker) Ah, a man... I was hit by a man. Blood... there's blood. From the face.

466
00:31:43,772 --> 00:31:45,772
Which place will you take the ambulance?

467
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:48,772
(Speaker) Location... I'm running away now, not at all.

468
00:31:48,772 --> 00:31:51,772
Are you outside now? Are you running away from the person you were hit with?

469
00:31:51,772 --> 00:31:53,772
(Speaker) That's right. From a self-proclaimed ex-boyfriend!

470
00:31:53,772 --> 00:31:56,772
Calling himself...

471
00:31:56,772 --> 00:31:59,772
(Speaker) (Male) Where have you been? (Speaker) (Female) It's so close. ➡

472
00:31:59,772 --> 00:32:03,772
Something like that made me think of her boyfriend and refused, and I hit her. ➡

473
00:32:03,772 --> 00:32:06,772
Isn't 38 guys trying to date a teenager in danger?

474
00:32:06,772 --> 00:32:10,772
(Takachiho) Did you call the police? (Speaker) No, it's impossible, it's impossible, it's impossible! ➡

475
00:32:10,772 --> 00:32:13,772
I'm currently running away from home. (Takachiho) Understood.

476
00:32:13,772 --> 00:32:16,772
Is it okay to go to the hospital by ambulance?

477
00:32:16,772 --> 00:32:18,772
Are you still on the way out? (Speaker) Yes. ➡

478
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:21,772
Address I don't know, but I'm currently in the vicinity of Yamashita Park.

479
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:24,772
It's hidden between a convenience store and a home improvement store ➡

480
00:32:24,772 --> 00:32:26,772
It seems like he's always nearby.

481
00:32:26,772 --> 00:32:29,772
(Takachiho) So if I go to the ambulance I'll be found.

482
00:32:29,772 --> 00:32:32,772
(Speaker) Can't you delete that person?

483
00:32:32,772 --> 00:32:34,772
That can't be done, right? (Speaker) (Ringtone)

484
00:32:34,772 --> 00:32:37,772
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

485
00:32:37,772 --> 00:32:40,772
(Speaker) (Mison) It hurts It hurts...! I can't walk I can't walk! ➡

486
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:42,772
Ambulance... Ambulance Come right away!

487
00:32:42,772 --> 00:32:46,772
Ah... Did you report it earlier?

488
00:32:46,772 --> 00:32:49,772
(Speaker) That's right. Misono. Soon and soon.

489
00:32:49,772 --> 00:32:51,772
yes . It's Misono-san.

490
00:32:51,772 --> 00:32:55,772
Misotatsu... at this time. Um, are you outside now?

491
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:58,772
(Speaker) Of course. I was walking to get hit by the night breeze.

492
00:32:58,772 --> 00:33:00,772
It hurt and I couldn't move.

493
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:03,772
Can I ask for that address?

494
00:33:03,772 --> 00:33:08,772
(Speaker) It's in front of the usual crosswalk! Yamashita Bridge in Yamashitacho, Naka Ward.

495
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:11,772
Understood . So I'll head to the ambulance ➡

496
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:14,772
If possible, please move to a safe place and wait.

497
00:33:14,772 --> 00:33:17,772
(Speaker) Ah yes yes. So please take care of me.

498
00:33:17,772 --> 00:33:19,772
yes .

499
00:33:19,772 --> 00:33:21,772
I wonder if I'll ride this again...

500
00:33:21,772 --> 00:33:26,772
hang on . Misotatsu is the intersection of Yamashita Bridge, right?

501
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:30,772
Ah yes. I've already made an order.

502
00:33:30,772 --> 00:33:33,772
(Takachiho) Yamashita Bridge means it's near the Marine Tower...

503
00:33:36,772 --> 00:33:40,772

668
00:42:50,772 --> 00:42:52,772

676
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:29,772
yeah? Are you crying?

677
00:43:29,772 --> 00:43:32,772
no… .

678
00:43:32,772 --> 00:43:34,772
I'm not crying.

679
00:43:34,772 --> 00:43:53,772
♬～

680
00:43:53,772 --> 00:43:56,772
Ah, thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your hard work.

681
00:43:56,772 --> 00:43:59,772
Even though Kasuhara says that he is the same newcomer ➡

682
00:43:59,772 --> 00:44:02,772
I'm a little senior so if you have any questions ➡

683
00:44:02,772 --> 00:44:05,772
Can you ask? No no, that's it.

684
00:44:05,772 --> 00:44:08,772
Rather, I am the one who is talking about the fire rescue team.

685
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:11,772
I want to hear a lot. (Uesugi) That's good.

686
00:44:11,772 --> 00:44:14,772
Let's exchange information. Ah, that's good, exchange of information.

687
00:44:14,772 --> 00:44:16,772
yes . Your hard work.

688
00:44:16,772 --> 00:44:19,772
Thank you for your hard work. Kaneshita-san.

689
00:44:19,772 --> 00:44:22,772
what? It may be a short time though ➡

690
00:44:22,772 --> 00:44:24,772
Thank you for your cooperation.

691
00:44:24,772 --> 00:44:27,772
I hope they understand that the scene isn't the only main character.

692
00:44:27,772 --> 00:44:29,772
Huh?

693
00:44:29,772 --> 00:44:33,772
Well, I recently understood too.

694
00:44:36,772 --> 00:44:39,772
Well, do your best in the next department at best.

695
00:44:39,772 --> 00:44:42,772
Huh? Is job rotation other parts too?

696
00:44:42,772 --> 00:44:46,772
Well, next up is probably the General Affairs Division. Tanaka-senpai loved me.

697
00:44:46,772 --> 00:44:49,772
He said he didn't listen.

698
00:44:49,772 --> 00:44:52,772
It may always be the Command Division.

699
00:44:54,772 --> 00:44:56,772
Are you really saying it?

700
00:45:03,772 --> 00:45:10,772
(Dojima's Cough)

701
00:45:16,772 --> 00:45:18,772
Haa...

702
00:45:18,772 --> 00:45:22,772
Haa haa...

703
00:45:22,772 --> 00:45:25,772
Huh... Huh...

704
00:45:29,772 --> 00:45:34,772
Huh... Huh... Hah...

705
00:46:09,772 --> 00:46:11,772
['119 Emergency Call' is...]

00:46:16,772 --> 00:46:18,772
