(Speaker) What should I say? It's just burning.

Can you hear it? hello?

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Can you hear it? hello?

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
(Speaker) Oh, do you have to say your address?

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I can't get to the fire truck. It's a fire, right?

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
(Speaker) Umm... but it's burning ➡

(Speaker) It's insane. ➡

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Even people who don't really understand are replied with and are so involved.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Um, that's...

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
(Speaker) Just a little complaint about her being rejected by her ➡

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why do I have to be hit like this?

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
(Speaker) (Male) This guy is too dangerous. I'm taking a picture. I'm taking a picture.

Sorry. So what's on fire online?

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Does that mean it's getting fired up?

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
(Speaker) (High school student) Yes. That's why I want them to be put out on fire.

34

(Speaker) (Male laughter) I see.

We cannot respond to such consultations here.

37

If it's really a difficult situation, consult your family or close friends...

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Extinguishing fires online is not the job of a firefighter.

39

(Speaker) (Calling sounds)

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000

Ask if you have any New Year's cards or mail.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Do you see New Year's cards or mail?

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
My heart is so painful that I start to sweat coldly.

Woo...

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll hold back 20.5 hours for 20.5 hours.

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah? Kaneshita's unfriendly guidance.

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If you work hard until tomorrow morning, you'll be on your own from now on.

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh no, it's not that Kaneshita-san is tired.

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Good. I don't want that person to teach me either.

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
(Yogo) He has the ability though.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But call a report that is not urgent, called a junk call ➡

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's what I mean to me. Huh?

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,666
That's what I mean to me. Huh?

112
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,333
Oh, isn't everyone using it?

113
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,000
(Yogo) That's not true. A coined word created by Kaneshita. ➡

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Every day, I accumulate like garbage ➡

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Finally, it's a wasteful report that just erases the entire data.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Wow. I thought it was an industry term.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's so cool, I'll use it too!

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What?! ? Huh? ➡

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Are you coming around while splattering your lunch?

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Ah, I've been running this far from home ➡

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This is what happens inevitably.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Well, once it gets into the stomach it's the same.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll have it.

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What's wrong?

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think there's a bit of love.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
yes? Regarding guidance to Kasuhara.

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So first ➡

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,666
So first ➡

131
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,000
I said I wasn't suited to being an instructor.

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm not suited to it, so I'm letting it do it.

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Which one is not love...?

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Why are you a new employee at a time like this?

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
(Takachiho) That girl was the only person to fill up

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There's nothing I can do about it. Hey Tanaka-kun.

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes. (Takachiho) Ah, Tanaka-kun. ➡

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Nap room sheets I'd like to ask a contractor if they've changed detergent recently.

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It smells strange.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You know if it's Kaneshiko, right?

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Command controllers can't directly save lives.

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No matter how hard you try, you rarely get thankful.

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Rather, the insults from the reporter wears down.

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
People who want to do such a job first➡

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
How valuable is this world of firefighting?

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
(Takachiho) Even if you bother quitting your bank.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
A child who came in saying they wanted to become a command controller ➡

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't raise them carefully, what will you do?

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't raise them carefully, what will you do?

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And that girl is definitely the best.

153
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
(Takachiho) How good his ears are.

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
(Speaker) (Male) Um, something happened, and my heart hurts a lot.

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
How does it hurt?

157
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
(Speaker) Umm, something is that excitement ➡

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I wonder what it is. I wonder what to say.

159
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Are there any other symptoms?

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's difficult to breathe or you can't stand.

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
(Speaker) Ah, yes. yes . That's how it is.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Um... sorry if I made a mistake.

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're a friend of a child who called me after getting a stir online earlier?

164
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
(Speaker) What? When I reported it earlier...

165
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
(Speaker) (High school student) "I just wrote a complaint about how my girlfriend rejected me ➡

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Why do you have to be beaten like this? 》

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
(Speaker) (Male) "This guy is too dangerous. I'm taking a picture, I'm taking a picture

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
(Speaker) (Male laughter)

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He was the one who was laughing behind me at the time, right?

170

That's good.

245
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I would do it if I weren't a Saitama prefecture.

246
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
(Minowa) Isn't Yogu-kun better off being away from his parents?

247
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
If things continue like this, I'll become an old man in the children's room.

248
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Hahaha. 24 hours a day I don't want to be told by my 30s who have bedhead.

249
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What is it that laughing like that?

250

255
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Ah, that's right. Internet cafe fire ➡

256
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Do you know the firefighter who responded?

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Do you know the firefighter who responded?

258
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Why? The place where the man was evacuated

259
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I was wondering if it was appropriate. I thought I'd ask.

260
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
There's no need to do anything unnecessary.

261
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The reporter was rescued and safe.

262
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Is there any point in Kasuhara knowing anything more?

263
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Even spending the time on the scene.

264
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,666

Once you've cut off the call, that's it.

269
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
In the end, it's always the members on the field who save their lives.

270
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Even the reporter

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's only time to see the firefighters and emergency services that make me feel at ease.

272
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We're the connection up until then.

273

What? From now? Yes, from now.

281

It's out. Athletic drinking is not very clear whether it's healthy or unhealthy.

283
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm a cultural person so I'm pass.

284

No, no matter how you look at it, it's unhealthy.

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Please leave because it's dangerous. It's not a place for ordinary people to enter.

336
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Ah, I'm not an ordinary person. yes?

337
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
My name is Kasuhara Yuki, who is affiliated with Section 3 of the Command Division.

338
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Those who received the first report of this fire.

339
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What do you mean to the Commander Division?

340
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What kind of imagination?

341
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What was the reporter's condition?

342
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What was the reporter's condition?

343
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I wanted to come to the scene and imagine it.

344
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So, while you're working? Ah, no, it's time for the time being on duty.

345
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's okay to be bored. Yeah?

346
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
home . Was the reporter the person on the stairs behind him?

347
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If it were that person, we'd really helped. ➡

348
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Can you understand that much without thinking about it?

349
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
As expected. thank you!

350
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
(Uesugi) Please don't thrust your neck too much.

351
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
(Uesugi) Please don't thrust your neck too much.

352
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,666
I guess they don't trust the field though.

353
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,000
No, no, that's why... ⚟ (Iida) Hey Uesugi!

354
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,666
yes!

355
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:12,000
Well then.

356
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,666
what up? (Uesugi) Ah no.

357
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:22,000
(Mobile phone) (Vibrator sound)

358
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,666
yes . what?

359
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,666
what? It's not.

360
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,000
How many days do you think it's been since the new year?

361
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Happy opening!

362
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Ah, I see. sorry .

363
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Happy new year .

364
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Show your face a little.

365
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
If you take your time, you can run and come.

366
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
(Mobile phone) Yes.

367
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Are you that busy? What is a command controller?

368
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Hmm, well, since it's a three-shift system, there are proper holidays.

369
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
(Mobile phone) Also, you're new to me ➡

370
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I want to use it on my days off to study.

371
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
(Mobile phone) (Gin) That's good, that's good! ➡

372
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
The more you study, the better. (Mobile phone) (Motor sound)

373
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The more you study, the better. (Mobile phone) (Motor sound)

374
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Dad, you're using my massage machine again, right?

375
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
(Motor sound) (Silver) No... No, ah...

376
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You can tell from the motor sound.

377
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Because it's the deadline today ➡

378
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I can't even come up with any copies that will really draw you in!

379
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Haha. (Mobile phone) (Haruka) New Year's idiot. New Year's idiot.

380
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Ah, by the way, what about your sister? I'll contact you again this year...

381
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
do not have!

382
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
do not have!

383
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I see.

384
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I also sent the opening but there was no reply.

385
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
(Mobile phone) (Haruka) That's right.

386
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Well, it means he's alive as soon as it's read.

387
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
oh yeah . It's good news that there's no news.

388
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
(Mobile phone) Yes.

389
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
(Haruka) But ➡

390
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
After all, it's the most reassuring thing to hear the voice.

391
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
After all, it's the most reassuring thing to hear the voice.

392
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah .

393
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:30,000
(Fire truck siren)

394
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
(Fire truck siren)

395
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
(Takachiho) Is there just one from today? good luck .

396
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yes, I'll do my best.

397
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm sure Kaneshita has said a lot to me, but ➡

398
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Well, first you just have to do it yourself.

399
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Be yourself.

400
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,666
Because there are many different types of command controllers ➡

401
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:57,000
I think Command Division 3 will be a good team.

402
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
( English )

403
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
( English )

404
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So, to my rhythm ➡

405
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Press both hands against the middle of your chest.

406
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm going. 1 2....

407
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
(Minowa) I know how you feel ➡

408
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Because the dog next to me is noisy ➡

409
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I can't put out a fire truck. (Takachiho) Kaneshita's mouth is also bad-mouthed, though➡

410
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I think it's because of his own beliefs.

411
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
⚟What am I?

412
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
oh… . It's nothing.

413
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
He was just fulfilling his duties as section chief.

414
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So, what kind of command controller do you want Kasuhara to be?

415
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So, what kind of command controller do you want Kasuhara to be?

416
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I… .

417
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I want to be an imaginative command controller.

418
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Is it imagination?

419
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah? What is it? that .

420
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

421
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

422
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
(Speaker) (Female) Well, something smells bad. odor?

423
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
(Speaker) I'm at Marine Mall right now. At the shopping centre. ➡

424
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Something really smells like that. Can't you do something about this?

425
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Does it smell like gas?

426
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
(Speaker) No, I don't think it's gas.

427
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Can you feel unwell due to the smell?

428
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Do I need an ambulance?

429
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
(Speaker) It's not that great ➡

430
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Anyway, I want you to do something about this smell.

431
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Understood . Check with the facility's disaster prevention center here ➡

432
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
If necessary, I will send the fire truck to the area.

433
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
If necessary, I will send the fire truck to the area.

434
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
What floor are you currently there?

435
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
(Speaker) Around the food court on the first floor. It's the food court on the first floor.

436
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Just to be sure, can I ask for your name and phone number?

437
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Kaneshita-san at Marine Mall...

438
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It might be a gas leak, and it's too late if something happens.

439
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I haven't said anything yet though.

440
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm wondering if I should avoid junk call.

441
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Well, it was just that they didn't let the fire truck head straight away.

442
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Well, it was just that they didn't let the fire truck head straight away.

443
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Thank you . (Speaker) (Ringtone)

444
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
(Sara) Fire Department No. 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

445
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Is it a strange smell?

446
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
(TV) (Announcer) Today around 2pm ➡

447
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
At the Shopping Center Marine Mall in Naka-ku, Yokohama City➡

448
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Several reports have been reported saying it smells strange. ➡

449
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The strange smell appears to have occurred on the first floor where the food court is located inside the mall...

450
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
What was it? This during the day.

451
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Hmm...

452
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
There are times when you don't know the cause.

453
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The smell is a sensation.

454
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It may be closed when the fire department arrives.

455
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But I'm glad there wasn't anything like chemical terrorism or anything like that.

456
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
(Yogo) It's a big deal when it comes to the NBC disaster.

457
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
That's right, it's a big deal.

458
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Nuclear, biologic and chemistry projects.

459
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,666
Right? Niijima-san.

460
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:59,000
It's chemical, not chemistry.

461
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Huh? What? Is that so?

462
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Huh? What? Is that so?

463
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Yeah . Well, whatever it is, there's nothing we can do.

464
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
That's a neat pack once, right?

465
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Huh? Yeah .

466
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Is there any meaning?

467
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
surely .

468
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Okay.

469
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000

What is squid sushi?

508
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
What is squid sushi?

509
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
(Rino) Don't you know? this .

510
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
"I won't follow people who don't know."

511
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
"Don't get in the car"

512
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
"Shock it out with a loud voice."

513
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
"I'll come right away."

514
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
"Let people know"

515
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I see . Mom says to remember.

516
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So then, I put that into practice with Rino-chan.

517
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So then, I put that into practice with Rino-chan.

518
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
That's great. Is that so?

519
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
thank you .

520
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Are you here alone?

521
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yeah . Because Rino is your older sister.

522
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Mom has a baby in her stomach, so it's tough.

523
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Is that what it is?

524
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And there is also the amulet that my mom gave me. ➡

525
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I heard that if I had this it would be fine. My mom said that.

526
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh, then let me tell you another important amulet?

527
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
⚟ (Light) Dad! oh!

528
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
What were you looking? Hmm, not particularly.

529
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Did you buy it? Yeah .

530
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
(Hikari) Well then! Oh that's fine.

531
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,666
When I get home, I'll put these on and practice.

532
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:29,000
Yes I'll do it! (Bookbook) Hey, that's fine though ➡

533
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Come back today before it gets dark.

534
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,666
Come back today before it gets dark.

535
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,333
You know, don't you?

536
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:35,000
It's going to get dirty soon.

537
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's no good.

538
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
⚟The policeman is number 110.

539
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Fire and emergency services are No. 119.

540
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
The policeman is number 110. Fire Emergency is number 119?

541
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
yes . It's good to remember. Actually, you're a big sister ➡

542
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
He's the one on the other side of 911 phone.

543
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
If you call me in case of a fire or illness, I'll definitely help you.

544
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
If you call me in case of a fire or illness, I'll definitely help you.

545
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
absolute? Yes, absolutely.

546
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I've been helped a long time ago too.

547
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
(Bookbook) Hey Mutsuki. sorry .

548
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
(Emi) I'm really sorry and sorry for the inconvenience.

549
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
No, this is the place.

550
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
After all, one person was still too early, right?

551
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Are you okay! I can come alone!

552
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Are you okay! I can come alone!

553
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But...

554
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Rino is fine. Mom is off.

555
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Understood. Thank you.

556
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Yeah!

557
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Your hard work. (Tanaka) Thank you for your hard work.

558
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Ah, Kaneshita-san, is that okay?

559
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Yeah?

560
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
These nap room sheets smell strange, do you think?

561
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
These nap room sheets smell strange, do you think?

562
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Do you mean smelling it?

563
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
yes . Ah, of course, it was the one I washed.

564
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
(Sniffing sound)

565
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Not particularly. That's right.

566
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Chief Takachiho: He's surprisingly a complainer because of his detailed details.

567
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
thank you .

568
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Tanaka-kun, is this a bit okay? yes?

569
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Tanaka-kun, is this a bit okay? yes?

570
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Do you know why Kasuhara went out of his way to quit his bank and join the fire department?

571
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Huh?

572
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
If you're a general affairs person, you'll probably get in touch with human resources situations here and there.

573
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Ah, but I'd say something like that in the absence of the person himself ➡

574
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It's no good. It's an invasion of privacy.

575
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Twitch. Did you click your tongue?

576
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
That's how you should ask the person himself.

577
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So it's fine.

578
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Huh?

579
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:13,000
(Mobile phone) (Vibrator sound)

580
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
yes .

581
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
(Dojima) So hard.

582
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
thank you . nice to meet you .

583
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That's why we can't send ambulances.

584
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,333
Ambulance It's not a taxi, do you know?

585
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,000
Because of this kind of report ➡

586
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
If you can't respond to other urgent reports ➡

587
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Can you take responsibility? Something's getting rough today.

588
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Please do so. Now, let's cut this.

589
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Haa...

590
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

591
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

592
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

593
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
(Speaker) (Female) Ambulance! Quick ambulance! What happened?

594
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
(Speaker) Collapse on the road! I hit my head and it's bleeding!

595
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Was it you who hit the head? (Speaker) No, it's not a man! ➡

596
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Come on, um... I'm riding an electric kickboard ➡

597
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I was almost hit! Anyway, come quickly!

598
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Please tell me where the ambulance is heading.

599
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
(Speaker) I don't know about that! It's outside!

600
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Is there a electric pole or a signal nearby?

601
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
(Speaker) What is the electric pole? What should I do? ?

602
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Please calm down.

603
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
From there something that can become a mark➡

604
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,333
Can't you see it? Convenience stores and nameplates in nearby houses.

605
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:40,000
(Speaker) I don't know if you say that!

606
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Who else would you be able to help?

607
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
(Speaker) If there's no one! So I'm on the phone, right?

608
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Is he lying down on the road? Or an intersection?

609
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
(Speaker) At the crosswalk! There's a bridge! Bridge...

610
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Are there any signs or signs on the bridge?

611
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
(Speaker) Eh... uh... ah, it says Sakurahamabashi!

612
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
(Speaker) Eh... uh... ah, it says Sakurahamabashi!

613
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's the crosswalk of Sakurahama Bridge. (Speaker) Yes.

614
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Understood . (Speaker) What are you going to do now...?

615
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The ambulance is on your way, so please calm down and listen.

616
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Is that person aware of it now? (speaker) not there. There are none.

617
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Please try calling out to me. Because it's (speaker) It's not there!

618
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Please just one more time. (Speaker) What...

619
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
(Speaker) A little brother. Big brother!

620
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
What do you think?

621
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
hello? Can you hear it?

622
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
(Speaker) It's not there after all.

623
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Are you breathing? (Speaker) I don't know about that!

624
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So, from now on, I would like you to do a heart massage with me.

625
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
(Speaker) It's not possible, I can't. I'll teach you.

626
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
First, I kneel next to him. I guess it's not possible because it's a speaker! ➡

627
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
First, I kneel next to him. I guess it's not possible because it's a speaker! ➡

628
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
That's the job!

629
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
But if you don't, you'll probably do something else...

630
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
(Dojima) Don't force yourself any more.

631
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Instructed to wait safely until the ambulance arrives.

632
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Understood . The ambulance will arrive soon, so

633
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Please be safe and careful.

634
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,666
(Speaker) Yes...

635
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:27,000
I'll hang up the phone from here.

636
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

637
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
(Takachiho) Kasuhara-san It's fine if it doesn't appear.

638
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
(Minowa) Fire Department No. 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

639
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,666
Sorry.... (Dojima) Thank you for your help. ➡

640
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:49,000
This is Dojima from Yokohama Fire Command Division. ➡

641
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
A traffic accident occurred. please .

642
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Understood . yes . thank you .

643
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
(Takachiho) I was able to take him to the hospital but ➡

644
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
They don't know exactly what to do after that.

645
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
is that so .

646
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Did you bother to inquire at the site?

647
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
The current case still left issues with identifying the reporter.

648
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
To check if there were no issues with the arrival

649
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It's an important job as a commander's department.

650
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Sorry.

651
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
If I could have properly heard it too.

652
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
That was the best.

653
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
In fact, the emergency team was able to arrive without hesitation.

654
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
But it's also a heart massage...

655
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
But it's also a heart massage...

656
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Kasuhara-san ➡

657
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It's best not to overly address each and every report.

658
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
(Sara) Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your hard work.

659
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
(Sara) Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your hard work.

660
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It's a morning, so it's a waste.

661
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
No, but I'm sleepy even if I keep awake.

662
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Thank you for your hard work! (Yogo) Thank you for your hard work.

663
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000

Kaneshita-san.

665
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:27,666
You're about to go, right at the scene of the accident yesterday.

666
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:30,000
What? Why...? Kasuhara's house is over there.

667
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
What? Why...? Kasuhara's house is over there.

668
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
No, no, I just took a detour and went home.

669
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I know what you're doing.

670
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,666
What...

671
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:43,000
I got a call yesterday. From the fire rescue team commander at the central station.

672
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
"yes"

673
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
(Mobile phone) (Iida) "It's been a while. That's bad, suddenly》

674
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
"Ah, it's been a while. what up? 》

675
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
{Ah, no, it's not a big deal ➡

676
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
After the internet cafe fire the other day➡

677
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Apparently a new employee from Kaneshita came to the scene.

678
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
(Mobile phone) (Iida) "A woman named Kasuhara"

679
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
"bad . I've caused trouble.

680
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
(Iida) "Well, I mean, the guys below me are a bit of a bit."

681
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
"They risk their lives on the ground."

682
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
For people in a safe zone ➡

683
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I don't feel like it's okay to step in with a light heart.

684
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
(Mobile phone) (Iida) "I'd understand if it's Kaneshiro." ➡

685
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
"well"

686
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
{Haa...}

687
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I told you not to do anything unnecessary.

688
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Sorry I went without my permission.

689
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
But this is to imagine the feelings of the reporter...

690
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
If you imagined, you could do it just in your head.

691
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
However, imaginations that you don't see the scene can just become fantasies.

692
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Is it that bad? Going to the site.

693
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Is it that bad? Going to the site.

694
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Kasuhara doesn't know yet.

695
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You can stop reporting and end there. ➡

696
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
How blessed are you?

697
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Apparently the man on the kickboard yesterday passed away.

698
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
No matter how hard we try, there are certainly lives that cannot be saved.

699
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
People on the scene ➡

700
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I see and touch this reality directly with my own eyes and feel it so much that I hate it.

701
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
We, who are the connections, jump in later on. ➡

702
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,666
We, who are the connections, jump in later on. ➡

703
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:36,000
Imagine what can you do! ? You can't do anything!

704
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
If you're going to report on power harassment above, please.

705
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000

710
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
In the situation, the kickboard was negligent and ignored the pause.

711
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It looks like it's getting bigger. I also had a helmet on.

⚟ (Dojima) There's no need to spread out your lunch box at a place like this.

740
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Well, I can't talk about other people either.

Um... Dojima-san.

742
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It's command controllers who save people with their imagination, right?

743
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Did I talk about that?

744
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Ah, no, I happened to hear it five years ago.

(Mic) (Dojima) {Among everyone here ➡

746

"But why not think about it like this? 》

751
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
The first thing to hear is to help people

752
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I'm a command controller.

753
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
"Imagine the situation beyond the phone from limited information, only voices and sounds."

754

755
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
{And sometimes ➡

756
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'll decide how to save a life.

If the staff on the ground were to save lives with their own hands➡

758
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Command controllers save people with their imagination.

759
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:42,000
After hearing that, I decided to join the fire department and become a command controller.

760
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
There are also events like that that have quite a meaning.

761
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
But no matter how much I imagine it ➡

762
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
There are absolutely no lives that cannot be saved.

763
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
So, each report is made ➡

764
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
So, each report is made ➡

765
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Shouldn't you not be too concerned about it?

766
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Those who would forget everything if they stopped reporting.

767
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I think the meaning of forgetting and switching between things is different.

768
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Even if it happened a second ago,

769
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Now, in response to the calls for help ➡

770
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Connecting life. That's our job.

771
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Connecting life. That's our job.

772
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
You can use all your imagination for this.

773
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
If you can do that ➡

774
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:51,000
There's no need to forget the lives that could be saved or the lives that could not be saved.

775
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Well, in short, that's it.

776
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Don't mess up ➡

777
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000

It's good that we're bored. The best thing is that there is nothing.

It smells strange before the fire door started working.

808
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Is it because of the smell that made me feel sick?

01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,666
Ammonia, the refrigerant, started leaking ➡

1018
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,333
The strange smell was spreading through the air conditioning and spreading throughout the building.

1019
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:07,000
Furthermore, the cleaning robot is

1020
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Because the electrical system was repeatedly collided with.

1021
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
There was a power outage and a sprinkler breakdown and fire.

1022
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
That's what it means.

1023
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Suddenly he spoke awful.

1024
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I was so surprised that nothing inside was included. ➡

1025
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
But thank you for the explanation.

1026
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Eh... It's difficult to handle.

1027
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Eh... It's difficult to handle.

1028
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Why me...

1029
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Hmm.

1030
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Hey Kasuhara.

1031
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Thank you for your hard work.

1032
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
After the first odd smell, he also went to Marine Mall.

1033
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Oh... Was it discovered...?

1034
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Oh... Was it discovered...?

1035
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I'll tell you, but this time I just happened to be lucky.

1036
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I haven't allowed to go and see the scene without my permission yet.

1037
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I know.

1038
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,000
But is it okay from me too?

1039
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Kaneshita-san: You said that the job of a command controller is a connection.

1040
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
We simply connect the reporter's information accurately. ➡

We simply connect the reporter's information accurately. ➡

Eventually, the members of the field will always save their lives.

1043
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
That's it?

1044
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I don't think that's all.

1045
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Because I know.

1046
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
There are lives that can be saved by the voices of command controllers.

1047
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
There are lives that can be saved by the voices of command controllers.

1054
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Anyway, I can connect it ➡

1055
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I want to connect my life.

1056
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Command controllers always

1057
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Because it's the first person to receive a voice for help.

1058
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
As we imagine ➡

1059
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I think it can lead to the future.

1060
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Maybe my way of thinking might be different though ➡

1061
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Thank you for your continued support!

Sorry. Even if you don't get angry like that...

1064
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:14,000
Apparently this has arrived.

1065
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
So I certainly gave it to you.
