21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It refers to an emergency team that handles ambulance transport.

22

Following the Tokyo Fire Department ➡

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000

Wow. So does Niijima have been selected as the launching member?

yes . (Minowa) Wow, it's not amazing! ?

Well... yes.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000

yes . (Yogo) Wow...

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Speaking of transfers, Uesugi-kun is one step ahead of him.

31

Job rotation ended with today's work.

32

35

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No no... No, that's it. (Minowa) Hey, let's stay together!

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hey! Then come back, definitely. (Uesugi) Yes. No... I don't like it.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
(Yogo) But if Kaneshita-san also goes to SR ➡

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000

40

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Business communication. The other day, it was a vacant house in Kanagawa Ward.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It seems there's a high possibility that it will be arson after all.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's been going on recently.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If there is anything suspicious about reporting a fire ➡

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'd like the police to tell me even the smallest things.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
nice to meet you . (Everyone) Yes.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
(Uesugi) Ah, I can hear the sound. (Speaker) (Female) It's already here. ➡

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
When I'm home, I'll always be there. Go. Ventilation fan? Sounds like that. ➡

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,666
I can't sleep at night either.

52
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,000
Is it a ventilation fan from a nearby house?

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
(Speaker) No, so... it sounds like a ventilation fan. ➡

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What is low-frequency sound? I'd like to hear about it for other people too.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's a problem because only I can hear it!

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes, that's why... are you not feeling well?

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Can I request an ambulance? (Speaker) Not that. ➡

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Um... what was your name?

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Is it me?

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's Uesugi. (Speaker) Uesugi-san. ➡

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,666
Have you heard me properly?

62
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,000
Ah, yes.... I thought I'd heard it.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
(Speaker) So why do you talk about ambulances? ➡

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm wondering why this low-frequency sound is

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They're asking you to look it up and stop it!

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Ah, sorry, we cannot respond to this kind of situation with the fire department.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
(Speaker) Haa... So that's fine. No use.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
(Speaker) (Calling sounds)

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah . You're so concerned about it. I'm not wrong with the current response.

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes. (Speaker) (Ringtone)

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
(Speaker) (Male) It's a fire. The location is at 9, Kihamacho, Naka-ku.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
In front of a house. The cardboard box left in flames.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's in front of a house in 1-9 Kihamacho, Naka-ku.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
(Speaker) Yes. Do you know who's home?

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
(Speaker) There is no nameplate. There's a sign on the seller's shop. ➡

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's probably an empty house. ➡

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The house next to the right is Taki's house across from Ishino.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Understood . thank you .

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Is the cardboard still burning? (Speaker) Yes, it's still burning. ➡

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's burning quite violently and smoke is coming out.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Understood . For the elderly, right nearby

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There is a group home. There should be a fire extinguisher.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The fire truck is already on its way, but it's around you and you ➡

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Can you help with the initial fire extinguishing?

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
hello?

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Could you hear it? Does it seem difficult to extinguish the initial fire?

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
hello . (Speaker) Then please.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Cardboard is burning near me!

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The cardboard box is on fire. Please tell me your address.

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
(Speaker) Umm... It's 1-9 Kihamacho, Naka-ku.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
(Uesugi) It's 1-9 Kihamacho, Naka-ku.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
(TV) (Announcer) Here's the next news. Today around 2pm ➡

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
In a residential area in Naka-ku, Yokohama City ➡

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I was reported that the cardboard box was burning.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The fire was extinguished by a firefighter who rushed over.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
(Minowa) You're doing it. (TV) (Announcer) In Yokohama City ➡

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Since last month, arsons have been on the target of vacant houses one after another.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The police are also considering committing the same crime.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We are under investigation.

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm glad it was just blurry.

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If the initial report had been a few minutes late, the fire might have even moved to an empty house.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I heard that the report was accurate.

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah .

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But why did that person hang up the phone like that?

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Your hard work. (Everyone) Thank you for your hard work.

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Ah, that's right.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm glad it was on this scale.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The road is also narrow. If the house is burning ➡

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It may have spread to the nearby area.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
⚟You guys, the police?

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000

We are from the fire department.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Ah, the fire department. Hello yesterday.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I reported the fire yesterday.

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
When I got home from shopping, it was a fire and I was surprised!

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Um... Didn't anyone see it here at the time?

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
someone? yes .

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hmm, when I saw it, there was no one there...

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Ah. But maybe that person.

125

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Did you understand something?

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's what the last time I reported the arson, right?

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I want you to hear the voices of the man in this video.

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
(Mobile phone) (Everyone) ♬ "Happy birthday to you"

175
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
(Mobile phone) Happy birthday Kaneshita-san!

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
(Mobile phone) (Applause) (Mobile phone) This is what happens in this year...

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
(Mobile phone) (Shiomi) Come on, Kaneshita-san quickly put out the fire and put out! ➡

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's a fire service!

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
(Mobile phone) Turn off the fire quickly and turn it off! It's a fire service!

180
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This voice...

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
(Speaker) (Male) "It's a fire. Location: Kihamacho, Naka-ku

182
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That reporter.

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I see.

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This guy is... Shiomi Sota.

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Two years ago, I was a junior who had to quit the fire service due to me.

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
(Shiomi) "Kaneshita-san! 》 《Don't come! ! 》

187
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
(Explosion sound)

188
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
{Tsumi.... Shiomi! Shiomi! ! 》

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So this person...

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Report to the section chief immediately. There's no need to do it.

191
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
but… . The reporter is arsonist.

192
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There is no evidence to deem it.

193
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Also, the police are doing the proper search for the perpetrator.

194
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Is it really Shiomi who reported that? ➡

195
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I just wanted Kasuhara to check it out.

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It was helpful.

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:48,000
♬～

198
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone) Fire department number 119.

199
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
(Speaker) (Male) I'd like to hear a little about it.

201
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
yes . (Speaker) Is there a fire alarm? ➡

202
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Will the fire department exchange that for you?

203
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Is it your home fire alarm? (Speaker) That's right. ➡

204
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Look, you've been scared lately, aren't you? It's arson, what?

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes yes. (Speaker) After all, I'm already 85. ➡

206
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What should I do if I were told to replace it myself...

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So that might be the target of installation assistance.

208
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Could you contact your district's fire station?

209
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
This is a line for emergency calls.

210
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
(Speaker) Ah... That's right. (Speaker) (Ringtone)

211
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

212
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
(Speaker) (Female) Ah... Can I do it again?

213
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
(Speaker) Ah, that's a shame. (Minowa) Yes?

215
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
(Speaker) Brother, isn't that? You're still in your 30s, right?

216
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes... Yes. (Speaker) What's the name? What is it?

217
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's Minowa though. (Speaker) Minowa-san... ➡

218
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Well, Minowa-san isn't too bad either. ➡

219
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I think a voice that looks more like a cool old man would sing more into my habit. ➡

220
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
My voice lacks depth, I mean. (Minowa) Starting earlier ➡

221
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't know what you're talking about ➡

222
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
If it's not a request from an ambulance or fire truck, I'll cut it off.

223
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
(Speaker) Change to someone a little older. He's a cool old man.

224
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes, there's just no one like that right now.

225
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
(Speaker) Now, wait. (Minowa) There's no need to wait.

226
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yes, I'll cut it off. (Speaker) (Ringtone)

227
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

228
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
(Speaker) (Female) Umm... It's Kaji. Is it a fire?

229
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What's on fire?

230
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
(Speaker) Ah... not, not. yeah? Isn't it a fire?

231
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
(Speaker) Woohoo... Ah, sorry, it's complicated. ➡

232
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
My name is Kaji. Umm... with a tail tail on the wooden side.

233
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
ah! It's Kaji-san. Sorry, what have you done?

234
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
(Speaker) Apparently my mother was taken to the emergency room yesterday. ➡

235
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Um... Which hospital was he taken to?

236
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Can't you tell me? My younger brother and his wife didn't tell me about the hospital.

237
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Sorry about that... Junk calls continue.

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Well, it's better than getting a report of arson.

239
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Well then, let's go with Uesugi-kun's Central Fire and Rescue Team ➡

240
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I hope for more success!

241
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
(Everyone) Cheers!

242
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Future fire rescue captain! (Takachiho) Wow...

243
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Ah! (Shop clerk) Yes, super spicy mabo.

244
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
(Everyone) Thank you. (Uesugi) No, I'm sorry.

245
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I went out of my way to hold a meeting like this.

246
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Not at all. Actually, it was fine even before this one.

247
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
See, Kaneshita and Kasuhara-san weren't there.

248
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Sorry. No no.

249
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Uesugi-kun also said that he was annoying when he got drunk Kaneshita-san ➡

250
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You have to taste it at least once.

251
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What! ? I'm not drunk at all. What's more, it's oolong tea!

252
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's fine, no matter what...

253
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Which site did you go to see the other day?

254
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Huh? Ah...where was the report of that arson.

255
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
(Sara) Do you understand anything?

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Umm...

257
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Ah... no. especially .

258
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Sometimes you can't ask the reporter to extinguish the fire first.

259
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Of course. Yeah .

260
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Well, but that can't be helped. That's why there's a firefighter.

261
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
oh yeah .

262
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But I'm worried if this continues for a while, right? I wonder if the perpetrator will be caught soon.

263
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
My senior at the central police station said it ➡

264
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Apparently, continuous arson is often a regular thing.

265
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Rule? yes . Day of the week, weather, etc.

266
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
They also have a particular preference for the place where they set fire. ➡

267
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I wonder what will happen this time. (Minowa) Um, me about that➡

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I've noticed something, can I make an announcement? ➡

269
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes, I'll announce it.

270
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Can I borrow this? (Shop clerk) That's fine, that's fine ➡

271
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I've taken it with me. (Minowa) Are there any serious things like that too?

272
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Ah... Aiyo. (Minowa) Aiyo.

273
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
gather! ➡

274
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So, first of all, the first arson incident that occurred last month ➡

275
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
26, Nishinouchi, Isogo Ward. ➡

276
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The second one was Akaharacho 5-chome, Kanagawa Ward. ➡

277
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And the third previous event was in Kihamacho 1-chome, Naka-ku. ➡

278
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And if you connect this with a line.

279
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Taraan!

280
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
(Yogo) Yes... And?

281
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Huh? Conversely, and? Don't you think this looks like something?

282
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It just looks like a triangle.

283
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
To be precise, it's an isosceles triangle.

284
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's no good, you guys.

285
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
If that were the case, I wouldn't become a great detective!

286
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It won't be. (Takachiho) It's fine, Minowa-kun.

287
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
A quick conclusion. (Minowa) Sorry.

288
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So, if we make a triangle of the same shape on the other side too...

289
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
This shape... ah . It's the mark Hamamark from Yokohama City.

290
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
(Sara) It also has the logo of the Yokohama City Fire Department.

291
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
(Minowa) Correct answer. And at the center of all the points...

292
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yokohama City Fire Department.

293
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What... Ah, does that mean the perpetrator has any grudge against the fire department?

294
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
(Minowa) Hmm... I don't know that much though ➡

295
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But what if there was a fourth crime ➡

296
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I wonder if it's around here.

297
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Nishi Ward... Is it around Sanri Town?

298
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
yes! Sanricho 3-chome!

299
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
(Takachiho) Yes, yes, that's about it now. We are not criminals.

300
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
As a command controller, what you need to do remains the same as before.

301
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
yes . dissolution . I'm back to the drinking party.

302
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
(Minowa) Thank you.

303
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Kaneshita-san. I'm not going, me.

304
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Even Kasuhara hasn't seen anything happen yet➡

305
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What will you do if you go? You can't even imagine it.

306
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's right, but... Are you planning to find the culprit?

307
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That's not our job. The section chief said that.

308
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So, it's tough.

309
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So, at least I'll contact Shiomi-san.

310
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Can't do it?

311
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I also reported other arson incidents after that ➡

312
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I tried to ask again.

313
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
(PC) (Female) "Um... in an empty house nearby ➡

314
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It looks like something's on fire.

315
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
(Click sound) (PC) (Male) 《Fire! 》➡

316
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The plants in the back house are on fire! 》

317
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
(Click sound) (PC) (Female) {While walking ➡

318
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Something smokes. So...》

319
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But Shiomi-san reported it ➡

320
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That was the only one last time.

321
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If you're an arsonist who reports it with some purpose ➡

322
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's strange if you don't report it every time.

323
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Shiomi just happened to see a fire ➡

324
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I suddenly hung up the phone ➡

325
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Maybe it's because there was another reason.

326
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Isn't that what Kaneshita-san could have confirmed?

327
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's not that simple.

328
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm to that guy...

329
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I think I know what happened to you two.

330
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But that's why it's really okay to do nothing.

331
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Certainly I'm not a police officer.

332
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I want to prevent fires that should be prevented.

333
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I want to do what I can.

334
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Thank you for your hard work.

335
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Is there any grudge against the fire department?

336
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Well, it's true that there were lives that could not be saved either by emergency or in a fire. ➡

337
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
There may be times when you're being hated somewhere.

338
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Rather than that, I told you not to come visit Takachiho.

339
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Ah, this is not a visit. Human resources interview.

340
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You'll be discharged from the hospital soon, right? When should I start working again?

341
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
(Takachiho) Next week? Will it be the week after next?

342
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
No... it was certainly surprisingly quick though.

343
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What I would like to ask Dojima-san to give me advice ➡

344
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I think everyone still has one.

345
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Haa...

346
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
(Mobile phone) Sanricho 3-26-5.

347
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I wonder if this is an empty house too...

348
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
(Mobile phone) 3-24-13 Sanricho.

349
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
There are quite a few...

350
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
(Male) I know. I'll definitely be there in a few more days.

351
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
There have been no reports of fires in the last two days.

352
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
However, there is a drying warning today, so make it an accident or make it an incident ➡

353
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I think there's a high risk of a fire. Let's bring tension.

354
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
(Everyone) Yes.

355
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Eh... I wonder if it's gone? The mystery of the great detective Minowa.

356
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
What about Kaneshita-san today? Apparently he got paid leave.

357
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Wow...

358
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000

359
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Can you see the fire and smoke? (Speaker) Yes. It's out It's out. ➡

363
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The fire is blowing! (Sara) I understand.

Please tell me the address the fire truck heads to.

365

368
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
[Nishi Ward...] (Minowa) [Sanri-cho 3-chome! 》

369
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000

370
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000

372
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Niijima-san. 3-chome 26-5 was an empty house.

373
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Because I went to see it. (Speaker) What! ?

374
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The fire truck is already heading for the first time, but can't we extinguish the fire?

375
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
(Speaker) I'm calling because that's not possible.

376
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Understood . Now, let's get away from the fire and take shelter to a safe place...

377
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
(Speaker) Ah... wait a minute. (Sara) Yes.

378
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
(Speaker) Um... this may not matter ➡

379
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Before the fire, there was a suspicious man leaving this house.

380
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
A suspicious man...

381
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
(Speaker) Is this better to call the police too? Should I report it?

382
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Please report it. We will also contact the police here.

383
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That's 24-13 Sanricho 3-chome, Nishi-ku.

394
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Another Sanricho 3-chome...

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's probably an empty house. Understood .

398
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Just now, even in an empty house at 3-26-5 Sanricho, Nishi-ku ➡

There was a report of a fire. Just to be safe ➡

400
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
That's definitely 24-13, right?

401
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
(Speaker) Ah, no doubt. I understand, I'll give you an order.

402
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
However, due to the fire at 3-chome 26-5 ➡

403
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
All nearby fire trucks have been released.

404
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It may take a little time.

405
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
(Speaker) Understood. Minowa-kun.

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
The reporter is not connected. (Yogo) Does that mean it was a false report?

434
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000

452
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000

Kaneshita, stop. You're a firefighter...

458
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's no longer in use. (Takachiho) What does that mean?

464
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000

I don't know who you are, but you're just burning trash.

484
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's fine, since no one's dead.

485
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000

Hahaha....

493
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000

Eh, 2-7-13 Wakabacho, Nishi-ku. ➡

508
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
No one has lived here for the last 10 years or so.

509

(Sara) That's 2-7-13 Wakabacho, Nishi-ku.

510
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Understood . This fire has already been reported.

511
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm on my way to the fire truck so I'm away from the fire and put it in a safe place...

512
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
(Speaker) Just... wait a minute! Someone will come out.

513
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
What... (Speaker) Is there a fire extinguisher somewhere?

514
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
(Speaker) Hey! Big Bro! Is it okay?! ?

515
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
(Speaker) Is there a fire extinguisher more than that? (Speaker) We're... a fire extinguisher? Fire extinguisher! ➡

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I've already called the fire truck. It's (speaker) so I'll turn it off.

518
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
(Speaker) (Currency of a call) (Sara) Ah...

519
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Your voice is Kaneshita-san, right? (Minowa) I think so too.

520
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But then what about that?

521
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
(Takachiho) Did you hear Kaneshita's voice too?

522
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
No... All I can hear is the sound of riding a bicycle.

523
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
(Speaker) (Bicycle driving sound)

524
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
In other words, this sound I can hear now...

525
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Sounds like the arsonist is running away.

526
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm sure Kaneshita-san will be...

527
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
(Man) "Is it okay? Just like this, a fire will spread.

530
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
But I can't track my system GPS...

531
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
If it's Kaneshita-san and Kasuhara-san ➡

532
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I think he thought the sound would help him get a clue to the perpetrator.

533
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Kasuhara-san, just listen to it. Please let me know if there is anything.

534
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000

543
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
(Speaker) (Bicycle brake sound) My bike stopped.

544
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Maybe I'm going to run away somewhere.

545
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
But I have to narrow it down somewhere.

546
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
(Yogo) I'm sure that's been going on forever...

555
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's near the entrance on the first floor of Yokohama City Hall.

556
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yowu-kun contacted the police. (Yogo) Yes. ➡

Yes, Yokohama Fire Department. Please take the Kanagawa conductor.

570
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
(Speaker) Appeared in an abandoned house at 2-7-13 Wakabacho, Nishi-ku. ➡

571
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
The fire was already extinguished by initial extinguishing.

572
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I was also able to contact Assistant Fire Commander Kaneshita, who was the reporter. ➡

573
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
There are no injuries and no need to be taken to an emergency.

574
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yokohama Fire Department Understood. Haa...

575
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000

00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Thank you very much. Thank you for your hard work.

577
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
(Firemen) Okay! Okay! The rope is fine! Okay!

578
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's slow.

579
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
(TV) (Announcer) Here's the next news. On suspicion of arson of non-current buildings

580
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Hasegawa Yota, 27, has been arrested. ➡

581
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Hasegawa was a vacant house in Yokohama city and was constantly in a series.

582
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I did the arson incident myself.

583
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
He stated that he intended to play

584
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The police are planning to pursue other crimes.

585
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Ah, no, this time we'll be talking about the mystery of the great detective Minowa-san ➡

586
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It even crossed!

587
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I won't deny it though ➡

588
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Rather, Kaneshita-san was more of a big success, right?

589
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
See. (TV) (Announcer) He was present at the scene ➡

590
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yokohama City Fire Department staff ➡

591
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
He has made a major contribution to the arrest of Hasegawa.

592
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
A letter of appreciation will be given to this fire department employee at a later date. ➡

593
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
The following news. (Minowa) Yes, yes... right?

594
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Kaneshita-san is also questioning the police today.

595
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Yeah . It's coming soon.

596
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
(Yogo) But there was an incredible guy... Playing with arson.

597
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
What's wrong?

598
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Ah... no.

599
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I was passing the culprit.

600
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
At that time...

601
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
(Man) "I know. I'm sure it's in a few more days

602
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I was talking to someone on the phone.

603
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
What? Does that mean he has an accomplice?

604
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Come to think of it, which woman first reported the fourth arson?

605
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
What was that person in the end?

606
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I don't really understand ➡

607
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
The section chief said he would provide the information to the police as well.

608
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I'm going to work like this because it's finished earlier than planned.

609
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah . Well then.

610
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Shiomi.

611
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
(Shiomi) I was curious about something when I saw the news.

612
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I never thought we would meet.

613
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Sorry.

614
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Why is Shiomi apologizing?

615
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's me who has to apologize.

616
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
2 years ago ➡

617
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I had to quit the fire service because of me.

618
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I had been hooked for a long time, but didn't even try to contact me.

619
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I'm really sorry.

620
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Please stop. Please lift your head.

621
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Because it's not Kaneshita's fault.

622
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I left the fire department.

623
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
actually… .

624
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Even before that accident, every time I was involved in attendance➡

625
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
My hands couldn't stop shaking.

626
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
(Shiomi) I'm scared of fire.

627
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But my grandpa and my father ➡

628
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I've always been a firefighter house, so I can't say I'm afraid of fire.

629
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So I had that accident ➡

630
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I finally felt like I had a reason to look cool and quit.

631
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Something... sorry.

632
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So there's no reason to apologise.

633
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But if that's true, even if the last report was actually a former firefighter, then I'd say.

634
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
They should have put out the fire in the first place.

635
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
(Shiomi) I was scared after all.

636
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
{Then please later}

637
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I see.

638
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
A while ago, I started with the same class from the fire service era ➡

639
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Kaneshita left the scene herself ➡

640
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I heard he went to the Command Division. So I was curious.

641
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
If you're worried about me, what should I do?

642
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
(Shiomi) But I didn't have the courage to check it out in person.

643
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
{Tidomi...}

644
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:12,000
If you were concerned about me, it's fine... Or rather...

645
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
It's irrelevant. ➡

646
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Ah, I'm currently working in a nursing home.

647
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It seems to suit your personality quite a bit and it's fun.

648
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So if you want to go back, Kaneshita-san too➡

649
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Please come back to the site any time.

650
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I support you as a citizen.

651
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Understood.

652
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000

654

yes . (Speaker) (Female) It's already morning until night ➡

655
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Meow meow meow meow I can't sleep because it's so noisy.

656
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Ah... I see. That's tough.

657
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
However, firefighters cannot catch stray cats.

658
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It would be best to consult with the ward office.

659
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
(Speaker) No... But the other day, the staff member over there ➡

660
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Did you catch the perpetrator of the arson? ➡

661
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Maybe you could even catch a cat?

662
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Ah no... that... Is that what you call that?

663
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
This level of peace is really good.

664
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Last week was a lot of turmoil.

665
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
When Minowa says that, for some reason, reports are increasing. ➡

666
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Can I stop? (Minowa) No no...

667
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone) (Sara) Fire department No. 119.

668
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Is it a fire? Is it an emergency? (Speaker) (Ringtone)

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
(Commuting control) Fire Department No. 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

670
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
(Sara) My back hurts, isn't it? (Speaker) (Ringtone)

671
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
⚟Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

672

Please increase the number 5 command station and the assistant station.

673
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:23,000
♬～

674
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Now I'll cut it off.

675
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Thank you for your hard work.

676
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
(Sara) Yes, then I'll be canceling this call.

677
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

678
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

hello? This is Yokohama Fire Department.

680
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

681
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
(Speaker) (Female) Maybe you... Dojima-san?

682
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:18,000
That's right. (Speaker) That's good... Finally I was able to talk. ➡

683
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I will prove your incompetence now. ➡

684
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Listen carefully.

685
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's a bit meaningful...

686
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Here it's an emergency line so if it's a prank...

(Speaker) (Calling sounds)

688
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
That's fine though.
