Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,800
(Speaker) (Male) Ah, what if it's um, um...➡

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,800

So I was walking earlier but it hurts again ➡

I can't stand anymore and say it's impossible.

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Will the pain continue?

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800

What's wrong? Ah... No, just now ➡

43
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Someone reported that my ear hurts ➡

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,800
That person should go to the emergency team to your family ENT clinic ➡

45
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
It seems like he was making a mess. Huh.

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
This one is similar too.

47
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Reporter who should have hurt his leg ➡

48
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Stars walked into the ambulance.

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Haha. (Sara) I saw that ➡

50
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
You can imagine the faces of the people on the scene.

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Also, this is what happens online.

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
(Mobile phone) (Male) How long will it take to arrive?

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
(Mobile phone) (Emergency personnel) Check.

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
(Mobile phone) (Male) This guy... Seriously.

55
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
(Mobile phone) (Laughter)

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Haa... Something like this ➡

57
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,800
It's like an AI that can tell if an ambulance is seriously needed➡

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Maybe it's not developed?

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,800
(Takachiho) I understand. I really understand how I feel.

60
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,800
But there's no such thing ➡

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
We have no choice but to respond steadily.

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,800
That's right. (Takachiho) And there was a minor injury ➡

63
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,800
You didn't settle and send an ambulance.

64
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
When something happens, someone else's life is the victim.

65
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,800
No matter how much you apologize, you can't get it back.

66
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Even if you've played 100 times and it was useless ➡

67
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
They have no choice but to have him participate for the 101st time too.

68
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,800
There's nothing better than someone else's safety.

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
(Yogo) But what is our feelings like?➡

70
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,800
It's not conveyed to the world at all.

71
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

72
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

73
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,800
(Speaker) (Male) Ugh, please get an ambulance right now. ➡

74
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
It's not me, but it looks like an acquaintance has collapsed.

75
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,800
What does it mean to have collapsed?

76
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
(Speaker) I was on the phone until just now. ➡

77
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,800
I had promised to meet you today, but my phone was broken. ➡

78
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
So I was calling from a public phone.

79
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,800
yes . (Speaker) Then in the middle of the phone call➡

80
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Suddenly, my heart started to say that it was painful. ➡

81
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
And it made a sound like something had fallen ➡

82
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Even when I called out to him, he stopped responding at all.

83
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Understood . Where to turn the ambulance?

84
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Do you know which one? (Speaker) Ah yes yes. ➡

85
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Wait a minute. I'll see it.

86
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:24,800
(Speaker) Ehh, Teraocho 3-6, Naka-ku, Yokohama City Um, 20...➡

87
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,800
It's 1. That's bad, with presbyopia.

88
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I'll repeat it. Teraocho 3 - 6➡, Naka-ku, Yokohama

89
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,800
City Hills Room 201. Is it 201 a no-no?

90
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
(Speaker) Ah, that's right. I want you to hurry up.

91
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Is there any evidence that the person collapsed in his room?

92
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Is that person collapsed at home?

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Could it be that you were calling from another location?

94
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
(Speaker) No, no, no, I'm cleaning my room ➡

95
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I was told it, so it's definitely home. Understood .

96
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Please tell me the name of that person.

97
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
(Speaker) Umm, Fully cute Junko.

98
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
How many people are you?

99
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,800
(Speaker) No, I don't know exactly ➡

100
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
I think he's in his early 60s. ➡

101
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,800
He said he had a chronic heart condition. ➡

102
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,800
And I live alone. That's why I want you to hurry.

103
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Yes, the ambulance is already on the way.

104
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Can I give him my phone number?

105
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
(Speaker) Ah, yes. 090's...

106
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,800
The door may be locked.

107
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Firefighters will also be out. Yeah .

108
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
There is a possibility that the firefighters will head over to the area.

109
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Worst, I might break the door, is that okay?

110
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
(Speaker) Ah, yes please.

111
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,800
So, your name and phone number...

112
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Was your phone broken?

113
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
(Speaker) That's right, I dropped it in the toilet.

114
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
So please name me.

115
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,800
(Speaker) Ugh... This is Suzuki. Suzuki Hiroshi.

116
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Suzuki will be at Furukawa's home after this ➡

117
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Will you head over? (Speaker) What? Ah, ah... huh... huh...

118
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Well, what are you here now? ➡

119
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Is this a public phone in Ogimachi Park, Naka Ward?

120
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
(Speaker) Yes... Yes, that's right. ➡

121
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,800
I think it will probably take about 40 minutes.

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
40 minutes...

123
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
(Takachiho) Until the squad members can contact the collapsed person ➡

124
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Please wait on the spot.

125
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,800
It's a problem if I can't contact you if something happens.

126
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
So, Suzuki-san, sorry ➡

127
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Can I wait near that public phone for a while?

128
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
If the emergency team could contact Furukawa-san ➡

129
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,800
We will contact you there. (Speaker) Yes, yes, I understand.

130
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Sorry. So let's cut this one off for now.

131
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,800
(Speaker) Yes please.

132

Have you not yet connected?

135
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Yeah . There's a high possibility that you're unconscious.

136
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
I hope the room is open.

137
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,400

However, the residents are women in their 20s and have no problems with their health.

143
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Her name is Furukawa, not Junko-san ➡

144
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
A woman in her 60s is said to be lying inside the room.

145
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
There is no situation either. Huh?

146
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,400
(Speaker) Are there any residents called Furukawa in another room?➡

147
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,400
I've checked, but is there any mistake in the reporting information at the headquarters?

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Please confirm. please . Yokohama Fire Department Understood.

Niijima-san. (Sara) Yes.

152
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Will you call Furukawa's number on the collapsed person?

Keep on calling. yes .

157
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Is it a prank?

158
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Or is the address wrong?

159
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
The person who reported earlier ➡

160
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Room number: It was stuck when I read it out.

161
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
There is also the possibility that you are wrong numbers.

162
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Furukawa-san himself is not able to connect as expected.

163
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
What do you do?

164
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,400
We were instructed to continue to search for Furukawa's house at the scene.

165
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,400
I can't yet assume it's a prank.

166
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400

There's a high possibility that it's a resident named Furukawa.

194
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
I want to check the room number. (Minowa) What?

195
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Is it Room 403 in City Hills? ➡

(Minowa) Which leg is hurting, Komiya?

202
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
(Speaker) No, that's fine, come quickly!

203
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,400
I'm heading to the ambulance already. Before the emergency services arrive

204
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
I'd like to hear a little more symptoms.

205
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
(Speaker) (Chime) (Speaker) Ah➡

206
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,400

207
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,400
(Speaker) (Knock) (Speaker) Ugh... Yes!

208
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
(Minowa) This might be bad.

209
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400

Here here! Carry it right away. ➡

215

Look, look at this.

216
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,400
(Uesugi) Ah, um, here at Furukawa's house?

217
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Huh? Fully cute? It's Komiya. I reported it earlier.

218
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Could you please wait a little? (Komiya) Ha! ?

219
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Yokohama Fire Department from the Central Fire and Rescue Team.

220
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
This is Yokohama Fire Department, please.

00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,400
(Speaker) (Uesugi) The emergency request for room 403 in the apartment building that is currently participating is ➡

222
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Have you noticed it? please .

223
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Yamamoto Town Emergency Team has already been ordered to Room 403. please .

224
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
(Speaker) (Uesugi) Understood. (Speaker) (Komiya) Hey, I'll be at the hospital ➡

225
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Take me with you! It hurts and I'm about to die, this one!

226
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,400
(Speaker) (Uesugi) Sorry. What should you do?

227
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,400
(Yogoru) We have confirmed this with the management company. In Room 207 in City Hills ➡

228
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Apparently there is a person named Furukawa who lives there.

229
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
207? (Yogo) But your name is ➡

230
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Apparently it's Yoriko, not Junko. (Takachiho) Yoriko...

231
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
(Yogo) Yes, kanji is "in order" so ➡

232
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,400
It is also possible that the reporter made a mistake.

233
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,400
(Takachiho) Understood. It's not 201, it's 207.

234
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,400
yes . (Takachiho) The man in room 403 is ➡

235
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Another emergency team will respond as usual later.

236
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,400
The current squad members should immediately head to Room 207.

237
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
learn.

238
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,400
For each squad that is participating in the disaster,

239
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Head towards Room 207. That's Yokohama Fire Department.

240
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
learn.

241
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,400
very sorry . Another emergency team will come.

242
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Please wait a little longer. (Komiya) Huh? What is that?

243
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
I'm really sorry.

244
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Hey, what's that about? ?

245
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,400
I'm very sorry, but the current members are

246
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
I was looking for another emergency.

247
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
(Speaker) (Komiya) Oh? (Minowa) At Komiya's place ➡

248
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
The emergency services will head straight away...

249
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,400
(Speaker) Do you know?! A citizen who is in pain so much ➡

250
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
It's impossible to leave it there!

251
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,066
But the person who was reported first would have priority.

252
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,400
(Speaker) This is an emergency! ➡

253
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,400
What will you do if you run out of your legs? Hey!

254
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Um, the emergency team is about to stop it from disappearing...

255
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
(Speaker) It looks like it's going to come off! (Minowa) Ah, is it likely to come off?

256
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Let's calm down, then.

257
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
This is Yokohama Fire Department.

258
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
What do you think? (Iida) Without responding to the intercom ➡

259
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,400
The door is locked. Worst, you'll need to destroy the key.

260
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,400
learn.

261
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
⚟Um....

262
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,400
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

263
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
(Speaker) (Connecting sound)

264
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
(Speaker) (Female) Yes...

265
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
This is at Center No. 119 ➡

266
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Your name isn't Suzuki-san, right?

267
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,400
(Speaker) Suzuki? No, something was ringing so it just came out.

268
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,400
That's right. excuse me . Ah, it's okay to just turn it off.

269
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
(Speaker) (Calling sounds)

270
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Hmm... where did you go?

271
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,400
(Speaker) (Iida) From the Central Fire and Rescue Commander to Yokohama Fire Department.

272
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,400
This is Yokohama Fire Department, please. (Speaker) Room 207: Contact with the injured person. ➡

273
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,400
For more information, please call us. Yokohama Fire Department Understood.

274
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,400
(Speaker) (Ringtone) This is Yokohama Fire Department.

275
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
(Speaker) (Iida) This is Iida, the commander of the Central Fire and Rescue Team. ➡

276
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,400
I recently got into contact with Furukawa from Room 207 of City Hills. ➡

277
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
just… .

278
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,400
He was reported in a very healthy state.

279
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,400
He said there was no fact that he collapsed while calling a friend. ➡

280
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Apparently he'd been going shopping all the time.

281
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Huh?

282
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,400
(General Affairs Director) In other words, a woman collapses ➡

283
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,900
It was a mischievous or false report, right?

284
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,900
(Takachiho) Yes. I was told by the reporter.

285
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Furukawa's phone number also seemed completely ridiculous.

286
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,900
It's malicious and I can't forgive it ➡

287
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,900
I couldn't get in touch because it was reported from a public phone.

288
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,900
I wonder if Suzuki's real name is also her real name.

289
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,900
Wow, it's become awkward.

290
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,900
(General Affairs Section Chief) Tanaka-kun. (Tanaka) Ah, yes.

291
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,900
Apparently, Komiya, who was the second reporter, was

292
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,900
Apparently he had an account with a lot of followers.

293
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,900
"My body hurts so much today I thought I might die, so I called an ambulance.

294
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,900
It was put off."

295
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,900
No, we didn't put it off.

296
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
It's still going on.

297
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,900
"I'm depressed because the energetic bars from the same apartment building are given priority." ➡

298
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,900
"Yokohama Fire Department decides based on age, not symptoms."

299
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,900
Posts like this are getting likes in the millions.

300
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,900
If it's just that we were troubled by the false report ➡

301
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,900
That's a good idea to make an announcement ➡

302
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,900
This is how it's causing trouble to the citizens.

303
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,900
(General Affairs Section Chief) We will consider taking measures including press conferences.

304
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
The city gave instructions.

305
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,900
Press conference? Are you going to apologize?

306
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,900
This incident was a prank in the end.

307
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,900
What will the Command Division respond to when that report was made?

308
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,900
It should have been appropriate. (General Affairs Section Chief) Really?

309
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,900
Did you not notice it at some point?

310
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,900
The reporter is lying.

311
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,900
it is… . (General Affairs Director) Well, including that ➡

312
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,900
We will investigate with the leadership of the general affairs. ➡

313
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,900
Based on the report, the organization will determine whether a press conference is necessary.

314
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,900
nice?

315
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,900
yes .

316
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,900
Haa...

317
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Takachiho.

318
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,900
Your face is scary.

319
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,900
This is how it looks to begin with.

320
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900
(Takachiho) So that's why ➡

321
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,900
I think everyone will be asked in the future. sorry .

322
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,900
No, the section chief wouldn't apologise. That's right.

323
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,900
If you've been reported, you know that I'm a prank.

324
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,900
It's not Kasuhara-san's fault. The response was appropriate.

325
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,900
So then there's no need for a press conference, right?

326
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
That's what I think...

327
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,900
(Mobile phone) (Vibrator sound)

328
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,900
Sorry it's from the section chief.

329
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,900
Yes, this is Takachiho.

330
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,900
It looks like it's difficult. (Minowa) That's right➡

331
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,900
All of the people who reported that prank were in trouble.

332
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,900
(Yogo) That's right. I'm also making more comments and making my impressions ➡

333
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
This person, Komiya too. ➡

334
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,900
I heard from the emergency team that responded.

335
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
This person has high uric acid levels during a health check➡

336
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
Apparently he was told.

337
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,900
So, swelling of your big toe is clearly a symptom of gout.

338
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Ambulance due to gout.

339
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
But, I'm hiding that and slamming the fire department.

340
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
It's too late, isn't it? If I apologize ➡

341
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,900
Isn't it even more exciting? Well, but ➡

342
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,900
When you apologize, civil servants have no choice but to apologize.

343
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
I think so too .

344
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,900
If the response is delayed, the conversation will get more and more complicated.

345
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,900
(Yogo) But... (Minowa) What about Kasuhara-san? What do you think?

346
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,900
Hmm...

347
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,900
In the first place, why did you make that prank call?

348
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,900
First reporter.

349
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,900
That's what bothers me. Kasuhara: Be careful, more than usual.

350
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,900
yes… .

351
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,900
(Child) Daruma fell.

352
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,900
(Child) Daruma fell.

353
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,900
this… .

354
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,900
(Child) Daruma fell.

355
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
(Suzuki) {Aaaaah, please get an ambulance now} ➡

356
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,900
"It's not me, but it looks like an acquaintance has collapsed."

357
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
☎《I understand. Where to turn the ambulance?

358
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,900
Do you know which one? 》 《Ah yes yes》

359
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,900
《Wait a minute. I'll see it

360
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:22,900
{Eh, Teraocho 3-6, Naka-ku, Yokohama City Um 20...➡

361
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,900
It's 1. That's bad, presbyopia

362
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,900
"I just got the room number wrong."

363
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:35,900
"This person was planning to cause trouble to Furukawa-san from the beginning."

364
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,900
(Suzuki) "It was like that I dropped it in the toilet"

365
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,900
☎《So, please name me.》

366
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,900
"Huh... This is Suzuki. Suzuki Hiroshi

367
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,900
Also, it was a fake name after all.

368
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,900
⚟ (The sound of the door opening)

369
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,900
But why is Furukawa-san's name pronounced?

370
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,900
I guess he didn't know.

371
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
(Male) Something's going up again.

372
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,900
(Shop clerk) Sorry. We're working hard too.

373
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,900
(Shop clerk) Welcome, please.

374
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,900
(Male) Sorry, where are the bean sprouts?

375
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,900
No, there's no such thing as arugula. Is it not good to have chicory?

376
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,900
"None of the voices of that reporter"

377
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,900
Isn't that convenient...?

378
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,900
Furukawa-san. It's okay to go up. (Junko) Thank you for your hard work.

379
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,900
Furukawa-san...

380
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,900
I'm sorry for causing trouble yesterday.

381
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,900
no . But why is the Commander Division here?

382
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,900
In fact, it was a public phone that was reported...

383
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
Pick this up.

384
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,900
The reporter was harassing Furukawa-san.

385
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,900
I thought I'd reported it.

386
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,900
Maybe that person.

387
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,900
A man who occasionally comes to greet a while ago ➡

388
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:45,900
I refused when I asked him to give me my contact information.

389
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,900
He doesn't even know his name.

390
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,900
But I'm pretty persistent.

391
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Did you tell that person what Furukawa-san's name?

392
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,900
I don't intend to tell you, but this is what it is.

393
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,900
So the name is.

394
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,900
But how about the address...

395
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,900
Is there time after this?

396
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,900
yes .

397
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,900
This is what I want you to see.

398
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900
this… .

399
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,900
They look similar, right?

400
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
I made a note like this ➡

401
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,900
I think he made a mistake when reporting it.

402
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,900
In other words, the perpetrator of the mischief report is

403
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,900
I've been following Furukawa up until this point.

404
00:22:47,900 --> 00:23:02,900
♬～

405
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,900
That's a genuine stalker...

406
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,900
What should I do...?

407
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
What should I do?

408
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
Umm...

409
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,900
We firefighters can't catch the perpetrator.

410
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,900
Maybe I should consult the police.

411
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,900
That's right. sorry .

412
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,900
No, I'm sorry.

413
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,900
I never thought it was a prank report from someone like that.

414
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,900
(Junko) It's not Kasuhara-san's fault.

415
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,900
(Tanaka) What do you think? ➡

416
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,900
Organize the recorded data of the stories and reports from the Command Division ➡

417
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,900
I wonder if this was the situation.

418
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Yeah . Are you okay .

419
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Personally, no matter how you look at it, the response was appropriate.

420
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,900
I don't think there's even a need to hold a press conference.

421
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,900
I think I'll make that decision if I read this report too.

422
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Sorry Tanaka-kun. ➡

423
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,900
Ah, no, it's my fault that it was a hassle➡

424
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,900
All of these kinds of work are left to the general affairs.

425
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,900
No, it's fine. (Takachiho) No, but...

426
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,900
The work of the staff and command division on the field is: ➡

427
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,900
Responding to calls for help.

428
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,900
Don't spend time on this kind of thing➡

429
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,900
I want them to focus on saving as many people as possible.

430
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,900
By doing our work ➡

431
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,900
I think it's going to be around and save someone else's life.

432
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,900
thank you .

433
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,900
Section Chief: Is it okay? (Takachiho) Huh?

434
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,900
The other day's false report was as expected about Furukawa-san in Room 207 ➡

435
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,900
It was harassment. Or rather, he's now a stalker.

436
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,900
Eh... maybe you went? That apartment.

437
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,900
Ah... uh, I was thinking about what kind of person the reporter was.

438
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:11,900
By chance, I met Furukawa-san and then went along with him.

439
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,900
Ah... are you okay? that .

440
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,900
Sorry.

441
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,900
But can I leave this like this?

442
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,900
Understood. I'll share that with the above.

443
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,900
But what purpose did you have?

444
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,900
It's not the job of the fire department to investigate such things.

445
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,900
The question now is whether our response was appropriate.

446
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
(Yogu) Wow, what is it? this .

447
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,900
what up? (Yogo) That person called Komiya...

448
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,900
(Takachiho) "The other day, the Yokohama City Fire Department finally arrived ➡

449
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,900
I thought I came to apologize, but it wasn't me again➡

450
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,900
Baa was my priority."

451
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,900
He's even identified as Kasuhara from the Command Division.

452
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
He was being seen.

453
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,900
"We firefighters can't catch the perpetrator."

454
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,900
(Junko) {I see}

455
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,900
"I don't think it was a prank report from someone like that."

456
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,900
(Junko) "It's not Kasuhara's fault"

457
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,900
{Kasuhara} (Mobile phone) (Shutter sound)

458
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,900
So I said that, be careful.

459
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,900
(Minowa) Something's still up. ➡

460
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,900
"And also, I took an ambulance to Baa's house.

461
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Apparently he took the prank report seriously."

462
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,900
(Yogo) Ah, the person I don't want to know the most➡

463
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,900
It's been known.

464
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Sorry. It's my fault.

465
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,900
Are you okay . Now I'll switch and work.

466
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,900
I hope there's nothing.

467
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,900
There seem to be a lot of troublesome followers.

468
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,900
Which finger on which hand was cut with a knife?

469
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,900
(Speaker) (Female) Umm, this is the index finger on my left hand.

470
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,900
Understood . Has the bleeding been stopped?

471
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,900
(Speaker) Holds it with a towel. But I couldn't stop.

472
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,900
Then just keep pressing hard.

473
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,900
I'm heading to the ambulance already. (Speaker) Yes. ➡

474
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,900
But is it really okay?

475
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,900
yes? (Speaker) I'm in my twenties ➡

476
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,900
If it's better to prioritize the elderly ➡

477
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,900
On there... (Minowa) No, it's fine.

478
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,900
We provide ambulances to those who need it regardless of age.

479
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,900
yes . Now, please just wait.

480
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,900
Um, what's right now...

481
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,900
I'm sure you've been worried about this post.

482
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,900
(Takachiho) Yes. yes . ➡

483
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,900
No, so that's not the case ➡

484
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,900
There is no manual.

485
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,900
Please understand.... ☎ (Calling sounds)

486
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,900
What's wrong?

487
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,900
Ah, yes, well...

488
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,900
It's a call to complain to us.

489
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,900
(Minowa) I guess that kind of thing will come after all.

490
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,900
"Do you select your life based on your age?" ➡

491
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,900
There have been a number of such cases, such as, "Is there a manual too?"

492
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,900
I can no longer handle the general affairs department's response. ➡

493
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,900
It looks like it's going around at home.

494
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,900
So, it means they're actually coming more.

495
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,900
Section Chief Sorry. I… .

496
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,900
It's okay. I have to deal with this much ➡

497
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,900
Being a section chief in the command division is hard to do.

498
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,900
☎

499
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,900
(Takachiho) This is Takachiho, Command Division. ➡

500
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,900
yes . Please turn it.

501
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,900
I got a call instead.

502
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:06,900
Yeah . yes . yes .

503
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,900
(Takachiho) I'm sorry.

504
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,900
When I'm doing various hand-cranks in the background ➡

505
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,900
I guess I'll do something like this.

506
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,900
yes .

507
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,900
But this is her own way➡

508
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,900
This is an action taken with the safety of the citizens in mind.

509
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,900
(General Affairs Manager) She's not the only problem.

510
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,900
Well, even so ➡

511
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,900
It is true that the impression of the fire department has become bad.

512
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,900
What's more, even the false report was revealed ➡

513
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,900
We've also received inquiries from the media. ➡

514
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,900
A press conference was held promptly to resolve the situation. ➡

515
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,900
That's the decision.

516
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,900
No... But if we hold a press conference now ➡

517
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:57,900
It will only lower the morale of staff, and if a similar report is received in the future,

518
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,900
You can make irreparable mistakes because you are afraid of failure.

519
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,900
In the first place, it was your mistake in judgment. ➡

520
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,900
Think of it as best you don't have to explain it yourself.

521
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,900
(Dojima) He's probably looking scary again.

522
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,900
Ping Pong. See.

523
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
thank you .

524
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:39,900
They are likely to hold a press conference regarding the false report.

525
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,900
It's a pain.

526
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,900
I wonder what I should have done.

527
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,900
(Takachiho) Isn't Dojima-san able to do better?

528
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,900
In the end, you have no choice but to trust your own judgment.

529
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,900
When I went to Kobe to cheer on

530
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,900
Takachiho That's what your dad said to you.

531
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,900
What...

532
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,900
(Dojima) At that time, both the government office and the fire department were affected by disaster➡

533
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,900
Not at all, but no one could get the accurate information.

534
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,900
(Dojima) Everything was decided by the field, whether to help and what to do.

535
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,900
After the earthquake, triage was introduced in Japan as well➡

536
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,900
Life has been prioritized.

537
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,900
(Dojima) This is the entire fire service system in the last ten years. ➡

538
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,900
Technology has also improved, so many things have become smoother.

539
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,900
But in the end, what a human can do ➡

540
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,900
Nothing has changed.

541
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,900
(Dojima) I'm looking at this view seems to change in an instant ➡

542
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,900
Even if something big like that happens ➡

543
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,900
It's the same.

544
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,900
Finally, trust your own judgment.

545
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:23,900
If you can't do that, you can't save someone else's life.

546
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,900
(Dojima) Ah, Takachiho.

547
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,900
Whether you're wrong or not

548
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,900
Because the guys under you know the best.

549
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,900
yes .

550
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,900
(Shutter sound)

551
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,900
Well then, I recently found an apartment in Naka Ward ➡

552
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:18,900
Regarding false reports and responses from the fire department in such cases➡

553
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,900
I would like to start a press conference.

554
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,900
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

555
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,900
(Sara) Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

556
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,900
(Speaker) (Miyake) Ambulance! Ugh....

557
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,900
What if?

558
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,900
(Speaker) Ugh, chocolate... I was trying to boil the chocolate.

559
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,900
And so the water that I was boiling turned over!

560
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,900
Did you get in your body? (Speaker) Yes on the thighs.

561
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,900
(Sara) I understand. Where to turn the ambulance?

562
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,900
Which will it be? (Speaker) Shirasunacho 2 - 6➡, Isogo Ward, Yokohama City

563
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,900
This is 405 from Hanazono Residence.

564
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,900
(Sara) I understand. Who's your house is there?

565
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,900
(Speaker) It's me. This is Miyake. (Sara) It's Miyake-san.

566
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,900
I was instructed to head to the ambulance. ➡

567
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,900
Are you cooling under running water now? (Speaker) Yes.

568
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,900
14:31 From a man in his 30s who lives in another room in our apartment building➡

569
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,900
Due to the sudden illness, the command center has requested an ambulance. ➡

570
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,900
Furthermore, the men were also present on the staff at the scene.

571
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,900
I was requested to transport it ➡

572
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,900
The members were responding to the previous report...

573
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,900
yes . What is your situation now?

574
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,900
Are you breathing? (Speaker) (Male) I'm breathing ➡

575
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,900
Something wobbling was making my lips look purple too.

576
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,900
is that so . (Speaker) Water content ➡

577
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,900
I can't get it at all. After drinking a little, I vomited right away.

578
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,900
That's tough. The ambulance is already on my way ➡

579
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
Please wait a little longer. (Speaker) (Ringtone)

580
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,900
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

581
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,900
(Speaker) (Female) No. 119?

582
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,900
yes . Here's the Yokohama fire department.

583
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,900
(Speaker)... Sorry, I made a mistake! ➡

584
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,900
I was thinking of asking for the time signal. It's not good anymore. ➡

585
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,900
Sorry. yes . Sorry.

586
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,900
(General Affairs Director) As a result, he responded to false reports.

587
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:01,900
What caused another reporter to feel uncomfortable?

588
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,900
It's true. We are very sorry.

589
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:11,900
(Shutter sound)

590
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,900
Now let's move on to the question and answer session.

591
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,900
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

592
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,900
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

593
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,900
(Speaker) (Male) Ahh... ah, please in the emergency.

594
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,900
What happened? (Speaker) Just a moment ➡

595
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,900
I can't move. My lower back is a little... ugh... it hurts.

596
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,900
My back hurts, isn't it? Are you unable to stand up now?

597
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,900
(Speaker) That's right, that's right. It's completely turned over now.

598
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,900
Understood . Please wait a moment.

599
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,900
This reporter: The other day, he made a false report from a public phone.

600
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,900
I feel like the voices are the same.

601
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,900
Understood. Continue listening.

602
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,900
yes .

603
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,900
Sorry for the long wait.

604
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,900
Well, where should I go to the ambulance?

605
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,900
Which will it be? (Speaker) Ah, uh... ➡

606
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:12,900
Room 207 is a condominium called City Hills in Teraocho, Naka Ward.

607
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,900
(Reporter) Still, the Command Division reported the prank ➡

608
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,900
It's true that you were made to dance, right? ➡

609
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,900
Overall, it's a decline in the quality of staff.

610
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,900
Isn't there no education?

611
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:34,900
yes . We are able to respond to the voices of our citizens.

612
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,900
We hope to continue to provide thorough guidance in the future.

613
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,900
Is it Room 207 in Teraocho, Naka-ku?

614
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,900
Also in Furukawa's room. (Minowa) Is this a lie too?

615
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,900
But this time I'm calling from a mobile phone.

616
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,900
It is within the range of the base station.

617
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,900
(Speaker) It hurts... What's going on? ➡

618
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,900
Hey, hurry up ambulance.

619
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,900
(Reporter) Specifically, the public's concerns

620
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,900
How do you think to dispel it?

621
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,900
(General Affairs Director) Please take specific measures to address this issue as soon as possible➡

622
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,900
We will present this to all citizens.

623
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,900
(Speaker) Ugh... it hurts... Ah... it's no good This.

624
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,900
(Dojima) "Takachiho, that's what your dad said to you."

625
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,900
"In the end, trust your own judgment."

626
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,900
"I hope nothing happens all day today"

627
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,900
Kasuhara-san, take the ambulance.

628
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,900
yes . I'll send you to the ambulance right away.

629
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,900
(General Affairs Section Chief) The press conference will now conclude.

630
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:14,900
♬～

631
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,900
Um!

632
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,900
Is there one last thing to do?

633
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,900
This is my personal opinion, but ➡

634
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,900
Command controllers are on a daily basis ➡

635
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,900
I sincerely address the calls for help.

636
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,900
The ambulance is already on the way.

637
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,900
Can I tell you your name?

638
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,900
(Speaker) (Iwase) Iwase. Iwase Noboru.

639
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,900
It's Iwase-san. How many are you?

640
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,900
(Mic) (Tanaka) Even if it's any report ➡

641
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,900
If even 1% of your life is at risk, head to help.

642
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,900
Unlike the villagers who gave up on the wolf boy ➡

643
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,900
No matter how many times you get lying, ➡

644
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,900
Command controllers have no choice but to continue to trust the reporter.

645
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,900
Do you know what causes lower back pain?

646
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,900
Because there's nothing to replace someone's life.

647
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,900
So please... please ➡

648
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,900
Reports that tramples on the thoughts of such staff members➡

649
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Please stop.

650
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:38,900
We appreciate your cooperation in making the proper use of No. 119!

651
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
(Shutter sound)

652
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,900
So, the reason is because you hit it hard, right?

653
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,900
(Speaker) Yes, that's right. ➡

654
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,900
This... this is probably broken. (Speaker) (Car driving sound)

655
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,900
Hey, is this person in the room?

656
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,900
Are you in Room 207 now?

657
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,900
(Speaker) What? Ah... Ah, no no no ➡

658
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,900
Ah... that's the balcony, the balcony.

659
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,900
Veranda? (Speaker) Ah, ah, ah ➡

660
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,900
He got into a fight with her and was kicked out on the balcony. ➡

661
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,900
He just went out. ➡

662
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,900
That's terrible. is that so .

663
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,900
So you can't go back to the room, right?

664
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,900
(Speaker) Yes. If this is really ➡

665
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,900
If it were Furukawa's stalker, then it would be a trespassing.

666
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,900
You should also contact the police. But I feel like their voices are similar ➡

667
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,900
That alone can't be decided. If there's any other deciding factor.

668
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,900
(Yogure) {In Room 207, City Hills ➡

669
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,900
Apparently there is a person named Furukawa who lives there.

670
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,900
"Did you tell that person what Furukawa-san's name? 》

671
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,900
Ah, is that Iwase-san's home?

672
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,900
