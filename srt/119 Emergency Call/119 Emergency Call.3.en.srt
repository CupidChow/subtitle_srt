1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
(Male) What? 24 Does that mean you shouldn't go out for hours?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It starts from 8:30 in the morning until 8:30 the next day.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
When a sudden increase in reports due to a disaster, etc. ➡

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Because I have to deal with it. (Men) Hmm...

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So you can't go to a convenience store or something? (Sara) Well, it's basically a lunch box.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There's a vending machine and a rest area inside.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Something can be done. (Everyone) Wow.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But you can't even watch your smartphone while you're at work, right?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah . No carry-in is permitted inside the command center where a report is received.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
(Male) Ugh, that's amazing. Is it okay? Sho.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
(Male) Ugh, that's amazing. Is it okay? Sho.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,666
yeah? Why me? (Male) Because when I was in college ➡

13
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,666
I just didn't reply for 10 minutes from Sara-chan ➡

14
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,666
He was almost crying. (Male) There it!

15
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,666
(Male) Maybe he was disliked. (Sho) No no no no.

16
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,000
That was when we just started dating.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How long will I keep it as a joke? (Everyone) Ahaha!

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, I can't get in touch at work, but what's wrong?

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's the same for any job ➡

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If we have a good day off like this, we can meet at any time. Right?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
(Sara) Yes. (Male) But when it gets long distance ➡

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not saying that either.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What is the time difference between London?

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
(Male) Ah... That's true.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
B... London? (Sho) No, um... that's...

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
(Male) Sorry. Did you still have to say something?

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
sorry .

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It wasn't that I hid it ➡

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He's only one of the candidates yet.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
How much? If you go. (Sho) Ah...

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's probably at least two years.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's probably at least two years.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I see....

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But that's amazing. I'm not going to be a candidate for overseas transfers.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No... not at all.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The company just has a policy of letting young people go to the market.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Does Sara definitely want to continue her current job?

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Does Sara definitely want to continue her current job?

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
(Sara) Yes?

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
(Sho) No, see... When I was in college, I would say I wanted to work abroad.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
(Sho) Saraha is more...

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
ah… .

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
sorry . Thinking about the future ➡

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I just thought that my current job was really the best. ➡

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sorry, let's go.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
(Sara) Abra Hapones?

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Noahbro Espanyol Bien.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
⚟ (Staff) Good morning. ⚟ (Staff) Good morning.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
good morning .

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
(Minowa) Yes, please come on this. (Yogo) Thank you.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Is it a souvenir from somewhere? (Minowa) No, not.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yesterday I got excited and bought too much.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yesterday I got excited and bought too much.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The next amateur rakugo performance will be "Manjuu scary" ➡

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
For eating as an image training session. Ah, it's scary... Ah, it's scary!

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Ah... ah! Manju is scary! (Yogo) Is that an image training session?

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What about Niijima-san? (Sara) Ah, that's fine.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
(Minowa) Yes.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hmm... I guess I have to go again after all...

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What are you doing?

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What a house! ?

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I was surprised... No, this is what surprised me.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I was surprised... No, this is what surprised me.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Kasuhara-san, are you going to buy a house? Ah... it's not.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I was just a little curious and went to the public viewing.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That means I'll buy it sooner or later.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Instead, it's a new one in Tsuzuki Ward.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's a residential area. ➡

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The exterior of the house is all the same.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
(Minowa) Ah... That's true. If there is a future report ➡

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If there's no way to tell the difference other than the nameplate ➡

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I thought it would be a problem.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Huh? A house that you don't even buy ➡

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Did you mean you went to see it on your day off?

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Did you mean you went to see it on your day off?

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Combined with a happy family? yes .

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Kasuhara-san has been thinking about work for a long time.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Huh? Ah... Come to think of it.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
(Minowa) Apparently like a section chief ➡

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Watch the DVD of the movie that my ex-husband left behind.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's better than just wrapping the tubes alone.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You can hear it, Minowa-kun.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
"The Devil's Sacrifice" The highball you drink while watching is the best, right?

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's completely different. " evil dead "

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's it!

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That's it!

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Ah, I haven't received it yet. (Minowa) How many do you want?

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Ou .

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's Kaneshita-san, right?

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
yes . Thank you for this the other day.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Sorry, I have something delicious.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
(Uesugi) Kaneshita also went to the scene from the Command Division...

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
(Iida) Uesugi.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well then.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Someone from the Central Police Station had come.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
He said he will be awarded the director for the recent fire at Tsurumi factory.

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It prevents explosions before they happen. Is that what it is?

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Isn't that strange? ➡

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It was Kaneshita who noticed aluminum.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
it's okay . In fact, it was the people on the scene who put their bodies on the ground who put their bodies on the ground.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
it's okay . In fact, it was the people on the scene who put their bodies on the ground who put their bodies on the ground.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There's only one person who doesn't like me.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's called Uesugi. ah… .

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What acquaintance? home . It's just a sync.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
They were just the same room at fire school.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You know someone.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Um... Is it about time to do it?

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Ah... sorry Tanaka-kun.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Please. (Tanaka) Yes.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Umm, that's right ➡

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Towards hiring new staff at Yokohama City Fire Department ➡

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We will be posting interviews with staff from each department on our website.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We will be posting interviews with staff from each department on our website.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Interview? (Tanaka) What about the rewards of work?➡

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I hope to be able to show you what they are doing along with photos.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And the command controller in the Command Division also wants to ask someone else.

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There's no choice but to be honest, I'm here... (Takachiho) Kasuhara-san, what do you think?

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Huh? Is it me? (Takachiho) Yes.

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It can also be reported that there are also people who change jobs from other industries.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Above all, the motivation for this job is the best of these, right?

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Above all, the motivation for this job is the best of these, right?

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Is that so? Right, no matter how you look at it!

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hey? Hey, that's right, right? Come on! Hey! ➡

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
See, Kasuhara is the most suitable person. ➡

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
See.... (Applause)

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The ambulance is already on the way, so the child will just leave it alone ➡

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Please leave it to sleep. (Speaker) (Ringtone)

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
(Sara) Fire Department No. 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
(Speaker) (Male) I don't know which one this is, though ➡

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Anyway, I want someone to let me know.

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What did you do? (Speaker) The ring that couldn't come off. ➡

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm hooked on it tightly. So, someone please send me now.

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm hooked on it tightly. So, someone please send me now.

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm sorry, but I can't send ambulances or fire trucks.

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
(Speaker) There's no need to have a car. If someone could come.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's not possible either. (Speaker) So what should I do?

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If you can't get out, please contact your local fire station.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It will be cut using a ring cutter at the police station.

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
(Speaker) That you can do it yourself! ? If it's the same fire service then that's it ➡

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It would be nice if you could contact me! (Sara) I can't do it.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm hanging up this call. (Speaker) (Cancel sound)

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Sometimes it happens, reporting a ring.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'd like to tell you some tricks to using dishwash detergent and thread.

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's been a pleasure.

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's a good thing for the reporter to investigate.

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's a waste of time. (Minowa) Well... That's true.

147

(Speaker) (Ringtone) Fire department number 119.

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
(Speaker) (Interpreter) It seems that only you can tell from Yokohama.

168
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
(Speaker) (Interpreter) I am a tourist. It's like Chinatown though...

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What do you see from where you are now?

170
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000

(Speaker) (Interpreter's Chinese) (Speaker) (Male Chinese)

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
(Speaker) (Interpreter) Apparently it's near Seiryu Hotel.

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Seiryu Hotel....

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
There's no hotel...

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Um... maybe the reporter ➡

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Did you say "Seiryu Restaurant?"

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
(Speaker) (Interpreter) Yes. So it's Seiryu Hotel.

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Is there a possibility that it's not a hotel but a restaurant?

180
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
(Speaker) (Interpreter) Ah! (Speaker) (Interpreter's Chinese)

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
(Speaker) (Male Chinese)

182
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
(Speaker) (Interpreter) Sorry it was a restaurant.

183
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
(Speaker) (Interpreter) Sorry it was a restaurant.

184
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
(Speaker) (Interpreter) That's my mistake. In Taiwan, the meaning of hotels is often the case.

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No, it's okay. I'll be heading straight away by ambulance ➡

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Please tell me you want to be safe.

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
(Speaker) (Interpreter's Chinese)

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
(Speaker) (Male) Shei Shei Shei. thank you .

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Do you know what week your wife is pregnant?

♬～

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Thank you so much for now. Niijima-san, you know anything other than English.

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I just remembered words that were easy to misunderstand.

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I just remembered words that were easy to misunderstand.

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No... that alone is amazing.

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This was my first time using an interpreter service. ➡

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's difficult. For foreigners who are not familiar with the land ➡

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It would be hard to find out where I am now ➡

199
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It would take more than twice as long if you use an interpreter.

200
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But is that? At least like Niijima-san ➡

201
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Should I speak English? Huh?

202
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
How did you study? English conversation classes?

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Haa... You should stop doing unnecessary things.

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
There are reports in various languages ​​here.

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Many people don't speak English.

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
If so, we use interpreting services.

207
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's better to train to improve the accuracy and speed of listening.

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's all I can say.

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
(The sound of the door opening and closing) That's true...

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Don't miss it.

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
No, it's as long as you can talk about it that much. That's amazing. ➡

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Don't miss it. (Yogo) Even before Kasuhara-san came➡

213
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's been the case for a long time.

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I mean, I can't really talk about myself.

215
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's right . But Niijima-san ➡

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Apparently he studied abroad in the United States when he was in college.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's a mystery why such a person came to the fire department.

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Are you going to Chinatown today?

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
How do you know? I pretty much understand.

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You want to review that report, right?

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
yes . So why don't you go with me?

222
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I also have a regular shop in Chinatown.

223
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I would be happy if they could have had a drink.

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Ahhh.

225
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So... please! oh! Okay.

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So Minowa and Yogura should come too.

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No, why do we even...

228
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Kasuhara-san's welcome party hasn't been held yet.

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No... But I've had a bit of alcohol in the morning.

230
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That's why I don't have to drink it. The Chinese noodles are also delicious.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yes, a welcome party.

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes, a welcome party.

233
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Niijima-san, everyone is all... (Sara) I'm fine.

234
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Thank you for your hard work. (Minowa) You're so tired.

235
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm so busy. (Takachiho) Thank you for your hard work.

236
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Ah, then, the rest is Kaneshita. (Minowa) What?

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Kaneshita-san, let's stop. That guy is no good.

238
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That guy alone.

239
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
(Minowa) Hey, why are you? What's scary? Ah, that's it ➡

240
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's a frog. Wow, is it a frog? Hehe... Frog!

241
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Iheehee... the best!

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No, um... I'm not laughing at the beginning yet.

243
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Stop it now! A frog! Too interesting!

244
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No, if it's so popular, I can't do it!

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Kaneshita-san was a laughing Ueto.

246
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yeah . But you shouldn't tell the person when you're sober.

247
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Because my tongue is clicked. (Yo Wu) What is that unfair.

248
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
There are a lot of foreigners after all.

249
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes... it's been increasing all at once in a year or two.

250
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What's more, it's now the Chinese New Year period. (Shop clerk) Just a moment! ➡

251

It seems like there will be more reports like that.

254
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
(Takachiho) Now they're disbanding! Thank you for your hard work.

It's really complicated. You have to be careful.

Is there any point in telling me that? Huh?

335
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Bad egg...Does it meant it hit an egg?

336
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
(Speaker) Why does this happen?

337

(Speaker) (Crying) (Sara) Minowa-san.

344
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000

345
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Huh? (Sara) It will replace it.

346
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000

(Minowa) Ah, that's right. As expected.

365
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I see . But... where I am now ➡

366
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I won't be able to go to the ambulance unless I'm properly informed. ➡

367
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I want someone to replace them.

yes .

369
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What a grandma from earlier...

370
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I had dementia. Talk to the facility staff ➡

371
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Don't let the ambulance go and check on it.

372
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Manual for dealing with inappropriate use.

373
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
(Sara) Yes. Reports to 9119 are constantly increasing.

374
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
If you spend time on low urgency junk calls,

375
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
If you spend time on low urgency junk calls,

376
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
We will no longer be able to respond to truly important reports.

377
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
(Takachiho) Yes. (Sara) To be honest, ➡

378
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
There are many people who have been dealing with the third department for a long time without any problems.

379
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
(Takachiho) Yes... I understand what Niijima is trying to say.

380
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But it's inappropriate use or junk ➡

381
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Is it so easy to judge?

382
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
it is… . (Takachiho) Manage everything ➡

383
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000

The serious symptoms and circumstances that could have been heard.

385
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The serious symptoms and circumstances that could have been heard.

386
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Isn't there a risk of missing out?

387
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
⚟ (The sound of the door opening) (Tanaka) Sorry, Chief Takachiho.

388

Is it okay now? (Takachiho) Hmm... yes.

389
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I also reported this to a city in the city about the black private lodgings in Chinatown.

390
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It is said that they will consider taking measures including administrative guidance.

399
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I guess the entire Command Division must share it. ➡

400
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Can you ask for the transfer materials Kasuhara-san?

401

(Speaker) (Male) Are you trying to say I'm panic? Are you making fun of me! ?

428
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Not done. This is for those who need an ambulance.

429
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I just want to know the information.

430
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000

434
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
(Speaker) (Male) That's the one who's listening! ? You're saying you should bring a man!

435
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Cool under running water until the ambulance arrives.

436
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Do what you can, even if it's over your clothes.

437
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
(Speaker) (Male) You're all cluttered and shut up! ! ➡

438

I know the situation. The ambulance is already on the way.

I know the situation. The ambulance is already on the way.

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Before that, there is the necessary first aid.

445
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Would you help me? (Speaker) (Male) Ah, I understand. ➡

First of all, are the areas where you burned are now cooled?

448
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Cool under running water.

449
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Thank you for your hard work...

450
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Ah... uh... .

451
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Niijima-san, are you okay?

452
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Ah... it's okay...

453
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
but… . It's just a period pain.

454
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
If that's the case, I'll have medicine. it's okay!

455
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's better not to overdo it. Leave it alone!

456
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
sorry .

457
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It's fine I'll pick it up myself.

458
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I wish they'd told me if it was tough.

459
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You can't do such irresponsible things.

460
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I… .

461
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I was... and it was a little bit overwhelming.

462
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Even if you don't have to help someone ➡

463
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm fine on my own...

464

(Takachiho) Wow! Niijima-san.

478
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
(Takachiho) Today we had a drinking party with the chiefs of Asahi Police Station.➡

479
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I was a bit clueless about the okonomiyaki that came out there.

480
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Haa... I didn't feel like I had eaten it at all.

481
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Ahaha... I'm from Kobe.

482
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What's more, my mother runs an okonomiyaki restaurant.

483
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
My father was a local firefighter.

484
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Where is Niijima-san? (Sara) What... Ah...

485
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
My mother works at Kawasaki city hall ➡

486
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
My father is now in emergency services at the Kawasaki Fire Department.

487
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Ah... That's right.

488
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
After all, there are a lot of people entering the fire service due to the influence of their parents.

489
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
After all, there are a lot of people entering the fire service due to the influence of their parents.

490
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I've always hated it.

491
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
My father's job and my mother's job.

492
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
No matter how unreasonable you say just a civil servant ➡

493
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Because I've seen him have to endure it.

494
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
ah… .

495
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But five years ago, when COVID➡

496
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I thought when I saw my father playing as an emergency team without a break.

497
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Without civil servants, this country would be over.

498
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I think that might be more important than going out into the world.

499
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I see. So...

500
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I couldn't become an emergency crew like my father.

501
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But in the Command Division, you can use your skills.

502
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
But in the Command Division, you can use your skills.

503
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I thought I could do my best.

504
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But in the end I was like Kasuhara-san.

505
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Those who are willing to take action and can get others involved ➡

506
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I guess it's suitable for you.

507
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I can't get used to... ah.

508
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That's what I was thinking.

509
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Ah... If you're happy to order coffee, do whatever you like.

510
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
(Chief of Section 2) That's all for the handover from Section 2. ➡

511
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
thank you . (2 people) Thank you for your hard work.

512
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Isn't it really cold today?

513
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
(Minowa) That. The moment I woke up in the morning, I was in the room and was breathless.

514
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Huh? Do you prefer not to turn on the air conditioner when you're sleeping?

515
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Because it's not a sore throat.

516
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You should set the timer an hour before you wake up.

517
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
(Minowa) Oh, did you have that kind of thing?

518
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Niijima-san, will you use this? It's cold inside the command center.

519
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
it's okay .

520
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I see....

521
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
(Commuting controller) I'll go. (Command controller) Come, come!

522
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
(Commons from command controllers)

523
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
(Command controller) Oh, it's fine! Go as it is!

524
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
(Command controller) Oh, it's fine! Go as it is!

525
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
(Commons from command controllers)

526
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
No, it was crowded below.

527
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Sorry, I'll be able to open soon.

528
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Ah... It's fine, it's fine.

529
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'm fine with this one.

530
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
(Dojima) You don't seem to like this kind of atmosphere.

531
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I said you again. Sorry, sorry.

532
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Niijima-san. (Sara) Yes.

533
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
What is the best present for baby showers these days?

534
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Next time, a baby has been born.

535
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
What...

536
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Ah...

537
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Is chatting not okay?

538
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
No... I mean, it's not good...

539
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I don't really understand.

540
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I feel a bit worn out when I talk to various reporters at work.

541
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
There's no point in talking to someone until other times.

542
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Well... it's basically silly. A story about the guys here.

543
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But that's also important.

544
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's really tough to just listen to it.

545
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
We're at work, and in any case.

546
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
He must be the right person to listen to what the reporter says.

547
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So for the rest of the time ➡

548
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I have to let go of the silly stupid story➡

549
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'll definitely collapse one day.

550
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Even if I'm so tingly, I say, "Help me!" ➡

551
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Those who can speak out loud are tough in the end.

552
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Well, this is also a chat.

553
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I think money is good. (Dojima) Yes?

554
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
A baby gift. I think money is the best.

555
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
What you need varies from person to person.

556
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Is it cash?

557
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
After all, the times are different.

558
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm glad I asked you.

559
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So please tell me the address where you can drive the ambulance to.

560
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
(Speaker) (Female) Ah, no... You say it hurts ➡

561
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Did you go? a little bit!

562
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
(Speaker) (Male) No need, ambulance!

563
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Eh... um...➡

564
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Is the owner behind you? (Speaker) (Female) Ah, yes...

565
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Can you get a little replacement?

566
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
(Speaker) (Female) Something's wrong. Come on, hurry up.

567
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
hello . (Speaker) (Male) Umm...➡

568
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I don't need an ambulance. is that so .

569
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Are you feeling well now? (Speaker) Yes somehow. ➡

570
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Sorry... I'll always post it on my own.

571
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Sorry... I'll always post it on my own.

572
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
home . However, your wife is worried about you ➡

573
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Once I went to the hospital and had a discussion ➡

574
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Isn't it better to reassure you?

575
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
(Speaker) Ah... Yes. That's right, well... ➡

576
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
But today it's really okay.

577
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Understood . (Speaker) (Ringtone)

578
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

579
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
(Speaker) (Female Spanish)

580
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
This is... It's Spanish.

581
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Ｈｏｌｄ　ｏｎ　ｐｌｅａｓｅ．

00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
(Speaker) (Announcement) We are very sorry, but ➡

585
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
However, the lines are busy this time. ➡

586
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Please call again after a while.

587
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
What... There are times when it doesn't connect...

588
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
The number of foreign tourists is increasing ➡

589
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It may be because it's not just the fire service that uses interpretation services.

590
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
(Speaker) (Spanish)

591
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Ｊｕｓｔ　ａ　ｍｏｍｅｎｔ　ｐｌｅａｓｅ．

592
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
What should I do...? It's replaced.

593
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Ah, but Spanish... I know.

594
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
(Spanish)

595
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
(Speaker) (Female) Ah...just a little bit.

596
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
ＯＫ 。

597
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
( English )

598
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
(Speaker) (English)

599
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
(Speaker) (English)

600
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
(Speaker) (Female) ulcera duodenal.

601
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
What? (Speaker) (Female) ulcera duodenal.

602
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:46,000
(Speaker) (English)

603
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Urcera Dodenal.... (Speaker) (Female) Yeah.

604
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
what happened? ah… .

605
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm saying it might be the same disease as before.

606
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I don't know because the disease is Spanish. I see....

607
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
First, it's better to prioritize listening to the location.

608
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
First, it's better to prioritize listening to the location.

609
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
(Speaker) (English)

610
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
A street in Chinatown?

611
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
(Yogo) Hmm... that information alone is not possible.

612
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
(Speaker) (Spanish)

613
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
(Speaker) (Spanish)

614
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
(Speaker) (Spanish)

615
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
He said he left the hotel and collapsed immediately ➡

616
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I don't know the name of the hotel.

617
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Is it possible that you don't know the name of a hotel?

618
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Perhaps...

619
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
"There was a really hotel near that reporting location."

620
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
"It actually looks like a dark lodging service that's run without permission."

621
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
That private lodging is that...

622
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
(Yogure) The scope of the base stations is not strange either.

623
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
There must have been a lion ornament nearby.

624
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
(Speaker) (English)

625
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
(Speaker) (Female) Lion? (Sara) Yeah.

626
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
(Speaker) (English)

627
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
It's not... Yeah… .

628
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
(Speaker) (Sound) (Speaker) (Spanish)

629
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
(Speaker) (English)

630
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
(Speaker) (Female) Que hago? Vengan rapido!

631
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Even though I vomited blood. Huh?

632
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
⚟ (The sound of the door opening and closing) Niijima-san will you listen to this?

633
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Kaneshita-san's smartphone. I have obtained permission from the section chief.

634
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Isn't this what the reporter said earlier?

635
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
(Mobile phone) ulcera duodenal.

636
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
This one! This is... Duodenal ulcer.

637
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It might be serious if you vomit blood.

638
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
(Speaker) (Spanish)

639
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Ｉ　ｋｎｏｗ．
Ｊｕｓｔ　ｈｏｌｄ　ｏｎ．

640
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
If there is only one hotel in this area, would you send an ambulance?

641
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
No, it can't be said that there are no other black private lodgings.

642
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I see.... And if I'm wrong ➡

643
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It just creates unnecessary confusion. If you have identified the location now, then ➡

644
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
As a result, the ambulance arrives early.

645
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But what should I do more...?

646
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
But what should I do more...?

647
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
⚟ (Dojima) Yes, I'm back.

648
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
There's no need to deal with other reports.

649
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
yes . yes .

650
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Kasuhara-san.

651
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
The other day I found the dark private lodgings, which were away from the big street?

652
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Ah... uhh. It was an alley though ➡

653
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It's not that far away.

654
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
help me .

655
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Take it.

656
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
(Speaker) (Female) What about help?

657
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
(Speaker) (Female) I'll...?

658
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
(Speaker) (Female) Help me! help me! help me! ➡

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000

00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Help me! ! help me! (Speaker) (Footsteps)

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
(Speaker) (Sound)

663
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
(Speaker) (Female) Um... I got some phone call.

664
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Haa... This is number 119.

665
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I received a report from that person ➡

666
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
To identify where the ambulance is heading.

667
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Would you help me? (Speaker) (Female) Is that what it is... ➡

668
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Yes, it's fine. (Sara) Is there an electric pole nearby?

669
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
(Speaker) (Female) Electric pole... Ah, there is.

670
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
There should be an address there.

671
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
please confirm .

672
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
(Speaker) (Female) Yes, wait a minute. ➡

673
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Um... it says Yamashitacho 413.

674
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
It's 413 Yamashitacho. Understood .

675
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
The ambulance is heading for me now. Until the ambulance arrives

676
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Is it possible to be there? ➡

677
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
thank you . (Takachiho) Dojima-san.

678
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Did you teach her anything?

679
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
no? We just chatted.

680
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
As expected.

681
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

682
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

683
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
In the end, where was the report?

684
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It was in front of the dark lodging that Kasuhara found, right?

685
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
yes . But why wasn't there an ornament?

686
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
surely .

687
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
(Sara) Maybe I didn't listen to it properly.

688
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Lion is a lion in English. ➡

689
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
When I saw this ornament, there were not many Westerners who could think of it as lions.

690
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
When I saw this ornament, there were not many Westerners who could think of it as lions.

691
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
surely .

692
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
That's the difference in language...

693
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I should have noticed that yesterday.

694
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Sorry.

695
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
No, there's no need to apologize.

696
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Rather, I was the one who had been helped.

697
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Ah... no... but...

698
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Even myself could not have done it. thank you .

699
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Ah... No...thank you for this.

700
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Ah... No...thank you for this.

701
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
(Takachiho) So thank you both for your hard work.

702
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Thank you for your hard work.

703
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Um... Section Chief. (Takachiho) Yes?

704
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Scary manju is scary, scary.

705
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Does anyone have a furoshiki? Furoshiki! Hahaha...!

706
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
No, no, no... No, no, no Furoshiki, laughing, kojiya, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

707
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
still . (Sara) Kaneshita-san...

708
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Yeah, that's surprising. I was surprised the other day too.

709
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Niijima-san doesn't have to do it properly here either.

710
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
There's no need to work hard until it's not work ➡

711
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
If there's something you're thinking about already➡

712
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Just like the other day, it's better to be told something.

713
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Of course, if you don't like it, you can go home any time.

714
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm also quite a hassle when I get drunk.

715
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
yes .

716
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
(Mobile phone) (Announcement) After the beeping sound ➡

717
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Please send me a message. (Mobile phone) (Translator)

718
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Let's talk about the future properly tomorrow.

719
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Just like Sho wants to work hard in London ➡

720
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I also want to work hard on this job and don't want to quit.

721
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It's already too much trouble! Haa...

722
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
(Takachiho) Hmm... Come to think of it, what about Yogu-kun today?

723
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Something's a little late because I've taken over something. ➡

724
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It seems it's coming soon.

725
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It's Yogu. long time no see .

726
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
long time no see . Today is?

727
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Wow, I'm going to be featured on the recruitment page as a representative of the squad.

728
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
He said he wanted me to have an interview. (Yogu) Ah... I see.

729
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Ah, yeah. Well then, see you later. rainwear .

730
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Kasuhara! Chief! Haha!

731
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Or rather, isn't manju scary? this .

732
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Just cute! No, it's sesame dumplings.

733
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Wow! So why don't you know?

734
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I was laughing like that. What! ?

735
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
What do you think? Niijima-san. (Sara) What? Ah... No ➡

736
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I don't really understand either. Why are you scared of manju?

737
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Ah! Are you allergic? (Minowa) Are you allergic?

738
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Ah! Are you allergic? (Minowa) Are you allergic?

739
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Minowa Are you allergic to? lie… .

740
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
What? Kasuhara-san, this is general education, right?

741
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Rather, I'm thinking of ordering a super spicy mabo from now on.

742
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
i want to eat! (Minowa) No more! These people!

743
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
These people are really scary!

744
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
What! ? Hey, which means? Sorry.

745
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
One super spicy mabo please.

746
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Ah already! Ahhh!

747
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
['119 Emergency Call' is...]
