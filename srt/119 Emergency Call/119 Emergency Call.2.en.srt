Ah, yes. They say they'll do it in class.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hikari: I'm saying I'll definitely be presenting my dad's work.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Isn't it about time to talk properly?

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
(Takachiho) Currently in Yokohama City ➡

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
(Takachiho) Currently in Yokohama City ➡

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It is home to approximately 3.771,000 people. ➡

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This town is Japan's largest city ➡

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
All 911 calls are received ➡

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is the Yokohama City Fire Department Fire Command Center.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The number of reports I received over the past year is:

39

373,000, 121 pieces.

On average, there are 1,022 cases per day.

You will receive a report once every 1 minute or 25 seconds.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This means that they played an ambulance once every 2 minutes and 4 seconds.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This means that they played an ambulance once every 2 minutes and 4 seconds.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
(The children) Wow. (Takachiho) Yes, there are a lot.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let's take a look. (The children) Yes.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000

(Tanaka) Please don't fall.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
(The children) Amazing! Wow, it's amazing! amazing!

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
About the staff working at the command center, which is constantly tense.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
About the staff working at the command center, which is constantly tense.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They are called command controllers or dispatchers.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
(Children) Is it a dispatcher? Wow.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
(Speaker) (Female) Ah, um... ah... um... my son ➡

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm 1 year old, but... Is it called a button battery? ➡

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Maybe I'd swallowed it. (Sara) I understand.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Please tell me the address the ambulance is heading to.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
(Speaker) Ah... um... But I didn't look at the part I swallowed ➡

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
(Speaker) Ah... um... But I didn't look at the part I swallowed ➡

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But... I guess the batteries are gone...

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Anyway, I'm heading to the ambulance ➡

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Please give me your address. (Takachiho) That's how it is➡

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The command stand is the one reporting in the front row.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Basically, it is supported by voice calls.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
However, recently it's called Video 119 ➡

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You can also use a system that allows you to send videos on your smartphone.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
(The children) Wow. (Takachiho) Ah, there.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
(PC) Please help! Haa haa... It'll be like this for another hour!

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
(PC) Please help! Haa haa... It'll be like this for another hour!

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
(PC) It's already tough! Please come quickly!

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
(Yogo) Yes. It's okay, so please calm down.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What is the situation now? ➡

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Can I just drop it down with the camera and take a picture?

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
(PC) (Female) Yes. (Takachiho) If you use Video 119 ➡

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Guidance on life-saving measures that are difficult to use voice alone ➡

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,666
It will make it easier to understand the situation on the site.

80
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:56,000
Ah... that's what it means to be caught by an octopus.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Asahi Ward Sakurazaki Higashi 2-41-3 Is it Nagaoka's home?

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
(Speaker) (Female) Yes.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
(Takachiho) And the secondary stand is behind the command stand.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
(Speaker) (Female) Slap your back... (Sara) There's no need to do anything.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Say it's not okay to give them water or drinks.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
(Sara) Yes.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
(Children) So who is that person behind?

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No. 3 and No. 2 broadcast. I'll make an order from 3 ➡

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Number 2 please delete it. (Commuting controller) Yes.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
(Takachiho) That's the general stand. Command Center Understand the overall report ➡

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The person in charge will be the seat of the person in charge.

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
(Children) That old man certainly looks arrogant.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hehehe....

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Boooo, that's a shame. (Children) What?

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's true that man is a super veteran, but he's my subordinate.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
(Takachiho) Incidentally, at the Command Center, there are ➡ from 1 to 3.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm taking turns three teams, but ➡

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm the head of these three departments! (The children) Wow.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hey Tanaka-kun. (Tanaka) Yes.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
(Children) Um, I want to see the work of a firefighter.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
oh yeah! I want to see the fire truck being on.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
(Teacher) Hey! sorry .

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
(Teacher) Hey! sorry .

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, that's certainly the case.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But you know, the people who ride the fire trucks aren't the only ones who are firefighters.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
(The children) What? Hmm.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Firefighters are one of the ranks of firefighters.

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If you become a fire service staff, you can be in the fire service, the emergency service, or the General Affairs Division.

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Everyone is a firefighter at first. (Tanaka)!

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
(Takachiho) Everyone here is also a firefighter ➡

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
After gaining experience in the fire service and emergency services field ➡

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
After gaining experience in the fire service and emergency services field ➡

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He's coming to the Command Division.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
(Children's speaking)

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, I explained that it was somehow

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
When everyone is having trouble with a fire or illness ➡

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Please call 9119. (The children) Yes.

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Ah, but pranks are no good.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
(The children) Yes.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Um... So what about when you saw Kapitaro?

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Kapitaro?

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
(Speaker) (Female) Ah, um... uh... it's an emergency. ➡

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
A person at work cuts his finger with a factory machine ➡

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There was a lot of blood... Was it the man who cut his finger?

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you a woman? (Speaker) I'm a male.

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How old is you? (Speaker) Probably... I'm in my 20s.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Understood . I'll send the ambulance to you ➡

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Please tell me your address.

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
(Speaker) Ah... um... It's Sakuyama Kogyo. Located in Tsurumi Ward.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's Sakuyama Kogyo in Tsurumi Ward. Don't know the address?

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's Sakuyama Kogyo in Tsurumi Ward. Don't know the address?

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
(Speaker) (Female) Address.... (Speaker) (Factory Manager) Eh! ? ➡

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Are you calling an ambulance? Who?

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What if it's okay? (Speaker) (Female) Ah... the address, right? ➡

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Address Address... Sorry, I recently joined the dispatched person.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
If there are other employees around you, you can be replaced.

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There's no need to tease.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
(Speaker) Ah, address I get it. Umm...➡

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The address is 3-7-13 Hamaecho, Tsurumi Ward.

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The address is 3-7-13 Hamaecho, Tsurumi Ward.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,666
I've been able to confirm.

145
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,000
The ambulance is already on your way, so don't worry.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
(Speaker) Yes. That factory is

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There seem to be a lot of buildings, but can you tell which one it is?

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
(Speaker) What... what should I say here... Just a workshop...

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's a workshop. Are there any features of the appearance?

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
(Speaker) What... Features... Kasuhara is fine.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oral first aid guidance. So until the ambulance arrives.

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I would like to ask for first aid, is it okay?

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
(Speaker) Ah, yes.

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's surprisingly nerve-wracking to see elementary school students.

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's it.

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No matter how you look at it, the reporter I just said ➡

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I should have had the other employees take over.

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I first reported her, so she was there at that time, and at that place ➡

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He must have been the most responsible person to deal with.

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If you can't find the location because of that,

161
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's meaningless. So as much as possible ➡

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I was trying to gather objective information.

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Kaneshita-san stopped it.

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Kaneshita-san stopped it.

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's because it would have been better to hurry up first aid.

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Even if you don't even get that far ➡

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
There was a surefire way to get the emergency teams to arrive at the scene.

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What method is it? Think for yourself!

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What...! I'm not a supervisor anymore.

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Are you not getting along better after the instruction period is over?

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's it.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The emergency team has posted an activity report.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Ah, really?

174
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah?

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
ah… .

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Hmm...

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
(Takachiho) This is for staff members who will be assigned to the Command Division from next spring.

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is a training plan, so please check it out.

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
No, it's annoying! (Takachiho) Please. ➡

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No, it's annoying! (Takachiho) Please. ➡

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Dojima-san's reemployment period ends ➡

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We are planning to raise the next generation of legends.

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I said that. Legend fine is 100 yen per session.

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What are you planning to use that legendary savings for?

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
(Dojima) It's not as good as you use it.

186
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Um... Section Chief. (Takachiho) Yes?

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
When did you know the section chief and Dojima-san?

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Since when...

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Maybe 15-16 years ago?

190
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
When I was first assigned to the Command Division ➡

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
When I was first assigned to the Command Division ➡

192
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He was given direct guidance.

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I see... So that's how long it takes...

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What... Maybe you're worried about Kaneso?

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
yes . Are you disliked?

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Hmm... As command controllers, both of us

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Is it just that the core part is slightly different?

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Also, it's fine as long as you can tell him back.

199
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
For roughly such a hard type,

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's better for the people below to pretend they're stupid and get away with it.

201
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I hoped for this and asked Mr. Kasuhara to lead the instructor ➡

202
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
There are also places that have been made into Kaneshita. Is that so?

203
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah . I'm looking forward to it.

204
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I will do my best .

205
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Thank you for your hard work. You're so tired.

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Kaneshita-san, are you bored after this? Huh?

207
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The factory in Tsurumi where the accident occurred yesterday➡

208
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I think I'll go and see it now➡

209
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Would you like to go with us? There's no way I'll go.

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I've said it many times but ➡

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I didn't allow him to go see the scene.

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Is it even a nuisance to the scene because of us?

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Is it even a nuisance to the scene because of us?

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What does it mean?

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It was reported from the emergency team's activities.

216
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There are more buildings in the factory than I thought.

217
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It took a while to identify the workplace where the accident occurred.

218
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What Kaneshita hates most is causing trouble to the scene...➡

219
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Is that so?

220
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Tw... That's annoying.

221
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Tw... That's annoying.

222
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,666
Let's go.

223
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:42,000
♬～

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I can't believe you're planning on getting them inside, right?

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If we were civil servants and we were to join as fire department staff ➡

226
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Permission is... Um... sorry.

227
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I have a question I would like to ask you a little about it.

228
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
(Male) Yes, what's wrong?

229
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Sorry yesterday.

230
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Sorry yesterday.

231
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Wow, it seems that the dispatcher was upset even though it wasn't a major injury.

232
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No, it seems that the amount of bleeding was also high.

233
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I think I was right to call an ambulance.

234
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Ah, is that so?

235
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This is a metalworking factory, right?

236
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah . Um... I specialize in sheet metal processing of iron products.

237
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Ah. Um... would be fine if we could see the scene of the accident, right?

238
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
yes .

239
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I wanted to know what was going on at the time.

240
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I wanted to know what was going on at the time.

241
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Is there a woman who reported it?

242
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Ah... um... she... that... she quit yesterday.

243
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
See, it seems he was shocked to see that blood.

244
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
She's a woman. Hehehe...

245
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Is it true? Huh?

246
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
When I reported yesterday ➡

247
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I could hear you sounding searching for a reporter.

248
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
(Speaker) (Factory Manager) [Eh! ? Are you calling an ambulance? Who? 》

249
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
(Speaker) (Factory Manager) [Eh! ? Are you calling an ambulance? Who? 》

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Maybe after that ➡

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Didn't you blame him for reporting it?

252
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's... what is it?

253
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Does it have anything to do with you?

254
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
No, because... It doesn't matter.

255
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
very sorry . Kasuhara.

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
sorry .

257
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Well, it's fine though.

258
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
(Factory Manager) This is the machine that had an accident yesterday.

259
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The employee with his finger cuts, sat down here like this ➡

260
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The employee with his finger cuts, sat down here like this ➡

261
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And the girl who reported that... Ah, it's over there, isn't it?

262
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Hey!

263

{If that's the case...}

280
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Kasuhara.

(Footsteps)

283
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I see....

284
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I wish I had been taught this...

285
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Hey, maybe what I was doing now...

286
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Ah... yes. It's my imagination.

287
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
on second thoughts… .

288
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
If you were to be taught the characteristics of this building➡

289
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You told the emergency team.

290
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Um... this time we needed quick first aid.

291
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Do you have time to do something like that?

292
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
surely . So what should I do...

293
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Think about it yourself, right?

294
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I wish they had got someone to stand in front of the factory to guide the emergency team.

295
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I wish they had got someone to stand in front of the factory to guide the emergency team.

296
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's all that was fine.

297
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Neither the reporter nor us are perfect.

298
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So I think I can solve anything on my own.

299
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
...I see. ⚟ (The sound of the door opening)

300
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
(Factory Manager) Ah... what's wrong? home .

301
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
(Factory Manager) It's okay now, right? Yes, thank you very much.

302
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
(Male) Umm, sorry, factory manager. ➡

303
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Which warehouse did I receive just now?

304
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
(Factory Manager) Ah, yes, yes. Umm... um... there, there. ➡

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
See, the door to where the red drum can is. ➡

306
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Take it there. (Male) Ah, I understand.

307
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
nice to meet you . Yes hurry hurry hurry. Yes quickly. Work is quick.

308
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
(Factory Manager) Thank you very much.

309
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No... sorry.

310
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
People these days have to give instructions in everything ➡

311
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm starting to get sick of it now. Hehehe....

312
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Are there many employees who are dispatched?

313
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
(Factory Manager) Well, it's materials costs now...

314
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
thank you . I learned a lot.

315
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Because it's not the second time. That's right...

316
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Ah, I'd like to thank you. Breakfast: Would you like to eat together?

317
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's fine, that's what it is. No, that's about it.

318
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm really hungry... (The sound of the stomach squeal)

319
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
(Children's fuss)

320
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
(Children's fuss)

321
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Ah... I see. Is it today Saturday?

322
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
(Yawk)

323
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Hehe... sorry, I'm sleepy as expected.

324
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If I'd always done something like this, I wouldn't have had it.

325
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah?

326
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
When I work 24 hours and finally get some time off ➡

327
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I mean, I'd go out of my way to check the aftermath of a report that's finished.

328
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I mean, I'd go out of my way to check the aftermath of a report that's finished.

329
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I guess so. And like today ➡

330
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
There's no reason why Kasuhara thrusts his head into the reporter's head after that.

331
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's no longer a fire department job, and it just causes unnecessary trouble.

332
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's true but ➡

333
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I can't help but imagine it.

334
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It takes every day for us ➡

336
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Even one of hundreds of reports ➡

337
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
For many reporters,

338
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Isn't it an event that happens once in a lifetime?

339
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
For some people, their lives may change dramatically.

340
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So I'm

341
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I want to face each of them as hard as possible.

342
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Draw a line up to this point ➡

343
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I don't want to do something that didn't exist.

344
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That's all I'd say is beautiful.

345
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Ah! It's dangerous!

346
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What were you doing in that place?

347
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I was looking for Kapitaro. Kapitaro?

348
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't you know? Capybara. ➡

349
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I heard there have been people around here recently.

350
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Wow.

351
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Did you get a report at us? no… .

352
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Well, in the first place, capturing animals is not the job of the fire department.

353
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
⚟Yamato Kapitaro was there?

354
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
oh! father .

355
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Huh? Is it your son? Yeah .

356
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
nice to meet you . I'm Kasuhara, my father's junior.

357
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
My father is a senior in the Command Division.

358
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Commander Division? Huh? Yes, Command Division.

359
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
(Yamato) Huh? Didn't you say that Dad of Light is the fire service?

360
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
(Yamato) Huh? Didn't you say that Dad of Light is the fire service?

Haa... I definitely did it...

363
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I thought I finally came to show my face, but what was it?

364
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Is it love?

365
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Are you a love problem?

366
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
different! Work worries.

367
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
different! Work worries.

368
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Dad, that's what's old.

369
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
old…?

370
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I know that it's difficult for work though ➡

371
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Can you not hurt your father in any way?

372
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
sorry .

373
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What happened?

374
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It may have made my senior's family awkward.

375
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It was a shame to stay quiet.

376
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
father… .

377
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Are you not going to get on a fire truck anymore?

378
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
it is… . Do you like the command department work?

379
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Haa...

380
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Rumor.

381
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
This is because it's a mother's job.

382
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Light… .

383
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Haa...

384
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Why did you keep a secret that you worked in the Command Division?

385
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Well... For my son, who admired himself as a firefighter,

386
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Well... For my son, who admired himself as a firefighter,

387
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's hard to say. Is that what it is?

388
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
(Haruka) Also, it may be that they can't say it because they're family.

389
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's not like that either of us.

390
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Konatsu's voice and the reason for keeping her distance from us ➡

391
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
He won't talk properly.

392
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Ah, that's right!

393
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Look at this!

394
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Oh, it's amazing! It's your sister!

395
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Hehehe... I was so happy to find him by chance at my part-time job! ➡

396
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Because I'm doing my job so vigorously.

397
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Well, it's okay, isn't it?

398
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But... it's about five years now.

(Doctor) Have you ever had any problems?

403
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
(Doctor) Most aphrodisiacs are psychogenic.➡

Things that are emotionally burdensome ➡

405
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Please avoid it as much as possible.

406

Kaneshita-san Good morning. Oh good morning.

407
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The other day, was it okay?

408
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
With that... my son. ah .

409
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Well, it has nothing to do with Kasuhara.

410
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
(Sara) Is the lower back the only thing that hurts?

411
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Is there anything else that is causing the pain to move?

412
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
(Speaker) (Male) It hurts so quickly!

413
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
(Sara) The ambulance is already on my way.

414
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

415
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
(Speaker) (Male) Umm... there was capybara.

416
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Is it capybara? (Speaker) I'm on the riverbed. ➡

417
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Is it capybara? (Speaker) I'm on the riverbed. ➡

418
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Can you catch this?

419
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
What about someone getting injured or something like that?

420
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
(Speaker) That's not. is that so .

421
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Sorry, but for the capture of such animals ➡

422
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I can't send fire trucks or ambulances. (Speaker) What? ➡

423
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So what should I do? First, the ward office ➡

424
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I think it would be a good idea to consult with us.

425
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
(Speaker) Ah... That's right. yes . please .

426
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,666
I'll cut this one. (Speaker) (Cancel sound)

427
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,666
(Speaker) (Ringtone) (Yogure) Fire department No. 119.

428
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:30,000
Is it a fire? Is it an emergency? Huh?

429
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Is it capybara? ah… . yes .

430
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Hmm...

431
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
What's wrong...?

432
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
(Minowa) Is it okay? Will you pull it? Tanaka - He looks like he wants to pull!

433
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
(Tanaka) I want to pull! (Minowa) Do you want to pull?

434
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
(Tanaka) I want to pull! (Minowa and Tanaka) That's it!

435
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
(The sound of steam coming out) (Minowa) Oh! Juo!

436
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
(Tanaka) Juo!

437
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
(Tanaka) Juo!

438
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
what? that . Huh? Heated Ekiben.

439
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Tanaka-kun bought it for me. Right. (Tanaka) Yes.

440
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
When I pull this string, the quick lime inside and the water mixed in. ➡

441
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It's getting fever!

442
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
(The sound of steam coming out) ⚟Ohohoho...

443
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Wow, it's strange that water can cause fevers.

444
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
(Tanaka) But why don't you also clean it up in the fire department?

445
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Powdered aluminum or magnesium.

446
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Depending on the substance, water may be poured in during a fire.

447
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
There may be a huge explosion. Ah, I see.

448
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I thought it would be good to pour water on fire.

449
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Until I entered this world. ⚟ (The sound of the door opening)

450
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
(Yogo) Are you doing that wrong? ?

451
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Capybara is not the job of a firefighter.

452
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's pointless to say that Yoguru gave it even though I refused.

453
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
What is capybara? (Yogo) But it was a request from a citizen.

454
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
If you're told to do that, you can't refuse!

455
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What? What about capybara? Did it come out? That's right, I continued to accept it. ➡

456
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
The image of animal capture being number 119 is probably what it is.

457
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Who's getting exhausted by that? (Minowa) Capybara?

458
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Who's getting exhausted by that? (Minowa) Capybara?

459
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
The job of fire and emergency services is to save lives.

460
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Don't waste time on anything else.

461
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
(Minowa) What... What exactly is capybara talking about...?

462
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
(Yogo) Ah, already! What is it? Kaneshita's field first!

463
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
If you love the scene that much, you should just go back quickly!

464
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
(Tanaka) Well, I guess they'll do that if they could do that...

465
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'll enjoy having this . (Minowa) What? Wait, Tanaka-kun. ➡

466
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
what? Do you know anything? (Tanaka) What?

467
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Ah... well... that's what it is. Right?

468
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Ah... well... that's what it is. Right?

469
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
(Yogo) No, if you say that, there's no way you can just ignore it, right?

470
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Well, that's it. The other day my tongue was clicked.

471
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Kaneshita: I was in an accident while I was in the fire department.

472
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
(The sound of cracking glass)

473
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:04,666
(Shiomi) "Kaneshita-san! OK ! ? 》

474
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:06,666
"Don't come! ! 》

475
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:10,000

476
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
{Uh...}

477
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
{Tsumi.... Shiomi! Shiomi! ! Shiomi! ! 》

478
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
(Tanaka) And he tried to help himself ➡

479
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
My junior was seriously injured.

480
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
(Tanaka) That guy too➡

481
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I retired because it would be pointless if I couldn't stay in the fire service. ➡

482
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I retired because it would be pointless if I couldn't stay in the fire service. ➡

483
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
That's why Kaneshita probably feels responsible.

484
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Why did you go back to collect the photos?

485
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Why did you go back to collect the photos?

486
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Sorry. I asked Tanaka-kun.

487
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Twitch: That guy...

488
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Why?

489
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I saw it when I was in college. In Tohoku.

Even a family photo doesn't even exist properly ➡

How hard it is.

496
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
but… .

497
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
The actions I took in that fire had crossed the line as a firefighter.

498
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
This caused confusion on the scene and ruined the lives of others.

499

It shouldn't come out of there.

That's why I'm stopping me too.

503
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Ideals, sense of justice, and the imagination that Kasuhara says ➡
