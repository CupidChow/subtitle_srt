00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
(Mother) It's cold today.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I hope it snows. (My little sister) I hope she gets off.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
(Mother) I wonder if it's going to rain. (Sister) It's nice if it rains.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
(Snow) "Are you home, are you home?" 》

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
《Oniece》

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
《Wait a minute》

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
⚟I want to make a snowman.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
(Uesugi) Please tell me where to point the ambulance.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone) No. 119 This is the fire service.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Is it a fire? Is it an emergency? (Speaker) (Kono) It's an emergency. ➡

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Um... I can't stop feeling nauseous.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Please tell me the address the ambulance is heading to.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
(Speaker) Onomae is a bus stop.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's in front of Ono. Is it an uphill? Is it a downhill?

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
(Speaker) Umm... on the way to Hoya Station.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Understood .

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll be heading to the ambulance so please tell me your name and age.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
(Speaker) Kono Ryoko... 53.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
thank you .

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Kono-san: Are you having any other symptoms besides nausea?

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You may have a cold sweat or a headache.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
(Speaker) That's not the case, something suddenly... ➡

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Kono-san, are you okay?

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
(Speaker) Ah.... hello .

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What's wrong? OK?

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Maybe I can't speak. Please tap the phone and get your answer.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Kono-san, can you speak?

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If "Yes," then hit the phone with your finger.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
(Speaker) (One-tapping sound)

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I can't make a sound.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Is there anyone around you who would like to replace your phone?

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If "Yes," then hit the phone.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There's no one there.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So are you able to breathe?

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
(Speaker) (One-tapping sound)

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Are there any other pain and pain besides nausea?

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Are you feeling nothing but nausea?

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
(speaker) (sound of hits once) There's none. Understood .

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The ambulance is already on my way.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Please wait in a safe place.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If you are unsure, I will leave this phone connected.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
(Minowa) Oh, is that the report from the previous report?

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
yes .

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
In the end, even after that emergency team arrived ➡

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It seemed like he couldn't speak, so he responded in writing.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What is that? Um, see...

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, it's not aphasia...

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Amosexia. Mental stress ➡

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's someone who suddenly loses his voice due to trauma.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
(Minowa) That's right. You know something.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Actually, my sister is like that. (Minowa) What?

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The past five years or so.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But other than that, I'm fine and that's it.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
5 years...

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So to the Fire Department?

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
yeah? Was it different?

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Five years ago, it was about whether Kasuhara would join the fire service. ➡

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Maybe it has something to do with it.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Ah... I joined the fire department for another reason.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
《The person who answered the phone when the house was on fire➡

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll remember it forever

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
"I have a job that will support someone like that ➡

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I hope it can be done

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But as expected ➡

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's been since then...

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Ah, yeah, nothing.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
(Uesugi) Um, can you ask a question?

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Ah, yes please.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What do people who can't report it in a voice?

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If you have such a disability ➡

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Even if you call 119, you can't tell me anything.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Ah, yes. For those people...

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Uesugi-kun should have taught that during his training.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
(Uesugi) What? Was that so?

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I guess he didn't listen properly anyway.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The Command Division was a bit of a lick.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
No no, that's what it is...

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
(Minowa) That's not enough!

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes. Sorry.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay, let me review it without thinking about its honesty.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We've just finished an awareness flyer.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
(Uesugi) Number 119 on the internet. (Takachiho) This is ➡

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is a system for those who cannot call 9119 via voice.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If you access a dedicated website using your smartphone or mobile phone,

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You can report it simply by operating the screen.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Once connected to the Command Center, use the chat function.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You can communicate the situation in words.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Also, the GPS function is linked. ➡

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can quickly find out where the reporter is currently.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But you can't use it unless you apply in advance, right?

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
yes . Sorry for the inconvenience. ➡

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's not enough to make public awareness of the public. ➡

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If anyone else needs it, please come!

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
⚟Yes.

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, it's tough.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Thank you for your hard work.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
OK? (Dojima) Ah, I'm fine.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000

Ah, yes.

(Speaker) (Ringtone)

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

112

(Speaker) (Crying)

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
(Speaker) (Nazuna) Um, my 3-year-old sister hit her head and is bleeding...

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Do you know where the ambulance is heading?

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
(Speaker) Haa... Haa... ➡

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I did it.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
yeah?

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000

(Speaker) (Hina) Big sister! Is your sister crying behind you right now?

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
(Speaker) (Nazuna) Yes... I don't want to take my mother's place anymore. ➡

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
When all my junior high school friends are playing ➡

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Why am I alone...

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Where are the two now?

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
(Speaker) Sorry... sorry....

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
it's okay . Let's calm down once. Can you breathe deeply?

(Speaker) (Ringtone) No. 119 This is the fire service.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Is it a fire? Is it an emergency? (Speaker) (Male) Um, something ➡

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
A little girl is bleeding from her forehead ➡

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I was crying so much that I thought I might get an ambulance. ➡

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Ah, poor. I'm crying so much.

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Please tell me the address the ambulance is heading to.

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
(Speaker) What? Umm, next to Mizono intersection... what is this? ➡

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Mi... Mizonoe Park.

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's Mizonoe Park next to Mizono intersection.

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is... Yogu-san. (Yogo) Huh?

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
(Sara) Report that ➡

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Is it around Mizono 2-chome, Kanagawa Ward?

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Ah, yes. That's the area around the origin.

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You're called Nazuna.

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What is your sister's name?

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's Hina-chan. The one who's getting injured is

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
How many girls are you?

144

(Speaker) (Male) Eh, maybe 2 or 3 years old. ➡

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ugh, sorry I'm driving now ➡

146
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I can't see it properly though. Ah, it's about middle school students nearby.

147
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
There are girls too. (Sara) This is what I thought...

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This may be the same as the report that Kaneshita is currently dealing with.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Um, can you have a girl talk to me?

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
(Speaker) (Male) No, it's impossible, it's impossible. Because I'm driving now. ➡

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The signal will change, so can I ask you later?

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh, then... Finally ➡

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Please tell me the colour of the clothes you two are wearing.

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
(Speaker) (Male) Well, pink... The little one is a pink jumper ➡

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
For middle school students... black. (Speaker) (Horse)

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
(Speaker) (Male) It's noisy. Sorry, a moment ➡

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Sorry it's ringing behind me... Also please.

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
yes . The little one is pink and the middle schooler is black.

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I wonder if I could tell you the colour of the clothes they are wearing right now.

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
(Speaker) (Nazuna) Ah, um... I'm black and the chicks are pink.

161
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Understood. thank you .

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's fine to say this is the same case, right?

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Kaneshita-san, I don't have to ask where it is anymore, so it's okay...

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Nazuna-chan, one more time ➡

165
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Can I ask where the two of them are?

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
(Speaker) What...

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You called to help your sister, right?

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
(Speaker) Ah.... So it's not the police ➡

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
First of all, didn't you call 119?

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
(Speaker) Yes...

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
In that case, you should respond properly to your own feelings.

172
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You, the reporter, must say it to the place where the two of them are.

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Otherwise, we can't even get an ambulance to the right place.

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
(Speaker) Ah... uh... ➡

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't know the address though... Yeah .

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
(Speaker) Mizonoe Park. It's Mizonoe Park.

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
thank you . I'll head to the ambulance soon.

Kaneshita-san...

183
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Thank you for your hard work. oh .

184
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yesterday's children were divorced and they were single-parent families.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
My older sister often took a break from junior high school and took care of her younger sister.

186
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Maybe it's your imagination?

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You know, are you going to do something like Kasuhara?

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I just happened to hear a neighbor talking.

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Um, why yesterday ➡

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Did you try to find out where she is until the end?

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Just having the same clothing color is weak as a confirmation of the same case.

192
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Is that really all?

193
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What is it?

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I wanted to reduce my regrets as much as possible.

195
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Even if you suddenly hurt your sister ➡

196
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What I reported with the feeling that I had to help ➡

197
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I thought it was better to be aware of it properly.

198
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
At least it's better than continuing to think that I couldn't do anything.

199
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Well, it's different whether my sister will forgive me or not.

200
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm sure it'll be fine.

201
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I have an older sister too, so I know.

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I can't dislike it.

203
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No matter what.

204
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
(Sara) What are you studying?

205
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Thank you for your hard work.

206
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Your hard work. What... what is that?

207
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Ah, I'm this.

208
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
(Sara) What I can still do in the world of fire service➡

209
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I thought there were so many things I hadn't tried.

210
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So an emergency medical? (Sara) Yes, first of all.

211
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Plus, it's best to simply obtain various qualifications ➡

212
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I think it's easy to get promoted.

213
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Promote success. (Sara) Originally ➡

214
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm a person with a strong desire to improve. (Yogo) Wow.

215
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What about Yogu? Why were you looking at such a book?

216
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Um, was it an ENT doctor?

217
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes... well, a bit.

218
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
(Doctor) You need to decide on a future treatment plan as soon as possible. ➡

219
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Please think about it carefully before your next appointment.

220
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:46,000
♬～

221
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Oh, it looks delicious.

222
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
(Silver) Like Like. (Haruka) Now let's eat, let's eat.

223
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll set aside the snow. Yes.

224
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
(Silver) Thank you.

225
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Ah, that's not good. After all, this is broken.

226
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
(Gin) It was quite a while ago. I bought this.

227
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Next, why not choose the gas one? (Haruka) What?

228
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Because that's the one that can be used even when a power outage occurs.

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Ah... yes. I see.

230
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's definitely... it's okay.

231
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What does that mean?

232
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
(Gin) No, you know, that fire had happened.

233
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah . At that time ➡

234
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Both snow and Konatsu were small ➡

235
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I was thinking that the two would remember the fire.

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I tried not to use anything that would cause fire as much as possible.

237
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You can also leave birthday cakes without candles.

238
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Ah, that's what it was like?

239
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Well, it's a parent's heart that doesn't know about children.

240
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Now that you mention it, they never talked about the fire.

241
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Still, the snow is

242
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Suddenly he started saying he would become a command controller.

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't know what's there, do I?

244
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That's right. We're willing to

245
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I guess they had assumed it was a scary memory.

246
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Certainly it wasn't just scary for me.

247
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But for my sister ➡

248
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Maybe that was the case.

249
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Huh? The cause of my sister's speech dysphoria ➡

250
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I think it was because I remembered the fire.

251
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
When I think about it, I want to join the fire department.

252
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I guess it happened after I said that.

253
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That means ➡

254
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's my fault.

255
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That's why I think my sister is avoiding me.

256
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's what it is...

257
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Would you like to eat it for now?

258
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
See, when you're hungry, you think about the bad and the bad.

259
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
(Silver) Ah.

260
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Hey, snow.

261
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Konatsu is holding a solo exhibition here.

262
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Why not go if it's tomorrow's holiday?

263
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
but… .

264
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Today, I suddenly came back ➡

265
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Is it because you're worried about your sister?

266
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Are you okay .

267
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No matter what the reason, there's no way Konatsu would hate Yuki.

268
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:50,000

270
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
thank you .

271
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Sorry, I came without even contacting you.

272
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
My mom told me.

273
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Amazing big sister.

274
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
All the drawings are super good.

275
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
(Tap sound)

276
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah .

277
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I sent it a message before, but I need to apply to use it.

278
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Ah, of course, it doesn't mean you have to use this ➡

279
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
If anything happens, call 119.

280
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
There is also a way to find out the situation from someone you can't talk to➡

281
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Any command controller knows.

282
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I wish my sister would come to visit me at any time➡

283
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I've memorized my phone number.

284
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Ah, sorry. Is that unnecessary?

285
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Anyway, no matter what happens to my sister ➡

286
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'll definitely help you.

287
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
This makes my sister's feelings ➡

288
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I don't know if it will be easier though.

289
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But if it's because I remember that fire ➡

290
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I want to tell them that I'm fine because I'm here now.

291
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

298
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,666
(Speaker) (Female) Ah, it's an emergency!

299
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,666
Please tell me where the ambulance is heading.

300
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,000
(Speaker) Umm, it's in front of the Mitsuba Bank Yatsukawa branch.

301
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
(Uesugi) It's in front of Mitsuba Bank Yatsukawa branch.

302
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
(Speaker) Yes.

303
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Who did you do it? (Speaker) I'm not a fan of you ➡

304
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
An elderly man holds his chest in pain ➡

305
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm sitting down. (Uesugi) I understand.

306
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Is that person aware? (Speaker) Ah, consciousness... ➡

307
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I feel like I'm trying to do something.

308
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Is there a reply to calling? Please ask for your name.

309
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
(Dojima) Oh, I'm starting to look pretty good.

310
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
yes .

311
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Takachihosa You've always been bored here too.

312
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Sit in front of you once in a while. (Takachiho) What?

313
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Leave the third row to me.

314
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'll take the place of the duty I'm in.

315
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What are you talking about?

316
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The main character of the Command Division is the front command stand.

317
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Even though I said that the general table was boring and I didn't like it.

318
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Is that so?

319
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Well, I just tried to say it.

320
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone) No. 119 This is the fire service.

321
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Is it a fire? Is it an emergency? (Speaker) (Male) Ugh, the fire station ➡

322
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Can you lend me a job?

323
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Is it a ladder? (Speaker) Yes. ➡

324
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I lost my house key for a while so I couldn't get in. ➡

325
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Since it's the second floor of the apartment, you can enter from the balcony.

326
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Ah... in the fire service ➡

327
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We haven't responded that way.

328
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
(Speaker) What? Ah, that's right. I wonder what to do...

329
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Sorry. I'll cut this one off.

330
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
(Speaker) Ah....

331
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Haa...

332
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It doesn't seem to be the case.

333
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
He wasn't running today.

334
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's the junk call on the ladder from earlier ➡

335
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If it were the usual Kasuhara, he would have even thought up a solution in vain.

336
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Well, that's fine though...

337
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Something's disgusting.

338
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Um...

339
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I've been before

340
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Do you remember saying that the command controller saved you?

341
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
ah .

342
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's what I was talking about when I was a child ➡

343
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
My sister and I were away at home when the fire broke out.

344
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
"Oniece! 》

345

363
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
For me, I was able to help by calling 119.

364
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This was the trigger for me to aim for this job.

365
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
But for my sister,

366
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It was such a scary event that I couldn't stand it unless I forgot.

367
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
That reminded me.

368
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
That's why the voice is...

369
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
If you become a command controller ➡

370
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I thought I could help a lot of people.

371
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
This hurt the closest family.

372
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I didn't have enough imagination at all.

373
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
(Microwave electronic sounds)

374
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Isn't it just scary?

375
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The fire wasn't just scary for the older sister.

376
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm sure he's regretting it too.

377
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I regret it...

378
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
He puts people in his position to protect at risk.

379
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
If I regret it after that, I can understand it too.

I didn't do anything...

385

We're not the only ones who want to help someone.

386
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's better not to push the other person into the person who is unilaterally helping them.

393
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I thought it would be wonderful to introduce Konatsu's illustrations.

394
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm going back to the company now, but what will I do?

395
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000

Um... my leg got stuck in the car.

402
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's still stuck now, right? (speaker)...

403
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000

A request for search and rescue. ➡

408
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
What happens to a man, 11 years old, at Sasanodai Forest, Isogo Ward?

409
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
My father reported that he couldn't understand it.

410
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's a search for an 11-year-old man. Understood .

411
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Which of the people who report the reporting are currently?

412
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
(Speaker) This is the sunrise square in Sasanodai Forest.

413
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It's the sunrise square. Understood . The rescue team will head over there.

414
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
(Minowa) It's all in the forest around here, so I hope they haven't gone far.

415

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
My parents and I went on a hike.

418
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Apparently he had a fight with his mother and only one person went ahead. ➡

419
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I couldn't see it in the sunrise square, where I was my destination.

420
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Even if I searched the area on my own for about an hour, I would say.

421
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It was said that it could not be found.

422
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Have you heard about Ryota's outfit today?

423
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
(Speaker) Yes. A brown jumper, navy blue pants, and an orange backpack.

424

Understood . (Speaker) I'm sure the fire department will contact you too➡

425
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000

426
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000

I'm Iida, the commander of the Central Fire and Rescue Team.

429
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I searched the radius of Sunrise Square within 800m radius. ➡

430
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Those requiring rescue cannot be found.

431
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I hope that the number of troops will be increased as we expand the scope of our search.

432
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I got it . We will increase the number of fire service teams and rescue teams.

433
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
There's less than an hour left until sunset...

434
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

435
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

436
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
(Speaker) Haa... Haa...

437
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Could you hear it?

438
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Um, maybe you can't talk now?

439
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
If "Yes," then hit the phone once.

440
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
(Speaker) (One-tapping sound)

441
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I can't talk. Umm, then...

442
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Huh?

443
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
"I'm fine with you whenever I come from my sister.

444
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I've memorized my phone number.

445
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Maybe your sister?

446
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
If "Yes," then hit the phone once.

447
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
(Speaker) (One-tapping sound)

448
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Big sister.

449
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I don't have time to be surprised.

450
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
If it's a fire, hit the phone three times if it's an emergency.

451
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
(Speaker) (Three-thrap sound)

452
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Is it an emergency...?

453
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Well, I'll ask a few more questions now➡

454
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
If "Yes," hit it once.

455
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Does your sister need an ambulance?

456
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Other people?

457
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
(Speaker) (One-tapping sound)

458
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Is that person aware?

459
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
(Speaker) (One-tapping sound)

460
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Are you breathing well?

461
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
(Speaker) (One-tapping sound)

462
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
There is both consciousness and breathing.

463
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Are you injured?

464
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
(Speaker) (One-tapping sound)

465
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Is blood coming out?

466
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Is there no blood coming out?

467
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
(Speaker) (One-thud sound) That means it's a sprain or a fracture...

468
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So I'll ask a few questions about where I am now.

469
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Is your older sister around Okamine Mountain?

470
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
(Speaker) (One-tapping sound)

471
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
On the way to the hiking trail?

472
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
(Speaker) (One-thud sound) It's on the way.

473
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Do you know where you are now?

474
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
The GPS has been cut off.

475
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I don't know...

476
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
(Dojima) Kasuhara Video 119 can be used.

477
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
If that were the case, you could turn on the GPS and you could tell the situation through the video.

478
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
yes . Big sister I'll send you a short message now.

479
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
When you access it, you will see that and the Command Center.

480
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You can connect it with video so please reply once if you like.

481
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
(Speaker) (One-tapping sound)

482
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I just sent it.

483
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Once you open the URL, follow the instructions on the screen.

484
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
This phone will be hung up for now.

485
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
(Speaker) (One-tapping sound)

486
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Do you have a big sister paper and a pen?

487
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I think I probably have it though.

488
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
With video, you can also write it.

489
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
surely .

490
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
My sister connected.

491
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I was able to narrow down where I was now, so I sent the rescue team to head over to me.

492
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
(Dojima) This is a bit off the course... ➡

493
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'll also put out a helicopter. (Takachiho) Please.

494
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Big sister, can you show someone who's injured?

495
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
What? That...

496
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Brown jumper, navy blue pants, orange backpack...

497
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
A lost boy...

498
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I see. Mt. Okamine is also connected to Sasanodai Forest.

499
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Would you like to contact the troops searching for the boys?

500
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Kasuhara-san: Just to be sure, please check the boy's name.

501
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Understood . Big sister.

502

504
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It's Ryota-kun, right?

505
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
(Minowa) Each squad is participating from Yokohama Fire Department to Sasanodai Forest, Isogo Ward.

506
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I recently received a request for rescue at Mt. Okamine ➡

507
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
There appears to be an 11-year-old man who is currently searching for the case.

508
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
For more information, please call. That's all for Yokohama Fire Department.

Sakae Fire Department is about to participate here ➡

511
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It's still 2km to the foot of Mt. Okamine.

512
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
That unit might arrive earlier.

513
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Maybe he slipped his leg and hurt him...

514
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Is your sister not injured?

515
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Kasuhara: I was able to see my face.

516
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
yes . Will you be able to see the face of your sister Ryota?

517
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
this… .

518
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
(Yogure) This is the early symptoms of hypothermia!

519
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's the worst if your body temperature drops any further...

520
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Heart and lungs stop.

521
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Big sister? hello . hear?

522
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Understood. Let's help you, sister.

523
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Anyway, I don't want to lower my temperature any further.

524
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
If there's something to wear, such as a jacket ➡

525
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Dress it up and warm it.

526
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
(Mobile phone) You can also wrap your body in a leisure sheet or something. ➡

527
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
If you have a warm drink, give it to me.

528
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And if I had a warmer

529
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Place it on your neck, armpits, or ankles to warm it up.

530
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Each squad is participating in rescue from Yokohama Fire Department.

531
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Man in need of rescue: 11 years old and suffers from hypothermia.

532
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
The Command Division instructs you to keep warm.

533
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Central Fire and Rescue Commander Understood. I'll only have 400 meters left until I arrive.

534
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
(Radio) (Dojima) Yokohama Fire Department Understood.

535
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
(Iida) Let's hurry! (Everyone) Okay!

536
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
(Mobile phone) The rescue team will arrive there in about 15 minutes.

537
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Huh?

538
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
(Dojima) Is it a radio interference? I hope it doesn't affect GPS.

539
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
(Minowa) I'm a little worried about the weather too. The rain clouds are approaching the scene. ➡

540
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It might start to descend in 20 minutes.

541
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Big sister might rain after this.

542
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
If it gets wet, your body temperature will drop ➡

543
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I want them to be in a place where it can avoid the rain as much as possible.

546
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Hypothermia is on the rise.

547
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
(Yogo) It's dangerous to force yourself to shake Kasuhara.

548
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Tell me to just rest.

549
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Big sister, don't force yourself to shake me up and wake me up.

550
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Just rest.

551
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Because it's okay. The rescue team will arrive soon.

552
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
What about the rain? (Minowa) No matter when it rains anymore ➡

553
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It's not strange.

554

555
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Yes, Yokohama Fire Department.

00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm the Central Fire and Rescue Commander.

557
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I reached the point indicated by the GPS.

558
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
There are no rescuers within a radius of 50m.

559
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
The GPS is insane...

560
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
(Speaker) (Iida) We will continue to expand our scope and search. ➡

561
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It's fine to recognize that those who need rescue can't make a sound, right?

562
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
yes .

Apparently Ryota was conscious while he was transported.

I wonder what would have happened if Kasuhara's lady were inside.

I found the older sister Ryota collapsed ➡

624

Apparently he came down to help involuntarily.
