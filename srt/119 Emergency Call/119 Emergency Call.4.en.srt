00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Ta... Taka-chan is vomiting!

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Please calm down. How many children are you?

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Are you aware?

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
(Speaker) I'm 1 year old! Taka-chan! Taka-chan!

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Ask the colour of your lips.

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Is there any change in the color of your lips? (Speaker) What a colour! ? ➡

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
A little... I feel like I'm redder than usual.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's redder than usual... (Minemoto) Does that mean your lips are red?

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's redder than usual... (Minemoto) Does that mean your lips are red?

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Carbon monoxide poisoning. (Minemoto) Correct answer.

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The ambulance is on the way right now. Is there any smoke left in the room?

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
(Speaker) Ah... there's still a little left.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
(Speaker) (Cough)

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
As expected, he calmly passed the exam.

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
(Sara) I understand. Once that happens, it will continue...

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,666
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

183
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
(Speaker) (Akiba) Well, it's my husband...

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
(Speaker) (Akiba) Well, it's my husband...

186
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
yes . (Speaker) I got vaccinated. ➡

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I did that, but I had a fever and it seemed like it would be painful.

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Can I tell you my address and name?

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
(Speaker) 18 Komyodai 3-chome, Izumi Ward. This is Akiba.

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's Akiba-san. How old is your age? (Speaker) Umm, 78.

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Her 78-year-old husband has developed a fever.

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
(Speaker) Oh, 78 is me. My husband is 82. He's 82 years old.

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Is vaccination the flu?

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is vaccination the flu?

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
(Speaker) That's right. But he's saying it's painful and painful.

196
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
How many degrees of fever is there?

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
(Speaker) Heat? 39℃? Was there 39°C? ➡

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't really know what it is, but I think it's around 39 degrees Celsius.

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's about 39°C.

200
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Other things like difficulty breathing or chest pain?

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
(Speaker) It's probably because it's the flu. ➡

202
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But I'm going to say it's okay. I'll go to the hospital later.

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
If that's the case ➡

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,666
If that's the case ➡

205
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,000
We recommend visiting a hospital by ambulance.

206
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
(Speaker) It's an ambulance! Huh? ambulance! ➡

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
good? Don't you need it, right? ➡

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
See, I say you don't have to call me.

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
is that so . Then I lose consciousness ➡

210
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If your breathing condition seems to be worse ➡

211
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Please report 9119 immediately.

212
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
(Speaker) Yes Yes Yes.

213
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Ah... (Speaker) (Cancel sound)

214
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,333
Wow, I was surprised. Isn't this guy a bad guy?

215
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone) What?

216
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
(Sara) Fire Department No. 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency? ➡

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Ah yes. Please calm down. He's 82 years old and Akiba-san.

218
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Akiba-san? I'll take over!

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,666
Akiba-san, I've changed my phone. I'm the one who dealt with it earlier.

220
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,000
(Speaker) (Akiba) So I said, let's call an ambulance! ➡

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But no matter how many times I say it, I won't listen.

222
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What happened? (Speaker) Looks like it's painful! ➡

223
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I couldn't stand up because I said,

224
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,666
It could be pneumonia!

225
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,000
Are you aware? If you call out to me, will you reply?

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
(Speaker) Don't do it! I've been saying this forever! ➡

227
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
you! you! ➡

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Come on! It's all like that!

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,666
All the emergency teams are currently participating.

230
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll be heading to the ambulance right now, but it'll take a little time.

231
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Call it's fine as it is ➡

232
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Akiba-san Please speak to your husband and encourage him.

233
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Akiba-san Please speak to your husband and encourage him.

234
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
(Speaker) You! you! ➡

235
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Ah... no... No good?

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
(Speaker) My voice has stopped coming.

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Have you stopped singing? Isn't there a sigh?

238
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
(Speaker) What? Umm, breathing.

239
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Are you not breathing?

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
(Speaker) I don't know, I'm not sure. It's become quiet.

241
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So your breasts... your breasts are moving?

242
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
(Speaker) Chest? My chest.

243
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
(Speaker) Chest? My chest.

244
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Are you going up or down?

245
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
(Speaker) Not working!

246
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
is that so . Understood .

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Akiba-san. Master, it seems like your breathing has stopped ➡

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'd like to have a heart massage.

249
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
May I? (Speaker) What... Massage?

250
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Heart massage. Master, what position are you in now?

251
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
(Speaker)... I'm lying down, next to me.

252
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Can I make it sniff?

253
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Can I make it sniff?

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
(Speaker) Yes Yes Yes. Should I point it up?

255
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
yes . Let it face up... (Speaker) (Sound)

256
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
(Speaker) (Cancel sound)

257
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'll call you again.

258
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Fire department number 119. Akiba-san Akiba-san Can you hear it?

260
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
(Speaker) (Sound) (Speaker) (Akiba) Yes. I turned up.

261
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's good. So I want you to give me that heart massage.

262
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's good. So I want you to give me that heart massage.

263
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
(Speaker) Hey, this guy, it's no good anymore. His mouth is open.

264
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Still, I want you to do it.

265
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
(Speaker) What! ?

266
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The firefighters head ahead.

267
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's only 5km left until we arrive. It's still going to take.

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's a heart massage.

269
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Master, breathing has stopped ➡

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I have to do it now. (Speaker) What? It's impossible. I'm that.

271
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's do our best until the ambulance arrives.

272
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,333
Put your hands together in the middle of your chest and stretch your elbows out...

273
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,000
(Speaker) Can't do it, can't do it!

274
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
it's okay . Because I'm with it.

275
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Push straight about 5 cm from the top along with the signal.

276
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
１  ２  ３… 。

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
(Speaker) No no no! My hips are bent and it hurts so much...

278
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please do it! I'll definitely help you!

279
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Please do it! I'll definitely help you!

280
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll help you, so let's do our best with me.

281
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
１  ２  ３… 。

282
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What is this person's age? It's 82.

283
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,666
(Minemoto) No, the person who made the phone call. It's 78.

284
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:29,000
He's close to 80 and his legs and hips are weak. I wonder if such a person can do effective CPR? ➡

285
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
If you force yourself to do it, this grandma will be in danger too.

286
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
If you force yourself to do it, this grandma will be in danger too.

287
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I have already had cardiopulmonary arrest. It's only 4km left until the firefighters arrive.

288
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Then even if I take action ➡

289
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The chances of life saving are extremely low.

290
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Something else...

291
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Ah, artificial respiration. Artificial ventilation...

292
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Kasuhara-san! I can't make it in time.

293
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,666
But I'll definitely help...

294
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,000
So you shouldn't say that!

295
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
(Speaker) Um, that's fine. ➡

296
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Ambulances are coming, right? When I come, I'll talk to the ambulance.

297
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Understood .

298
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So until the ambulance arrives➡

299
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Please wait as is. (Speaker) Yes. Sorry.

300
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
(Speaker) (Cancel sound)

301
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
(Takachiho) Kasuhara-san.

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I haven't taken a break for a while.

303
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,666
yes . (Speaker) (Ringtone)

304
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,000
(Sara) Fire Department No. 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

305
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
(Sara) Fire Department No. 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

306
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Woo...

307
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Sorry for yelling out loud earlier.

308
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I just can't give up.

310
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I just can't give up.

311
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What is the desire to give the reporter hope?

312
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I understand.

313
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But what if you said that and you couldn't help?

314
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Isn't it cruel to be irresponsibly hopeful?

315
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
(Yogo) "It's okay! I'll definitely help you! 》

316
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
(Yogo) "Go back! Go back! 》➡

317
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
"Haa haa haa...! 》

318
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
(Fujiwara) "I said I'd help..."

319
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
《Why?! ? Why! ? 》

320
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
"I said I'd definitely help you, right! ? 》➡

321
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
{Why... why...}

322
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
"I said I'd definitely help you, right! ? Why! ? 》

323
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
"I said I'd definitely help you, right! ? Why! ? 》

324
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Ah, sorry, I'm going to blame...

325
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
When I was little...

326
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Huh?

327
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I once reported it when I was little.

328
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I once reported it when I was little.

329
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It was really scary though...

330
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
When I was so scared I couldn't do anything...

331
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
He told me, "It's okay. I'll definitely help you."

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I was able to help them because I was encouraged by those words.

333
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I was able to help them because I was encouraged by those words.

334
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
that's why… .

335
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Even if both the reporter and us don't give up...

336
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
There are lives that cannot be saved.

340

(Dojima) It's become more convenient. ➡

341
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
In the past, it was connected with three lines: red, white, and yellow.

342
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What? Is that so?

343
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
(Dojima) Oh, it was reflected.

344
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Thank you for your hard work.

345
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Thank you for your hard work.

346
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Your hard work. (Tanaka) Thank you for your hard work.

347
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
This was the result of the Great Hanshin and Awaji Earthquake.

348
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
(Dojima) Yes. I'm asked to give a lecture next time.

349
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
A test of the material. What? Tanaka.

350
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
(Tanaka) Yes.

351
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I see. This year marks 30 years.

352
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,000
At this time I was 33. Are you guys not born yet?

353
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
yes . yes .

354
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
(Dojima) I was in Kobe to cheer him on.

355
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
(Dojima) I was in Kobe to cheer him on.

356
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Kobe squad members ➡

357
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's not like we can confirm the safety of our families.

358
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I was really trying hard. ➡

359
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But there were too many victims.

360
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
(Dojima) It was exactly this time that both your mind and body would be crushed.

361
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But before us, exhausted

362
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
There were many more victims suffering.

363
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
There were many more victims suffering.

364
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What do you think I thought, seeing that?

365
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Umm...

366
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yes, time runs out. I'm back I'm back.

367
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,666
Eh...

368
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:26,000
(Dojima) Hey Tanaka. To switch this picture to PowerPoint ➡

369
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What should I do? (Tanaka) Ah, that's...

370
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What should I do? (Tanaka) Ah, that's...

371
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
thank you .

372
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Thank you for your hard work.

373
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's rare for Dojima to do that for young people.

374
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,666
It's just by chance.

375
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:51,000
I guess it means that there's enough balls to take care of.

376
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Sorry for the inconvenience to the teacher too.

377

378
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
yes .

379
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
(Mobile phone) (Uesugi) What is it? Will the phone answer?

380
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm waiting for a reply from my peer-member Kure.

381
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
(Mobile phone) (Yogo) Ah... It's like I'm going if I can.

382
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
(Mobile phone) (Yogo) Ah... It's like I'm going if I can.

383
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Haha. That's the one who never comes.

384
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yogo: Something has changed.

385
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Huh?

386
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You when you're on the scene?

387
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It was even more passionate.

388
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
(Mobile phone) (Uesugi) It felt like everyone would help him too. ➡

389
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Even during that cafe accident... (Yogo) That's fine.

390
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
(Mobile phone) I even managed to get a qualification as an emergency medical professional. ➡

Isn't it a waste of treasure to be in the Command Division?

393
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Ah already! For now, let's meet up with a classmate!

394

Thank you for your hard work.

I'm sorry! Um... I wasn't planning on listening to the phone.

417
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

418
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Ah, that's right.

419

What... What! ?

420
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Hmm.

421
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Hmm.

422
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Could you please go out with me for a moment?

423
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Heh?

424
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Even I can't say I'll help you!

425
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's not that Kasuhara-san has no idea.

426
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Because it's a very strong word.

427
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I want to keep this in mind!

428
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000

Thank you for your hard work. Ou .

432

What's that? He hadn't gone home yet? yes .

433
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Um... Dojima-san. (Dojima) Yes?

434
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
(Sara) I see. I'm sure Yogu-san also said something.

435
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yeah .

436
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But that was because it was a crucial moment, right?

437
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Hmm, what do you think?

438
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Back then, I was just doing it hard.

439
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Back then, I was just doing it hard.

440
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Ah... No, there will be a peer meeting next time.

441
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
A peer meeting...

442
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Honestly, I don't want to go.

443
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
They're the ones who know about their old self➡

444
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
You were even hotter?➡

445
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It was so loud that they wanted to come back to the scene.

446
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It was so loud that they wanted to come back to the scene.

447
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I think it's still hot now though.

448
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Huh?

449
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Ah, no...

450
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
He's serious.

451
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
(Takachiho) Yes, Yogu-kun is serious. But I'm not confident.

452
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Confidence? What? For saving people.

453
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
That's not true either, either. I don't have one either.

454
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
But I'm doing it with the feeling that I'll definitely save him.

455
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
That's for Kasuhara-san, you, Niijima-san, and Minowa-san.

456
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
That's for Kasuhara-san, you, Niijima-san, and Minowa-san.

457
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But even Yo Wu-kun really is ➡

458
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
He has that passion for him more than anyone else than Kasuhara-san. ➡

459
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
If you can get along well with that feeling ➡

460
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I could become a better command controller.

461
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Well, in particular, Kasuhara's body is overflowing from her whole body.

462
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Even if you really want to help

463
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Should I not say it?

464
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Should I not say it?

465
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That depends on when it's that and the situation.

466
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Huh?

467
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Did you think it was a boring response? Ah, no.

468
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
But ➡

469
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
All I can say is this.

470
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Well, I'm also quite a bit of a word.

471
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
That's right.

472
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Huh?

473
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Hehe.

474
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But even if I think about what happens after I say it, I can't do anything.

475
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
When Kasuhara is here ➡

476
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
If you really think you want to help me, then

477
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You can just put it into words.

478
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
No one can stop that.

479
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I see.

480
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Ah!

481
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
What is it?

482
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Maybe that's the answer?

(Yogo) Yes. Please tell me the address where you can send the ambulance to.

503
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,666
First of all, could you please tell me the address of the intersection?

504
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,666
So the convulsions have been cured, right?

505
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:19,000

506
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
(Sara) The name of the intersection under the traffic light...

507
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
The ambulance is already on my way.

508
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Mom, did you get it out of the bathtub?

509
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
(Speaker) (Female) Yes. I managed to manage with my daughter.

Is the other party a bike? (Speaker) (Male) It's completely right-handed. ➡

514
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.

515
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You don't have to apologize to me.

516
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Have you ever had a fever of 40°C and vomited?

517
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
(Speaker) (female)... he's not vomiting. But I didn't wake up...

518
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
don't cry . Right? It's okay.

519
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
(Speaker) (Male) When I got back from a walk I was struggling ➡

520
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,666
It seems like he doesn't even make a sound. Wife: Do you have any awareness?

521
00:32:56,666 --> 00:33:00,000
(Speaker) Yes, there is. Sit down, you're bent down.

522

(Speaker) Yes, there is. Sit down, you're bent down.

523
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Are you feeling hurt somewhere? Chest etc.

00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
(Speaker) No, something is holding onto the area around my throat.

525
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It holds the area around your throat.

526
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
That could be a sign. Wife, is there something stuck?

527
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Ah. That wife was eating something?

528
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Have you got something stuck in your throat? (Speaker) Yes? something? ➡

529
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Ah, it's mochi! I said I should grill the rice cakes before I went out!

530
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It chopped rice cakes in my throat. (Speaker) That might be true!

531
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Dad is heading to the ambulance now. ➡

532
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Let's make some rice cakes that are packed in before then.

533
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
(Speaker) Yes. What... What should I do?

534
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It is in the middle of my wife's back, between the shoulder blades and shoulder blades.

535
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Please hit it with the base of your hand.

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

(Speaker) I'm not conscious! Um... after saying my heart hurts so much... ➡

Have you had any other symptoms with chest pain?

(Minemoto) What does that mean?

558
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It appears to be an acute myocardial infarction.

559
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
The whole team is playing.

560
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000

563
00:34:57,666 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm heading to the ambulance now, but it looks like it's going to take a little time.

564
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,666
(Speaker) What... What should I do?

565
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:04,333
So until the ambulance arrives.

566
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,000
There's something I would like you to do.

567
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Are you in the car in the parking area now?

568
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,666
(Speaker) That's right!

569
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:12,000
I think there's an AED inside the parking area facility ➡

570
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Please help someone else ➡

571

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,666
My breathing has stopped now ➡

583
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:44,000
My husband is currently going to get an AED.

584
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Because it's (speaker), AED... Well, it's a heart massage, right? ?

585
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,666
yes . Does it seem difficult to get your dad out of the car?

586
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,333
If it seems difficult ➡

587
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,000
I have to have it done in the car.

588
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
(Speaker) Ah, this is a minivan ➡

(Yogo) Yes. (Dojima) 10km to the Yokohama area.

595
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
No matter how hard you try, it will take more than 15 minutes.

596
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Let's ask Kawasaki if they can support her.

597
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000

(Speaker) (Takeda) Understood! It's no good.

622
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Kawasaki is in a similar situation to ours.

00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Supporting is difficult.

624
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000

"This is a newly built residential area in Tsuzuki Ward."

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Kaneshita-san: That's the parking area in Tsuzuki, right?

That's right though.

667
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The Tsuzuki Parking Area allows you to get off on a public road from there, right?

668
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
After getting off, it's about 5km to the nearest lifesaving center. It will take more than 10 minutes.
