1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,000
(Takachiho) That's all for the matters reported regarding work.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And finally.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It seems that Dojima will undergo surgery today. ➡

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Message.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, please look forward to seeing you today. (Tanaka) What?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Manager Takachiho: one more point. One more thing. (Takachiho) Ah, that's right.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Kaneshita. yes .

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Would you like to take the promotion exam?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Huh? Promoted ➡

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Eventually, the SR unit commander will be talking to me.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
SR! Super Ranger! ?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yokohama City Fire Department Special Advanced Rescue Unit? (Takachiho) That's right. ➡

Hey Tanaka-kun. (Tanaka) Yes.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There were also strong requests from other troops.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What is the request... Isn't it amazing?

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
ah… .

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
When it comes to SR, it's something that all firefighters admire.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
(Uesugi) That's right.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, I hope they will remain as commander.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I think this matter is something that Kaneshita himself decides.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Think about it carefully.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000

(Speaker) (Male) Sorry... I fell while walking, hit my knees ➡

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It hurts so I can't move... Which leg hurts?

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I understand. Please tell me the address where you can send the ambulance to.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
(Speaker) Huh... Address... Where is it? here… .

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If you're outside, are you sure there's a utility pole?

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There may be an address written on it.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000

(Speaker) No, it's just the knees... It hurts... this is true...

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
OK? I'm heading to the ambulance now ➡

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I gave instructions so I didn't try to force myself to move ➡

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000

SR? Yeah .

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,800
If I were to go, it will be on the job site again, so the work will change drastically ➡

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,000
If requested, there may be overseas dispatches.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's right.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What about the light?

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I wonder if Dad might go to SR.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
(Light) Hmm...

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The dad in the Command Division was also pretty cool.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What? Is that so? (Light) Yes.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But SR's dad might be good too. Which one is it?

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Ah, it's a SR blower car.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Do you want to go back to the scene? Huh?

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
SR I've always wanted to go there.

58

(Speaker) I'm currently camping with a friend from university ➡

75
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:25,811
Maybe it's because it's so cold today? One person was shaking in the tent.

76
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:28,811
Which campsite is it? (Speaker) Umm... Seya Ward's ➡

Sorry, that's what we make here...

92
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:25,811
Please ask us what you ate around the night before yesterday.

93

(Speaker) Ah... um... camping with my friends the day before yesterday➡

Uesugi-kun ask what you ate. This one might be a bit lazy too.

100
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:59,811
Did you eat something? At the campsite.

101
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:01,811
(Speaker) (Male) Ah... Yes. Just now, everyone ➡

102
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:03,811
I grilled oysters and ate them.

00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:05,811
(Uesugi) You ate the oysters after grilling them. ➡

104
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:09,811
How long ago was it? (Speaker) Umm... 30-40 minutes ago.

105
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:13,811
(Minowa) Is the onset early for a slow-schooler? Ask if there are any other symptoms.

106
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:15,811
Sorry. Something other than trembling... (Sara) See you later ➡

Check again to see what the car is like.

111
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:26,811
What is the current situation with cars?

112
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:31,811
Maybe they're bumping into something. (Speaker) Ah... hit the electric pole ➡

113
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:35,811
The front is shaking. (Sara) Have you been crushed quite a bit?

114
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:39,811
Are there any smoke or liquid leaks?

115
00:06:39,811 --> 00:06:43,811

(Speaker) (Male) That's right. His face and mouth are... yes.

121
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:57,811
After eating oysters, the disease develops after 30-40 minutes... and numbness?

122
00:06:57,811 --> 00:07:00,811
That's not the case, it might be a paralyzed shellfish poison.

123
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,811
Bei Du….

124
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:06,811
Uesugi-kun, that paralysis, maybe shellfish poison. Ask if you can breathe.

125
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:10,811
Is the only thing that's numb? It's hard to breathe.

126
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:14,811
(Speaker) Breathing... Breathing is painful? copper?

127
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,811

(Mobile phone) Even if it wasn't me, I was on the verge of participating. Hmm...

139
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:02,811
The Command Division has also joined the board. Have you no longer been willing to go back to the scene?

140
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:05,811
(Mobile phone) Are you being invited by SR?

141
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:08,811

(Speaker) Hmm... where is it? All I can see is the sky...

Kusa-san, can you speak loudly now?

166

If you think you can give it, try calling for help.

167

It seems like something was fainting. on second thoughts .

If you are exposed to the rain for a long time, you may develop hypothermia.

187
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:52,811
Kusa-san, it's cold, isn't it?

188
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:56,811
Please try harder and wait a little longer.

189
00:10:56,811 --> 00:11:00,811

190
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:04,811
Ah, yeah. Maybe your name is wet...

191

The ambulance will be fine until the phone arrives.

192
00:11:07,811 --> 00:11:15,811
(Speaker) It's cold... It's cold. Hey, this... I wonder if I'll die like this... ➡

Thank you for your hard work. Your hard work.

202

I'm glad that the person who fell into the irrigation canal from earlier was safe.

203
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:56,811
ah .

204
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:02,811
Thank you. Huh?

205
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:06,811
No, just now. It was helpful.

206
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,811
What! ?

207
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,811
What is it?

208
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:12,811
no… .

209
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:19,811
It's not like Kaneshita-san... It was the first time I was grateful.

210
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:27,811
Um... Kaneshita-san. what?

211
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:30,811
Are you not happy to be able to go to SR?

212
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:32,811
What's that? Do you want me to go? No, um...➡

213
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:36,811
If I or a new employee were worried about me and couldn't go to SR...

214
00:12:36,811 --> 00:12:38,811
Are you overly self-conscious?

215
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:41,811
You guys have nothing to do with it. I don't even care.

216
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:43,811
What, then why?

217
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:45,811
I thought Kaneshita would go without hesitation.

218
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:48,811
How much do you want me to come out?

219
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,811
No, that's why it's not the case.

220
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:19,811
What do you think? How is it?

221
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:23,811
Ah... That's right. Sorry.

222
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,811
Ah...

223
00:13:35,811 --> 00:13:37,811
yes .

224
00:13:59,811 --> 00:14:02,811
Ah... I was told that visiting is prohibited ➡

225
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:07,811
It wasn't said that consultations were prohibited. Sorry.

226
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:16,811
Right now... they've been asked if they're not coming to SR.

227
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:19,811
Honestly, I'm confused.

228
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:23,811
I've always been aiming for it.

229
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:27,811
Me a long time ago ➡

230
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:33,811
I once suffered serious injuries to a colleague during a rescue operation.

231
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:35,811
(Shiomi) "Kaneshita-san! 》 《Don't come! ! 》

232
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:37,811
(Explosion sound)

233
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:41,811
{Shiomi! Shiomi! ! Shiomi! ! 》

234
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:45,811
It ruined his life.

235
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:52,811
I came to the Command Division because of the accident.

236
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,811
My wife seemed worried about me going back to the scene too.

237
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:03,811
No... I understand. My wife has been in charge since I moved to the command department.

238
00:15:03,811 --> 00:15:07,811
It seemed somewhat relieved.

239
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:13,811
I also find it rewarding for the Command Division.

240
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:17,811
The first thing you can do to prevent the worst case scenario is always

241
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:20,811
It's just command controllers.

242
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:27,811
But I still hear the calls for help ➡

243
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:32,811
I can't go there right now.

244
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:52,811
♬～

245
00:15:52,811 --> 00:16:00,811
♬～

246
00:16:00,811 --> 00:16:02,811
Sorry.

247
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:05,811
I'll worry about it and decide for myself.

248
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:10,811
Ah, that's right.

249
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:12,811
Instead of not being able to visit

250
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:15,811
Everyone saved me their register savings.

251
00:16:15,811 --> 00:16:19,811
I've said about 10 times per person and have accumulated about 60 times.

252
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:22,811
That's what I just said.

253
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:32,811
(Uesugi) That's good here. I wonder if they'll come with the guys in the center next time.

254
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:34,811
Yes, stop it? I'm going to be like a firefighter now.

255
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:36,811
(Uesugi) Ugh.

256
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:39,811
Come to think of it, the Niijima-san exam is the day after all, right?

257
00:16:39,811 --> 00:16:42,811
yes . (Yogure) He's an emergency medical officer, right?

258
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:45,811
good luck . Hehehe....

259
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:47,811
Ah... sorry, I took a break.

260
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:49,811
(Takachiho) What are you talking about? If that's the case ➡

261
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:51,811
It's okay to take a lot of breaks. (Sara) Thank you.

262
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:55,811
After all, Niijima-san is a huge desire to improve.

263
00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:58,811
I have to learn from it too... Eh, I'll follow you too ➡

264
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:00,811
I think I'll go and take the exam.

265
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,811
What... Minowa-san had a desire to improve.

266
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:04,811
Uesugi-kun, how ambitious I am...

267
00:17:04,811 --> 00:17:06,811
I'm sorry, but I'm going to replace my lemon sour.

268
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:08,811
I'm still in the middle of speaking! Hey!

269
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:10,811
(Uesugi) I'm going to the toilet. (Minowa) OK, then talk about it in the toilet.

270
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:13,811
(Uesugi) It's coming along! ? (Minowa) My senior is still there ➡

271
00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:18,811
It must be on the way! (Uesugi) It's scary...

272
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:21,811
So I'll go again at the beginning of the week. (Bookbook) Yes.

273
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:23,811
He said he'll take his granddad's sushi.

274
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:26,811
Oh, you'll buy me some salmon roe. Good morning to your dad and mom.

275
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:29,811
Yeah . I'm coming. Take care . take care .

276
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:31,811

Sorry, I can't take that kind of thing here.

283

(Speaker) What! ? (Uesugi) To a nearby contractor ➡

284
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:01,811

(Speaker) Is that so? (Uesugi) Here is an emergency line ➡

286
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:05,811

00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:12,811
Haa... I'm doing this all the time today. (Yogo) It was raining a lot this week.

289
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:17,811
(Minowa) No, it's still peaceful...

290
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,811

The house... the house collapsed from the dirt.

294
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:29,811
Are you in the house now? Are you in a safe place?

295
