00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,666
Have you issued evacuation orders?

18
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,333

19
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,000
Understood .

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000

(Speaker) (Male) No, I'm currently looking for a fire extinguisher. ➡

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's a bit of a smoke and I can't see it. (Sara) It's dangerous. Evacuate immediately.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Each squad is competing in Cityportville. ➡

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,666
This incident is inside Cafe Brantz on the 20th floor of Cityport Building...

25
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,000
(Speaker) (Male) So everyone can't go downstairs. ➡

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Can I run to this one?

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
(Kaneshita) There must be other stairs in that building.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,666
(speakers) available! Everyone is the stairs over there! On the west side!

29
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:16,000
Be sure to close the stairs door. (Speaker) (Ringtone)

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There's been an announcement saying evacuate.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please wait there until the emergency services arrive.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll cut this one off.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000

(Speaker) Now on the 20th floor of City Port Building...

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
(Speaker) (Cough) You don't have to talk.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Please set it to phone speaker mode.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
(Speaker) (Operating sound)

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Keep your body as close to the floor as possible ➡

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothes to avoid inhaling smoke.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
(Speaker) (Cough)

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
calm down . Look closely around.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If there is an emergency exit, head over there.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,666
If smoke doesn't show up, touch the wall and do as much as possible.

49
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,000
Move to a location away from fire and smoke.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
(Speaker) (Sound)

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
(Speaker) No more... I can't. I can't breathe...

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's do our best! Find a place with less smoke!

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Stay low in posture!

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
(Speaker) (Cough)

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
hello?

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
OK? Can you hear it?

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Can you hear it? hello? OK?

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If you can't speak, hit the phone!

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Anything is fine!

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Find a place with less smoke!

Please run away! please! (Takachiho) Kasuhara-san!

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000

All fire extinguishing and rescue operations have been completed. ➡

21 people were taken to the hospital due to injuries or poor health.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Unfortunately, one person passed away.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I think the members here were still responding ➡

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm not working for my late night shifts. Please take a good rest.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
(Minowa and the others) Yes.

Excuse me. Thank you for your hard work. ➡

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Um... Dojima-san. (Dojima) Yes?

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Is it okay?

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Security camera footage shows the Cityport Building explosion ➡

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It is believed that this crime was committed by this woman.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is...

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
(Detective) Yes. This is Michise Motoko.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
(Dojima) But she...

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
(Detective) He was released from prison two months ago. ➡

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Do you remember having contact with her recently?

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
⚟ (Takachiho) Dojima-san.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
(Minowa) Revenge on Dojima-san? What does that mean? that .

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
(Tanaka) I think it would be quick to hear this.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is a report record submitted by the fire department for the time being.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
(Speaker) (Dojima) Fire Department No. 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
(Speaker) (Michise) Ambulance please. ➡

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There was a lot of blood coming from his stomach.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
(Speaker) (Dojima) Did you get injured by anything?

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
(Speaker) (Michise) No, I stab it.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
(Speaker) (Dojima) You? That person?

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
(Speaker) (Michise) Yes. With a knife.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
(Speaker) (Dojima) Wow... I understand. I'll send the ambulance to you ➡

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Please tell me your address.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
(Speaker) (Michise) In this room ➡

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
They said they were going to be happy together! ➡

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But this person... This person!

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
(Speaker) (Dojima) Please tell me the address of Nesochira now. ➡

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll send you an ambulance right away.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
(Speaker) (Michise) Hehehe! Hehe...

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
(Speaker) (Dojima) What if? Can you hear it? ➡

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If you can't say the address ➡

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It doesn't matter if the name of the apartment or apartment is.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
After that, the ambulance was somehow sent to me.

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
By the time he arrived, the man who was stabbed had already died.

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
(Tanaka) Michise Motoko was arrested and charged with murder. ➡

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But in court ➡

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
"I had no intention of killing him. He died ➡

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
"It was because the command controller who reported the report had a bad response."

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's... (Tanaka) Of course ➡

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
With this audio data and testimony from Dojima➡

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Michise's claim was rejected and he was sentenced to 13 years in prison.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He committed this incident to get revenge.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Why can you say that?

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The police came to us just before the explosion.

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It turns out that Michise had called 119.

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
(Takachiho) Maybe he reported it to Dojima...

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
(Speaker) (Michise) "Now that you're incompetent"

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll prove it

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's Michise's declaration of war.

She is the mother of a woman who passed away.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
(Uesugi) It seems that her daughter was working at a cafe at the fire scene. ➡

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000

(Yogo) Kasuhara-san ➡

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Michise Motoko hasn't any other calls to 119?

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It seems they'll search for it from the recorded data. Others too?

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
When searching for it at the request of the police ➡

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There were no other reports from the same number?

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
yes . But maybe they're changing the number.

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
(Minowa) So, does that mean you're searching by relying solely on your voice?

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
(Yogo) Well, Kasuhara-san has those ears.

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
(Speaker) (Male) Um, I'll be hospitalized next time...

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
(Speaker) (Female) Why do ambulances pass by in front of us? ➡

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I use other routes... (Click sound)

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,666
(Minowa) That's certainly not

149
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,000
It might be possible that only Kasuhara-san can do it ➡

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Honestly, I'm a little worried. (Yogo) isn't it?

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
(Speaker) (Uesugi) Ah, I can hear the sound.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
(Speaker) (Female) When I'm home, I always go. Ventilation fan? Sounds like that. ➡

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
No, so... it sounds like a ventilation fan. ➡

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,666
What is low-frequency sound? This person...

155
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,000
(Speaker) (Female) I would like to hear about it as well as other people too...

156
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,000
(Speaker) (Michise) Maybe you... Dojima-san?

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
(Speaker) (Dojima) That's right.

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
(Speaker) (Michise) That's good... Finally I was able to talk.

(Click sound)

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
(Speaker) (Uesugi) Is it okay to request an ambulance?

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
(Speaker) (Female) Not that. ➡

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Um... what was your name?

163
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Chief!

164
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Reports that appear to be from Michise Motoko ➡

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So far, this is all I've found.

166
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I've changed my tone and number for each one.

167
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I think it's definitely Michise.

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Did you think so just by speaking?

169
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That was all in the beginning, but I found commonalities.

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Every report is definitely that person ➡

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I was trying to find out the name of the command controller.

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
(Speaker) (Female) "Not so" ➡

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
"What was your name? 》

174
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
(Speaker) (Female) Are you trying to say that I'm a complainer? 》➡

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
"What's your name? Tell me your name

176
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
(Speaker) (Female) "Big brother, that's right, right? You're still in your 30s, right? 》

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,666
(Speaker) (Minowa) {Yes... Yes}

178
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,000
(Speaker) (Female) "What's your name? What is it? 》

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I think it's because he was looking for Dojima-san.

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Understood.

181
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We will discuss with the above how to communicate it to the police.

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
please .

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Thank you for your hard work! Hey Kasuhara!

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Where are you going?

185
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Umm, towards the Kanzaki Station Building in Minami Ward.

186
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I didn't receive any reports from that place yesterday.

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's obvious...

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
When reporting someone called Michise ➡

189
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I realized that I had changed the place where I called each time.

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
If these are her range of activities ➡

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I think that's the reason why something is likely to happen next.

192
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Michise is being chased by the police. I can't say I'll make something happen again.

193
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But I can't say that I won't wake up.

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So you have to prepare.

195
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
"What if an explosion or fire occurs now? 》

196
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
"Where is the best place to evacuate? 》

197
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What if something happened to the kids? 》

198
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What if it was a hospital? 》

199
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What if it was a station? 》

200
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:13,000
♬～

201
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
"What can I do? 》

202
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
(Speaker) (Female) "Please help.... help me…"

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
(Speaker) (Sound)

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
(Speaker) (Female) 1... 2 3 4 5...

205
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
(Speaker) Mom! mother! ➡

206
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Sorry to be alone! Sorry I didn't come home soon! ➡

207
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
mother! 1 2....

208
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Do you have any frowns or dislikes?

209
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
(Speaker) None at all! It's completely nothing anymore...

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
1 2 3.... (Speaker) (Chime)

211
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
(Speaker) Ah, it's here! It's okay to leave.

212
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
All that's left to do is follow the instructions of the emergency team.

213
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
(Speaker) Yes. (Speaker) (Cancel sound)

214
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
(Takachiho) Kasuhara-san. You don't have to take it next time.

215
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's been a heavy report, isn't it?

216
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
No, it's completely fine.

217
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

218
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

219
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
(Commuting and Control Controller) Kasuhara-san.

220
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
i am back .

221
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Is it okay to go back? Yes, no more.

222
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What causes lightheadedness? What was he told at the hospital?

223
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Ah... it's just like lack of sleep.

224
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Ah, it's going to be replaced soon, right? It'll go in if it's gone.

225
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Wait a minute, Kasuhara-san.

226
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
(Dojima) Kasuhara. You should go home today.

227
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm sure he's been going around a lot on his days off. That's only natural.

228
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I know that you're worried, but it can't be helped if you panic.

229
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
How can Dojima-san be that normal?

230
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I want to do whatever I can.

231
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't want something like that unreasonable to happen again.

232
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's what everyone here thinks.

233
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But all the misfortunes and unreasonableness in the world➡

234
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
There's no one who can stop it. ➡

235
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So we fire departments

236
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
He calmly responds to all sorts of events and connects his life.

237
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But I didn't connect.

238
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
He told me to help him... but...

239
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I couldn't become like Dojima-san.

240
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Sorry.

241
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
(Takachiho) He's been cornered that much ➡

242
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I should have noticed it sooner.

243
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Will I be taking off my next work schedule?

244
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah . I'll be at my parents' house for a while.

245
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Which do you drink, snow coffee or black tea?

246
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
There are also a variety of breads.

247
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Recently, a delicious bakery has been opened in my neighborhood.

248
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
(Haruka and Gin) Hehehe...

249
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
(Sara) I understand a little bit of Kasuhara's panic.

250
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
We are the fire department ➡

251
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You can only respond once something happens.

252
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Whether it's an emergency or a fire ➡

253
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Only when someone's life is at stake is needed is needed.

254
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I was hoping that something might happen someday➡

255
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But waiting for that is tough.

256
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
(Sara) What's more, the Command Division is ➡

257
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You can't even rush to the spot.

258
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
(Challenges from the members)

259
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Both sides!

260
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
please .

261
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Something will happen someday...

262
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That's true even for natural disasters.

263
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The ultimate in unreasonableness.

264
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't know when it will happen and no one can stop it.

265
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
(Minowa) Well, but I too, like Dojima-san. ➡

266
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't have the confidence to be strong.

267
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
"I couldn't become like Dojima-san" ➡

268
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
No, Kasuhara said that too.

269
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What did that mean?

270
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I guess it's the one that only Kasuhara-san and the legend know.

271
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Sorry, it came all of a sudden.

272
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yes.

273
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Did you hear it from your mom?

274
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
oh dear… .

275
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I see....

276
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Really... it's meaningless, isn't it?

277
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I became a command controller because I wanted to help people. ➡

278
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This is what caused trouble to those around me...

279
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Please help me.

280
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I was saved by snow.

281
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
25 years ago and the other day.

282
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's not my strength either way ➡

283
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's because Dojima-san and her older sister were there.

284
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
but… .

285
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I wonder if there is a life that can be saved with just one person's power.

286
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Snow's job is to connect.

287
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's on this side of the snow and this side ➡

288
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It must mean there's always someone else there.

289
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
There are surely things that only snow can do ➡

290
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
There must be many things that Yuki alone can't do.

291
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Sorry the other day.

292
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Or rather, thank you very much.

293
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Have you got a little rest? yes .

294
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What about Dojima-san today?

295
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Ah, it was a hospital after being monitored. It'll come as soon as the end.

296
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
is that so .

297
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I told you to hand this when Kasuhara-san came.

298
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
this… .

this .

308
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
(Speaker) (Announcer) The Kanagawa Prefectural Police said earlier on the 20th of this month➡

309
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
He was wanted in the explosion that occurred in Cityport Building, Yokohama.

310
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It has been announced that Michise Motoko has been arrested. ➡

311
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Michise suspect was around 9:30am today ➡

312
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
He himself appeared at Yamashita Police Station.

313
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Maybe he thought he couldn't get away.

314
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
(Speaker) (Announcer) Furthermore, Michise suspect happened in Yokohama City the other day.

315
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It also hinted at involvement in a series of arson incidents.

316
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The Kanagawa Prefectural Police are investigating the details. ➡

317
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
That's the news.

318
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
(Detective) Is it all about clearing up the grudge against the fire department?

319
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
yes .

Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

323
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
(Speaker) (Male) That kind of throat hurts incredibly.

324
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
My throat hurts.

325
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Are there any other symptoms? What about fever and cough?

326
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
(Speaker) Not that ➡

327
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
When I came to visit Yokohama Luminous, it suddenly started to hurt. ➡

328
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,333
The two friends I have with are the same thing.

329
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,000
(Sara) Symptoms are experiencing ➡

330
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You and two friends, do you mean three?

Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

332
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
(Speaker) (Female) Ah, please ambulance. ➡

333
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
There were many customers complaining that they were feeling unwell.

334
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Where is the ambulance headed?

335
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
(Speaker) This is Restaurant Big Beat on the 6th floor of Luminous.

336
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
This is also a report from Luminus that several people are feeling unwell.

337
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
How many people have symptoms?

338
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Are you sueing?

So I looked at the humidifier that was there ➡

350
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
For some reason, the timer was set to turn on after 30 minutes. ➡

351
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So if I cut that off and resume operation ➡

When the humidifier starts, prepare the chlorine gas so that it comes out. ➡

390
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:24,333
Apparently he appeared in.

391

Section Chief. How about parking at the sea fishing park?
