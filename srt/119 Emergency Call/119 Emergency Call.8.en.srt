1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,000
(Konatsu) It's not because of the snow. ➡

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Because that fire...

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Because it's my fault.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
(Silver) There's no need to push yourself too hard.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Ah, no, there's just something terrible going on.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And that fire was an unfortunate accident. ➡

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The sunlight reflected off the mirror on the windowsill...

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
See, is it a converging fire?

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
yes . So it's Konatsu's fault...

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I want to talk.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Something I couldn't say for a long time.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That day was Yuki's birthday, right?

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
(Haruka) "It's work so there's nothing I can do about it."

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
"But I promised to be with you on your birthday."

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
"Daddy is a liar"

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
(Haruka) "Then the three of you go out and have fun together? With my sister

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
{Hi! 》

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
{Ah, that's a problem...}

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
《Please listen to me anything about snow?》

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
My dad told me about it

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
《Whatever? " "Yeah"

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
"I want to see the snow then! 》

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
《Snow...》

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
{Haa...}

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
《No?》 》 《I mean, it's not good...》

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
"Even though I told you anything! Mom is a liar too...

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
(Haruka) {Snow}

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
"What are you making? 》

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
[Secret. Don't look; Yes Yes

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
{Ah, I'm going to get the cake ➡

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Can I ask you to stay home for a little while? 》

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
{Yes, come on}

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:35,000
♬～

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:54,000
♬～

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This is...

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The real cause of the fire.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Sorry for hiding it forever.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I should have said that back then.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
"Are you gonna have a good time? 》

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
"The sunlight is through glass, mirrors, etc. ➡

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Gather together in one place ➡

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It gets so hot that it starts to heat up.”

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
"I don't know what's clear but ➡

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
In the mirror I placed by the window ➡

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's likely that the sunlight has been reflected

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
(Konatsu) But I couldn't say it...

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It was scary...

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm really sorry.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
(Gin) Was that something on my own?

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
(Haruka) It was tough, wasn't it? Sorry I didn't notice.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
(Konatsu) This is what I've been able to avoid dragging over for a long time ➡

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Thanks to everyone.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Everyone was as bright as usual, as there was no fire.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
My memories of the fire fade away...

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
As expected, that day➡

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Because I said I wanted to be a command controller.

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It was my fault for reminding me.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And the voice came...

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's not.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
but… .

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It certainly started at that time.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But I was shocked to remember it ➡

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I was about myself, who started a fire but couldn't do anything.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So it's not the snow.

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I also wanted to support snow.

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But it was really tough... ➡

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Rather than telling the truth about snow, I would rather be worried about it ➡

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I thought it would be better to leave myself.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So I kept my distance.

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
(Konatsu) I'm really sorry.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Even though Yuki would help me...

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Even though I couldn't do anything...

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's not the case.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's not like I couldn't do anything.

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Because my sister taught me.

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
(Konatsu) "Your police is number 110"

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
{Fires and emergency services are number 119}

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
"Your policeman is number 110. Fire - Is the emergency room number 119? 》

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
{Yeah, well done}

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Fire - The emergency room was number 119.

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I was able to call 119 at that time.

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Because my sister taught me.

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So it was thanks to my sister that I was saved.

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And...

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
My sister made this one ➡

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I guess it's because I said I want to see the snow.

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That means that I was the one who caused the fire in the first place.

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
(Haruka) No. If you say that ➡

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I was saying something silly that I would give you anything.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
(Gin) Wait a minute. I broke my promise with snow ➡

91
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It was because he had to put in work that Yuki was in a bad mood.

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
surely . (Haruka) I see.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Maybe it's all because of your dad.

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
(Silver) What? Yeah… .

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
oh dear… .

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Huh! ? (Konatsu) Hmm...

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
(Silver) What...

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So it's the fault of the whole family.

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That's right. It's everyone's fault and it's thanks to everyone.

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's what we are at the Kasuhara family.

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What is that? A strange catchphrase.

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
(Gin) What's wrong? He's just a professional.

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
(Haruka) Hehehehe... So let's eat a cake.

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
cake? I don't like it.

105
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Today is Yuki's birthday. Ah, I see.

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I forgot. Ah... Congratulations.

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
( cough )

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
⚟ (Yogo) I understand, but I'm glad it didn't accumulate. ➡

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There will definitely be more reports.

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
(Minowa) No, but I'm sad.

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I've become an adult who can't look forward to the snow.

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What is that? How to say it.

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
(Yogure and Minowa) Good morning. (Dojima) Good morning.

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm getting excited. Even in this year. When it snows.

115
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Are you serious? (Yogo) See you~➡

116
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's what it is.

117
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
( cough )

118
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Well, there's a recent GPS problem at home too. ➡

119
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It seems that the same situation can be seen for both Section 1 and Section 2.

120
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I've also got the system checked.

121
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The cause is unclear.

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It may be due to the influence of solar flares. (Uesugi) Sun flare?

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It is an explosion that occurs on the surface of the sun.

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This could lead to communication failures and satellites being destroyed.

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If a satellite is broken, it means that the GPS is going to go wrong.

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
(Uesugi) What? That's insane... (Minowa) That's insane.

127
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It is said that solar flares become more active in the 11-year cycle.

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This year is the 11th year! (Takachiho) Yes, stop.

129
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's dangerous to conclude that this is the cause even though it's not clear.

130
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
(Minowa) Oh no... (Takachiho) Anyway, now ➡

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The basics are to ask the person who reported the reporter to see the location ➡

132
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Please be even more thorough.

133
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
(Everyone) Yes.

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I hope there is no problem with the command system itself.

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Don't say anything that's not a lucky one. Sorry.

136
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Ah, Kasuhara-san. The secondary station will be in from today, right?

137
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
yes . good luck .

138
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I've only just been able to handle the secondary machine as well.

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I will do my best .

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So, please give us guidance from Dojima and Kasuhara.

141
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No, me...

142
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Can you refuse by looking at this face?

143
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Haa... Yes yes. I understand.

144
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
thank you .

145
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I think you already know it though ➡

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The most important role for the secondary machine is to check and support the command machine.

147
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Check and support. Yeah .

148
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
When I got on the command stand, I was so focused on talking to the reporter. ➡

149
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's not like you'll lose sight of what's around you.

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes, I'm often.

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So I sniff it from behind and the assistant calmly watched it ➡

152
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Check to see if there are any oversights or mistakes.

153
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Living State It's Takinami's house in Room 801.

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Understood . I'll send you an ambulance. ➡

155
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Let me ask you a few questions.

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
(Dojima) This is why the secondary machine ultimately presses the disaster point confirmation.

157
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's a serious responsibility.

158
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And another important thing about the secondary unit, what do you think?

159
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Um...

160
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
⚟Do not hesitate.

161
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Right, right? It would have no meaning if you answered.

162
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Don't hesitate.

163
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I wonder if the senior is sitting on the command stand or what?

164
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Make sure to point out any points that need to be pointed out.

165
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What about our hierarchical relationships?➡

166
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Before the report that it takes a life or death

167
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It doesn't mean anything.

168
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So, please.

169
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
thank you .

170
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

171
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
(Speaker) (Male) Um... it looks like I've got a bit of a hip ➡

173
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Haa... I can't walk anymore. Understood .

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Please tell me your address.

175
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
(Speaker) I was walking, so ha ha ha ha...➡

176
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's exactly what it is...

177
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's fine. (Speaker) Izumi Ward's Koganesazaka... This ➡

178
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Probably around 6th Street.

179
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Are there any buildings that can be used as markers?

180
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
(Speaker) Only the house is there. In a residential area...

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Can you see the nameplate at your nearest house?

182
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
(Speaker) Suzuki... It says. ➡

183
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Before that... I'm here.

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's in front of Suzuki's house in 6th Street.

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
(Speaker) Yes. Are you next to Suzuki-san?

186
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Can you see the nameplate at your house across from me?

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
(Speaker) across from me is... Sato-san. It's Sato-san.

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Maybe this...

189
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Kaneshita-san. Sato-san's neighbor ➡

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Can anyone see? (Speaker) I can't see it.

191
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Understood . So, is there an electric pole nearby?

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I think it has an address or electric pole number.

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
(Speaker) Haa haa... Yes. please tell me .

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
(Speaker) Koganesazaka 6-chome 31 What... It's 31 Koganesazaka 6-chome.

195
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Ambulance I'll be heading straight away so I'd like to ask a few questions.

196
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
How many are you currently? (Speaker) 30...3. Haa haa...

197
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Are there any other symptoms besides lower back pain?

198
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
(Speaker) No... especially... Kaneshita-san...

199
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It seems like you're continuing to get short of breath, but is it difficult to breathe?

200
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
(Speaker) Haa... Yes. Um, this is simply...

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
yes . (Speaker) It's been a while since I exercised ➡

202
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If I don't lose weight... I'll end up with all sorts of things. is that so .

203
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Please let me know as soon as I feel worse.

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
(Speaker) Haa... Yes. Please tell me your name.

205
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There was no curtain on the show. There's nothing I can do about it.

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That's how it is.

207
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Also, this isn't the only work for the assistant.

208
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
yes .

209
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
♬～

210
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Huh? (Dojima) What's wrong?

211
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Okazu Emergency Examination for a man with back pain earlier.

212
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I think I'll be on the move soon, but the ambulance was stopped quite a bit before me.

213
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I see... is that here?

214
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
(Speaker) (Iwashita) From Okazu Emergency to Yokohama Fire Department.

216
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes, Yokohama Fire Department. (Speaker) at 31 Koganesazaka, Izumi Ward ➡

217
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He arrived and came into contact with the injured person. ➡

218
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I would like to ask for the support of the rescue team when they are transported.

219
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
support… . (Dojima) Please ask for details after agreeing.

220
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yokohama Fire Department Understood. Please feel free to learn more.

221
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
(Speaker) Okazu Emergency Understood. I'll call you.

222
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

223
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Thank you for your hard work. This is Kasuhara from the Command Division.

224
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
(Speaker) (Iwashita) This is Iwashita, the commander of Okazu Emergency Team. ➡

225
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
First of all, the site is in the middle of a rather steep slope.

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We decided that the ambulance could not be moved up.

227
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
on second thoughts… . (Speaker) So ➡

228
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Only members climb the hill and use a stretcher to get injured and injured people ➡

229
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I was planning to transport him, but the injured and sick person said that... ➡

230
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
According to him, he has 170 kg.

231
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
170kg! ? (Speaker) Only three members ➡

232
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Push the stretcher and go down the hill ➡

233
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I think it's dangerous...

234
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Um... I understand. They send the Nakata Police Station rescue team to head.

235
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
(Speaker) Yes please. (Dojima) Wait a minute.

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This is Dojima from the Command Division. 2-3 I have something I would like to ask.

237
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
(Speaker) Yes please. (Dojima) That site ➡

238
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's a residential area, right? If you have a garage nearby, you can find it.

239
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Are there any? (Speaker) Ah... ➡

240
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The house in front of the scene is empty.

241
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
If that's the case, what if it's a minivan for public relations?

242
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You can go up that far and stop it, right?

243
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It is better to carry the injured person in that car and travel the slope. ➡

244
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Isn't it safe?

245
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Of course, if that house would understand.

246
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
(Speaker) I'll check with the residents.

247
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
please .

248
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I will let Nakata Police Station know that.

249
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
(Speaker) Yes, thank you very much.

250
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
thank you .

251
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
(Yogo) Apparently something was amazing ➡

252
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Dojima-san. Yeah . I mean ➡

253
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm the assistant, but it's nothing.

254
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
(Sara) No, but it's only the first time, right?

255
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What's more, Kaneshita-san can't help but be on the command stand.

256
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That person won't be overwhelmed. (Minowa) But ➡

257
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I wonder if Dojima-san will give me direct guidance ➡

258
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm jealous. No matter how legendary.

259
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Um, what is that legend?

260
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Huh? Now?

261
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
No, as Dojima-san's command and control ➡

262
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I know I have a long career though.

263
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I wonder why he was called that way.

264
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Ah, that's right, I'll just send an order to participate in the fire station ➡

265
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The command will be played using a synthesized voice, right?

266
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
"The first appearance of the building fire in the middle area"

267
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It doesn't look similar.

268
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
(Minowa) It's not that they're similar or not.

269
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's fine. sorry .

270
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Ah, please continue.

271
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But, in the past, there were no such systems.

272
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
All of the command controllers issued participation commands in their own voice.

273
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
With a flesh voice? (Minowa) Yes.

274
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I've never heard of it either.

275
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But, it seems Dojima-san's voice order was amazing.

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The tone of his voice conveyed the seriousness of the incident.

277
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The nickname given to me was Legend.

278
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I see .

279
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
(Speaker) (Buzzer)

280
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
(Speaker) Building fire: First participation in Sakae Ward Shimonagaoka...

281
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
This is still bland.

282
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
His face is scary, Takachiho.

283
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
No... because what is it? this .

284
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
As you can see.

285
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Why suddenly? The reappointment period has not yet been completed.

286
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
To be honest, it's tough to work on duty.

287
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
To your elderly body.

288
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Also, I would like to go on a trip abroad while I'm still healthy.

289
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Please stop lying like that easy to understand.

290
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Section 3 became a good team.

291
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I think I've done my job well.

292
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
but… .

293
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
If Kasuhara becomes a full-fledged student as a secondary player, I'll quit.

294
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Until then, please keep it.

295
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Is it here...?

296
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
(Iwashita) {Because it's in the middle of a rather steep slope ➡

297
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We decided that the ambulance could not be raised.

298
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
"It's true that this hill cannot be used in an ambulance."

299
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
"We should have known that Yokohama has a lot of slopes."

300
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
{I've been exercising for the first time in a while so I have to lose weight... I'm going to get into it all the trouble}

301
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Also, at this point, regarding the physique of the reporter ➡

302
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If I had noticed, I could have sent out a rescue unit from the beginning.

303
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
⚟Hey, it was really there.

304
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Dojima-san! It's tough here.

305
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Haa... Haa...

306
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
(Dojima) I asked Kaneshita.

307
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Kasuhara always goes to check out the scene where he reports his interests.

308
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Is Kaneshita-san? (Dojima) That's what I'm worried about.

309
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Something like hills or things I didn't notice the body shape of the reporter.

310
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But I should have had more time for the secondary vehicle.

311
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
If I say that, I'll be the same.

312
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
When I asked for the address ➡

313
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
In my experience, I had to go through it.

314
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Also, the emergency services on the scene may regret it.

315
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Huh?

316
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
If you have a terrain around here in your mind➡

317
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
When you participate, you must confirm with the Command Division.

318
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I should have been able to respond in some way.

319
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
We're not a superhero team.

320
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's why we all work hard and cooperate.

321
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Imagine it and make it into the next thing ➡

322
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's important.

323
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But don't blame everything on yourself.

324
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
yes .

325
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What... to tell you that ➡

326
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Did you go out of your way to come here?

327
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's... I'm the instructor.

328
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I am truly honored to receive guidance from Mr. Dojima.

329
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What is it... what is it, hey.

330
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Because he's a legend.

331
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Ah. Hey .

332
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Legend...

333
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Well, that's fine now.

334
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

335
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

336
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
(Speaker) (Yaegashi) Um... it's an emergency. Suddenly my head hurts so badly. ➡

337
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It was like he was hit with a gay slut.

338
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Understood . Please tell me the address the ambulance is heading to.

339
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
(Speaker) 3605 Bay Tower Hills, 2-4-19 Midorigatani, Nishi-ku. ➡

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
This is Yaegashi. (Minowa) Bay Tower Hills 3605. ➡

(Yogure) What happened? (Speaker) Going in the field ➡

363
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Just as I was about to work, a senior suddenly started to sweat. ➡

364
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I fell over... (Yogo) What is the gender and age of that person?

365
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
please tell me . (Speaker) It's about 35 for a man.

366
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Understood . Is the person who collapsed is conscious?

367
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
(Speaker) Ah, wait a minute. (Yogo) Yes.

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000

There's none, so I'm calling! Come quickly!

(Yogo) He's not conscious. Are you breathing?

372
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
(Speaker) Something's tinkering... I don't know, so that's it!

373
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
(Yogo) I understand. That person's breathing has stopped➡

374
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
A heart massage is necessary because it may be possible.

375
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'll tell you so could you please do it together?

376
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000

388
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
What is this sound...

(Speakers) 1, 2 1, 2... (Speaker) (Metal sound)

390
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Mr. Yogura, please ask where you are on the construction site.

391
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
If they're on high scaffolding, they'll have to send out a rescue team.

392
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Please continue listening as you continue.

393
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Where are you at the construction site now? (Speaker) (Male) Umm, on the scaffolding!

394
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000

Kasuhara-san.

403
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Next time, you can enter by yourself.

404
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Huh? Is it okay now?

405
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It has also been approved by Dojima-san.

406
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
thank you .

407
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
That's good. (Uesugi) Congratulations.

408
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Isn't it amazing? (Minowa) As expected.

409
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Can everyone listen a bit?

410
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Umm...

411
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Mr. Dojima is scheduled to retire this month.

412
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
⚟Huh? Huh?

413
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I also have to spend my paid leave, so today is my last day working.

414
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Why so suddenly?

415
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
He didn't tell me the reason either.

416
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Um...

417
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
actually… .

418
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
《Doujima-san》

419
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
"Can I just alright? 》

420
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
(Dojima) "What is it? Work consultation? 》

421
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Have you already gone to the hospital? 》

422
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
《A persistent cough in my throat, bloody cough》

423
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
{If you have this symptom, it might be...}

424
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Pharyngeal cancer

425
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
{I know}

426
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
{If there is a command controller that is so knowledgeable about illness.

427
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's okay here too

428
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Pharyngeal cancer...

429
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
(Yogo) Depending on the degree of progression, the vocal cords may be removed by surgery...

430
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
In other words: ➡

431
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It is a disease that can sometimes make you lose your voice.

432
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So I suddenly quit...

433
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Kasuhara-san.

434
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
⚟ (Footsteps)

435
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Dojima-san.

436
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Congratulations. It's sunny and it's his debut as a secondary machine.

437
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Instead, I'm quitting...

438
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Is that one...?

439
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Voice... Will it stop coming out?

440
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
After all, he spoke.

441
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Don't worry.

442
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
If the surgery goes well, your vocal cords will remain.

443
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Apparently he can also speak during rehabilitation.

444
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So why?

445
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
There's no need to quit.

446
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Our job is ➡

447
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It's not like you can speak up.

448
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I was imagining it.

449
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
As a command controller, as before ➡

450
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I look at myself when I can no longer speak.

451
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
The moment when you lose the job you put into your life.

452
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
But if you quit first you can give up.

453
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Let's take action first, assuming the worst case scenario.

454
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's a curtain-ending that is typical of a command controller.

455
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And even if I'm not here anymore...

456
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
That's not exactly like Dojima-san.

457
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Because it was definitely okay at that time.

458
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I once called 119 when I was five years old.

459
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
☎ (Ringtone) ☎《119th Fire Department》➡

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
{It's a fire... Please help me...}

462
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
At that time, it was Dojima-san who answered the phone.

463
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Of course you don't remember.

464
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
At that time ➡

465
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Dojima-san said this.

466
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
{What should I do...What should I do...} {Onie-sister! 》

467

I can say "It's definitely okay" ➡

484
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
How courage does it take for a command controller?

485
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I know now.

486
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But Dojima-san said that.

487
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
He gave me courage.

488
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So I'll say it too.

489
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Dojima-san is fine.

490
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Definitely ➡

491
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You can come back here again.

492
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's definitely okay.

493
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Ah, have the emergency teams come?

494
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
(Speaker) (Female) Yes. I've come, I've come. ➡

495
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Um, this is a phone call...

496
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It's okay to have the phone hang up.

497
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
All that's left to do is follow the instructions of the squad.

498
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Good job.

499
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
(Speaker) (Ringtone)

500
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

501
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
(Speaker) (Ueda) My friend is flying a drone right now. ➡

502
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It was somehow out of control, or rather, it flew into something strange.

503
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
The drone... Has someone got injured when they fell?

504
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
(Speaker) No, that's not there and it's still flying. ➡

505
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Something seems to be wrong with GPS.

506
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Again, GPS is in poor condition.

507
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
(Sara) I see...

508
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
That's nothing the fire department can do.

509
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
(Speaker) No, but... that's the highway soon.

510
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000

511

Let's listen to it just in case, the time, and contact details.

514
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Do you know which highway it fell on which area?

515
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
(Speaker) It's around the hunting grounds interchange on the Yokohama Yokohama Yokohama Road.

516
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I hope nothing's happening...

517
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000

519
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Fire department number 119. Is it a fire? Is it an emergency?

520
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
(Speaker) (Nishiyama) An accident. If you're driving at highways ➡

521
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
The car in front of me suddenly stopped and bumped into me. ➡

522
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
When I got off, I saw a few cars getting a ball accident.

523
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Which highway is it?

524
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
(Speaker) Umm, on the Yokohama Yokohama-suka road... here...➡

525
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's a little past the Hunting Field Interchange.

526
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's near the hunting ground interchange on the Yokohama Yokohama Road.

527
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
This is probably because of the drone from earlier...

528
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Can you see the numbers on the kilopost on the side of the road?

529
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
(Speaker) It says Ah 1.4.

530
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It's at 1.4 points on the uphill.

531
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Are you in a safe place now?

532
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000

Do you know how many cars were in an accident and what kind of cars it was?

537
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
(Speaker) Umm... I'm not really sure ➡

538
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
The front is a truck and then a regular car...

539
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
A ball-punching accident at high speed?

540
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
(I think it's about six speakers). The front is the truck ➡

541
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It was a thrust accident with six regular cars.

542

543

(Speaker) Umm... the second car is quite flat ➡

544
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It seems like a few people are trapped inside.

545
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Is there any awareness of the person inside the car?

546
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
(Speaker) I don't know about it, but the driver's seat is the one ➡

547
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Something is groaning, it looks like it's painful!

Understood . I'll be sending the emergency teams and rescue teams to the next level.
