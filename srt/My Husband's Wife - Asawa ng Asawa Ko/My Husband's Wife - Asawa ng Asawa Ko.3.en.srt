1
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:29,400
<i> Who are you?</i>

2
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:31,000
<i> Just tell us what you need.</i>

3
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:32,333
<i> We are the Kalasag!</i>

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,367
<i>We are the brotherhood that
fights against abuse and greed.</i>

5
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:37,133
<i> And we're all here...</i>

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,500
<i> for Congressman Rodriguez.</i>

7
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:41,267
<i>Jordan?
Jordan!</i>

8
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,833
<i> What's the matter with you?</i>

9
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,867
<i> What?</i>

10
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:46,600
<i>All you have to do is get
Cristy!</i>

11
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:49,400
<i>I didn't tell you to hurt
Jordan!</i>

12
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:52,367
<i>Why do you put your itch first
before the movement?</i>

13
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:53,833
<i> Didn't I help you?</i>

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,933
<i>We agreed that we'd both benefit
from this!</i>

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,400
<i>Darn you! You really
are stubborn!</i>

16
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:04,033
<i> Stop!</i>

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,200
<i> Stop!</i>

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,267
<i> Jordan?</i>

19
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,233
<i> Jordan, where are you?</i>

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,400
<i> Jordan... Okay.</i>

21
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:12,833
<i> Come here.</i>

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,667
<i>Babe... Your husband's life lies
on you.</i>

23
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:20,933
<i>You'll pick his brain on the
ground if you don't come.</i>

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,833
Jordan, I hope you understand.

25
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,367
I can't just ignore you. Sorry.

26
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:51,400
Sorry.

27
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:13,133
Jordan, I'm begging you.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
Listen to me.

29
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,600
No matter what they say,

30
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,667
please just keep quiet.

31
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:23,233
Please. They'll just hurt you.

32
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,833
Shai, I'd rather get hurt
than Cristy.

33
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,933
I need to protect my wife.

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,700
If something happens to me...

35
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:40,067
Jordan, don't talk like that.

36
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,333
Shai, if something
happens to me.

37
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,367
And you and Cristy survive.

38
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:46,267
Tell her I love her so much.

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,633
I love her and Tori so much.

40
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,467
And even if we've only been
a family for a short time.

41
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,633
That's the happiest moment
that happened in my life.

42
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,067
Tell her I love them.

43
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:10,000
No! Listen to me.

44
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:14,233
I know a way to escape.

45
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,800
It's in the South Wing.

46
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:19,133
We just need a- a distraction.

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
We can escape.

48
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:26,333
What do we do?

49
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,467
Just 20 seconds left.

50
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:39,367
Your wife doesn't
care about you.

51
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:41,267
Kill me instead.

52
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,367
- Jordan.
- As long as my wife is safe.

53
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,300
No! Don't!

54
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,633
Don't!

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,000
Jordan!

56
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:58,600
Jordan, I'm here now.

57
00:03:58,667 --> 00:03:59,867
Cristy!

58
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:02,333
I told you not to show up!

59
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,567
Jordan!

60
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:07,433
Jordan!

61
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,167
Sorry, Jordan!

62
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:19,867
I told you to hide...
You should survive.

63
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,533
You should go home to Tori.

64
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,100
No! Sorry, babe.

65
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:26,633
Sorry, I can't bear not being
with you.

66
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,367
I don't want to be
away from you.

67
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:29,633
I don't want to.

68
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:41,567
You two are good actors.

69
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,333
It's our first time to see this
kind of drama.

70
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,467
Right?

71
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:48,733
So.

72
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:56,167
Sawa, go get her cell phone.
Hurry!

73
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:58,100
Let's divide them into groups.

74
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,500
So, we can leave.

75
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:00,700
Wait.

76
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,000
Leon, are we going to bring
all of them?

77
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:05,533
Stop asking questions.

78
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,200
Alakdan!

79
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:08,533
Get Congressman.

80
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,267
Igat, Bakulaw, you'll have
the foreigners.

81
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:20,033
Move faster so we can leave!

82
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,067
Hurry up!

83
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:21,900
Faster!

84
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:26,267
Jordan!

85
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,333
Jordan!

86
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,400
Where are you taking them?

87
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:32,700
Lie on your stomach!

88
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:33,267
Lie on your stomach!

89
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:33,933
Get down!

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,667
Get down!

91
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,600
Get down! Get down!

92
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:37,467
Cristy, I'm here.

93
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:38,533
Cristy!

94
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,400
Get him!

95
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:42,367
Jordan, where are you?

96
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:43,000
Get down!

97
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,800
Have some tea first, Ma'am.

98
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:49,700
Thank you.

99
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,233
Thank you.

100
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,300
I'll put this away, Ma'am.

101
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:55,633
Yes.

102
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,733
Thank you.

103
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,700
Breaking news.

104
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:04,933
A hostage crisis is taking
place at,

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,133
<i>Helio Paradiso Southern Island</i> .

106
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,700
Based on the video circulating
on social media,

107
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
the rebel group against
abuse and greed,

108
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:14,833
also known as<i> Kalasag</i> ,
did a mass shooting

109
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,833
a few minutes before eight
in the evening.

110
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,633
Cristy!

111
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:31,500
Well, you two are sweet.

112
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:33,400
I hope everyone has someone
who loves him.

113
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:34,967
I feel envious.

114
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:37,033
Jordan!

115
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,967
Right?

116
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,933
Looks like your love story will
end here.

117
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,100
You can't bring me down even
if you work together!

118
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:25,567
Cristy, the gun.

119
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,667
Jordan!

120
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:35,900
Come on!

121
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:39,667
Come on, Jordan.

122
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,300
Hurry up!

123
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:44,933
Where's the gun?

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,167
Here.

125
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:00,567
Igat!

126
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:08,600
Igat!

127
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:09,500
Igat?

128
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:10,633
Igat, wake up.

129
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,467
What happened?

130
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,167
I heard a gunshot.

131
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,633
I thought you killed those two.

132
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,533
What happened?

133
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,167
They escaped from me.

134
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,567
- Where are you taking me?
- Just walk.

135
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,133
Stop asking questions.

136
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,533
You'll have a vacation,
Congressman.

137
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,400
Who are you?

138
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,267
What do you need from me?

139
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:34,167
Let me go.

140
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,367
Make him sit at the back.

141
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:39,933
Watch him.

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,600
What do you need?

143
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,167
Remove this thing from my head!

144
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,267
Shut up, Congressman.

145
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,500
Or I'll blow your head off.

146
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,133
Those pests are so annoying!

147
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:57,433
What?

148
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,467
They escaped.

149
00:08:58,533 --> 00:08:59,733
They stabbed Boy.

150
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,067
Didn't I tell you not
to be stupid?

151
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,233
Go find them!

152
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,267
Hurry up!

153
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,700
Come on, Leon.

154
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,133
They're just a nuisance.

155
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,033
We're leaving, anyway.

156
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,600
Right?

157
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:15,533
No!

158
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I don't want anyone to win
against me.

159
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,100
You two!

160
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:22,500
Find the couple!

161
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:23,500
Hurry!

162
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,367
What do we do with these people?

163
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:33,833
Don't shoot!

164
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,233
Put that down.

165
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,800
I'll take care of her.

166
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:43,300
Bakulaw, watch them.

167
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:44,133
Everybody, down!

168
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,467
Don't you dare escape!

169
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:52,067
Try escaping, and we'll
shoot you!

170
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:57,467
Auntie, let's be strong for
Cristy and Jordan.

171
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,700
Jeff!

172
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,700
My god! I'm glad you came!

173
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Aunt Carmen called me when she
saw the news.

174
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:18,933
We haven't contacted Jordan and
Cristy up until now.

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,033
Cristy called me earlier.

176
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:25,500
What did she say?

177
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:26,933
What did my daughter say?

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,133
Is she safe?

179
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,533
Is she safe?

180
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,033
What's happening to her?

181
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,667
What did she say?

182
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,967
Don't worry.

183
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:38,133
I'm sure Jordan will take care
of Cristy.

184
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:41,500
I've also talked to the police
in San Felipe.

185
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:44,033
They're almost there.

186
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,300
Cristy was the one who called
them for help.

187
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:56,233
I've also coordinated with
the police in San Felipe,

188
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,033
so I can go there now.

189
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,767
So, the coordination
will be faster.

190
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:09,533
Jeff, bring Cristy back.

191
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:12,833
And Jordan, too.

192
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:21,533
We'll wait for you here. Please!

193
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Aunt Carmen, don't worry.

194
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,000
Stop crying.

195
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:30,667
I will do everything to bring
them back safely.

196
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:31,200
Okay?

197
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,600
Bring them back.

198
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,567
Okay.

199
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,033
I'll get going.

200
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:09,033
Babe, hold this, hold this.

201
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,333
Hold on to me.

202
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,600
Where do we go?

203
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:13,700
There.

204
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,867
Shaira told me there's
an exit over there.

205
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:22,933
This way?

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,300
Do we go this way?

207
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:28,767
Do we go this way?

208
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,000
Don't cry.

209
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,267
I told you we can get
out of here, right?

210
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,133
We'll go home to your
mom and Tori.

211
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,567
Cristy! Jordan!

212
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:38,167
Shaira!

213
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:39,667
- Shai!
- Help me!

214
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:42,633
- Shaira! Shaira!
- Shai!

215
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,067
Jordan!

216
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:44,867
Jordan.

217
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:45,400
Shaira.

218
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:46,133
Shaira.

219
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,867
What happened to you?

220
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,400
Shaira, how did you escape?

221
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,367
Shaira?

222
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:50,167
Shaira!

223
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:51,133
- Shaira!
- Shaira, wake up!

224
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:56,033
Shaira! Shaira? Wake up!

225
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,933
Shai!

226
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We have the chance to get
out of here.

227
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:00,400
- Shaira, wake up!
- Shai, wake up!

228
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:02,433
We're almost there.

229
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,433
Let's go!

230
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,900
Shai!

231
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:07,400
Shai.

232
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,367
Shai.

233
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:11,500
No one moves.

234
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:13,600
Stand up.

235
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:16,733
Stay still.

236
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,167
Don't move.

237
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:34,933
We're taking too long.

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,800
Where's Leon?

239
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:39,467
Over there! He's taking care of
something!

240
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:40,700
Get him.

241
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:41,767
And him.

242
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,833
Kuwago, get them.

243
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,433
This?

244
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:45,833
Yes.

245
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,800
Let's go.

246
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,567
Go!

247
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:57,133
I'll take care of
everything here!

248
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:58,733
Get down.

249
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,767
Down!

250
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:02,633
Jordan!

251
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:09,667
Shai, wake up!

252
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:10,900
Shai, wake up!

253
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,200
Don't hurt, Jordan!

254
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,100
Cristy.

255
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:31,967
Cristy.

256
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:37,200
Jordan!

257
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:38,233
Jordan!

258
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,100
Come here!

259
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:54,933
I don't want to!

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,967
Come here!

261
00:14:58,733 --> 00:14:59,900
Jordan!

262
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:00,533
Cristy.

263
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,900
Jordan!

264
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,400
Jordan!

265
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:04,800
Cristy!

266
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:05,600
Jordan!

267
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,733
Come here!

268
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:09,733
I don't want to!

269
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,900
Let go of me!

270
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:14,500
Jordan!

271
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,400
Jordan!

272
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,767
Where's Leon?

273
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,000
Hurry! Get on the boat!

274
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,133
Get on the boat!

275
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,667
Hurry up!

276
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,133
Let's get out of here!

277
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,767
Hurry up!

278
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,167
Faster!

279
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:47,000
Faster!

280
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:48,533
My wife?

281
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,833
Where's my wife?

282
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,000
Sorry, sorry.

283
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,800
I didn't expect
this to happen.

284
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:54,833
Let's go.

285
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,433
Hurry up. Let's get out of here.

286
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,967
Hurry!

287
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:00,167
My wife needs me.

288
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:01,567
Jordan, listen
to me first!

289
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:03,067
I will go to my wife!

290
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:04,467
Listen to me!

291
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:06,500
I know you love
Cristy so much!

292
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:07,933
But we're here.

293
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,767
We can almost escape.

294
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:12,100
Let's find a way
to get her later!

295
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:12,667
Move!

296
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:13,267
No!

297
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,067
Let's go! Hurry up!

298
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:15,900
Cristy!

299
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:18,467
Jordan!

300
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:19,967
Cristy!

301
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,567
Jordan!

302
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,467
I don't want to
come with you!

303
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:29,067
Let's go!

304
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:30,867
Jordan!

305
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:33,733
Come with me!

306
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,967
Jordan!

307
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,033
Jordan!

308
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,300
Cristy!

309
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:48,533
We're okay. Everyone's here.

310
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,767
Go. Get on the boat.

311
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,667
- Hurry up, Leon. Come on.
- They're going to catch us.

312
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:53,133
Go! Get on the boat!

313
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,067
Just surrender!

314
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:55,167
The police are
on their way!

315
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:56,367
Come on! Are you really going to
bring that woman?

316
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,867
Let's go!

317
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,567
I won't let go of this
witch because she hurt me!

318
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:03,033
Get on the boat!

319
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,467
Cristy!

320
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,000
No matter what you do...

321
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,700
- Jordan!
- No one can save you!

322
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:09,900
Start the boat!

323
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:13,000
Jordan!

324
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:13,733
Cristy!

325
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,533
Let's go!

326
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,500
Get her on the boat, Leon!

327
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:20,567
Cristy.

328
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:21,667
I'm here.

329
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:25,367
Cristy, I'm here.

330
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:27,467
Cristy! Cristy!

331
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,600
Let's go!

332
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:30,400
Leon!

333
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,033
let's go!

334
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,667
Let go!

335
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,200
- Cristy!
- Jordan!

336
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:36,633
Let go!

337
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:43,200
Leon, let's go!

338
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:46,233
Leon, come on!

339
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:46,933
Cristy!

340
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,233
Jordan!

341
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,167
- Cristy!
- Jordan!

342
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:55,400
- Cristy!
- Jordan!

343
00:17:55,467 --> 00:17:57,867
Jordan, that's enough. Stop.

344
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:18,267
Let's go!

345
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,600
Get her.

346
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,467
- Carry her!
- Cristy!

347
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:27,400
Jordan?

348
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:28,700
Jordan, that's enough.

349
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:29,800
Don't get up.

350
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:31,300
Don't get up, Jordan.

351
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:32,833
Jordan!

352
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:38,500
Let's go!

353
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:45,967
Help!

354
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:46,667
Help!

355
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:49,900
Please help us!

356
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:51,767
Help!

357
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,767
Help!

358
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,467
Help us!

359
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:58,667
Jordan!

360
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,633
Jordan, Jordan.

361
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:36,300
Jordan...

362
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,100
Leslie, come on.

363
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:42,833
Let's go with him.

364
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:49,700
Jordan... Leslie, hurry up.

365
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,067
Leon.

366
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:54,800
What?

367
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:55,800
Who's that woman?

368
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:57,600
Why did you bring her?

369
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,067
Did you see what she did to me?

370
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,067
I'll just get even
with that animal!

371
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:11,267
But is it true that you won't
let her free?

372
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,333
Yes, why?

373
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,667
You can't hold her
hostage forever.

374
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,400
She'll just be a burden
to the group.

375
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:13,533
Where is Congressman.

376
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,333
They're here!

377
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,233
Dad!

378
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,133
Dear.

379
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,067
I have a gunshot wound.

380
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:37,367
Aunt Pusit.

381
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:43,833
Does it hurt somewhere?

382
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,067
Buwaya!

383
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:47,800
You act as if you didn't go on
the same mission!

384
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,333
Calm down!

385
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:51,267
Aunt Pusit, you're just envious

386
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,433
because you don't have
a boyfriend.

387
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,133
What happened?

388
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:01,500
Comrades, listen.

389
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,200
Let's pay respect to Hito
and Ulupong.

390
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:12,967
Who gave up heir life
for our goal.

391
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,700
Bring them in.

392
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:24,433
Let's go!

393
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:26,533
Hurry up!

394
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:40,167
Dad... Dad, what took you
so long?

395
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,600
I thought something bad happened
to you.

396
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:14,933
Shaira?

397
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,267
Shaira!

398
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:16,967
Jeff.

399
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:18,233
What happened to you?

400
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,733
Did you get hurt?

401
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,200
Are you one of the hostages?

402
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:23,233
It's a long story.

403
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,033
But...

404
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:30,400
Jordan has a serious
wound. Jeff!

405
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,167
What about Cristy?

406
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:54,433
Shaira, where's Cristy?

407
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,400
I've been calling the police,

408
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:58,400
but they don't have an update.

409
00:24:58,467 --> 00:24:59,933
Where's Cristy?

410
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,833
Everyone, listen!

411
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,900
No one should touch
the hostages!

412
00:27:17,967 --> 00:27:19,500
Why did they get Cristy?

413
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:22,200
What did my daughter do to them?

414
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:23,767
You're hiding something.

415
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:27,600
You don't hold someone hostage
without a reason.

416
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:29,367
Brother, if something bad
happens to him.

417
00:27:29,433 --> 00:27:31,467
What? You'll send me to jail?

418
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:32,567
He's crazy.

419
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:35,200
He got you involved.

420
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:37,167
I will set you free.

421
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:39,367
Really?
