1
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:17,133
Let go!

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,567
I said let go!

3
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:19,400
Cristy!

4
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:21,333
- Jordan!
- Let go!

5
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,833
- Cristy!
- Jordan!

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,700
Leon, come on! Let's go!

7
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:28,167
Cristy!

8
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:29,667
That's enough!

9
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:30,967
Jordan!

10
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:41,767
Jordan!

11
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,933
At first, this seemed like
a dream.

12
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:16,267
Jordan and I have fought for
this love for four years.

13
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,200
It wasn't easy.

14
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:21,633
It wasn't fast.

15
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,867
But today, I'm very happy,
I am ecstatic.

16
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:34,067
Everywhere I look, the people
who love me,

17
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:35,667
who love us... are smiling.

18
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:56,300
Finally, I can give my forever
to the man I love the most.

19
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:04,067
Boyfriend, friend, and most
of all, my other half,

20
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:08,500
who will be with me in every
challenge.

21
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:14,100
Our daughter, Tori, will grow up
full of love.

22
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,500
And we will never be apart.

23
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:26,667
I thank God and Jordan for not
giving up, for being steadfast,

24
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:34,667
for not losing the smile he
gives me every day.

25
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,867
I am very proud to say that
from this day on,

26
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:59,400
I, Cristy Manansala is Jordan
Manansala's only wife.

27
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:03,367
And the only one who owns
his heart.

28
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,500
You can now exchange your vows.

29
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:14,600
Babe, I still can't believe
you'll be my wife.

30
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:18,933
I will do everything to make you
happy for the rest of our lives.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,900
I'm not perfect, but I'll do
everything to love you and Tori.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,233
I love you so much.

33
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,100
You're the only one I need
in my life.

34
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:37,233
Babe, I still can't believe
we're here.

35
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,033
This is our day, Babe.

36
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,167
We've waited for this
for so long.

37
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:45,467
You, me, and Tori will be
a family.

38
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:49,467
And our world we'll be
ours again.

39
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:53,033
I love you so much.

40
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:02,200
Meldy, bring Tori inside.

41
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:12,200
Ladies and gentlemen, I now
present to you,

42
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:16,167
Mr. and Mrs. Jordan Manansala!

43
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,733
You may now kiss the bride.

44
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:36,400
Bad omen.

45
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:27,367
Jordan, I want to thank you,

46
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:32,867
for giving Cristy this beautiful
wedding that she deserves.

47
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,500
But I want you to remember,

48
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,500
that this is not the culmination
of your marriage.

49
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:42,033
This is only the beginning.

50
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,233
And, Jordan, I heard all your
promises to Cristy.

51
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,367
And I hope you will fulfill
all of that.

52
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:52,767
- Okay?
- Yes, Mom.

53
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,867
Because I want nothing
but to see,

54
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:59,800
my daughter and granddaughter
happy.

55
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:01,600
Okay?

56
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,700
Congratulations,
congratulations.

57
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:09,867
Mom, thank you!

58
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,667
Guys, let's drink to that!

59
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:13,800
- Cheers! Cheers!
- Cheers!

60
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:14,900
Cheers, cheers!

61
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:18,633
Guys, cheers, cheers!

62
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,633
I want to congratulate these
love birds in front of me.

63
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,233
Jordan, Bro, Cristy,
Congratulations.

64
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,900
I owe a lot to you, Bro.

65
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:31,100
You know that.

66
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,500
For those of you who don't know,

67
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:38,100
Jordan gave up his studies
to send me to college,

68
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:41,833
to raise me well when our
parents died.

69
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:46,033
So, bro, you deserve all the
happiness, the joy,

70
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,067
the blessings, the respect,
the love,

71
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:50,467
all the love in the world.

72
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:56,600
And for me, couples who prove
their love for each other,

73
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,233
are meant to be together.

74
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,700
That's why, You should kiss!

75
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,433
- Kiss! Kiss!
- Kiss! Kiss!

76
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,167
- Congrats, Bro.
- Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.

77
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:09,633
- Thank you, Jeff!
- Kiss!

78
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,367
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

79
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,900
I just want to say something
short and sweet.

80
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:22,200
Jordan, Cristy, congratulations.

81
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,800
I love you both so much.

82
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:28,633
Jordan, please take care of my
cousin, and my best friend.

83
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,533
So, I'd like to ask you, please,

84
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,433
to give Tori a sibling!

85
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,067
Cheers, everyone!

86
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:41,900
Well, first of all, I want
to thank all of you.

87
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:45,500
Because Cristy and I have
chosen,

88
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:47,267
all our wedding guests
carefully.

89
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,000
You really are handpicked.

90
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,167
As you can see, it's
so intimate.

91
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,633
From my batchmates to
Cristy's friends,

92
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,100
godfathers, and godmothers,
our family,

93
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,367
I want to thank everyone.

94
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:00,833
And, of course, most
importantly,

95
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:03,267
Mom, thank you so much.

96
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,800
I know we used to not get along,

97
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:10,333
but, I'm so happy that we're
now a family.

98
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,267
I love you, Mom.

99
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,733
Thank you, thank you.

100
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:21,133
And of course, to my
beautiful wife.

101
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:27,100
If this is a film, I'm telling
you, I still can't believe it.

102
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,267
It's like betting one peso
on the lottery,

103
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,933
and winning a million.

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,867
That's what happened.

105
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,900
I'm still head over heels
in love with her.

106
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:38,333
I love her so much and
no one else.

107
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,833
And, Babe, do you
have anything to say?

108
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,200
- Yes, yes! It's my turn.
- Yes!

109
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:44,667
Let me join you. I'll give
my speech.

110
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:48,233
Sorry, Babe.

111
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,667
Everyone, thank you so much for
being here on our special night.

112
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,633
We've waited for this for
a long time.

113
00:08:55,733 --> 00:09:01,333
That's why we're very thankful
that you made it here tonight.

114
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,700
This wouldn't be complete, and
it wouldn't be special

115
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,467
if you were not here with us
to celebrate.

116
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:12,300
But I should thank my Mom
the most.

117
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,000
Mom, thank you so much.

118
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:21,200
Ever since Dad, this has been
my dream.

119
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:22,633
So thank you, Mom.

120
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,433
It's a dream come true.

121
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,933
I love you, Mom.

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,900
I love you.

123
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,400
- Cheers.
- I love you, Mom.

124
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:30,000
Cheers.

125
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,000
Cheers!

126
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:33,167
Everyone, please enjoy
the evening.

127
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:34,767
Let's dance!

128
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:40,467
- Cheers!
- Cheers, everyone!

129
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:42,133
Congratulations, newlyweds!

130
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,367
- Thank you, thank you!
- Thank you!

131
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,933
But really, thank you.

132
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,667
Our wedding wouldn't be this
beautiful if it wasn't for you.

133
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:49,900
Shai, thank you.

134
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:54,033
Honestly, you've been a good
friend not only to Jordan,

135
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,367
but also to me.

136
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:59,667
Even if I don't say it,
Girl, I'm so grateful.

137
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:03,000
You were there for Jordan when
we were having a tough time.

138
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,700
Come on, don't mention it.

139
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:05,867
What are friends for, right?

140
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,600
- Thank you.
- Exactly!

141
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,500
Can I borrow Jordan for a while?

142
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,233
Is that okay?

143
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,333
Go, go, go!

144
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,333
Just make sure you bring him
back to me later.

145
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,700
He's my Babe, too. Okay?

146
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:17,667
Kidding. Enjoy, Babe.

147
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:18,733
- Yes, yes.
- Enjoy, enjoy.

148
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,833
Hey, Cristy! I'll go ahead,
okay? We'll go home.

149
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,067
Mom, can Tori stay
the night here?

150
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,233
Just one night, Mom.

151
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,667
I will bring her home so you two
can enjoy.

152
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,367
- No, Cristy,
- It's a beautiful party.

153
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:32,767
I'll bring you home,
Aunt Carmen.

154
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,500
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

155
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,200
Haven't you had a drink?

156
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,267
No, I just had a little.

157
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,167
- Just one glass.
- Okay. We'll go ahead.

158
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:38,867
- Mom.
- Congratulations.

159
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:40,233
Mom, I'll take care
of the guests.

160
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,933
- Okay, congratulations.
- Mom, I'll go with you!

161
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,800
Kiss Tori before we leave.

162
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:45,167
Yes, I will.

163
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:47,067
Shai, I'll get going.

164
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:48,200
I'll bring Aunt Carmen home.

165
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:49,233
- Okay.
- Be safe.

166
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,767
Don't drink.

167
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,833
- Be safe.
- Okay.

168
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,700
- Let's go, Auntie.
- Okay.

169
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:00,000
- Be safe.
- Bye.

170
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,000
- Be good.
- Bye.

171
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:03,700
Of course. My wife.

172
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:04,467
See you, see you.

173
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:05,733
I'll go to Tori!

174
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,100
Dance, dance!

175
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,867
Yeah!

176
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:15,467
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

177
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,200
Cheers!

178
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:25,433
Careful.

179
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,933
My god, you're both drunk.

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,833
Wait.

181
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,067
- Wait...
- There, there.

182
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:32,633
- Put him there, go.
- Girl, he's heavy.

183
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,333
- Careful.
- Sorry.

184
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,100
My gosh.

185
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:36,300
Here, here.

186
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:40,200
Can you manage?

187
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,567
- Ouch!
- You, too!

188
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:45,167
You shouldn't have let Jordan
drink a lot.

189
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:47,067
Cristy might get mad.

190
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:49,233
That would be good.

191
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,233
So they'll separate soon!

192
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,400
Will you get to your senses?
They might hear us.

193
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:59,433
Come on, Leslie. Am I not
allowed to react?

194
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,633
You know how long I worked
hard to get Jordan, right?

195
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,100
I even introduced him to
our clients.

196
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:07,867
to help him in his business,

197
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:12,333
and then. Cristy suddenly
appeared.

198
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,267
But Shai, they're
already married.

199
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:19,433
I think it's time to accept that
you will never have Jordan.

200
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:23,633
Cuz. Cuz!

201
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,500
Cuz, where's Jordan?

202
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:26,733
I don't know.

203
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll look for him. Wait, Cuz.

204
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,633
I'll get water for Jordan.

205
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,000
Don't do anything stupid.

206
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll be right back.

207
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,367
Don't do anything stupid.

208
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:00,300
Why?

209
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:02,967
Is it stupid to love you?

210
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,533
Jordan.

211
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:30,100
Jordan... Jordan?

212
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,733
Hi, Cristy!

213
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,467
Shai.

214
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:36,567
I didn't know you were there.

215
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,033
What are you guys doing here?

216
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:42,000
Jordan is wasted.

217
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,333
It'll be embarrassing if the
guests will see him like that.

218
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,533
Oh my gosh.

219
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,900
Sorry, sorry.

220
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:49,233
There she is! There it is.

221
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,167
Here's the water.

222
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:52,567
Sorry, you had to take care
of him.

223
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:53,933
It's okay, it's okay.

224
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,667
I'll take it from here.

225
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:57,567
I'll take care of him, okay?

226
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:58,233
Okay.

227
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,433
Thank you guys so much.

228
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,700
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

229
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,433
Babe...

230
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,833
Babe, water.

231
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,633
Babe, wake up.

232
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:15,200
- Come on!
- Wait, wait.

233
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:16,567
My dress.

234
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,867
Why?

235
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:56,933
Is there a problem?

236
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,633
Nothing.

237
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,900
It's just that, I thought.

238
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,100
I would never be afraid to lose
you once we got married.

239
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,567
But it seems like I'm more
nervous now.

240
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,700
Babe, you won't lose me.

241
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:18,600
Why do you think like that?

242
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,133
Nothing. It's just that,

243
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,667
when I saw you and Shaira
earlier, I felt off.

244
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:37,367
Babe, why are you laughing?

245
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:39,933
I find you cute.

246
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You're cute when you're jealous.

247
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,500
Knock it off, Jordan.

248
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,267
Okay, okay.

249
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,333
But seriously, babe.

250
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,800
You don't need to feel scared
or jealous,

251
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:57,167
whether with Shaira or
other girls.

252
00:15:57,233 --> 00:16:02,233
Like I told you, you're
my only dream,

253
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:07,800
Mrs. Cristy
Salcedo-Manansala.

254
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,733
Only you, Babe.

255
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,567
Cristy, my only point is,

256
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:52,100
you don't have to get
pregnant again,

257
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,467
just because you're married
already.

258
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,000
Thank you, Yaya.

259
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:55,767
Yes, Ma'am.

260
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,067
Okay. Go to sleep, go to sleep.

261
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,533
- Okay, go to sleep.
- Bye.

262
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,467
Love you, okay?

263
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:01,100
Okay.

264
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,500
Okay, okay. Go to sleep.

265
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:03,433
Bye, Mommy.

266
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,367
Bye, Grandma.

267
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:06,833
- Bye.
- Tori and I will go here.

268
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:15,400
So, as I was saying, It's not
wise to have another child,

269
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,633
now that you're married.

270
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,467
You promised me that
you'd finish,

271
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:22,333
your Master's Degree, right?

272
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,533
Yes, Mom. And don't worry.
I'll keep my promise.

273
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,500
I'll enroll this
coming semester.

274
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:30,100
And maybe Jordan can go back,

275
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:34,600
to college when you're
finished, right?

276
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:37,367
It's still better if, Babe.

277
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:38,467
You're back.

278
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,267
That's all the stuff you have?

279
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:47,867
Actually, Mom, I'll only stay
here for a month.

280
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,133
My business is doing good,
that's why,

281
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:51,167
I've made adown payment
for the house,

282
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:54,333
where, I'll move with my love.

283
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,700
You're leaving?

284
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:04,533
Mom. It's about time.

285
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,267
We have to start our own family.

286
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:13,433
This house is enough for
all of us. Right?

287
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,367
This house is big.

288
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:16,800
It's spacious.

289
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:19,100
How about Tori?

290
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:21,133
Are you going to take my
grandchild away from me?

291
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:26,033
Mom...

292
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,500
Mom, I will take care
of your daughter.

293
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,833
And I won't take Tory
away from you.

294
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,300
We'll visit you often.

295
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:39,700
And our new house.you're always
welcome there, Mom.

296
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,600
Dear, isn't this too dangerous?

297
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,500
It's full of rocks!

298
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,833
We still have a lot to fix, Mom.

299
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,600
Jordan and I are still
saving up.

300
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,767
So, soon, this will be
our dream home.

301
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,667
Come in, Mom.

302
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:22,800
The living room is here.

303
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:24,167
This way.

304
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:27,133
Okay... And... Bye!

305
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,833
Bye, Tori!

306
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,000
Stay there, Baby.

307
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:33,867
Here's the living room, Mom.

308
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:36,267
This is a bit slippery.

309
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,867
You should look after Tori.

310
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:43,800
Mom, I'm sorry for disappointing
you when we decided to leave.

311
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:47,433
But I hope you can see he's
doing everything,

312
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,567
to take care of me and Tori.

313
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:51,700
He'll take care of us.

314
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:53,467
That's all you want, right?

315
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:54,733
<i> Not there!</i>

316
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,500
<i>You're getting excited,
aren't you?</i>

317
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:59,600
<i>You really are impressive, Shai.</i>

318
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,467
Who's that?

319
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,300
That's Shaira, Mom.

320
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,000
She was at our wedding.

321
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:06,800
<i> You're really good!</i>

322
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,967
Auntie! You're finally here.

323
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,500
- Hi, Jeff!
- Excuse me for a while, Auntie.

324
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:12,667
Cristy, I'll get juice
for Shaira.

325
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:13,867
Sure.

326
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:19,033
Cristina, you shouldn't let
your husband,

327
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,533
have a good time with
another woman.

328
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,133
And in your own home?

329
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,167
Mom, they're just friends.

330
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:29,667
<i>Stop! It's your fault!
I told you to stop.</i>

331
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:31,600
They're just friends?

332
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,233
That laugh?

333
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,500
You cannot be too careful,
Cristy.

334
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,367
You know that.

335
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:38,867
Tell Jordan it's
not appropriate.

336
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,400
Okay? Tell him.

337
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:41,267
Yes, Mom.

338
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,733
I'll check it out.
I'll go ahead.

339
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,000
Jordan. Wait, wait, wait.

340
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:46,833
Yes, Mom.

341
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:53,300
<i>See? You're getting excited,
aren't you?</i>

342
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:54,300
Really?

343
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:55,500
- Let me.
<i> - You really are something.</i>

344
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:06,333
<i>You really are impressive, Shai.</i>

345
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,967
<i>- Of course.
- Let me check.</i>

346
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,667
<i>Come on. Admit it.
You're excited.</i>

347
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:10,600
Jordan.

348
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:27,133
Jordan, what's this?

349
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,733
Babe, you won't believe
what she got for us.

350
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,333
Shai.

351
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:36,500
It's for your honeymoon.

352
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:39,200
One week stay in our branch
in South.

353
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,867
I'm sorry.

354
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,300
My gift is a bit late.

355
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:48,533
I have to make sure you guys
have the best experience.

356
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:55,200
Are you okay, Cristy?

357
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,667
I, I. I, I just don't know
how to... say thank you.

358
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:02,233
Thank you.

359
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,733
Thank you, Shai.

360
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,900
Let's just have a group hug.

361
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:07,700
Yes?

362
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:08,733
Thank you!

363
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,600
Congrats!

364
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,667
Thank you, thank you.

365
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:35,833
Thank you!

366
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,533
Thanks, Babe.

367
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,200
Oh my gosh! Babe!

368
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:41,733
It's beautiful!

369
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,733
Mister, thank you.

370
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,733
Thank you.

371
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,967
Babe, this is where we'll
make Tori's sibling.

372
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,100
I'm sure of that.

373
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,633
We just arrived.

374
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,667
Wow! It's so nice.

375
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:59,933
- I'm glad we got this gift.
- Yes.

376
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,367
Hey.

377
00:23:00,433 --> 00:23:01,533
Hi!

378
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,267
Welcome to<i> Helio
Paradiso Southern Island</i> .

379
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,133
Shaira!

380
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,367
What are you doing here,
Leslie? Shai?

381
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:09,767
We have a VVIP from Manila.

382
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,733
The congressman has
requested us.

383
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,667
So, here we are!

384
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:15,667
Actually, I forgot that,

385
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:18,467
you'll also have your honeymoon
today.

386
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:20,167
Yeah.

387
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:23,533
Yes, Shai, thank you, it's
so beautiful here.

388
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:27,833
We should treat you to lunch
just to say thank you.

389
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,300
Okay?

390
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,733
I'll try.

391
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,200
Okay, I'll leave you here.

392
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:35,667
We'll check in so we won't ruin
your schedule. Okay?

393
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:36,967
Sure, go. Enjoy!

394
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:37,833
- Thank you, thank you.
- This way, this way.

395
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,933
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

396
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,800
Let's go, Babe.

397
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:41,800
Go! Yay!

398
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:05,600
I don't get you, Girl.

399
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:07,867
Are you a masochist?

400
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:11,200
Why did you gift them with
a honeymoon package?

401
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:12,633
Why not?

402
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,267
So, they can enjoy their little
time together as a couple.

403
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:19,933
What do you mean?

404
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,133
I'm warning you, Shai.

405
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,133
What?

406
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,567
I won't do anything,
Leslie! Relax.

407
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:31,567
What I mean is that marriages
don't last long these days.

408
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:34,067
And besides, remember?

409
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,433
They broke up before.

410
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,633
So, it's possible to
happen again.

411
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,500
Stop it, Shaira.

412
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,167
The congressman's here.

413
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:43,300
Please get the drinks ready.

414
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:49,933
Congressman, welcome.

415
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,900
Welcome!

416
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:53,600
- Welcome.
- We have something for you.

417
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:55,267
Drinks.

418
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,967
Here.

419
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:58,667
- For you.
- Thank you.

420
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:00,100
You're welcome.

421
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:01,933
Is there anything you need?

422
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,533
No.

423
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:04,333
All right.

424
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,400
It's amazing!

425
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:20,367
Wow!

426
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:49,667
Yes?

427
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,433
Okay. We're ready.

428
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,467
Babe, we can do that.

429
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,933
- Shai, Shai.
- Nice!

430
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,600
Is Leslie not coming?

431
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:13,500
The congressman is so clingy.

432
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:16,067
One of us should assist him.

433
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,267
Don't worry.

434
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:20,067
At least I already have
a connection.

435
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:21,300
Wait, Babe.

436
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:23,800
I'll get another round so we
can have some more.

437
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:25,633
- I've finished mine already.
- Okay, sure. Sure, sure.

438
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,433
- Go.
- I will miss you.

439
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,033
Thanks, Babe.

440
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,167
Wait for me.

441
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:30,200
Of course.

442
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,067
Are you single?

443
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:46,433
Sorry, there's a lot about you
that I don't know.

444
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,333
Let's just say that
it's complicated.

445
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:51,567
There's this guy that I like.

446
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:56,133
But, we can't really
be with each other.

447
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,167
I think I know who you're
talking about.

448
00:27:59,233 --> 00:28:02,167
What?

449
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:04,100
It's Jeff.

450
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:06,500
Come on. He's a hopeless
romantic.

451
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:08,967
That's why he got married early.

452
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:12,867
And he was so heartbroken when
he broke up with his wife.

453
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:14,900
But, Girl, just a little
more time,

454
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:18,467
and his annulment will be done.

455
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:20,167
So. no more complications.

456
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:21,200
Everything will be okay.

457
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:25,167
Cheers to that.

458
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:26,667
Cheers to that.

459
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:30,900
So, it's Jeff.

460
00:28:30,967 --> 00:28:34,033
Okay, one more round!

461
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,067
Perfect.

462
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:35,900
- Perfect timing, Babe.
- One more round.

463
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:37,733
- Thank you.
- Of course, Babe.

464
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,567
Thank you!

465
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:42,033
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

466
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,867
Let's dance, Babe?

467
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:50,567
Let's do it.

468
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:52,300
Shai, we'll be right back.

469
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:53,533
- Let's go, Babe.
- Yeah.

470
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:36,900
Babe, I love you. I love you
so much.

471
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:39,033
I love you, and I'm
willing to fight for you

472
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,900
against Mom or whoever.

473
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:49,533
I'll get through every challenge
we might encounter,

474
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,167
for you and Tori.

475
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:56,800
Babe, you will never lose me.

476
00:29:56,867 --> 00:29:59,467
They will have to kill me
first before they can take

477
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:01,967
you away from me.

478
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:03,067
You.

479
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:06,400
You and only you are the only
Mrs. Manansala.

480
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:08,633
Of course.

481
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,767
You're only mine.

482
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,000
And no one can take
you away from me.

483
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:16,833
I love you so much.

484
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,900
Alakdan, where are the weapons?

485
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:04,433
It's all here, everything's in
good condition.

486
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,467
You know what to do!

487
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:12,633
Let's go!

488
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,667
What's that?

489
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:28,533
Go, go, go!

490
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,100
Go!

491
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:34,300
Hurry up! That way! Hurry!

492
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,433
We are the<i> Kalasag</i> !

493
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,300
We fight abusive and
greedy people.

494
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:48,033
I will pay no matter the cost.

495
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,333
Just let me go!

496
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,000
I don't want to die, Jordan.

497
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:51,900
They might kill us.

498
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:52,800
No one will die.

499
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:54,267
No one will die.

500
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,100
What are you going to do?

501
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:57,100
Hey!

502
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:57,767
Stop!

503
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:58,867
Help us.

504
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:02,000
Some rebels invaded the resort.

505
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:04,467
Jordan and I got separated.

506
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:05,533
What?

507
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,700
Why aren't we leaving?

508
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:08,667
The congressman is already
with us.

509
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:12,233
I want to make sure that
no one will report us.

510
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,933
Bring some of our men.

511
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,300
Search every room!
