1
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:30,433
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I now present to you,</i>

2
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,700
<i> Mr. and Mrs. Jordan Manansala!</i>

3
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,533
<i> Bad omen.</i>

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,200
<i> Why?</i>

5
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:41,233
<i> Is it stupid to love you?</i>

6
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,267
<i>You shouldn't have let
your husband have a good</i>

7
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,700
<i> time with another woman.</i>

8
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:46,900
<i> And in your own house?</i>

9
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:50,067
<i> Mom, they're just friends.</i>

10
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,833
<i>Did you really have to gift them
with a honeymoon package?</i>

11
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,000
<i> Why not?</i>

12
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:57,200
<i>So, they can enjoy their little
time together as a couple.</i>

13
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:03,000
<i> Okay. We're ready.</i>

14
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:05,233
<i> Are you single?</i>

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,567
<i>Sorry, there's just a lot about
you that I don't know.</i>

16
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,800
<i> There's this guy that I like.</i>

17
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:15,133
<i>But we can't really be with
each other.</i>

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,967
<i>I think I know who you're
talking about.</i>

19
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:20,233
<i> Huh?</i>

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,167
<i> Hurry, that way!</i>

21
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:26,300
Babe, let's go.

22
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:27,533
Come on, let's go!

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,133
Where do we go?

24
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:40,733
You, come here!

25
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:41,333
Stop!

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,567
Go there!

27
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:44,600
Move over there,
Congressman!

28
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,733
Gather everyone!

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,367
Sit!

30
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:53,567
I said sit!

31
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:56,833
Sit down, sit down.

32
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,600
Sit down!

33
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:04,167
Excellent, comrades.

34
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:05,933
Who are you?

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,833
Just let us know
what you need.

36
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,367
Don't hurt our guests.

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,700
Do you want them to pick up
your brain on the ground?

38
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:19,033
Do you?

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,267
They might catch us.

40
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,333
Let's stay here.

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,200
Where?

42
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,500
Babe, this way. Come on!

43
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:05,167
We are the Kalasag!

44
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:10,133
We are the brotherhood
that fights abuse and greed.

45
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,733
And we're all here. for
Congressman Rodriguez.

46
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:27,167
The one who stole every
farmer's land!

47
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:45,700
Wait.

48
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,067
Jordan, we shouldn't
have gotten in here.

49
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:59,800
We'll get stuck.

50
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:02,167
We can't stay outside.

51
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,900
We'll get caught easier if
we do.

52
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:06,000
What about Shaira
and Leslie?

53
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:08,100
I hope nothing bad happens
to them.

54
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,867
Babe, wait. I'll call
Mom and Tori.

55
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,500
Not now, babe. They'll just get
worried.

56
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:17,567
We need to focus on how to
help others.

57
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,400
We should let the police know.

58
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,433
We have to contact them.

59
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,833
The police? What if those people
get angrier?

60
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,533
I don't want to die, Jordan.

61
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,700
They might kill us.

62
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,967
No one will die.

63
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,400
No one will die.

64
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:30,833
We'll go home to Tori.

65
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:37,300
Babe, call the police.

66
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,467
Okay.

67
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,733
They are the group I see
on TV.

68
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,933
They cut off their
hostages' heads when they

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,100
can't pay the ransom.

70
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,733
Hey!

71
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Who told you to chitchat?

72
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,933
Shut your mouth if you don't
want us to blow your

73
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,667
heads off!

74
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:07,233
Buwaya!

75
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,433
Get a bag.

76
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,433
Get those that will fit in
their heads!

77
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,233
Shut up!

78
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,200
Give me your cell phones!

79
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:15,967
Cellphone.

80
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:18,133
Include your jewelry, too.

81
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,000
Cell phone, faster!

82
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:23,633
Put it there, put it here.

83
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,767
Your jewelry. Move!

84
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:26,667
Jewelry.

85
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:27,400
Put it there.

86
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:30,533
Give all your cell phones.

87
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,967
Try to hide your phones, and
we'll blow your heads off!

88
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:40,367
Hello, Sir?

89
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:41,233
Sir, hello.

90
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,200
Please help us.

91
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:45,033
They might kill us if you don't
come here.

92
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,667
Please, have mercy on us.

93
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:48,700
Save us.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,333
Are you sure no one escaped?

95
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:56,700
Leave our guest alone. Just get
what you need!

96
00:05:56,767 --> 00:06:01,600
Igat, Bakulaw... Search
the entire resort!

97
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:04,333
Bring some of our men!

98
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,967
What did they say?

99
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,433
They say they'll come here.

100
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,867
But they'll come from the
neighboring island.

101
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,233
Hurry! Hurry!

102
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,167
There's another one over there.

103
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,167
Gather everyone in the center.

104
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:26,733
Sit! Sit!

105
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,267
- Sit down!
- Sit down!

106
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,467
- Leon is waiting!
- Hurry up!

107
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,133
Take care of them.

108
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,000
We'll go to Leon.

109
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:44,667
- Walk.
- Walk!

110
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:45,367
- Walk!
- Walk.

111
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:38,300
I'll just use the restroom.

112
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:39,833
I can't hold it in anymore.

113
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Make it quick.

114
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,567
This mission is so easy.

115
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,867
We got the fool politician
without breaking a sweat.

116
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,700
We can finally exchange heads.

117
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:57,567
I'm sure Leon will be glad.

118
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:58,933
What?

119
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,400
This is not the time
for chitchat.

120
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:03,267
Do you want to lose your
tongue?

121
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,833
Move.

122
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,400
And you, hey!

123
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:08,267
I'm coming!

124
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,800
I can cut that off.

125
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:10,467
Hurry up.

126
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:10,967
I'm done.

127
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:11,967
You took so long.

128
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,433
Babe.

129
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:48,967
Looks like they're gone.

130
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:53,133
Careful. We'll go out.

131
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,500
Okay.

132
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:00,867
Hurry up!

133
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:01,867
Move!

134
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:02,233
Move!

135
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:02,600
Move!

136
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:20,500
Leon.

137
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,967
Why aren't we leaving yet?

138
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:25,000
We already have the Congressman
with us.

139
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,767
I want to make sure no one will
report us.

140
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:33,867
And I want the authorities
to be surprised that we

141
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:36,233
have something against them.

142
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,533
Bring some of our men.

143
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,000
Search every room.

144
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:43,200
I don't trust Igat.

145
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,967
Make it quick.

146
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,633
What do you need from us?

147
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,800
Please spare us.

148
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:57,967
We didn't do anything wrong
to you!

149
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:01,400
I'm willing to pay if I'm the
one you need.

150
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,133
How much do you want?

151
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,733
I have money!

152
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,600
I will pay you no matter
the cost!

153
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:06,900
Just let me go!

154
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:12,500
And then what?

155
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:17,867
You will give us the money
you stole?

156
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:18,400
Is that it?

157
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,233
Don't worry, Congressman.

158
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:32,633
You will know everything
we want.

159
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:38,167
So, shut your mouth for now.

160
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:44,000
If not, I will show everyone
what we're capable of.

161
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,200
Do you want that?

162
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:05,933
Hey!

163
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,567
Stop!

164
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:48,167
Hello, Cristy?

165
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:49,133
What's up?

166
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,300
Is Jordan already giving you
a headache?

167
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,833
Jeff... Jeff, help us.

168
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,800
Some rebels invaded the place.

169
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:58,500
<i> Jordan and I got separated.</i>

170
00:11:58,567 --> 00:11:59,500
What?

171
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:04,100
Jeff, I couldn't believe it
at first, too.

172
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:06,567
<i> Help us, please.</i>

173
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:09,067
I don't want to die.

174
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:11,200
Don't tell Mom, okay?

175
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:12,733
<i> Don't tell Mom.</i>

176
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,700
Take care of them while we're
still away. Until we escape.

177
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,033
Wait, wait.

178
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,700
Hold on.

179
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:20,200
You're going to escape?

180
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:21,333
Isn't that dangerous?

181
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,767
Where's the police?

182
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:23,433
I don't know.

183
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,367
I hope the police arrive.

184
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:26,600
But... Okay, okay.

185
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:30,467
I'll find a way to help you.

186
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:31,467
Okay.

187
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,167
<i> Just don't lose hope, Cristy.</i>

188
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:34,000
Jordan is strong.

189
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,933
He'll come back to you, okay?

190
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,633
Thank you, Jeff.

191
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,533
Bye.

192
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:37,200
Jordan?

193
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:38,133
Jordan!

194
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,033
You, monsters!

195
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,133
What did you do to him?

196
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,500
Jordan, Jordan, get up.

197
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,100
I'm fine.

198
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,233
Your clothes are so clean.

199
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:56,467
Are you tough?

200
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:00,867
Where did you get him?

201
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:01,967
In the men's restroom.

202
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:03,100
Oh, really?

203
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:07,033
Where's the one with you?

204
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:12,133
I'm alone.

205
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,033
What did we do wrong to you?

206
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:17,100
Answer my question!

207
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,767
I don't have anyone with me.

208
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,000
I really am alone.

209
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,367
You're alone?

210
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:26,933
You're alone!

211
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:35,800
Jordan.

212
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:45,567
Are you okay?

213
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,633
Cristy... Cristy, can
ask for help.

214
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,133
She can ask for help.

215
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,100
What are you staring at?

216
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,500
What are you planning
to do with us?

217
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,567
Stop.

218
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:32,467
Do you want to know?

219
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:33,200
Do you?

220
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:33,967
That's enough.

221
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:34,700
Stop, please.

222
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,033
Please.

223
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,867
We'll do whatever you want.

224
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:39,233
Just don't hurt him.

225
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:43,867
Please.

226
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,933
I like your girlfriend.

227
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,867
She knows her place.

228
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:56,367
Be like her.

229
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:03,567
Because if not, I will blow
your head off.

230
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:22,767
Hey.

231
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,267
What are you still doing there?

232
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,933
I'm done searching that area!

233
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,867
Let's go back.

234
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:30,200
I don't know what Leon
is looking for.

235
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:31,700
Let's go, come on.

236
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:54,300
Leon.

237
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:55,233
Yeah?

238
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,967
The first floor is clear.

239
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:58,033
Are you sure?

240
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,500
Yes, we are.

241
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,600
<i>I'm okay. Just keep hiding.
Love you.</i>

242
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,000
You jerk!

243
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,000
You really are stubborn!

244
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:29,233
Stop!

245
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,767
Stop!

246
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:31,667
That's enough!

247
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,033
Don't hurt him! Please!

248
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,400
Don't hurt him.

249
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:35,267
Stop.

250
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:35,600
- Won't you let go of it?
- Jordan.

251
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:50,600
This is his wife.

252
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,600
If your wife is here, who is
this woman?

253
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,500
It's none of your business.

254
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:05,133
It seems that you like
that animal.

255
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,667
You know... I feel bad
for your wife.

256
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:17,300
She's worried for you.

257
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:18,800
Let's call her.

258
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:19,800
Don't.

259
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,200
Don't!

260
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:23,067
Don't!

261
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:30,900
Jordan?

262
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:32,033
Jordan, where are you?

263
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,500
<i> Jordan...</i>

264
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:35,933
Come here.

265
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,700
Listen.

266
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,033
Where are you?

267
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,133
Jordan!

268
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,900
Babe, don't say anything!

269
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:41,233
Babe!

270
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,233
<i> Babe?</i>

271
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,100
<i> Babe, where are you?</i>

272
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:46,500
<i> Where are you?</i>

273
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:47,500
<i> Babe, don't!</i>

274
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:58,067
<i>I'll give you five minutes
to show up.</i>

275
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:04,200
If you don't come, I will blow
your husband's head first.

276
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,733
I'll give you five minutes

277
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,033
<i> to show up.</i>

278
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,267
<i> If you don't come,</i>

279
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,167
I will blow your husband's
head first.

280
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:25,400
Cristy, don't say anything!

281
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:27,200
Think of Tori!

282
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,300
Jordan?

283
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,867
Jordan.

284
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:44,933
Go ahead.

285
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Make him shut up.

286
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:47,367
Bakulaw, Igat!

287
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,300
What will you do?

288
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:52,067
What will you do?

289
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:54,167
Stop!

290
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:56,100
Don't hurt him!

291
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:56,900
I'm begging you!

292
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:58,767
Please stop!

293
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,933
Stop!

294
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,767
I said stop!

295
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,167
That's enough!

296
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:04,733
Let go of him!

297
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,167
Jordan!

298
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:06,733
Jordan.

299
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,733
Stop!

300
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,867
Monsters!

301
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,933
Stop!

302
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,033
Animal Jordan!

303
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,733
Jordan!

304
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,867
That's enough!

305
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:25,167
Stop it!

306
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,667
Aren't you going to shut up?

307
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:28,733
Won't you shut your mouth?

308
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,033
Won't you?

309
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,833
I'm sure that the police will
arrive in a few hours.

310
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,433
And you will pay for everything
you're doing!

311
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,467
Aren't you really going to stop?

312
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,100
Let go of Come here.

313
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:46,800
Shai, Shai!

314
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:49,467
What now?

315
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:51,200
Come here.

316
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:53,600
Shai!

317
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:57,067
I will make this animal shut up.

318
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:03,967
- Shai...
- Where are you taking me?

319
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:07,000
Let go of me!

320
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:08,533
I'm not scared of you!

321
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,267
What are you going to do?

322
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,667
You're a monster!

323
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:20,833
Animal.

324
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:26,367
I can't breathe!

325
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:29,500
Are you really going to kill me?

326
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:30,833
Brother!

327
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,600
What's the matter with you?

328
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:47,400
I told you to just get Cristy.

329
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,700
I didn't tell you
to hurt Jordan!

330
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:58,467
Why do you put your itch first
instead of the group?

331
00:22:58,533 --> 00:23:00,433
I helped you!

332
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,033
I helped you, didn't I?

333
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,633
We agreed that we'd both benefit
from this!

334
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:12,233
They have transferred Dad
to Camp Crame.

335
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,767
He can no longer escape.

336
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,033
That's what they thought.

337
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,933
Will Congressman Rodriguez still
go to your resort

338
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,433
next month?

339
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:25,400
Why? Are you planning something
against Congressman?

340
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,300
What if we do?

341
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,400
I thought you were not
interested in the group?

342
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:37,167
What if I help you?

343
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:41,000
I can give you the blueprint
of the resort.

344
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:44,267
So, you'll know the place.

345
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:48,700
And why would you do that?

346
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,433
I want you to get someone, too.

347
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,100
What?

348
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,033
Whatever you plan to do with
Congressman,

349
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,833
bring that woman with him.

350
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,700
What? Is it because of this man?

351
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:10,567
I don't care what you do with
that woman.

352
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:13,533
I want her out of my life.

353
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,867
I did everything you needed.

354
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:19,633
You owe me that you got
Congressman Rodriguez!

355
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,633
I only want you to get Cristy
so I can have

356
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,200
Jordan to myself!

357
00:24:24,267 --> 00:24:24,933
Fine!

358
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,233
Tell your man to behave

359
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,933
if he doesn't want
to get killed!

360
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:31,667
Do you understand?

361
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:32,933
Leon, don't hurt him.

362
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,867
Do you understand?

363
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,567
Don't hurt him.

364
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:44,800
What's that for?

365
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:47,233
I'm just making it believable.

366
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,500
So, it will be convincing.

367
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,233
Come on.

368
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,467
- Leon, what are you doing?
- Get your act together!

369
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:04,733
Move.

370
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:08,567
Shai.

371
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:13,233
Okay. Let's do it again.

372
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,967
Hello? Shaira?

373
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:24,267
Cristy. So?

374
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:27,000
What?

375
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,000
Is the traffic bad?

376
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:31,467
It seems that your
husband's life doesn't

377
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:32,400
matter to you.

378
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:33,100
That's not true.

379
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,433
That's a lie.

380
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,400
Don't touch my husband!

381
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,267
<i> I told you,</i>

382
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:41,567
your husband's
life lies on you.

383
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:43,700
One minute left.

384
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:48,267
You'll pick his brain on
the ground if you don't come.

385
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,567
Don't, don't. I'll go there.

386
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,833
I'll go. Don't hurt Jordan.

387
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,967
I'm begging you, please. Please.

388
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,000
Even if you kill me...

389
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:21,367
Its enough for me to know that
my wife is safe.

390
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:22,333
No. Don't!

391
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,300
Don't!

392
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:24,200
Jordan!

393
00:26:24,267 --> 00:26:26,833
Jor Cristy
called me earlier.

394
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,267
Is she safe?

395
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,133
Is she safe?

396
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,867
No one will shoot!

397
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:33,100
I'll take care of her.

398
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:33,767
Cristy!

399
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:34,800
Jordan!

400
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:36,333
- Jordan Jordan!
- They will hurt you!

401
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,433
No! No!

402
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,933
Jordan!
