3
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,030
Greetings, brother.

4
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,880
Greetings, Lord Wang.

5
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,120
Why are you here?

6
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,840
I was training here with Ming'en.

7
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,790
When I went back,
I found my pendant missing,

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,040
so I returned

9
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:29,990
to look for it.

10
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,230
Training?

11
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,760
I'm a bit embarrassed.

12
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,230
You're skilled in martial arts,

13
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,400
so I can't fall too far behind.

14
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,480
Shao, you're truly diligent.

15
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,680
But remember to keep your things well

16
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
next time.

17
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,070
Oh, you found my pendant.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,200
Your Highness, I will take my leave.

19
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,430
Thank you, brother.

20
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,630
Wait!

21
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,400
Snake poison?

22
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,520
Your Highness, are you okay?

23
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,520
I...

24
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,240
Who asked you to come?

25
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,960
I was worried about you.

26
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,310
If you didn't come, I'd be safe.

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,240
Thank you for your concern.

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,400
But you should know

29
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,800
now I'm your mother.

30
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't go too far.

31
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,680
Your Highness.

32
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,310
I'll take you back.

33
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,990
No need.

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,870
There's a hidden path.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,840
Your Highness, let's go.

36
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,280
Your diversion tactic was brilliant.

37
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,840
Leave it by the west chamber.

38
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,750
Aye.

39
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,150
But who informed the Crown Prince?

40
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,550
Your Highness?

41
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,270
I'm fine.

42
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,470
Once we find out
the origin of the willow blade,

43
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,430
everything will be clear.

44
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,120
Shi... Shiqi?

45
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,310
Shiba?

46
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,750
Shiqi, it's really you.

47
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,830
What are you doing here?

48
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,830
Did he send you here?

49
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,630
Master ordered me to stay in the palace

50
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,310
to follow the Fifth Prince.

51
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,120
I lost track of him tonight

52
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,950
and ruined Master's plan.

53
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,550
What about you?

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,920
Did your mission fail too?

55
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,560
You opened
all the purple medicine boxes.

56
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,190
Are you looking for the Ink Poison?

57
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,680
If a poisoned person takes this,

58
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,920
they'll die immediately.

59
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,510
Shiqi, what are you doing?

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,070
I want to escape alive.

61
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:15,830
Shiqi,

62
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,190
have you seen Shisan?

63
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,600
I heard she's also in the palace,

64
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,870
but I haven't seen her since I came.

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,840
Shiba,

66
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,920
we're just killing machines
who came here for punishment

67
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,120
instead of chitchat.

68
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,120
If you want to survive,

69
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,870
put away those unrealistic hopes.

70
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,480
Think carefully

71
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,870
and find a way to stay alive.

72
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,920
Have you fallen for Shao and grown soft?

73
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,480
As an assassin, I have no right

74
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,070
to fall for anyone.

75
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,310
How could a qualified assassin

76
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,800
fail so many times?

77
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,480
You and Shao,

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,680
only one can live.

79
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,710
Of course,

80
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,560
I still hope

81
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,270
you can reunite with your family alive.

82
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,320
No punishment?

83
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,870
You are the noble Consort Wei.

84
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,720
You should be enjoying

85
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,190
wealth and honor.

86
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,760
And you

87
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,510
are just a useless loser!

88
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,760
Wait!

89
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,680
You want to protect her?

90
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,680
Shiba has risked her life for us.

91
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,720
She should die on the battlefield

92
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,070
instead of being killed by you.

93
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,560
Your tone sounds like Shao now!

94
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,360
So annoying!

95
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,800
Master, it's all my fault!

96
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,430
Please spare Shiqi!

97
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,830
You can use the Ink Poison on me!

98
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,510
Punish me, Master!

99
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,270
Shiba!

100
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,950
You want to take the Ink Poison?

101
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,320
No!

102
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,350
Shiba!

103
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,560
Get off her!

104
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,750
Shiba!

105
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,470
Shiba...

106
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,160
Shiqi.

107
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,510
I'm going to die, right?

108
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,270
You'll be fine.

109
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,190
I'll see Shisan soon.

110
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,190
I don't know

111
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,240
why you were looking for the Ink Poison,

112
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,560
but

113
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,870
I've found it.

114
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,480
It's here.

115
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,560
Just take it.

116
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,230
Shiba!

117
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,910
Shiba!

118
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,920
Shiba!

119
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,040
Shiba!

120
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,120
Shiba, I'm sorry!

121
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,870
Shiba, I'm sorry!

122
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,750
I've found it!

123
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,200
I've found it!

124
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,270
I've found it!

125
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,870
I'll bring you home!

126
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
I'll bring you home!

127
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,440
With the Ink Poison,

128
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,240
we can ask the pharmacist
to make the antidote.

129
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,510
However, Master's eyes

130
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,030
are all over the palace.

131
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,790
It's nearly impossible

132
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,440
to take this out.

133
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,960
I have a plan.

134
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,870
With the antidote,

135
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,750
you can save your mother,

136
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,750
and we'll escape to
the edge of the world.

137
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
As long as he's alive,

138
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,480
we will never be free.

139
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,360
More people will suffer and die

140
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,720
in pursuit of non-existent hopes

141
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,120
like Shisan and Shiba.

142
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,600
You want to dismantle the group?

143
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,440
But that's impossible.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,910
How can an assassin

145
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,670
defeat their master?

146
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,200
Di Shiqi can't,

147
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
but Consort Wei can.

148
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,390
Yilan,

149
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,910
I owe this to Shiba.

150
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,390
Please help me.

151
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,440
Teach me seducing skills

152
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,030
to earn the emperor's favor.

153
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,150
You want to use him
to weaken the Crown Prince

154
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,270
and dismantle the group?

155
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,600
I don't know if I can survive this game.

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,080
If I can't make it,

157
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,110
Yilan,

158
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,320
please take care of my mother.

159
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,010
No.

160
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,510
I can't leave you behind.

161
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,200
You won't leave me behind.

162
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,200
You need to take the poison out.

163
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,720
If I get out alive,

164
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,480
we can meet again.

165
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,120
When that day comes,
I hope you can bring the antidote

166
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,630
and my mother.

167
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,680
Okay.

168
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,120
I believe we'll meet again

169
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,440
and rescue all our sisters.

170
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,460
(Three Days Later)

171
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,200
Mother, what do you need?

172
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,350
Shao.

173
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,600
I want you

174
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,000
to choose a fine gift

175
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,440
for Consort Wei.

176
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,080
What day is it today?

177
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,480
Why are you giving her
such a valuable gift?

178
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,080
Consort Wei has practiced
her zither skills

179
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,840
and finally earned your father's favor.

180
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,440
She deserves a good reward.

181
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,870
Mother, stop kidding me.

182
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,390
I wouldn't dare fake the decree.

183
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,750
His Majesty has decreed

184
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,600
that he will sleep with
Consort Wei tonight.

185
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,960
Your Highness, the Fifth Prince...

186
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,390
I've made it clear.

187
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,240
I just hope

188
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,840
he can understand my love for him.

189
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,840
Your Highness!

190
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,390
♪Dreaming of a meeting♪

191
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,650
♪A gust of wind, a thought♪

192
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,570
♪See you in the dust♪
