3
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,240
Di Shiqi, are you...

4
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,950
Hurry, protect Her Highness!

5
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,510
Help! Protect Her Highness!

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,040
Protect Her Highness!

7
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,270
Your Highness!

8
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,230
Do you mean he tried to harm Consort Wei?

9
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,790
Your Majesty,

10
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,350
after Her Highness came here,

11
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,510
Shouzheng appeared from time to time,

12
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,590
talking some nonsense.

13
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,710
Today, he blocked Her Highness's way

14
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,070
and insulted her.

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,560
She couldn't endure it

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,200
and asked me to hit his face.

17
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,070
But he attacked Her Highness

18
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,870
and said...

19
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,510
He said...

20
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,880
What?

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,760
He said Her Highness should die.

22
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,910
Your Majesty,

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,510
when he rushed at me,

24
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,480
I saw it clearly.

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,000
He looked like someone.

26
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,480
Looked like someone?

27
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,870
He was nearly identical to him.

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,960
One of those rogues from before.

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,470
However, I was not sure.

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,710
If I mistakenly killed
the Crown Prince's man,

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,030
I'm willing to atone with my life.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
He's just an ignorant servant.

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,750
His life doesn't matter.

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,680
However, the rogue incident was strange.

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,960
Shouzheng wouldn't attack
Consort Wei with no reason.

36
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,240
Brother,

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,280
he was your man.

38
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,910
Why do you think he did that?

39
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,710
I failed to manage my subordinates.

40
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,360
I will investigate thoroughly

41
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,960
and give her an explanation.

42
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,960
Brother, you should avoid suspicion.

43
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,110
Father,

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,000
please allow me to investigate this.

45
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,470
I will find the link between
Shouzheng and the rogues.

46
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,030
I don't think the rogue incident
was just an accident.

47
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,080
Our enemies wanted

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,560
to incite conflicts
between the two nations.

49
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,870
Okay.

50
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,870
You will handle this matter.

51
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,910
You must find out the truth.

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

53
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,430
Ouyang Heng!

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,190
Learn from your brother.

55
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,120
You can't even manage your men.

56
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,960
How can I entrust you with the nation?

57
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,150
I'm sorry, Father.

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,710
Your Highness, well done.

59
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,310
Your Highness, I don't know
what you're talking about.

60
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,630
Aren't you afraid to lose your mother?

61
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,800
I'm afraid.

62
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,910
However, I advise you

63
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,630
to ensure my mother's safety

64
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,680
for your own sake.

65
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,600
What should we do next?

66
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,150
Don't worry.

67
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,070
The capital is under lockdown now.

68
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,360
Shouzheng's death

69
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,240
got him involved.

70
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,480
He won't act recklessly for now.

71
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,720
Tomorrow, leave the palace with the team

72
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,390
and pick up my mother.

73
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,600
Be careful alone in the palace.

74
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,190
I'll find someone
to make the antidote soon.

75
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,680
I want to see you alive.

76
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,480
When you arrive at Wei,

77
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,630
find a way to escape.

78
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,880
Please

79
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,360
take care of my mother.

80
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,830
Fifth Prince has arrived!

81
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,120
Yilan is leaving tomorrow.

82
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,270
My mother was worried about you,

83
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,070
so she sent Chuncan to serve you.

84
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,560
Chuncan.

85
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,870
I will punish you.

86
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,000
Help!

87
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,360
Thank Noble Consort.

88
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,000
Miss Yilan,

89
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,870
can you do me a favor?

90
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,950
Your Highness, go ahead.

91
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,720
A few subordinates of mine

92
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,680
are also heading to the border.

93
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,070
Could you take them along?

94
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,120
No problem.

95
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,560
Then I shall take my leave.

96
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,350
Your Highness.

97
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,600
I did some research.

98
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,560
They're all top martial artists.

99
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,040
I've never seen someone

100
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,920
trying to help so earnestly.

101
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,240
I can never repay

102
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,360
the debts I owe him.

103
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,950
Mother, I'm so sorry.

104
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,360
Please forgive me.

105
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,070
Don't you like playing with

106
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,000
that vixen's son?

107
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,230
Go ahead.

108
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,630
Should I send you to Changle Palace now?

109
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,870
I won't do it again!

110
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,720
I won't do it again!

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,120
I've told you

112
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,390
you are different from him.

113
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,750
Since childhood,
your father hasn't favored you.

114
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,390
He made you Crown Prince

115
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,630
only to appease our family.

116
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,830
But that vixen's son is different.

117
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,310
He has nothing,

118
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,430
yet your father still adores him.

119
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,460
Without the position,

120
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,600
you are nothing!

121
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,920
How dare you waste time

122
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,510
playing with him?

123
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,950
Nanny, help!

124
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,960
Help!

125
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,950
Nanny! Nanny!

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,840
Remember,

127
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,560
a ruler has no weaknesses.

128
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,680
Your love will only get them killed.

129
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,440
Mother,

130
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,120
you're wrong.

131
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,310
The Xie Family counts on me now.

132
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
A loser doesn't deserve
to be our family.

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,160
In the contest,

134
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,270
you lost to that vixen's son
in every aspect.

135
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,030
Did you see

136
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,600
how your father looked at you?

137
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,600
What a shame.

138
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,910
You're bleeding.

139
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,620
(Ten-year-old Sprout)

140
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,200
Get out!

141
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,150
But you're bleeding.

142
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,750
Don't move!

143
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,910
I said don't move.

144
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,240
Master asked me to bring you food.

145
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,750
I won't eat!

146
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,000
- You won't?
- No!

147
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,240
Get out of here!

148
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,200
You're disgusting!

149
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,870
You're eating like a dog!

150
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,320
Most people from our village
starved to death.

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,850
If you were me,

152
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,240
you'd also eat like a dog.

153
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,800
Master.

154
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,390
Yilan took the madwoman from East Lane.

155
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
According to our eye,

156
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,030
they plan to escape the city.

157
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,080
Ask my imperial guards
to block all exits.

158
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,120
Shiqi,

159
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,030
do you really think

160
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,750
everything will go smoothly?

161
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,180
According to our eye,

162
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,510
they're still in the city.

163
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,800
Why?

164
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,110
After Yilan got out,

165
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,790
she took a middle-aged woman
from East Lane.

166
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,910
Then the imperial guards
sealed all city gates.

167
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,750
Middle-aged woman?

168
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,030
She was sold to the arena

169
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,630
after getting separated from her mother.

170
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,440
She made so much effort

171
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,670
just to get a woman out of the city.

172
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,910
But the guards
work for the Crown Prince.

173
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,720
No matter what she's planning,

174
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,200
I'm afraid it's hard to succeed.

175
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,120
Are you going to
fight against the Crown Prince?

176
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,720
But I can't ignore this.

177
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,910
Noble Consort has arrived.

178
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,200
Mother.

179
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,680
Shao,

180
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,030
Changle Palace will host
the Spring Banquet soon.

181
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,550
I've invited
all the noblewomen in the capital.

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,150
Your father wants you

183
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,080
to select a woman

184
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
and marry her.

185
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,440
- Mother...
- You don't have a choice.

186
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,670
I like Wang Jiarou,
the Grand Marshal's daughter.
