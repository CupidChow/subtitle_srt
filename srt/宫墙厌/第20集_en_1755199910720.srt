=Episode 18=

3
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,820
(Five Days Before the Wei Envoy Arrives)

4
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,680
Great!

5
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,940
(Spoiled by the Fierce Assassin Princess)

6
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,400
Your Highness, what brings you here?

7
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,790
I've prepared a gift for you.

8
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,120
Your Highness!

9
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,320
Your Highness!

10
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,430
Your Highness!

11
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,680
Your Highness,
please don't harm yourself!

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,310
Stop cutting your hand, or it'll be ruined!

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,960
No.

14
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,350
I must tell His Highness.

15
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,480
Don't!

16
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,840
I can't drag his feet again!

17
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,430
Don't go...

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,040
Your Highness, Your Highness...

19
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,070
Your Highness,

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,320
don't worry,

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,950
I won't let anything happen to you.

22
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,430
You've promised me.

23
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,950
You must keep your word.

24
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,990
Don't worry,

25
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,840
I'll definitely get the antidote

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,350
for you.

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Di Shiqi...

28
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,120
No one should sacrifice
themselves for me.

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,520
Since my fate is sealed,

30
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,430
I shall give it all I've got.

31
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,360
Let's see who'll have the last laugh.

32
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,120
This audacious rascal

33
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,710
used your power

34
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,240
to insult me.

35
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,120
I've eliminated this traitor for you.

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,750
You won't blame me, right?

37
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,080
How dare he covet you?

38
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,120
Go,

39
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,910
feed this traitor's head to the dogs.

40
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,190
Your Highness, you've made

41
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,400
a lot of effort for me.

42
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,030
How should I repay you?

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,590
Without your protection,

44
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,080
I was even bullied
by such a humble guard.

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,360
I beg you to take me back.

46
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,710
I suffer from
the Ink Poison every night.

47
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,870
It's been

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,910
so painful.

49
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,710
The Wei envoy will visit soon,

50
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,310
and I'll be doomed.

51
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,360
I've realized my mistake.

52
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,310
Master, please forgive me.

53
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,080
My shoes are dirty.

54
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,750
The way you lower your head
is beautiful.

55
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,080
Unfortunately,

56
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,750
it's all false.

57
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,910
I can still see the unextinguished

58
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,240
spark of defiance in your eyes.

59
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,720
What should I do

60
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,560
to gain your trust?

61
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,920
Just tell me,

62
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,870
and I'll do anything for you, Master.

63
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,600
I only hope

64
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,430
you can spare my life.

65
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,000
What if I ask you to kill Ouyang Shao?

66
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,800
Will you do it?

67
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,320
Can't bear it?

68
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,120
Nothing is more important than my life.

69
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,080
Your Highness,

70
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,750
I found the key ingredient.

71
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,950
Have you finished it?

72
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,920
Okay, let me try it.

73
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,270
Your Highness, this time is different.

74
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,560
The last ingredient is poison.

75
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,120
Fight poison with poison. It might work.

76
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,430
Your Highness, your body

77
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,040
is very weak

78
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,070
and damaged inside

79
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,720
after all these tests.

80
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,070
You might not

81
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,470
make it through

82
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,070
this time.

83
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,240
Your Highness, you can't do it!

84
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,680
We've come this far.

85
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,480
There's no turning back.

86
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,160
Give it to me.

87
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,950
(Sprout, wait for me.)

88
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,240
(Once the antidote is made,)

89
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,830
(you will be free.)

90
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,350
- Oh!
- Your Highness!

91
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,910
Your Highness!

92
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,560
Your Majesty,

93
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,070
the Wei people worship Buddha,

94
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,120
so visiting Huafu Temple in the palace

95
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,000
is a key part of this visit.

96
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,430
Perhaps I can

97
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,920
arrange Huafu Temple

98
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,600
to better welcome the envoy.

99
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,600
Huafu Temple is where the royal family

100
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,070
worships and prays.

101
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,560
You're a woman.

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,430
You'll dishonor our ancestors

103
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,800
and bring bad luck.

104
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,870
Ministry of Rites has many talents.

105
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,160
I don't need to do it myself.

106
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,190
I just want to see the layout

107
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,430
and provide some suggestions

108
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,510
based on Wei customs.

109
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,630
Okay, you can do it.

110
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,230
But remember,

111
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,120
you must not go inside.

112
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,400
Aye.

113
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,000
Your Highness,

114
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,360
the stage is ready.

115
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,510
Don't let me down.

116
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,880
Your Highness,

117
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,040
it's late.

118
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,870
Let's go back to rest.

119
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,240
I'm not tired at all tonight.

120
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,440
Your Highness.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,270
Pardon me,

122
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,000
do you have to do this?

123
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,800
The Fifth Prince is a soaring eagle,

124
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,160
but I'm a caged sparrow.

125
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,070
I can't drag him down anymore.

126
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,630
The Crown Prince won't truly cure me.

127
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,430
Instead of always being

128
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,310
someone else's pawn,

129
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,360
I'd rather control my own life.

130
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,070
But Your Highness...

131
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,000
The Crown Prince wants you
to kill the Fifth Prince.

132
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,000
From the start, I knew

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,830
he wouldn't trust my loyalty.

134
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,480
He needs a scapegoat
to kill Ouyang Shao.

135
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,630
Therefore,

136
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,630
he'll send people to capture me.

137
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,800
He won't miss this chance
to kill two birds with one stone.

138
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,920
In that case,

139
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,160
I must use this opportunity

140
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,950
to reveal the Shadow Palace.

141
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,870
But you and the Fifth Prince...

142
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,470
Don't worry.

143
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,800
I'm already dying.

144
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,760
But he

145
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,430
will live with blessings.

146
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,750
Sorry.

147
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,080
Your Highness.

148
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,590
You're finally awake.

149
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,480
The... antidote.

150
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,920
It worked.

151
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Your poison has been cured.

152
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,240
You coughed blood
because you tried so many drugs

153
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,200
that you got weak.

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,360
The nanny is preparing the medicine.

155
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,320
It'll be ready soon.

156
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,280
Okay.

157
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,590
That's amazing.

158
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,590
By the way,

159
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,750
Chuncan just came.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,630
Consort Wei wants to meet you

161
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,150
at Huafu Temple late afternoon.

162
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,750
(Sprout, wait for me.)

163
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,100
(Four Days Before the Envoy Arrives)

164
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,720
It's said that Buddha saves

165
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,150
all sentient beings,
yet not the miserable ones.

166
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,750
Consort Wei.

167
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,630
The officials have left.

168
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,200
Why are you still here?

169
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
Do I have to tell you

170
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,080
where I'm heading?

171
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,040
No need.

172
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,200
However, although you're a consort,

173
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,870
you're still a woman.

174
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,000
You mustn't enter the Buddha hall.

175
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,280
Get lost.

176
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,630
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

177
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Ridiculous.

178
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,270
Do you want to go in?

179
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,710
See?

180
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,480
God didn't punish us.

181
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,080
The light of heaven
shines equally upon every soul.

182
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,670
It was those in power

183
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,670
that decreed that women

184
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,960
shall remain in the darkness.

185
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,350
I know.

186
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,600
You want to burn incense

187
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,990
for your mother,

188
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,720
Yilan, and your sisters.

189
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,790
What's wrong, Sprout?

190
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,630
They say you can't lie
in front of Buddha.

191
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,390
I want to

192
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,360
be honest with you this time.

193
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,000
That night,

194
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,150
you asked me to escape with you.

195
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,630
You have no idea

196
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,080
how much I wanted

197
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,480
to give up everything and go with you.

198
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,510
As long as I'm with you...

199
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,750
I can go anywhere.

200
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,320
But I just can't...

201
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,670
I must go back
to beg the Crown Prince...

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,120
just to be alive.

203
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,960
I understand.

204
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,120
I understand, Sprout.

205
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,480
No, you don't.

206
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,030
He ordered me to...

207
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,320
kill you.

208
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,870
Sprout,

209
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,750
don't worry.

210
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,150
I won't let anyone harm you.

211
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,110
Actually,

212
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,960
we still have other choices.

213
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,360
This is my choice.
