3
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,710
I don't want to do it.

4
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,920
If I sleep with the emperor,

5
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,790
will that person dislike me?

6
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,280
I'm not the person you like.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,310
I don't know about him.

8
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,640
What if I say you're the person?

9
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,120
(So, this is your acting.)

10
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,950
I like you too, Your Highness.

11
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,310
If you want to

12
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,840
be with me,

13
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,070
I'll eliminate all obstacles and worries

14
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,000
for you.

15
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,640
Your Highness, it seems you're drunk.

16
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,790
You're speaking nonsense now.

17
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,320
The wine is too strong.

18
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,510
You should take care of your body.

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,960
Don't drink too much.

20
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,290
This...

21
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,190
Just that?

22
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,630
It's been five days.

23
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,590
Why hasn't the Fifth Prince
taken action?

24
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,120
Was the confession okay that day?

25
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,310
I fell in love with someone.

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,550
Who?

27
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,800
He's got a pretty face,

28
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,800
good handwriting,

29
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,590
and he often helps me.

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,150
I like you too, Your Highness.

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,120
If you want to be with me,

32
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,960
I'll eliminate all obstacles and worries

33
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,310
for you.

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,960
I'm not sure.

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,400
Your Highness.

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,680
The emperor's servant

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,870
is waiting at the door
of Changle Palace.

38
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,030
Please come.

39
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,270
Your Highness,

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,470
the imperial guards are all our men now.

41
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,000
When the emperor dies,

42
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,520
they will control the city immediately.

43
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,590
Your Highness, don't be nervous.

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,280
Follow the noble consort's guidance,

45
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,310
and you'll win His Majesty's heart.

46
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,280
Consort Wei and Yilan

47
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,080
are supposed to be imprisoned.

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,960
You haven't decided how to kill them.

49
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,150
Order Consort Wei to hang herself.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yilan shall die with her.

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,000
But there's only one fake death pill.

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,120
Who should use it?

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,800
Wise choice.

54
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,750
Father,

55
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,150
I

56
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,840
will rule Qi well.

57
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

58
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,920
Don't be polite.

59
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,870
Thanks, Your Majesty.

60
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,920
It's been a few days,

61
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,160
and you've become much skinnier.

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,950
If you like it,

63
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,040
I will do my best.

64
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,670
Come here.

65
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,830
After learning Qi's etiquette,

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,480
you're much more obedient now.

67
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,910
Your Highness!

68
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,880
What's wrong?

69
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,200
Your Highness!

70
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Someone, help! Help!

71
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,520
Father!

72
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,720
- How's Father?
- How's Father?

73
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,720
Your Highness, rest assured.

74
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,600
His Majesty's paralysis
is due to overwork.

75
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,630
I will prescribe some
revitalizing medicine.

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,430
He'll recover in a few months.

77
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,390
However, to ensure the effect,

78
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,950
intercourse must be avoided.

79
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,270
Changle Palace is quite far
from Father's chamber,

80
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,120
but you got the news

81
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,390
earlier than I did.

82
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,310
I always pay attention
to Father's health,

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,480
so I got the news earlier.

84
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,800
Unlike you, brother.

85
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,070
You're always too busy

86
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,480
to care about Father.

87
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,630
Well,

88
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,590
brother,

89
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,870
Father is still fine.

90
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,000
You must be disappointed.

91
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,430
Shao, how dare you?

92
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,310
Stop arguing.

93
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,160
I'm not dead!

94
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,270
Get out!

95
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,240
His Majesty needs to rest.

96
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,870
Your Highness, please leave.

97
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,820
(Changle Palace's Chamber)

98
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,000
My mother isn't here.

99
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,950
She'll be here in a moment.

100
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,430
She asked you over

101
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,870
perhaps because she wanted to talk about

102
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,070
last night's incident.

103
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,630
Your Highness,
you must've been freaked out.

104
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,390
I knew you didn't want to sleep

105
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,110
with my father.

106
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,240
I couldn't think of another way

107
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,800
but harm my father.

108
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,320
Is my willingness

109
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,960
worth such a risk?

110
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,080
If this can ease your worries,

111
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,680
it'll be worth it.

112
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,750
I made the decision on my own.

113
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,550
Don't blame yourself.

114
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,030
Noble Consort has arrived.

115
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,910
Greetings, Your Highness.

116
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,710
Mother.

117
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,120
His Majesty has been unwell lately,

118
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,440
so they might gossip about it.

119
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,840
You can stay in the Changle Palace.

120
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,510
If anyone disrespects you,

121
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,960
just tell me.

122
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

123
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,440
Ouyang Shao.

124
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,080
Follow me.

125
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,320
Your Highness, wait a minute.

126
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,910
Ouyang Shao.

127
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,480
Look at you.

128
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,480
You're always by your father's side.

129
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,000
How can you be so careless?

130
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,870
How could you not notice

131
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,750
he fell ill?

132
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
Listen,

133
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,320
your father is getting old.

134
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,630
If the crown prince takes the throne,

135
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,390
he won't go easy on us.

136
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,080
Perhaps,

137
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,600
we'll have to count on Consort Wei.

138
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,320
Stop laughing!

139
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,000
Do you understand?

140
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,480
Yes, Mother.

141
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,480
How did I raise such a fool?

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,840
Mother!

143
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,600
Your Highness, Your Highness!

144
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,990
Your Highness!

145
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,200
Your Highness!

146
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,390
Your Highness!

147
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,440
Your Highness!

148
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,920
Your Highness,

149
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,120
I asked her

150
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,120
what caused my father's illness,

151
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,200
but she wouldn't tell me.

152
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,270
I had no choice but to invite you here

153
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,960
to force her to speak.

154
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,230
Your Highness!

155
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,600
Master, please spare me!

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,840
I'll tell you!

157
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,960
I'll tell you!

158
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,720
It's the Fifth Prince.

159
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,480
He likes Her Highness
and doesn't want her

160
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,150
to sleep with the emperor.

161
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,390
He likes her?
