3
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,030
Shouldn't he be thinking about
how to deal with us?

4
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,960
Who's worth all the effort?

5
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,430
Could it be...

6
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,760
Have you thought of something?

7
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,680
Nothing.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,280
Just some unrealistic fantasies.

9
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,600
You may leave now.

10
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,950
I want to be alone.

11
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,870
Aye.

12
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,680
Promise me.

13
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,200
If that day really comes,

14
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,510
please bury my name

15
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,560
here as well.

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,430
Di Shiqi might be here,

17
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,840
but Sprout

18
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,870
never will.

19
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,870
I don't know

20
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,360
how you ended up here,

21
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,320
but don't worry,

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,160
I'll find your mother,

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,360
rescue your sisters,

24
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,550
and

25
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,230
get your revenge.

26
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,600
(Why is the soil so loose?)

27
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,860
(Di Shiqi)

28
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,390
Sprout,

29
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,160
are you still alive?

30
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,340
(Qi-Wei Border Post)

31
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,550
Your Highness,

32
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,630
the gifts we received

33
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,950
are three times the reported amount,

34
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,110
and the number of soldiers has doubled.

35
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,830
Why did Wei decide
to send more gifts for no reason?

36
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,680
The Wei envoy said he'd come

37
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,600
and explain it.

38
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,440
He should be here soon.

39
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,110
The Wei envoy has arrived.

40
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,080
I'm Sai Qi, the envoy of Wei.

41
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,920
Hello, Envoy Sai.

42
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,040
Please rise.

43
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

44
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,390
Envoy Sai,

45
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,830
you initially planned twenty carriages.

46
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,710
Now there are sixty or seventy.

47
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,880
Why is this?

48
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,950
Your Highness,

49
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,640
our king hadn't received the letter,

50
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,590
so the quantity was

51
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,080
decided by Prime Minister Li.

52
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,870
Our king learned about Abi Ya's crime

53
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,950
and felt sorry,

54
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,270
so he decided to prepare this
with utmost respect.

55
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,230
Hope you can accept them.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,990
He's so generous.

57
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,040
Thank the King of Wei.

58
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,670
However, it differs
from the reported number.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,200
I should send a letter to my father.

60
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,160
Of course.

61
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,150
We'll wait at the post station.

62
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,640
There's one more thing.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,920
Please go ahead.

64
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,360
During this period,

65
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,590
can the Wei Army retreat 20 miles?

66
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,000
Your Highness, is this necessary?

67
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,560
In peacetime, unless permitted,

68
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,240
armies must keep a 20-mile distance.

69
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,800
I'm sure you also know this.

70
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,320
I haven't received my father's order,

71
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,910
yet you're so close.

72
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,910
Are you planning to declare a war?

73
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,600
I wouldn't dare.

74
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,950
I'll order them

75
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,030
to withdraw.

76
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,270
Thank you, Envoy Sai.

77
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,270
Who?

78
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,030
Your Highness, I'm Sai Qi.

79
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,200
If there's anything, come tomorrow.

80
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,040
Your Highness,

81
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,190
I'm here

82
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,640
to tell you

83
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,120
that our army

84
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,950
has retreated to Qingfeng Mountain.

85
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,910
Besides, I have my own reason.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,640
I hope you can like me.

87
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,640
Envoy Sai, please behave yourself.

88
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,040
Your Highness.

89
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,480
Your Highness,

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,590
I want no title.

91
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,390
I just hope

92
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,560
if I make you happy,

93
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,830
you can be closer to Wei.

94
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,510
Envoy Sai, please don't.

95
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,710
I've already fallen for someone.

96
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,510
Besides, the peace between Qi and Wei
are not up to us.

97
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,510
In a world dominated by men,

98
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,880
you've become

99
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,160
the envoy of Wei,

100
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,800
which means you're exceptional.

101
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,200
If you're smart,

102
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,120
why not focus on state affairs?

103
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,950
Prosperity brings peace.

104
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,350
The incense...

105
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,320
What's wrong, Your Highness?

106
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,030
Why are you...

107
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,440
Are you into me?

108
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,440
You're from the Shadow Palace.

109
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,830
What are you talking about?

110
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,440
I don't understand.

111
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,190
Sprout...

112
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,350
Tian Shi'er.

113
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,990
Long time no see.

114
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,440
Di Shiqi,

115
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,120
I knew you were alive.

116
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,200
You finally escaped
from this living hell.

117
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,470
Why come back?

118
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,190
Wait for someone.

119
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,390
Could it be

120
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,120
for this man?

121
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,190
No.

122
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,080
Forget it.

123
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,430
Save your little secret

124
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,000
for the master.

125
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,320
Just wait here.

126
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,950
After I finish him,

127
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,680
I'll take you to Master.

128
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,600
Tell me,

129
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
why do we risk our lives

130
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,390
for our master?

131
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,710
It's because we want to

132
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,440
cure the Ink Poison

133
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,120
and leave, isn't it?

134
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,240
Is this the antidote?

135
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,400
Let us go.

136
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,510
Otherwise, I'll destroy it.

137
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,270
This can ease the Ink Poison.

138
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,680
No wonder Master adores you.

139
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,120
Sprout!

140
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,240
Stay back!

141
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,200
If you come closer,

142
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,520
you'll never see me again.

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,480
No matter what you're doing,

144
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,870
tell me, and I'll help you.

145
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,400
Please.

146
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,710
Please let me see you one more time.

147
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,350
So,

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,400
you're not Princess Abi Ya

149
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,470
but the Shadow Palace's
17th Di Assassin.

150
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,280
Yes.

151
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,750
Great.

152
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,230
Ouyang Heng,
the master of the Shadow Palace.

153
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,470
Your Majesty,

154
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,160
I'm willing to be your sword

155
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,560
to eliminate the Shadow Palace.

156
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,470
You're dying.

157
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,230
How can you defeat them?

158
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,830
Please fake my death
so that I can get out.

159
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,630
Why should I trust a humble servant?

160
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,160
If I fail,

161
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,950
you may take my life.

162
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,230
Even if you don't,

163
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,830
the Crown Prince will not spare me.

164
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,400
You overestimated your worth.

165
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,790
Your Majesty,

166
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,520
I was brought up by the late queen,

167
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,680
so I know how the Xie Family
controls the court.

168
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,190
Vixen!

169
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,200
How dare you talk about politics?

170
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,400
Your Majesty.

171
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,920
I've been working for the Shadow Palace.

172
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,950
I know the entanglements of the Crown Prince,

173
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,920
the Guardian Duke,
and Prime Minister Li.

174
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,680
This might be risky,
but we'll catch them off guard.

175
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,680
Perhaps I can help you

176
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,270
eliminate some

177
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,350
unwanted forces in the court.

178
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,950
Okay.

179
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,200
I grant you a fake death.

180
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,870
But after you leave,

181
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,990
you must kill the Guardian Duke.

182
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,800
If you fail,

183
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,240
you must finish yourself

184
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,040
and frame everything
on the Crown Prince.

185
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,160
Otherwise,

186
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,750
not just you,

187
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,830
everyone involved in this

188
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,560
must die.

189
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,880
I understand.

190
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,110
I'd never get others involved.

191
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,040
Sprout!

192
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,360
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,880
- Yuan!
- Your Highness!

194
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,280
- Yuan!
- Your Highness!

195
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,470
Your Highness, are you alright?

196
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,160
I'm fine.

197
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,280
Why are you here?

198
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,240
His Majesty received your letter

199
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,800
and asked my father to send me here.

200
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,440
However, the Guardian Duke
told His Majesty

201
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,030
this was a crucial diplomatic matter,

202
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,160
and he must come in person.

203
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,520
I knew he was up to no good,

204
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,350
so I followed along.

205
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,320
Oh, I see.

206
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,710
No wonder the Guardian Duke came.

207
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,160
I know how to help you.

208
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,590
What's wrong?

209
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,960
Nothing.

210
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,870
Someone from the Shadow Palace
tried to attack me.

211
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,200
But I know what to do now.

212
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,350
Let's get changed.

213
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,990
Sir, your tea is ready.

214
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh, no.

215
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,040
It's a trap.

216
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,440
Consort Wei, long time no see.

217
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,680
Take her dagger away,

218
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,200
or she'll hurt herself.

219
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,630
What magic do you have?

220
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,710
Why did His Majesty
help you fake your death?

221
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,560
Why is the Crown Prince
so obsessed with you?

222
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,470
Never mind.

223
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,440
I'll send you back to the Crown Prince.

224
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,630
Guardian Duke,

225
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,230
you seem quite disappointed

226
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,870
to see me alive.

227
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,710
Your Highness,

228
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,830
I'm surprised that you showed up

229
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,830
with this assassin.

230
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,870
I've heard rumors
about you and Consort Wei,

231
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,990
and they turned out to be true.

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,480
- Guardian Duke.
- Your Highness,

233
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,230
I wish I could keep the secret.

234
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,040
However,
I'm His Majesty's loyal servant.

235
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,040
I have to report
your conspiracy with Consort Wei

236
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,800
to His Majesty.

237
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,040
Guardian Duke and his guards
were attacked by the Shadow Palace

238
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,350
and died immediately.

239
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,160
Your Highness,

240
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,520
we're surrounded by Guardian Duke's men.

241
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,750
They look like the Wei Army.

242
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,750
He really betrayed our country.

243
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,350
Luckily, I have a plan.

244
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,190
