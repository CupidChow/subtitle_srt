00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,340
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,080
In that case,

4
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,120
Crown Prince,

5
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,150
let's investigate it respectively.

6
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,480
No winner or loser, only right or wrong.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,480
Shao, that's exactly what I want.

8
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,620
(Shadow Palace)

9
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,000
It's the first time you've seen my face.

10
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,150
Aren't you surprised?

11
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,520
Drink it.

12
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,350
Master, you once said

13
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,920
Shadow Assassins

14
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,310
should be cold and heartless.

15
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,560
But you've done many unnecessary things.

16
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,000
You killed Li Changshun.

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,070
Do you want to ruin my plan?

18
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,440
Mercy, Master!

19
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,790
I just wanted to steal the papers

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,040
to serve in bed soon.

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,400
Don't kneel!

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,750
Forget those lowly instincts.

23
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,280
I want you to play a princess,

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,800
so do it well.

25
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,910
A killer

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,400
can never become

27
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
a real princess.

28
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,520
Do you have to be a despicable assassin

29
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,400
instead of a noble lady?

30
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm useless.

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,360
The lowliness can't be erased.

32
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,750
Look,

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,310
the old scars on your skin

34
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,870
are almost gone due to the Ink Poison.

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,240
But you can't change your lowly nature!

36
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,430
Shut up!

37
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,080
I'm your father's consort.

38
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,270
Forgive me.

39
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,710
I was so rude.

40
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,190
No wonder Shao cares about you so much.

41
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,710
As for the arson case,

42
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,190
I'll handle it for you.

43
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,840
Today at noon,

44
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,080
no matter where you are,

45
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,960
no matter who's with you,

46
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,240
remember,

47
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,750
the broken cup is the signal.

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,560
Kill the person who breaks the cup.

49
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,800
I'll help you through this ordeal.

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,640
I got it.

51
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,750
(The woman I like)

52
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,240
(must be one of a kind.)

53
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,020
(Yuheng Pavilion)

54
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,400
Your Highness,

55
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,840
when you went to see Master,

56
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,910
the whole palace was looking for
the man in black.

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Do you think the Fifth Prince knows

58
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,520
that you did this?

59
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,910
I've humiliated him in public.

60
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,800
He'll stop investigating me, right?

61
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,400
You don't know men.

62
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,030
Your slap

63
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,750
might arouse the interest

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,040
of a nobleman.

65
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,030
Ming'en,

66
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,680
tonight, after Her Highness goes back,

67
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,000
you'll disguise as
a man in black to cause a scene

68
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
and clear her name.

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,160
Use your lightness skill.
Don't be caught.

70
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,430
The crown prince loves probing.

71
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,430
Let's give him a mystery to solve.

72
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,760
Aye.

73
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,600
If this murder

74
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,560
hinders Master's plan
to kill the emperor,

75
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,070
we'll both die in the palace.

76
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,800
Don't worry.

77
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,510
Master said he'd help us.

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
How?

79
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,190
The broken cup is the signal.

80
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,270
Kill the cup breaker.

81
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,070
Who does he want to kill?

82
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,240
Princess Chenxi has arrived!

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,160
Greetings, Your Highness.

84
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,310
She was adopted by the noble consort.

85
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,860
Mother asked me to invite you

86
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,190
to have lunch with us.

87
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,200
Noble Consort?

88
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,190
As a newcomer, you're so unlucky.

89
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,120
So many terrible things have happened.

90
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,560
You've suffered a lot.

91
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,430
I asked them to prepare
some Wei cuisines.

92
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,310
Hope it brings you comfort.

93
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,630
Thank you, Your Highness.

94
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,600
(Who else is coming?)

95
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,590
Mother,

96
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,390
good afternoon.

97
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,950
Shao, come here.

98
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,430
Have a drink with me.

99
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,750
Greetings, Your Highness.

100
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,040
No matter where you are,

101
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,800
no matter who's with you,

102
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,630
the broken cup is the signal.

103
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,160
Kill the person who breaks the cup.

104
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Your Highness, sorry! I made a mistake!

105
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,190
It's okay. Just clean it up.

106
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,440
Aye.

107
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,160
Mother!

108
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,670
Assassin!

109
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,480
Master?

110
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,830
Yue'an, you've served me
for eight years.

111
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,390
Why do you want to kill me?

112
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,360
You sent me to the Ladies' Court

113
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,190
to learn etiquette from Li Changshun.

114
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,190
I killed that monster.

115
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,640
I...

116
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,070
I wish I could kill you too...

117
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,960
Check on her!

118
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,120
If it weren't for her,

119
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,560
I would've been dead!

120
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,110
Your Highness.

121
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,430
I'm fine.

122
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,360
Just a bit shocked.

123
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,670
Master,

124
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,390
why is my blade always

125
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,600
a bit slower than yours?

126
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,200
Because your blade isn't meant to kill.

127
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,480
I'm the one
who's completed the most missions.

128
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,670
(Di Shisan, Assassin)
You never harm the innocent.

129
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,720
You hesitate when wielding the blade,

130
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,080
instinctively judging
if they deserve to die.

131
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,750
If you think too much,

132
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,440
you'll be slow.

133
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,040
Shiqi,

134
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,390
in the Shadow Palace,

135
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,630
if you get soft-hearted, you'll die.

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,240
Di Shisan volunteered.

137
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,200
You have similar figures and skills.

138
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,670
We have to make her the murderer

139
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,150
to clear His Majesty's doubts.

140
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,790
Besides, by doing so,

141
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,000
you can gain the noble consort's trust.

142
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,390
Don't be upset.

143
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,750
I'm just thinking

144
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,480
Shisan has completed her mission,

145
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,750
but she still couldn't survive.

146
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,150
We've tried so hard
to complete our missions.

147
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,720
But in the end,

148
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,960
can we really get what we want?

149
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,550
The Fifth Prince has arrived!

150
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,510
Your Highness, this is for you.

151
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,120
Thank you for saving my mother.

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,030
Thank you, Princess Chenxi.

153
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,270
Chenxi, go out and play
with Yilan, okay?

154
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,150
I need to talk to Consort Wei.

155
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,280
The case is closed.

156
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,670
You're innocent.

157
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,160
It's worth celebrating.

158
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,960
Indeed.

159
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm really happy.

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,320
Your Highness, there seem to be

161
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,440
tears in your eyes.

162
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,390
I rarely smile.

163
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,000
Eventually, I forgot how to smile.

164
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,360
Actually, you should smile more often.

165
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,000
The weather is lovely today.

166
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,270
The flowers are beautiful.

167
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,510
Look at the fish,

168
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,750
it's full of energy.

169
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,200
They're worth a smile.

170
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,910
I'm trapped in this tiny place,
struggling every day.

171
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,440
Should I feel happy about it?

172
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,550
Even in this prison,

173
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,270
there's still a ray of hope.

174
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,120
Your Highness, please follow me.

175
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,150
Look, it's free now.

176
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,600
Someone's here to free you.

177
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,320
You're free now.

178
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,600
(Ouyang Shao...)

179
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,030
(Could it be him?)

180
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,390
See?

181
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,200
Freedom comes with a price.
