3
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,630
Your Highness!

4
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,040
Fifth Prince.

5
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,350
It's okay.

6
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,430
I have to make it clear.

7
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,840
Mother asked me to give you this.

8
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,790
Yilan,

9
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,950
leave us alone.

10
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,630
Aye.

11
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:39,860
Come with me.

12
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,710
Aye.

13
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,480
Thank your mother.

14
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,800
Your Highness, anything else?

15
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,550
Why?

16
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,430
Why did you choose Father?

17
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,590
- What about me...
- Ouyang Shao.

18
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,680
Kiss me.

19
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,120
What?

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,710
Kiss me.

21
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,750
Your Highness, I...

22
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,470
Are you happy now?

23
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,190
Stop dreaming.

24
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,710
Your father is waiting for me.

25
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,840
Please go back.

26
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,320
Don't worry.

27
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,720
When combined with strong wine, this drug

28
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,480
can make one turned on

29
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,800
and unconscious.

30
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,800
From now on, the emperor

31
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,000
will be obsessed with you.

32
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,950
I didn't know the Shadow Palace
had such a powerful drug.

33
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,980
(Punishment Room)

34
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,040
The former master left this.

35
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,950
He used it to feed breeding male animals.

36
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,160
The new master prefers killing,

37
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,630
so he hasn't used it.

38
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,830
Well, it's really useful this time.

39
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm worried that the Fifth Prince
might get angry.

40
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,950
Should we also use this...

41
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,230
No need.

42
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,680
He grew up under the sunlight,

43
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,430
pure as an angel.

44
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,560
These dirty tricks

45
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,000
shouldn't be used on him.

46
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,430
Fate is so complicated.

47
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,310
He's a popular nobleman

48
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,480
living under the sunlight,

49
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,430
while we're like nasty rats

50
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,160
living in dark sewers all our lives.

51
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,870
Then I'll tear a rift in the sky

52
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,600
to let the light in.

53
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,950
Darling.

54
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,240
Darling!

55
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,830
Your Majesty,

56
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,870
just sleep and be quiet.

57
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,000
Be good.

58
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,150
Master,

59
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,160
the show is about to begin.

60
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,230
Your Highness.

61
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,270
Have you found anything

62
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,000
about the willow blade?

63
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,680
The blade Consort Wei used to kill

64
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,160
Li Changshun is forged from diamond,

65
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,560
which is rare and precious.

66
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,950
I've found out that

67
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,750
the diamond mine, though appearing

68
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,480
to have another owner,

69
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,470
is actually owned by

70
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,310
the Guardian Duke and the Crown Prince.

71
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,200
Father,

72
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,720
I want to investigate this.

73
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,930
Greetings, brother.

74
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,950
Who informed the Crown Prince?

75
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,870
Once we find out the origin
of the blade,

76
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,000
everything will be clear.

77
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,960
Brother,

78
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,070
it turns out you're the master.

79
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,160
Here's my order.

80
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,750
Search the palace and the city.

81
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,430
I will eliminate

82
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,630
all his forces.

83
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,030
Aye.

84
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,110
Your Majesty.

85
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,480
Don't let people see this.

86
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,190
It's against Qi's rules.

87
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,440
Rules?

88
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,480
I make the rules.

89
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,480
Your Majesty,

90
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,390
I'm already grateful

91
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,000
that you allow me, a lowly woman,

92
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,670
to accompany you in the study.

93
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,600
But now there are rumors.

94
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm not afraid,

95
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,750
but I don't want them to criticize you.

96
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,360
Who dares to criticize me?

97
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,550
Did someone bully you?

98
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Just tell me,

99
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,360
and I'll support you.

100
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,230
Your Majesty,

101
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,120
with your promise,

102
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,000
I can die without regret.

103
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,080
If you don't want to say,

104
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,200
I won't force you.

105
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,630
As for those servants in the palace,

106
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,390
if they dare disrespect you,

107
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,720
just punish them.
You don't need to put up with it.

108
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,030
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.

109
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,550
I have a humble request.

110
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,390
I don't know if I should say this.

111
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,550
Just tell me.

112
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,240
I've been in Qi for some time.

113
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,360
My mother isn't favored
by the King of Wei

114
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,910
and is having a hard time.

115
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,390
I want

116
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,670
to ask Yilan to send

117
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,600
some gifts to Wei.

118
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,800
Good.

119
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,000
I asked you to learn etiquette,

120
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,120
and it really worked.

121
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm glad

122
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,840
that you're so filial.

123
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,620
Look,

124
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,720
go back and prepare the gifts.

125
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,550
Tomorrow, our diplomatic corps
will escort her.

126
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,840
Thank you, Your Majesty!

127
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,440
When I'm with you,

128
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,030
I feel much younger.

129
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,080
Of course he feels young.

130
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,030
The emperor is over 40 years old,

131
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,870
and he dreams about

132
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,320
being strong and capable every night

133
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,550
without realizing it.

134
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,630
He thought you revived his spirit.

135
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,790
No wonder

136
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,510
he cherishes you dearly now.

137
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,870
Everyone in the palace is saying
that the emperor adores you.

138
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,200
I'm afraid our master has found out.

139
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,910
What should we do?

140
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,240
He should

141
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,840
be the one worrying about it.

142
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,630
Yilan,

143
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,750
a team will escort you tomorrow morning.

144
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,750
You must remember

145
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,080
to pick up my mother at
Guaizao Alley, North Lane of the Capital

146
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,390
and leave with her.

147
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
What if our group stops me?

148
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,550
Master won't act rashly tomorrow.

149
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,270
Master wants to see you.

150
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,960
Then let him come and see me.

151
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,270
How dare you?

152
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,790
Do you think you can disrespect Master

153
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,870
just because the emperor adores you?

154
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,350
Yilan.

155
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,840
Aye.

156
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,200
This rude servant

157
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,440
insulted me.

158
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,480
Hit his mouth.

159
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,110
You...

160
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,670
How dare you hit me?

161
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,270
Why wouldn't I?

162
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,120
You're always bullying us

163
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,320
and treating us like animals.

164
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,910
You should be punished!

165
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,390
Not just the group's rules,

166
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,270
even in the palace,

167
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,360
I'm the Crown Prince's guard.

168
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,630
How dare you?

169
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,030
His Majesty decreed

170
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,440
that in the Changle Palace,

171
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,440
I can punish the servants as I please.

172
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,590
Yilan,

173
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,840
go ahead.

174
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,550
Remember,

175
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,440
don't try to scare me
with the Crown Prince.

176
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,790
Even if you work for god,

177
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,550
I'll still punish you.

178
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,000
Di Shiqi, are you...

179
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,240
Don't you dare question Master's orders!

180
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,150
