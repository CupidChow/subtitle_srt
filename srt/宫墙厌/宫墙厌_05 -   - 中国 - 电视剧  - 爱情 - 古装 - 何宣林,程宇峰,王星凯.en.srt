00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,340
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,710
Shut up!

4
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,960
Mercy, Your Highness.

5
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,200
I was so rude.

6
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,400
Master,

7
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,000
so you have a weak spot too.

8
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,180
(Yuheng Pavilion)

9
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,200
Later today,

10
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,430
Ming'en, the Fifth Prince's bodyguard,

11
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,560
came to ask about your hobbies.

12
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,040
Do you think

13
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,590
he's suspected you
because you've been close

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,480
to the Fifth Prince?

15
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,430
Impossible.

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,790
If you want to catch your prey,
you won't do it

17
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,680
blatantly.

18
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,510
Then the Fifth Prince must like you.

19
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,150
I've never experienced this before.

20
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,840
When Master sets me free

21
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,430
after the mission is over,

22
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,510
I'll travel around to see

23
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,120
what the world is really like.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,280
What if our master

25
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,430
is the Crown Prince?

26
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,590
When this is over,

27
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,190
he'll take over the throne,

28
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,240
and we'll be the blemishes

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,710
he must erase.

30
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
If we fail,

31
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,240
he won't spare us either.

32
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,470
No.

33
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,630
Not just us.

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,800
Everyone involved in this mission

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,240
will die.

36
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,840
We must survive.

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,240
We must give it all we've got.

38
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,870
We must take control of our own destiny.

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,640
Yes.

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,400
Destiny is in our own hands.

41
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,030
Your Highness,

42
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,560
Eunuch Jiu, His Majesty's servant,

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
is here to announce
something about Princess Abi Ya.

44
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
Your Highness.

45
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,360
This is Eunuch Jiu,
His Majesty's servant.

46
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
Do you recognize him?

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,960
(Tian Jiu?)

48
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,310
But Eunuch Jiu just told me something

49
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,870
about your past.

50
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,190
Di Shiqi, now that you're Consort Wei,

51
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,280
can't you even recognize your guide?

52
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,800
Di Shiqi?

53
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,630
I don't know what he's talking about.

54
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,630
Let me explain this.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,750
Di Shiqi is the 17th assassin
of the Shadow Palace.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
Assassin?

57
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,630
That's nonsense.

58
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,710
Your Highness, do you believe that?

59
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,710
Don't get angry.

60
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,470
Your identity will affect
the peace treaty.

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,030
No one can leave here

62
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,750
until we figure it out.

63
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,520
Hurry!

64
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,630
Di Shiqi, you killed the princess

65
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,000
and committed countless crimes.

66
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,710
It's time to pay.

67
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,360
You're slandering me.

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,190
I'd like to see your proof.

69
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,920
So stubborn.

70
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,310
Your Highness, I haven't told you

71
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,270
that she was a humble fighter
in the black market.

72
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,680
I brought her to the Shadow Palace

73
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,070
with the excuse of
helping her find her mother.

74
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,360
I still have your ransom paper.

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,830
Do you want me to show it to you

76
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,870
to force you to tell the truth?

77
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,080
Your Highness.

78
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,560
Di Shiqi is favored by
the Shadow Palace's master.

79
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,310
If we kill this lowly woman,

80
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,750
we will lure out this evil monster

81
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,120
hiding in the dark

82
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,560
and eliminate him.

83
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,510
You'll achieve a great merit.

84
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,830
And I guarantee

85
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,720
you will take over the throne.

86
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,510
Shao, are you really going to

87
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,240
kill me just because of

88
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,390
his words?

89
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,830
What did you say?

90
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,920
If you eliminate the Shadow Palace,

91
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,920
you'll be Qi's great hero.

92
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,880
Before this.

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,870
Before this?

94
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,750
I said if we kill this lowly woman...

95
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,510
He spread rumors
and slandered the consort.

96
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,080
Execution.

97
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,270
Someone wants to use you as a weapon.

98
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,920
Who are you referring to?

99
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,560
But I'll protect you

100
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,000
(Cannon, General)
and capture the person behind you.

101
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,780
(Cannon)

102
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,880
What are you doing?

103
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,270
How dare you take my stuff?

104
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,510
How dare you?

105
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,710
Go to hell!

106
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,160
How dare you take my stuff?

107
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,560
Are you saying...

108
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,420
Go to hell!

109
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,870
She's my mother?

110
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,800
Look carefully.

111
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,190
How dare you take my stuff?

112
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,070
You like stealing, right?

113
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,080
Sprout.

114
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,110
Come on.

115
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,830
Play with this little grasshopper.

116
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,200
Hang in there.

117
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,680
Once we're in the city,

118
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,310
we'll find food.

119
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,480
I heard Tian Jiu died
at the Changle Palace.

120
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,910
Yes.

121
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,680
He tried to use the Fifth Prince
to take you down.

122
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,240
Lowly servant,

123
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,390
just like an ant trying to shake a tree.

124
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,920
But I'm wondering

125
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,000
why the Fifth Prince killed him

126
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,240
instead of believing him.

127
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,680
Is it because

128
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,560
he trusted you too much

129
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,630
or because you told him something?

130
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,270
I wouldn't dare.

131
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,160
I pledge my loyalty to you, Master.

132
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
Remember,

133
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,040
you're mine.

134
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,040
I understand.

135
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,270
Thank you, Master.

136
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,480
I will take your mother back.

137
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,000
I hope you can

138
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,040
reunite soon.

139
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,760
Aye.

140
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,000
I saw my mother today.

141
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,190
Is she doing well?

142
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,400
No.

143
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,510
Master took me to see her

144
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,430
to give me a warning.

145
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,040
My mother's life is in his hands.

146
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,240
In five days,

147
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,750
if I fail to serve the emperor,

148
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,950
I'm afraid he'll kill my mother.

149
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
But if you succeed,

150
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,070
we won't be able to get out alive.

151
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,270
That's right.

152
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,240
It seems like

153
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,720
a dead end.

154
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
I don't think so.

155
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,560
There's a way out.

156
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,110
The Fifth Prince.

157
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,270
I can't figure him out.

158
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,150
If it weren't for him,

159
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,000
you could've been dead.

160
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,150
But...

161
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,960
Don't you get it?

162
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,720
The Fifth Prince loves you.

163
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,240
Loves me?

164
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,510
Do you still believe in true love?

165
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,390
Let's try to find out

166
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,750
if this is true love.

167
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,200
You're hesitating.

168
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,390
You can't bear it?

169
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,000
I've wielded
swords and blades all my life,

170
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,670
but I don't know how to use
people's true heart.

171
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,480
Only if the Fifth Prince
intervenes to delay it

172
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,240
will we have time to make
a thorough plan to escape from

173
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,480
the Shadow Palace.

174
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,670
It's our only chance.

175
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,280
What should we do?

176
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,080
Stop drinking.

177
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,110
If you get drunk,

178
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,440
you'll forget your lines.

179
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,870
Don't worry.

180
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,240
I've memorized them all.

181
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,550
Everything's under control.

182
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,360
Just a piece of cake.

183
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,960
Your Highness?

184
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,080
It's you.

185
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,470
Your Highness!

186
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,790
Let's drink together.

187
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,560
Your Highness,

188
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,200
it's dangerous. Come down.

189
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,560
Turn around.

190
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,800
- Well...
- Turn around.

191
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,480
Your Highness, be careful.

192
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,510
His Majesty's servant

193
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,550
came today with a decree.

194
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,870
I must sleep with him in five days.

195
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,320
I still couldn't avoid it.

196
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,270
I already knew this.

197
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,150
I regret it now.

198
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,910
What do you mean?

199
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,240
I fell in love with someone.

200
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,230
Who?

201
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,510
Well, it's not the emperor.

202
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,120
You probably know him too.

203
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,750
He's got a pretty face,

204
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,790
good handwriting,

205
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,390
and fine martial arts.

206
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,200
And he often helps me.

207
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,390
Unfortunately,

208
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,630
I had to marry his father.

209
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,670
If I knew I'd fall for him

210
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,510
at the beginning,

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,480
I would've knocked him out

212
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,840
when we first met

213
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,120
and kept him to myself

214
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,550
for a lifetime.

215
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,350
Your Highness!

216
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,510
Ouyang Shao,

217
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,390
I don't want to do it.

218
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,790
If I sleep with the emperor,

219
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,550
will he dislike me?

220
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,030
I'm not the person you like.

221
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,240
I don't know about him.

222
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,510
What if I say you're the person?

223
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,000
I like you too, Your Highness.

224
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,480
If you want to

225
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
be with me,

226
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,600
I'll eliminate all obstacles and worries

227
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,390
for you.
