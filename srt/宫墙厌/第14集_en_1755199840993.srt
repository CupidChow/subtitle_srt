3
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,000
Where's your scar?

4
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,800
What scar?

5
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,640
When I was young,
my mother cut a piece of flesh

6
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,840
so that I could survive.

7
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,200
That wound was deep to the bone,

8
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,480
leaving an obvious scar.

9
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,000
Do you know something?

10
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,430
The rescue went too smoothly,

11
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,760
and I was suspicious then.

12
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,120
It seems

13
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,510
the Crown Prince let Yilan rescue her

14
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,510
to block the diplomatic corps.

15
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,430
Ming'en is looking for your mother.

16
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,790
Sprout.

17
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,560
I will do anything I can

18
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,200
to help you find your mother.

19
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,870
Next month is your mother's
death anniversary.

20
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,840
Write a few eulogies for me.

21
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,230
Thank you for thinking of her.

22
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,480
If my mother knew this,

23
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,590
she'd appreciate your kindness.

24
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,390
Why haven't I seen Consort Wei lately?

25
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,280
Father, you're busy with work.

26
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,480
Consort Wei should
stay here to serve you.

27
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,080
She said it was
the prayer ceremony of Wei,

28
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,670
and she needed to fast for three days.

29
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,350
Never mind.

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,390
After all, she's the princess of Wei.

31
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,400
She still remembers her roots.

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,920
- But...
- Fifth Prince has arrived!

33
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,790
Father, blessed be.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,270
I have something urgent to report.

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,440
Shao, speak freely.

36
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,830
When I was investigating
Shouzheng's case,

37
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,670
I found him involved in a group

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,920
called Shadow Palace.

39
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,150
They have committed
evil crimes in the capital.

40
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,200
Their leader can't be simple.

41
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,880
Brother, I wonder
if you've ever heard about it.

42
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,950
He was just a servant.

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,160
How dare he collude with a cult?

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
Shao, you must investigate it thoroughly

45
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,760
for my reputation.

46
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,920
Investigate thoroughly.

47
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,830
Don't let those nasty rascals

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,550
tarnish the royal family.

49
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,160
Aye.

50
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,550
I told Father I'd investigate
the Shadow Palace.

51
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,760
The Crown Prince won't act for now.

52
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,510
I'll find a way to stall for time.

53
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,550
You should rest well.

54
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,670
The scars need time to heal.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,510
Fortunately, during the prayer ceremony,

56
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,320
I don't need to be close to His Majesty.

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,510
Any news about my mother?

58
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,440
By the way,

59
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,550
Father said he'd throw you

60
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,360
a grand birthday banquet

61
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,040
based on the noble consort's standard.

62
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,600
You should be prepared.

63
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,760
It's getting late.

64
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,550
I'll head back now.

65
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,590
What a great moment.

66
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,440
Unfortunately,
it's Princess Abi Ya's birthday,

67
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,040
not mine.

68
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,480
Your Highness.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,950
Speak.

70
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,030
They confessed.

71
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,350
The Shadow Palace was founded
by the late queen.

72
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,750
What did you say?

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,040
The queen?

74
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,110
Yes,

75
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,640
the late queen established it

76
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,150
to help women in the world.

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,630
A nanny surnamed Tong

78
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,070
assisted the queen.

79
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,640
She also developed the Ink Poison.

80
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,870
After the prince took power,

81
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,270
Nanny Tong disappeared.

82
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,390
Three days ago,

83
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,320
we found information about Nanny Tong.

84
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,670
Okay.

85
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,080
We must talk to Nanny Tong.

86
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,280
Aye.

87
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,120
This pawn is completely out of control.

88
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,950
If we don't kill Di Shiqi,

89
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,030
she'll bring disaster to us.

90
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,230
Uncle.

91
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,270
Don't you think death is too kind

92
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,000
for someone from

93
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,320
the Shadow Palace?

94
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,320
Even ants can shake a tree.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,470
Your Highness, don't go too far.

96
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,710
Uncle, please stay calm.

97
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,270
All useless pawns will end up the same.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,080
But before that,

99
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,910
I want her to kneel by my feet

100
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,200
and beg me.

101
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,590
Greetings, Your Majesty.

102
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,150
Why did you suddenly

103
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,680
summon me?

104
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,640
Consort Wei has arrived.

105
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,910
Guardian Duke, you shall speak.

106
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,350
Your Majesty,

107
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,430
I want to reveal the fact

108
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,270
that Consort Wei isn't Princess Abi Ya.

109
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,840
Guardian Duke,

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,710
do you have proof?

111
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,000
I heard

112
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,600
the real princess

113
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,630
was gentle and delicate.

114
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,550
However,

115
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,560
she escaped
after being captured by the rogues.

116
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,510
Later, she went to the Ladies' Court

117
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,760
and even injured Eunuch Li.

118
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,080
This woman is unruly,

119
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,150
unlike a palace-raised princess.

120
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,510
I remember

121
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,360
this case

122
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,030
was solved a long time ago.

123
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,720
Guardian Duke,

124
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,470
who are you so obsessed with it?

125
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,910
I'm just a consort.

126
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,710
His Majesty will make the judgment.

127
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,590
Guardian Duke, have you overstepped?

128
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,200
I'm doing this for His Majesty's safety.

129
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,160
I'm worried that some traitors

130
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,240
want to ruin the peace
between Qi and Wei.

131
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,310
Therefore, I found

132
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,680
the real portrait of Princess Abi Ya.

133
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,790
Guardian Duke,

134
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,000
is it because you're old,

135
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,350
or have you been misled?

136
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,120
You want to question
Consort Wei's identity

137
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,470
with a single portrait.

138
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,440
Isn't it ridiculous?

139
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,590
The true portrait is here.

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,200
How can it be wrong?

141
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,560
I remember

142
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,240
it was you who picked up Consort Wei.

143
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,560
You must've been deceived by traitors.

144
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,270
Forgive me,

145
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,910
Fifth Prince, you failed in your duty.

146
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,910
Well, Guardian Duke, could you tell me

147
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,030
where you got this portrait?

148
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,120
If you had close ties with Wei,

149
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,350
it'd be reasonable

150
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,240
to get this portrait.

151
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,200
Your Majesty, don't be misled.

152
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,680
I have no connections with Wei.

153
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,790
I got this portrait
from a wandering artist

154
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,710
when I was investigating the case.

155
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,080
This artist once painted
for Princess Abi Ya.

156
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,670
Guardian Duke,

157
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,150
you insist

158
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,710
that I'm not Princess Abiya.

159
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,440
Well, then tell me,

160
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,400
where is Princess Abi Ya?

161
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,560
Well,

162
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,920
I haven't found her.

163
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,680
You haven't found her,

164
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,200
yet you're saying I'm a fake princess

165
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,520
based on a single portrait.

166
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,230
How ridiculous.

167
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,520
Your Majesty,

168
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,630
I chose to be your consort

169
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,200
because I was grateful
that you cared about the people

170
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,400
and were willing to make peace

171
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,560
so that our people could avoid war.

172
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,630
However, Guardian Duke,

173
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,040
you've been trying to dig into my past

174
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,950
to stir up trouble.

175
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,280
What are you up to?

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,840
Father,

177
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,400
I meant to report this earlier.

178
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,400
I've found something that can prove

179
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,080
Guardian Duke has something to do
with the Shadow Palace.

180
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,120
Guardian Duke,

181
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,080
what do you have to say?

182
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,520
He's talking nonsense.

183
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,160
Your Majesty,

184
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,030
I don't know why he's trying to

185
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,470
connect me with the Shadow Palace.

186
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,520
There must be a misunderstanding here.

187
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,160
However, this woman is a liar.

188
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,360
I have a witness.

189
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,750
We'll know the truth once we see her.

190
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,680
Bring her here!

191
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,470
Yilan, is that you?

192
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,750
You disguised yourself as the princess.

193
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,270
You asked me to keep the secret

194
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,280
and promised not to harm me.

195
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,640
However,

196
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,200
after I left the palace,

197
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,520
you sent people to kill me.

198
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Your Majesty,

199
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,240
I accuse Consort Wei of murdering

200
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,320
and replacing the princess

201
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,920
and ruining the peace-making marriage.

202
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,590
This is unforgivable.

203
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,510
Your Majesty,

204
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,800
the criminal Yilan
has testified against her.

205
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,110
What else do you want to say?

206
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,470
Guards,

207
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,870
send this wicked woman to prison!

208
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,960
How dare you?

209
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,920
Father is still here.

210
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,830
Who are you to punish her?

211
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,590
Besides, this witness alone

212
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,200
can't prove she's the fake princess.

213
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm doing this for His Majesty's safety.

214
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,230
Your Highness, are you defending her

215
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,480
because you like her?

216
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,400
Enough.

217
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,080
What is really happening?

218
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,950
Yilan,

219
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,990
do you have your reasons?

220
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,440
What did they do to you?

221
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,950
Her Highness asked you

222
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,280
why you betrayed her.

223
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,110
I'm only loyal to Princess Abi Ya.

224
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,560
I didn't betray anyone.

225
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,080
I'll kill you and avenge my princess!

226
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,320
You don't even understand
Wei's royal language,

227
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,040
and your severed finger

228
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,160
is slightly shorter than Yilan's.

229
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,680
You're not Yilan.

230
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,470
Father, she's not Yilan.
