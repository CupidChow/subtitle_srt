00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,810
Such a strong Omega scent.

00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,150
I could smell it through the door.

5
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,820
Mr. Sheng.

6
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,680
Are you marked by an Omega?

7
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,410
It's none of your business.

8
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,590
You are right.

9
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,620
I'll return to my room.

10
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,190
Good night.

11
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,260

for a long time too,

00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,220

Shen Wenlang is not an idiot.

21
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,480
Why do you need to remind him to eat?

22
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,910
Crazy.

Humph.

28
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,780
Since he ignores me,

Mr. Sheng, thank you
for taking care of me these days.

31
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,250
I've thought about it.

32
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,930
It's really inappropriate
to keep bothering you.

33
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,990
I've already found

34
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,420

Also,

39
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,430
I will return the money
you lent me on time.

doing nothing further with me anymore?

willing to mark you forever?

Every time I think of you

I get twisted by jealousy

71
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,260

Let's stop doing this,

94
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,590
okay?

95
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,260
Mm.

There isn't anything on your schedule
for the day after.

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,520

107
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,080
Secretary Gao...

108
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,640
Secretary Gao asked for 10 days off.

109
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,570
But don't worry.

110
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,220
He handed over his work ahead of that.

111
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,290
I'll be in charge of

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,640
your personal affairs.

113

Again?

114
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,060
Why?

115
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,890
Uh...

116
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,890
I think it's because
something happened at home.

117
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,550
What could happen to him?

118
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,970
He probably went to accompany

119
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,230
his Omega who gets heats every other day.

120
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,400
Humph.

121
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,860
It doesn't matter.

122
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,540
Since he wants to be
such a good partner,

123
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,010
then don't come back.

124
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,510
Find someone to take over his work.

125
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,150
Yes.

126
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,330
What are you waiting for?

127
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,660
Pick up the plane for me.

128
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,770
Sorry, Wenlang.

129
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,930
Can I take one minute of your time?

130

Gao Tu.

131
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,620
Sorry.

132
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,610
Please

133
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,540
make some way for us.

134
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,750
Shen, I only need one minute.

135

I don't have to force a result.

is that okay?

00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,660

So annoying.

Even if he refuses,

143
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,200
he should tell me himself.

144
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,350
Who do you think you are?

145
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,780
Are you his dog?

146
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,310
No.

What do you mean no?

148

You're a Beta,

149
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,330
but you're always around
an S-tier Alpha,

150
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,410
rejecting all his romantic advances.

151
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,270
Who knows what you're up to?

152
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,930
I suspect you're up to no good

153
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,780

154
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,250
How filthy and shameless.

156
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,230
Why waste your words
on an Omega?

157
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,160
Let's go.

158
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,380
I'm going to throw up.

159

I hate Omegas.

160
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,840
Make sure to clean yourself up

161
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,720
when you come back to work next week.

162
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,210
Don't you know

163
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,300
how strong the Omega scent
on you is?

164
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,720
Don't come near me
with that filthy Omega scent.

165
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,100
It stinks.

166
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,140
Hello?

167
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,760
-Dad.
-Gosh.

168
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,630
Gao Tu.

169
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,350
What took you so long to pick up?

170
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,580
I'm interested

171
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,220
interested in a big business recently.

172
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,850
The return rate is very high.

173
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,420
It's just that

174
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,550
we're short of some starting funds.

175
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,570
I would like to get

176
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,540
some more money from you.

177
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,640
Just transfer it to my bank account.

178
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,900
How much do you want?

179
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,060
Not much.

180
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,160
100,000 is enough.

181
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,260
100,000?

182
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,160
Did you gamble again?

183
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,470
Why? Is 100,000 a lot?

184
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,560
Hey!

185
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,590
You work in such a big company,

186
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,880
you must earn a lot.

187
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,300
What? Can't even give your dad 100,000?

188
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,790
I raised you for nothing.

189
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,130
What a good for nothing!

190
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,930
Dad.

191
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,130
I'm just an office worker.

192
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,460
The company size
has nothing to do with me.

193
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,680
Besides, Qing is still hospitalized.

194
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,140
Fine.

195
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,370
Hey.

196
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,950
Qing has been

197
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,850
sickly since she was young.

198
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,940
She will only drag us down.

199
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,890
She's not getting better
even with treatment.

200
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,020
In my opinion,

201
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,900
she's just wasting our money.

202
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,340
Might as well
give up on her treatment earlier.

203
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,870
What are you talking about?

204
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,070
Qing is your daughter.

205
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,650
Okay, fine.

206
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,180
If you want to treat her,
you go ahead, okay?

207
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,140
When can you

208
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,900
transfer the money I want?

209
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,430
I don't have that much.

210
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,810
I'll give you 2,000 at most.

211
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,520
What?

212
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,440
Two thousand?

213
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,670
What can I use that for?

214
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,420
You make so much money
but you won't give your dad some?

215
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,540
You'll be criticized
if anyone hears about this.

216
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,940
Listen.

217
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,160
If you don't give me the money,

218
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,270
I'll go to your company.

you can continue to work there.

220

Sure.

221

Whatever.

222
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,800
If I lose my job after you do that,

223
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,220
you won't even have this 2,000.

224
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,290
Hey, you...

You'd better come back
a few days early if possible.

227
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,950
Mr. Shen seems to be very angry

228
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,380
that you're always taking leave.

229
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,540
He even said things like

230
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,270
telling you to never come back.

231
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,400
Remember to explain to Mr. Shen
when you're back

232
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,660
or he might target you.

233
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,230
Actually, he doesn't need me at all.

234
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,840
I've been the one watching him

235
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,170
and refusing to give up.

236
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,480
He shines like the moon,

237
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,340
surrounded by stars.

238
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,760

am the most ordinary one

I don't want to give up.

339
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,510
So I'd rather lie

340
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,360
and keep my Beta identity

344
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,770
10 years is probably...

345
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,370
how long

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,450

354
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,790

355
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,710

but there's no progress.

374
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,120
In order to
leave enough authority to the lab,

375
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,320
I carried out
the reform of the research center

376
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,170
and touched the share
of those old men on the board.

377
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,410
At this rate,

378
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,990
there will be more and more objections.

379
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,120
Shengfang'd be besieged sooner or later.

380
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,750
The leaders of the research team
have issued orders

381
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,760
to make everyone work overtime.

382
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,000
As for personnel,

383
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
we've been trying to recruit
experts in the field too.

384
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,920
Got it.

385
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,880
Mr. Sheng.

386
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,700
One more thing.

387
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,220
What?

388
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,650
We received news that

389
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,770
the person-in-charge of X Holdings
will be coming to Jianghu soon.

390
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,670
They may be seeking a new partner.

391
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,280
Have you verified that?

392
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,330
Yes, I've checked.

393
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,490
They will be organizing
a special exchange meeting.

394
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,490
They've sent invitations to
top pharmaceutical companies

395
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,560
in Jianghu.

396
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,370
I heard...

397
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,140
that person will also be coming to Jianghu

398
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,290
to meet the final partner selected.

399
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,800
Really? That's great.

400
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,990
As long as we can get close to X Holdings,

401
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,670
we won't be stuck in such a weak position

402
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,550
to get the patent to the targeted drug.

403
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,200
I believe what Shen Wenlang can get,

404
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,450
we Shengfang can too.

405
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,450
But...

406
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,510
But what?

407
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,250
Shengfang Bio
isn't on the invitation list.

408
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,220
Why?

409
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,820
The PR team is still investigating.

410
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,460
That's strange.

411
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,360
After all,
there are many companies invited

412
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,160
far more inferior to us.

413
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,100
Hmm.

414
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,590
Report to me
as soon as you find out the reason.

415
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,390
Got it, Mr. Sheng.

416
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,770
Chen Pinming.

417
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,650
Which representative
did X Holdings send this time?

418
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,520
It's Chang Yin.

419
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,710
Okay.

420
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,140
I got it.

421
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,310
You may leave.

422
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:09,940
Okay.

423
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,180
Mr. Sheng.

424
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,340
Yes?

425
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,390
Your susceptible period is coming, right?

426
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:17,990
Yeah.

427
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,560
You look tired.

428
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,780
Take care of yourself.

429
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,980
Nothing is more important than health.

430
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,960
Okay. I got it. Thank you.

431
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,590
Why did they leave Shengfang Bio
out of the invitation?

432
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,230
Last time at Chairman Zhang's dinner,

433
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,390
I even met Chang Yin.

434
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,630
I didn't offend him.

435
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,210
How could we be targeted?

Mr. Sheng?

444
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,790
Take a closer look at his nape.

445
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,040
Look at what's there.

446
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,470
An inhibitor patch?

447
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,600
That's right.
I think his susceptible period is coming.

448
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,060
He's an S-tier Alpha.

449
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,510
I'm just a B-tier Alpha.

450
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,080
It's better to stay away from him
during times like this.

451
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,110
An S-tier's oppressive pheromone

452
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,500
is no joke.

453
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,710
Mr. Sheng.

454
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,010
Has Chang Yin arrived?

455
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,640
Yes.

456
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,520
He's here.
But he didn't take the front door.

457
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,370
He went straight into the VIP lounge
from the side door.

458
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,580
There are a few bodyguards
in front of the lounge.

459
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,290
Some of his acquaintances
were turned away.

460
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,180
Let's not go head on first.

461
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,990
Okay.

462
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,590
Let's try to get a chance
to drink a toast to him.

463
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,960
Okay.

464
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,690
Mr. Sheng, what's wrong?

465
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,570
Nothing.

466
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,730
I don't know why.

467
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,330
This susceptible period feels differen.

468
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,080
I can't really control myself.

469
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,760
You're sweating a lot.

470
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,510
The inhibitor patch is drenched.

471
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,740
I brought some spare ones.

472
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,170
Would you like to
change it into a new one in the bathroom?

473
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:08,970
Sure.

Secretary Chang, sorry.

477
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,780
Mr. Sheng is inside?

478
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,930
Mr. Sheng, isn't this too much?

479
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,500
You're using your pheromones

480
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,030
to have the whole washroom to yourself.

481
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,790
So this is the arrogance

482
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,200
of Shengfang Bio they speak of.

483
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,910
Mr. Sheng, you look pale.

00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,580
Mr. Sheng, are you feeling unwell?

486
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,080
Go to bed and lie down, okay?

487
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,530
I feel so terrible.

488
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,740
I know.

00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,320

00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,410
Okay.

491
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,460
Secretary Chen, thank you.

492
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,940
Leave Mr. Sheng to me.

493
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:55,890
Head back first.

494
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,390
I'll take good care of him.

495
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,000
I feel so terrible.

496
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,490
Mr. Sheng, let go of me.

497
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,540
How can I help you change like this?

498
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,290
No.

499
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,590
I don't want to take off my clothes.

500
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,550
I want to sleep with you like this.

501
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,710
How can you sleep without changing?

502
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,310
You'll feel uncomfortable.

503
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,050
I'm not sleepy.

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,970
Of course it does.

509
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,120
Mr. Sheng, lie down.

510
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,060
Do you like my comforting pheromones?

511
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,670
Mr. Sheng, have a good dream.

512
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,530
Good night.

513
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,260
Mr. Sheng.

514
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,250
There's a rumor that

515
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,080
HS Group suddenly formed
an anti-corruption team

516
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,080
specially targeting

00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,110

519
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,690
causing panic.

520
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,220
Do you think
we should take the chance to...

521
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,420
Troubles always start from within.

522
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,180
Shen Wenlang doing this is like

523
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,750
digging his own grave.

524
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,720
Ask the HR department
to set up a special headhunting team.

525
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,640
While it's turbulent internally,

526
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,370
let's try and get
some of their core team members.

527
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,490
Okay.

528
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,070
But

529
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,560
HS is doing a very good job
at keeping this under the covers.

530
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,580
All we know now is that
those being investigated

531
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,260
are mainly in the
research team.

532
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,260
Do you have a list?

533
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,490
We are still trying to get that.

534
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,250

00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,090
Yes.

537
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,940
I don't care about the difficulty,
only the result.

538
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,500
Do anything you can.

539
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,750
I want to get a list of the core members
within a month.

540
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,560
No matter what it takes.

541
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,980
Got it, Mr. Sheng.

Let's go on a vacation together this time.

546
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,730
Didn't I tell you

547
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,560
not to contact each other again?

548
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,570
Shaoyou.

549
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,890
I know you don't like me
going out all the time.

550
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,360
But I've changed.

551
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,090
What does it have to do with me?

552
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,680
Don't say that.

553
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,830
I know

554
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,030
you're with that orchid-scented Omega.

00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,280
but Shaoyou,

558
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,830
you're an S-tier Alpha.

559
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,120
You don't have to go through
your susceptible period alone.

560
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,740
How I spend my susceptible period

561
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,340
and who I spend it with
is none of your business.

562
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,350
We just fooled around for a few days.

563
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,650
If you want me to

564
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,630
buy you a few more bags,

565
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,300
you can just contact my secretary.

566
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,530
Don't call me if there's nothing else.

567
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,210
What now?

568
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,370
Shaoyou. It's me, Boqiao.

569
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,330
Why are you so angry?

570
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,420
Who pissed you off?

571
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,610
Stop spreading my privacy

572
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,130
and I'll be less angry.

573
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,600
Hey, that won't do.

574
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,100
You know me.

575
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,490
Don't tell me any secrets.

576
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,780
I can't hide anything.

577
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,530
By the way,

578
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,920
isn't your susceptible period coming?

579
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,920
I'm going to Country P for a few days.

580
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,000
Do you want to join me?

581
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,270
Country P's entertainment industry
is very advanced.

582
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,800
There are many beautiful Omegas.

583
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,600
No.

584
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,160
Why not?

585
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,920
Let's go. The more the merrier.

586
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,200
Yushan's going too.

587
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,160
Boqiao, don't force Shaoyou.

588
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,510
You know Shaoyou wouldn't go to Country P

589
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,580
unless there's something important.

590
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,370
Just take it as doing me a favor.

591
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,460
Let's go together.

592
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,350
No.

593
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,100
What did I tell you?

594
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,400
You got rejected ruthlessly, right?

595
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,220
I know he doesn't like Country P.

596
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,750
I just want to help him overcome it.

597
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,480
Just because he lost

598
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,400
his ancestral pocket watch in Country P,

599
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,060
he started to hate that place.

600
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,860
Mr. Sheng is

601
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,080
is so narrow-minded.
Come on.

602
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,340
Hua Yong, why are you hiding here?

603
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,540
What's with that face?

604
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,080
Shut up!

605
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,810
Who is it? Come out!

606
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,160
You disturbed my nap.

607
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,340
How dare you ask me who I am?

608
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,180
Sh-Sheng Shaoyu.

609
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,410
You're an Alpha,
yet you're bullying an Omega.

610
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,840
Come here.

611
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,020
Close your eyes.

612
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,449
He's just a coward.

613
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:14,719
I scared him away.

614
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,300
Don't be afraid.
I'm not doing anything.

615
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,489
I'm just giving you
some comforting pheromones.

616
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:20,790
You'll feel better.

617
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,230
Don't be afraid. Just stay still.

618
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:26,010
Just for a moment.

619
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,150
I don't smell any pheromones on you.

620
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,150
You're not an Omega. You're a Beta?

621
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,280
Huh?

622
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,590
I've never seen such a cute Beta.

623
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,020
So the pheromones doesn't work on you?

624
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,780
No, I'm not a Beta.

625
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,400
I'm just not differentiated yet.

626
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,020
No wonder I can't smell you.

627
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,500
But I'm going to differentiate soon.

628
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,860
What scent do you like?

629
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,640
I should go.

630
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,650
Sheng Shaoyou.

631
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,430
What is it?

632
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,610
I'm going to get something,
I'll be right back.

633
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,410
Okay.

634
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,380
Can you give me your number?

635
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,150
Why? You want to thank me?

636
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,530
No need.

637
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,570
If you meet someone who bullies you again,

638
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,020
don't stand still like an idiot.

639
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,540
Run if you can't defeat them.

640
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,980
At least you can protect yourself
like that.

641
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,780
That's all.

642
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,070
Goodbye, kid.

643
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,600
Secretary Chen,
would you like tea or coffee?

644
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,220
I'm fine with anything.

645
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,880
Anything convenient for you.

646
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,050
Sorry.

647
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,070
I came without telling you.

648
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,880
It's okay.

649
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,580
Let me make you some lime tea.

650
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,780
Sure.

651
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:05,730
Thank you.

652
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,080
Mr. Sheng went on a business trip.

653
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,540
He didn't want you to be bored

654
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,270
so he asked me to send you a book.

655
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,140
What book?

656
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,590
[Human Words]

657
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,170
Oh, this one.

658
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,380
I mentioned it to Mr. Sheng
a while back.

659
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,900
I said I liked this book
since I was a kid.

660
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,530
I've always wanted to
read it a few more times.

661
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,800
I've been working for Mr. Sheng
for many years.

662
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,040
I can tell that he cares about you.

663
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,060
Mr. Sheng is very nice.

664
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,580
Secretary Chen.

665
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,170
Yes?

666
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,680
Is Mr. Sheng on a business trip

667
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,820
because of his susceptible period?

668
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,160
This is a personal schedule.

669
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,280
I'm not sure.

670
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,250
Personal schedule?

671
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,270
Got it.

672
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,590
Oh, right.

673
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,880
I baked cookies.

674
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,960
Would you like some, Secretary Chen?

675
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,030
Sure, thank you.

676
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,840
You're welcome. I made two flavors.

677
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,810
Try them both.

678
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,160
Secretary Chen.

679
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,230
Do you like our company's

680
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,890
briefcase?

681
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,160
If you like it,

682
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,240
I can give it to you.

683
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,410
Oh.

684
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,810
This is your bag?

685
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,360
I thought it belongs to Mr. Sheng.

686
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,380
I wanted to refill his name cards.

687
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,930
Last time at the business party,

688
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,930
Mr. Sheng had an empty name card case

689
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,180
and got really angry.

690
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,200
Mr. Sheng does have
a bad temper sometimes.

691
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,130
It must be tough to take care of him.

692
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,210
It's nothing. It's my duty.

693
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,830
Try it.

694
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,880
I just baked it.

695
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,560
Oh, I suddenly remembered

696
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:20,540
Mr. Sheng asked me to
go to the lab again today.

697
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,960
I'll leave you to it then.

698
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,700
Sure. Work is the most important.

699
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,580
I'll pack the biscuits for you.

700
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,310
Thank you so much.

701
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,440
Come in.

702
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,650
Mr. Shen, here's your tea.

703
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,000
What's wrong with you?

704
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,080
You look so pale.

705
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,080
I'm fine.

706
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,440
You're fine?

707
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,570
Have you seen yourself in the mirror?

708
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,040
You call this fine?

709
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,370
I'm sorry.

710
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,560
I didn't sleep well recently.

711
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,710
I feel a little dizzy.

712
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:15,530
Dizzy?

713
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,100
Gao Tu.

714
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,040
You're not a kid anymore.

715
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,430
You should see a doctor
if you feel sick.

716
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,880
You should know that.

717
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,640
Gao Tu.

718
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,590
What are you doing?

719
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,480
I've seen a doctor.

720
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,130
It was my asthma.

721
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,450
I got highly effective injections
for a few days in a row.

722
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,050
I'm already getting better.

723
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,140
Mm.

724
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,450
Mr. Shen.

725
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,840
This is the budget summary
of next month's procurement plan.

726
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,240
Gao Tu.

727
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:56,960
Yes.

728
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,860
You made this financial report?

729
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:05,130
There's an extra zero
in the procurement plan's total sum.

730
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,040
Gao Tu.

731
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,550
Are you blind?

732
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,630
Sorry, Mr. Shen.

733
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,630
I didn't check carefully.

734
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,630
Check?

735
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,020
Humph.

736
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,280
You're just not

737
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,130
taking work seriously.

738
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,120
Your soul is completely sucked away

739
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,300
by that Omega

740
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,530
who's always in heat.

741
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,260
You even got the numbers wrong.

742
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,790
Even a kid

743
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,850
wouldn't make such a stupid mistake.

744
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,880
Mr. Shen,

745
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,860
the report was written by
the finance and procurement department.

746
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,460
I'm just taking it here.

747
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,090
Sorry, I wasn't around
for the past few days,

748
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,160
so I couldn't review this report myself.

749
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,290
HS Group doesn't hire useless people.

750
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,900
I don't have time
to listen to your excuses.

751
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,040
Sorry, I'll fix it right away.

752
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,460
Also.

753
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,980
I'm sure you know that

754
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,310
I hate Omegas.

755
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,080
Yes, I know.

756
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:58,810
Then how dare you

757
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,490
come into my office with the stench

758
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,740
of an Omega all over you?

759
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,410
I...

760
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,240
It reeks. Get lost.

761
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,930
Wash that stench off before you come back.

762
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,970
Sorry, Mr. Shen.

763
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,110
I'll leave now.

764
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:32,220
[HS Group]

765
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,130
I wonder who he's spending
his susceptible period with.

766
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,190
[Crazy Guy]

767
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,070
I feel like killing someone.

768
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,130
Secretary Chen is so clumsy.

769
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,780
His tapping device is always so noisy.

770
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,590
Why are there
so many useless people around him?

771
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:51,400
Anyway, it's time.

772
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,160
Everything should go as planned.

773
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,430
Crazy bastard.
