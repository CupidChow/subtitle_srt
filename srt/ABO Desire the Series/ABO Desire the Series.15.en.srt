"Desire the Series"

2
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,600
(Episode 15)

3
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:44,909
I'm sorry, no.

4
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:47,045
How did no one take photos?

5
00:01:47,312 --> 00:01:48,312
Gao Tu.

6
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:50,181
When did you become so stingy?

7
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,022
Stop ignoring me, Gao Tu.

8
00:02:02,527 --> 00:02:04,696
Why guard an Omega so fiercely?

9
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:40,031
Why guard an Omega so fiercely?

10
00:02:49,474 --> 00:02:51,076
Hey, answer me.

11
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:52,844
Are you asleep?

12
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:00,318
Hey.

13
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:01,618
Answer me.

14
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,254
Are you asleep?

15
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:11,763
No.

16
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:15,266
Shen Wenlang, actually I...

17
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:22,774
Fine, sleep.

18
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:24,843
Reply first thing tomorrow.

19
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:27,412
Good night!

20
00:03:34,352 --> 00:03:35,520
Fine, sleep.

21
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,856
Reply first thing tomorrow.

22
00:03:57,909 --> 00:03:59,511
Shen Wenlang knows it very well.

23
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:01,846
Gao Tu quit.

24
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:05,950
He's no longer obligated
to reply to Wenlang instantly.

25
00:04:06,618 --> 00:04:08,920
But having to face the
total lack of motivated communication,

26
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:16,161
Wenlang, accustomed to instant replies from
Gao Tu still feels rage and disappointment.

27
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:20,865
He knew he was being irrational

28
00:04:21,432 --> 00:04:23,901
but the idea of Gao Tu
with a pregnant Omega

29
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:25,403
leaving him

30
00:04:25,703 --> 00:04:27,906
felt like a weight on his chest;

31
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,874
suffocating.

32
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:34,245
The thought of not seeing Gao Tu daily

33
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:36,514
left Wenlang breathless.

34
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:40,051
Suffocating like never before.

35
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,151
He should be up by now.

36
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:18,323
Why no reply?

37
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:27,198
Why don't you reply?

38
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:11,127
If you're not responding,
I'll never contact you again.

39
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,411
We're done.

40
00:06:13,544 --> 00:06:14,646
Who cares.

41
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,062
[Wenlang recalls/takes
back all his crash-out messages]

42
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:56,321
Gao Tu, where's the money you owe me?

43
00:06:56,688 --> 00:06:58,189
You promised to repay me.

44
00:06:58,389 --> 00:06:59,624
Where is it?

45
00:07:12,403 --> 00:07:13,438
Gao Tu.

46
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:15,940
You wouldn't break your word, would you?

47
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:05,771
[text notification that Gao Tu
returned the money and that he's broke]

48
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:28,278
You think if you ignore my calls you
can get away from your responsibility?

49
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,479
I'm your father

50
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,581
100,000, not a cent less.

51
00:08:31,582 --> 00:08:32,983
If I'd suffer

52
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:34,719
you and Qing will pay.

53
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:36,453
My patience is limited.

54
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:37,955
Don't test me.

55
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:25,503
[text notification saying Wenlang received
the money and that he's obscenely wealthy]

56
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,215
This repayment notice makes
Wenlang's anger rise but not boil over.

57
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:40,350
Like a damp firework.

58
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,253
But no explosion.

59
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:45,089
Just fizzling out.

60
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:48,392
Instead, a hollow ache

61
00:09:49,193 --> 00:09:51,529
gnawing emptiness.

62
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:06,077
Mr. Hua.

63
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:08,078
Your pheromone glands are badly injured.

64
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,145
You need to lie down

65
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:10,548
Mr. Sheng will wake up soon.

66
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:11,582
Don't worry.

67
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,716
Go rest in your room.

68
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:13,751
Leave.

69
00:10:14,218 --> 00:10:15,253
I'm staying.

70
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,855
Just add a bed next to Mr. Sheng's.

71
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:19,323
But.
But what?

72
00:10:20,658 --> 00:10:23,027
We must examine the wound.

73
00:10:23,494 --> 00:10:24,362
Theoretically.

74
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:25,996
You need to undergo
surgery as soon as possible.

75
00:10:25,997 --> 00:10:26,631
Otherwise...
No need.

76
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:30,868
Why isn't he awake yet?

77
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:33,804
Are you sure the test results are okay?

78
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:34,871
Yes.

79
00:10:40,845 --> 00:10:41,845
Mr. Sheng.

80
00:10:42,146 --> 00:10:43,281
You're awake.

81
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:51,923
What's wrong with you?

82
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,392
I'm fine. Take your time.

83
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,527
If you get up too quickly, it'll be
bad for your cardiovascular health.

84
00:10:57,528 --> 00:10:58,796
How did this happen?

85
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:02,265
Where's Sheng Shaoqing?

86
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,201
He's been taken to the police.

87
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,971
Your police are impressively efficient.

88
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:08,844
It's a great lesson for
our country to learn from.

89
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,679
Was it Shaoqing?

90
00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:16,313
Hmm.

91
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:18,407
But I'm fine.

92
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,051
But you.

93
00:11:20,484 --> 00:11:22,887
Shaoqing poisoned the wine.

94
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:25,022
The blood test report is pending

95
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:26,189
I'm concerned.

96
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,391
Your glands are damaged

97
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:29,794
yet you worry about me?

98
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:31,528
Hua Yong.

99
00:11:31,662 --> 00:11:33,164
Do you live at the hospital?

100
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:35,177
You don't get tired of being
hospitalized every day?

101
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:38,636
Now you're getting me involved.

102
00:11:38,836 --> 00:11:40,671
Wenlang, stop talking.

103
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:44,375
Whether Hua Yong is staying at
the hospital, or who he's visiting...

104
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:46,277
What does it matter to you?

105
00:11:46,744 --> 00:11:47,611
Shen Wenlang.

106
00:11:47,612 --> 00:11:49,547
You haven't gotten enough beatings yet.

107
00:11:49,914 --> 00:11:51,648
You came to my room to get your ass kicked.

108
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,360
It's a good idea to save
them on the spot, isn't it?

109
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:55,385
If it wasn't for this nutcase
standing next to you.

110
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:57,454
You think you can take advantage of me?

111
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:58,455
Oh.

112
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,092
Well, you can come over here and try.

113
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:02,093
Wenlang.

114
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:04,428
Don't talk to Mr. Sheng in that tone.

115
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:05,662
He won't be happy.

116
00:12:05,663 --> 00:12:09,065
And I'm supposed to be happy if
he's using that tone of voice on me?

117
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:10,334
Mr. Sheng.

118
00:12:10,335 --> 00:12:12,202
Something happened to
Wenlang's family recently.

119
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:13,503
He's not in a good mood.

120
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:14,839
Don't get on his bad side.

121
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:16,172
Something happened?

122
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:17,842
What could happen to me?

123
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:19,409
Secretary Gao resigned

124
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,244
isn't this an internal crisis for you?

125
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:21,679
You…

126
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,180
All right, stop it.

127
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:29,186
What the hell is going on?

128
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:31,389
How did you get the blood on you?

129
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,390
Mr. Sheng.

130
00:12:34,576 --> 00:12:36,945
Sheng Shaoqing poisoned your wine.

131
00:12:37,228 --> 00:12:39,530
Trying to harm your glands
while you're passed out

132
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:41,932
I've handed over the
video evidence to the police.

133
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,567
The police also confirmed.

134
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:46,070
Sheng Shaoqing authorized the kidnapping.

135
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:49,607
Your brother

136
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:52,575
is not too well.

137
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:55,846
But it's okay.

138
00:12:56,313 --> 00:12:57,313
Luckily.

139
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:01,585
It's a good thing the drugs
he gave weren't too strong.

140
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:04,688
Hua Yong.
What's going on?

141
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:06,557
Are you okay?

142
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:06,957
Yong.
Boss.

143
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:08,425
Yong.

144
00:13:08,893 --> 00:13:09,493
Doctor.

145
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,860
Doctor.

146
00:13:13,464 --> 00:13:14,831
I think it's hemorrhagic shock.

147
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:15,766
We need to save him now.
Emergency blood transfusion required.

148
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:17,401
What's his blood type?

149
00:13:17,402 --> 00:13:18,836
He's an S-class Alpha like me

150
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:19,970
I think it's type A.

151
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:21,638
Okay, I'll call the blood bank and
get a transfusion ready right away.

152
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,639
Wait a minute, Doctor.

153
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:23,741
My boss

154
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:25,108
is not Alpha blood type.

155
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:26,277
So what's his blood type?

156
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:28,611
My boss has a very rare blood type.

157
00:13:28,612 --> 00:13:29,280
You tell me.

158
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:30,481
What's his blood type?

159
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:34,317
The boss is...

160
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:35,585
Enigma.

161
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:37,087
Enigma blood type.

162
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:41,391
Qing is recovering well.

163
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:42,725
She'll be out in a few days.

164
00:13:42,726 --> 00:13:44,094
Thank you for taking care of me, sis.

165
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:44,528
Thank you.
No worries.

166
00:13:51,368 --> 00:13:52,002
Brother.

167
00:13:52,336 --> 00:13:53,871
Are you not feeling well?

168
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:55,406
You don't look so good.

169
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:57,207
No.

170
00:13:58,309 --> 00:13:59,210
Then.

171
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:00,544
Did something happen?

172
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:08,052
Did Gao Ming call you again?

173
00:14:08,385 --> 00:14:09,487
Don't get so excited.

174
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:11,296
Pay attention to your wounds.

175
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:13,022
Why does he keep coming back?

176
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:14,023
He only cares about your money

177
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:15,504
just badgering you over and over.

178
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,230
I'm the same

179
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:22,600
I've been sick for so long.

180
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:25,836
You've had to take on
both parental roles for me.

181
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:28,405
And worried about the
cost of my surgery.

182
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:30,840
I wish I wasn't born.

183
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:31,841
Stop talking nonsense.

184
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:34,244
Don't worry

185
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:36,247
I'll never give him money again.

186
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:37,715
He can't keep weighing me down.

187
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:40,543
I'm happy to take care of you.

188
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:42,493
so stop calling it a burden.

189
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:44,421
So.

190
00:14:44,422 --> 00:14:45,623
What's wrong with you?

191
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:48,425
I've noticed you've been
absent-minded these days.

192
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:54,832
I quit my job.

193
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,434
You scared me

194
00:14:57,601 --> 00:14:59,303
I thought something terrible was going on.

195
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:00,905
So what if you quit?

196
00:15:01,205 --> 00:15:02,072
I told you.

197
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:03,774
That Shen Wenlang is a miserly exploiter.

198
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,441
But I'm better now

199
00:15:05,442 --> 00:15:06,509
I can be discharged soon

200
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,411
I can make money too.
Qing.

201
00:15:15,152 --> 00:15:16,287
I'm pregnant.

202
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:24,929
What did the doctor say?

203
00:15:26,597 --> 00:15:27,597
Excessive blood loss.

204
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:28,598
Still in a coma.

205
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,769
But the good news is that
the vitals have stabilized.

206
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,650
Shouldn't be a big problem.

207
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:36,673
Where's Sheng Shaoyou?

208
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:42,746
He's at the boss's bedside.

209
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:44,448
I told you.

210
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:46,550
This little lunatic thinks he's so powerful

211
00:15:46,784 --> 00:15:48,118
he has no sense of restraint

212
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:50,120
he never stops stirring up trouble

213
00:15:50,654 --> 00:15:52,022
one day it'll backfire on him.

214
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,390
Wenlang.

215
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:55,593
The boss isn't awake yet.

216
00:15:55,893 --> 00:15:56,894
Cut the crap.

217
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:58,596
Am I wrong?

218
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:01,532
Having an unnatural constitution

219
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:03,932
doesn't give you license
to be reckless with your life.

220
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:05,328
Think about all these years.

221
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:06,803
Hasn't he done enough things

222
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:07,844
that gamble with his life?

223
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:10,507
Everything he does has everyone on pins and needles.

224
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:13,811
With such an adorable face

225
00:16:14,011 --> 00:16:15,446
but a cold, harsh personality.

226
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,074
He doesn't give a damn about anything else to get what he wants.

227
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,052
Is this something a normal person would do?

228
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:23,966
Wenlang.

229
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:27,124
You can't expect people who live
in that environment to be normal.

230
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:28,826
It's not fair to him.

231
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:00,291
Boqiao, have you noticed?

232
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:02,725
Shaoyou seems to be
interested in those good-looking.

233
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:05,029
Omegas, ones who love to cry.

234
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:07,031
Look at his exes.

235
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:08,799
It's basically the same.

236
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:11,769
It seems to be true.

237
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:14,705
He does seem to enjoy watching Omegas cry.

238
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:16,973
Yes.

239
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:20,811
I think the root cause is
Shaoyou's excessive self-demand.

240
00:17:21,145 --> 00:17:22,645
Otherwise, why would he envy those

241
00:17:22,646 --> 00:17:24,415
who can cry when they face grievances?

242
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:52,710
What are you doing here?

243
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:54,878
I'm looking for you.

244
00:17:58,482 --> 00:17:59,482
What's wrong?

245
00:17:59,683 --> 00:18:00,950
Is there a law that says

246
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:03,120
a cousin can't visit his
cousin for no reason?

247
00:18:04,588 --> 00:18:05,588
Yong.

248
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,325
Why are you suddenly looking in the mirror?

249
00:18:09,293 --> 00:18:11,095
Why are you suddenly looking in the mirror?

250
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:13,463
Could it be.

251
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:16,366
you're in love?

252
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,870
Yeah.

253
00:18:22,873 --> 00:18:23,873
Really?

254
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:28,912
Zuo.

255
00:18:29,446 --> 00:18:30,446
Let me ask you

256
00:18:31,215 --> 00:18:33,584
when you were with
Bea, you cried every day.

257
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:35,419
How the hell did you pull that off?

258
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:38,389
What do you mean, "how"?

259
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:43,961
How is someone

260
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:45,829
supposed to cry?

261
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:47,264
You feel sad,

262
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:49,299
and then tears come.

263
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:52,903
But I'd bet money you'll
never cry in your life

264
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:56,173
I've never seen you shed a tear.

265
00:18:56,707 --> 00:18:59,142
Bea and I were talking about this recently

266
00:18:59,143 --> 00:19:01,845
how on earth does he hold back tears?

267
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:06,150
Are your tear ducts broken or something?

268
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:37,448
[in Cantonese]
Where did this come from?

269
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:39,950
It's awful.

270
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:42,452
I made it.

271
00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:43,586
You did it?

272
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:45,989
Did you take the wrong pills?

273
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:48,759
You're so annoying.

274
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,795
Nobody asked.

275
00:20:04,408 --> 00:20:05,408
Boss.

276
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:07,478
The results are in.

277
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:09,513
Your eyes are very healthy.

278
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,225
Then why can't I cry?

279
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,393
You're strong, bold.

280
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,996
Aggressive, enterprising,
and very admirable.

281
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,934
I don't want admiration.

282
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:32,970
I want to be able to cry.

283
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,972
Do you have any good suggestions?

284
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:36,973
Maybe.

285
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:39,343
You could find a therapist.

286
00:20:43,146 --> 00:20:44,381
What do you mean?

287
00:20:45,082 --> 00:20:46,383
I'm not mentally healthy?

288
00:20:47,918 --> 00:20:48,986
I didn't mean that.

289
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:53,290
Toughness is a rare trait.

290
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,426
But vulnerability is also human nature.

291
00:20:58,028 --> 00:21:00,230
Haven't you ever felt sorrow

292
00:21:00,631 --> 00:21:01,632
helplessness

293
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:02,966
loss

294
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:04,935
or in pain?

295
00:21:07,638 --> 00:21:08,972
In those moments

296
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,440
when overwhelmed by emotion

297
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:13,477
the lacrimal glands
reflexively produce tears

298
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:15,546
that's how crying begins.

299
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:19,383
When pain feels unbearable

300
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,486
humans turn to tears as a way to soothe it.

301
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:27,424
Unbearable pain?

302
00:21:29,393 --> 00:21:30,393
I do

303
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:35,365
when I long for him

304
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:37,734
but can't get close

305
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:40,871
it's almost unbearable.

306
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,185
If I can't learn to shed tears.

307
00:21:59,323 --> 00:22:01,892
I might never bridge the gap between us.

308
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,830
Are you awake?

309
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,300
How's it feel?

310
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,270
Don't move.

311
00:22:19,343 --> 00:22:20,711
With such a serious injury.

312
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:22,004
And having lost so much blood

313
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:23,525
but not properly receiving treatment.

314
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,580
Hua Yong.

315
00:22:24,715 --> 00:22:26,275
What the hell is going on in your head?

316
00:22:27,784 --> 00:22:29,086
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheng.

317
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:30,954
Don't be angry.

318
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:32,389
Why should I be angry?

319
00:22:32,756 --> 00:22:35,125
A lying cheat like you is better off dead.

320
00:22:35,192 --> 00:22:36,760
Dead things don't cling.

321
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:39,095
Lie still

322
00:22:39,963 --> 00:22:40,963
I'll get the doctor.

323
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:45,969
Mr. Sheng, please don't go.

324
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:47,404
I'm fine.

325
00:22:47,437 --> 00:22:48,804
Look at your face.

326
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:50,307
This is clearly not 'fine'

327
00:22:52,342 --> 00:22:53,342
Well.

328
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,144
The doctor said you're
an ultra-niche blood type.

329
00:22:55,145 --> 00:22:57,213
There's no match in any
blood bank in the world.

330
00:22:57,214 --> 00:22:58,615
You can't lose any more blood.

331
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:02,251
Mr. Sheng.

332
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,755
Are you angry?

333
00:23:04,955 --> 00:23:06,323
But I didn't lie to you

334
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,758
I told you

335
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:08,791
I'm not an Alpha.

336
00:23:09,626 --> 00:23:11,227
It's Mr. Sheng who doesn't believe in it.

337
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:12,461
Who could possibly believe

338
00:23:12,462 --> 00:23:14,164
something like “Enigma” actually exists?

339
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:24,941
Hua Yong.

340
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:26,008
Mm.

341
00:23:26,543 --> 00:23:27,811
Say you love me.

342
00:23:28,745 --> 00:23:29,813
Is it real?

343
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:32,915
Don't move, stay still.

344
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,921
It's true, Mr. Sheng.

345
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:39,923
I love you.

346
00:23:40,624 --> 00:23:41,792
I hope you're happy

347
00:23:42,426 --> 00:23:43,927
and you like me too.

348
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:45,595
Then don't mess around anymore.

349
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:48,632
I can't be happy seeing you hurt.

350
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:49,933
I'm sad.

351
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:51,767
Hua Yong.

352
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:53,870
Do you want to see me in pain?

353
00:23:56,606 --> 00:23:57,341
Well.

354
00:23:57,574 --> 00:23:58,809
Then lie down

355
00:23:59,443 --> 00:24:00,443
I'll get the doctor.

356
00:24:04,715 --> 00:24:06,783
Didn't I tell you to lie still?

357
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:10,519
The wound has split again.

358
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,188
That's significant blood loss.

359
00:24:11,189 --> 00:24:12,289
Doesn't it hurt?

360
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:15,192
Mr. Sheng, I'm not in pain.

361
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:19,763
It's fine, right?

362
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,809
Does it hurt you to see me wounded?

363
00:24:36,446 --> 00:24:37,581
Hua Yong.

364
00:24:38,248 --> 00:24:39,449
It hurts me, too.

365
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:57,666
Don't worry, Mr. Sheng

366
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:58,667
I'll be fine

367
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:02,404
I've rebandaged Mr. Hua properly this time.

368
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:03,373
The wound is deep

369
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:04,441
and it hurts the glands.

370
00:25:04,608 --> 00:25:06,543
An ordinary person
wouldn't have survived this.

371
00:25:07,144 --> 00:25:08,878
You must follow
postoperative care strictly.

372
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:11,147
Try to avoid to excessive movement.

373
00:25:11,148 --> 00:25:12,149
And no water contact.

374
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:14,284
Okay, thank you.

375
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,154
Oh, Mr. Sheng.

376
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:20,222
Doctor Wang said your blood
report has several abnormalities.

377
00:25:20,223 --> 00:25:22,425
You'll need to have tested again.

378
00:25:22,692 --> 00:25:24,003
Would now be a convenient time for you?

379
00:25:24,027 --> 00:25:25,929
I'll have a colleague take you to the lab

380
00:25:26,163 --> 00:25:27,163
Abnormalities?

381
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:28,565
What's abnormal?

382
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:30,833
For safety's sake

383
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:32,903
we drew a full blood sample from Mr. Sheng

384
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:34,704
and conducted every possible test.

385
00:25:34,805 --> 00:25:38,175
The result shows that Sheng's
total progesterone is 12.6.

386
00:25:38,475 --> 00:25:40,744
It's a value only found during pregnancy.

387
00:25:42,646 --> 00:25:43,646
Pregnancy?

388
00:25:43,847 --> 00:25:45,916
The standard of your
hospital is a real concern

389
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,384
I'm an S-Class Alpha.

390
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:48,952
How can I get pregnant?

391
00:26:01,598 --> 00:26:02,866
He's not replying to WeChat

392
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:04,167
and his phone is off.

393
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:06,336
What the hell is Gao Tu doing?

394
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:09,372
Is he at the hospital with Gao Qing?

395
00:26:14,444 --> 00:26:16,413
Since I'm already here

396
00:26:16,913 --> 00:26:20,984
dropping by to visit my old
classmate's sister seems reasonable.

397
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,642
Gao Tu.

398
00:26:47,244 --> 00:26:48,245
Are you inside?

399
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:53,850
Are you okay?

400
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:55,485
Open the door.

401
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:00,924
I'm fine.

402
00:27:02,826 --> 00:27:03,826
Are you okay?

403
00:27:42,532 --> 00:27:43,532
Are you okay?

404
00:27:44,634 --> 00:27:45,634
Mr. Shen.

405
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,071
What are you doing here?

406
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:49,406
Hua Yong is hospitalized.

407
00:27:50,273 --> 00:27:51,273
I went to visit him.

408
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:00,984
Are you sure you're okay?

409
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:05,488
I'm fine.

410
00:28:05,522 --> 00:28:07,042
Then why don't you answer my messages?

411
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:10,760
Texts...

412
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,098
Maybe I didn't notice...

413
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:15,124
Didn't notice?

414
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,435
Then why did you pay me back?

415
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:20,770
The deadline was coming up.

416
00:28:28,945 --> 00:28:29,945
Mr. Shen.

417
00:28:30,013 --> 00:28:31,615
What do you want from me?

418
00:28:31,915 --> 00:28:33,049
What's wrong with you?

419
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:35,584
Why did you throw up?

420
00:28:38,488 --> 00:28:39,488
Gastroenteritis.

421
00:28:41,358 --> 00:28:42,358
Gao Tu

422
00:28:43,126 --> 00:28:44,126
tell the truth.

423
00:28:44,561 --> 00:28:45,561
Mr. Shen.

424
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:51,433
I have to take care of my family these days, I'm
very busy.

425
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:53,646
I don't look at my cell phone as much

426
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,670
Family?

427
00:28:56,673 --> 00:28:58,353
The Omega who got pregnant out of wedlock.

428
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,277
You threw up like that.

429
00:29:01,945 --> 00:29:03,945
If you didn't know, you'd
think you were pregnant.

430
00:29:04,214 --> 00:29:05,214
I didn't.

431
00:29:08,284 --> 00:29:10,520
Mr. Shen, please don't joke about this.

432
00:29:14,391 --> 00:29:15,759
Please pass it on for me.

433
00:29:17,027 --> 00:29:18,762
I wish Secretary Hua a speedy recovery.

434
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:20,863
I have to go.

435
00:29:20,864 --> 00:29:21,864
Don't go yet.

436
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:24,947
What the hell is wrong with you?

437
00:29:25,135 --> 00:29:26,135
You don't respond on WeChat.

438
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,971
Your phone is off.

439
00:29:28,972 --> 00:29:30,692
And you're making yourself look so haggard.

440
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:31,930
Gao Tu

441
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:33,149
What?

442
00:29:35,845 --> 00:29:37,013
Do you need money?

443
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:39,015
No.

444
00:29:39,115 --> 00:29:40,115
What do you mean by “no”?

445
00:29:43,053 --> 00:29:44,120
You look pale.

446
00:29:45,288 --> 00:29:46,848
Haven't you been eating properly again?

447
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:49,825
Gao Tu.

448
00:29:50,026 --> 00:29:51,694
Tell me if you have any problems.

449
00:29:52,495 --> 00:29:53,863
We were in the same class.

450
00:29:54,864 --> 00:29:56,266
I will definitely help you.

451
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,870
No need.

452
00:30:04,674 --> 00:30:06,009
I don't need any help.

453
00:30:07,711 --> 00:30:09,012
I eat a lot every day.

454
00:30:11,915 --> 00:30:13,483
Thank you, Mr. Shen, for your concern

455
00:30:14,384 --> 00:30:15,585
I've got things to do

456
00:30:15,885 --> 00:30:16,953
I'll leave.

457
00:30:26,629 --> 00:30:28,998
This is the third test already.

458
00:30:29,265 --> 00:30:30,365
The Progesterone levels

459
00:30:30,366 --> 00:30:31,634
are still the same as before.

460
00:30:32,802 --> 00:30:34,069
So it's confirmed

461
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,371
Mr. Sheng is pregnant.

462
00:30:36,206 --> 00:30:37,206
Yes.

463
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:40,410
We organized a
multidisciplinary consultation

464
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,610
and now we can basically
confirm it's a pregnancy.

465
00:30:43,246 --> 00:30:45,715
But based on the available data so far

466
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:47,416
there's no documented case of

467
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:50,086
pregnancy from an Enigma-Alpha bond.

468
00:30:50,754 --> 00:30:51,721
So?

469
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:54,557
Most of our experts
still have reservations.

470
00:30:54,891 --> 00:30:55,891
What do you mean?

471
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,060
Here's the thing.

472
00:30:58,428 --> 00:31:00,539
Although the drug residue
indicators in Mr. Sheng's blood

473
00:31:00,563 --> 00:31:02,465
are far below the teratogenic level.

474
00:31:02,732 --> 00:31:05,135
But we still need consider the history
of unknown drug ingestion.

475
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:06,970
So my personal advice is that

476
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,572
you'd better decide carefully.

477
00:31:09,973 --> 00:31:10,973
Decide what?

478
00:31:11,074 --> 00:31:12,175
The child's name?

479
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:14,010
We'll make a good decision.

480
00:31:16,646 --> 00:31:17,647
As a doctor

481
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:19,382
I don't recommend keeping the baby.

482
00:31:26,055 --> 00:31:28,191
You're making my Alpha abort our baby?

483
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:33,963
I know it's hard to accept.

484
00:31:34,597 --> 00:31:35,864
But we have to consider

485
00:31:35,865 --> 00:31:37,266
the unknown history of drug intake, right?

486
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:39,001
Can you please stop giving
me unnecessary advice?

487
00:31:39,002 --> 00:31:40,403
Don't make things difficult for me.

488
00:31:40,737 --> 00:31:42,639
Enigma's kids aren't that fragile.

489
00:31:43,006 --> 00:31:44,106
Keep your mouth shut

490
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:45,241
I'd appreciate it.

491
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,010
Alright, stop it.

492
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:49,846
Mr. Sheng.

493
00:31:50,713 --> 00:31:52,147
Threatening a doctor at
a doctor's appointment.

494
00:31:52,148 --> 00:31:53,349
You think you're in Country P?

495
00:31:54,784 --> 00:31:55,784
Mr. Sheng.

496
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:57,353
I wasn't threatening him.

497
00:31:58,288 --> 00:32:00,328
Don't worry about that
medication affecting Peanut.

498
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,925
Peanut has my genes

499
00:32:02,225 --> 00:32:03,992
and they won't be affected
by that small amount of drug exposure.

500
00:32:03,993 --> 00:32:04,993
Shut up!

501
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:07,197
I'll deal with you later.

502
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:13,001
Explain.

503
00:32:14,704 --> 00:32:15,705
Explain what?

504
00:32:17,207 --> 00:32:19,742
What's the deal with pregnancy
and permanent marking?

505
00:32:21,044 --> 00:32:22,412
I told you.

506
00:32:23,112 --> 00:32:24,947
The kidnappers injected you with cyanide.

507
00:32:24,948 --> 00:32:26,281
If I hadn't permanently marked you.

508
00:32:26,282 --> 00:32:27,150
you would've died.

509
00:32:27,151 --> 00:32:29,117
Mr. Sheng, if you die

510
00:32:29,118 --> 00:32:30,118
I'm gonna die, too.

511
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,921
A freak who can't even
be killed by cyanide.

512
00:32:32,922 --> 00:32:34,389
Stop acting like it's
life or death all the time.

513
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,310
Just because you're
Enigma and smarter than most

514
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,937
doesn't mean the rest
of us Alphas are idiots

515
00:32:37,961 --> 00:32:38,962
I wouldn't dare.

516
00:32:41,064 --> 00:32:42,584
So what's the deal with the pregnancy?

517
00:32:43,366 --> 00:32:45,134
I said we should take precautions.

518
00:32:45,535 --> 00:32:46,769
Mr. Sheng refused.

519
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:50,339
But still.

520
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,674
It's mostly my fault

521
00:32:51,975 --> 00:32:53,343
I couldn't resist the temptation.

522
00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:56,446
But when it comes to Mr. Sheng

523
00:32:56,746 --> 00:32:58,414
I'm just weak-willed.

524
00:32:59,048 --> 00:33:00,450
I can resist anything...

525
00:33:04,754 --> 00:33:06,222
except your temptation.

526
00:33:07,156 --> 00:33:08,156
Besides.

527
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:10,158
I really want us

528
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,728
to have a baby together soon.

529
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:19,669
You should be sold to
the zoo as an exhibit.

530
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:23,573
Will Mr. Sheng come to
watch my performance?

531
00:33:23,748 --> 00:33:24,582
Playing what?

532
00:33:24,607 --> 00:33:25,607
The role of a pervert?

533
00:33:29,245 --> 00:33:30,245
A mermaid.

534
00:33:30,913 --> 00:33:32,215
I'm good at swimming.

535
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:35,084
I once read a fairytale

536
00:33:35,385 --> 00:33:36,419
and it said,

537
00:33:37,387 --> 00:33:39,087
Mermaids need the bodily
fluids of their beloved humans

538
00:33:39,088 --> 00:33:40,590
to transform into having legs.

539
00:33:42,358 --> 00:33:43,626
How did that book you read

540
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,627
ever get published?

541
00:33:45,628 --> 00:33:46,628
Unpublished.

542
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,331
I wrote that myself.

543
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:50,133
Ten short stories in all.

544
00:33:50,466 --> 00:33:52,402
The main characters are Mr. Sheng and me.

545
00:33:53,703 --> 00:33:55,672
Seriously, what breed of pervert are you?

546
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,346
The kind that can make Mr. Sheng pregnant.

547
00:34:04,714 --> 00:34:06,754
How could I really believe
that you could make me…?

548
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,085
Mr. Sheng, I've told you before.

549
00:34:10,086 --> 00:34:11,086
Do you remember?

550
00:34:11,154 --> 00:34:12,388
And I said.

551
00:34:12,522 --> 00:34:14,924
Our first child will be called Peanut.

552
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,160
Mr. Sheng.

553
00:34:18,394 --> 00:34:19,929
Just have a baby for me

554
00:34:20,229 --> 00:34:22,264
I really, really want a kid from you

555
00:34:22,265 --> 00:34:23,265
I'm begging you.

556
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:27,948
I'm an Alpha, how the hell
am I supposed to get pregnant?

557
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,144
A few years ago

558
00:34:35,311 --> 00:34:36,411
I built a specialized medical team

559
00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:39,015
for Mr. Sheng in Country P.

560
00:34:39,515 --> 00:34:40,917
As long as Mr. Sheng is willing.

561
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,430
They'll come to JIANGHU anytime.

562
00:34:44,387 --> 00:34:46,055
Don't you want to have a child with me?

563
00:34:47,023 --> 00:34:49,503
Are you really in such a hurry
to have a child out of wedlock?

564
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,794
But I don't.

565
00:34:52,562 --> 00:34:54,030
I plan every day

566
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,999
how to propose to Mr. Sheng.

567
00:34:59,602 --> 00:35:00,903
Stop saying ridiculous things.

568
00:35:02,305 --> 00:35:03,305
To be frank

569
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,049
besides enhanced
purification and healing abilities

570
00:35:06,442 --> 00:35:09,078
what other effects will
permanent marking have on me?

571
00:35:11,114 --> 00:35:12,515
Almost all good effects.

572
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,884
Almost all?
Yes.

573
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,489
The only downside is that.

574
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:21,890
Mr. Sheng's rut period

575
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:23,092
will become a heat period

576
00:35:23,226 --> 00:35:24,360
and synchronize with me.

577
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:25,894
Beside these.

578
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:26,963
All good effects.

579
00:35:27,964 --> 00:35:29,731
My physical strength,
intelligence, and healing ability

580
00:35:29,732 --> 00:35:31,210
all far exceed those of ordinary humans.

581
00:35:31,234 --> 00:35:34,114
These will all be passed on to the
other half through permanent marking.

582
00:35:36,038 --> 00:35:37,038
Mr. Sheng.

583
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:40,843
You'll have 30% of my abilities.

584
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:44,559
And one hundred percent of my love.

585
00:35:45,014 --> 00:35:46,014
What about the price?

586
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:48,203
Talking about rights
without responsibilities

587
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:49,786
Mr. Hua, are you coaxing a child?

588
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:51,686
Your only obligation

589
00:35:51,687 --> 00:35:52,789
is to love me.

590
00:35:53,723 --> 00:35:55,291
Can you do that, Mr. Sheng?

591
00:35:55,391 --> 00:35:57,711
Mr. Hua's habit of acting
first and asking questions later

592
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,195
doesn't make him easy to love.

593
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,099
So, Mr. Sheng, what kind do you like?

594
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,199
The obedient kind.

595
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,170
Lie to me again

596
00:36:08,404 --> 00:36:09,404
and I'll kill you.

597
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,784
I would never lie to you.

598
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:37,920
[A close up of a lemon soda bottle for some reason?]

599
00:36:42,205 --> 00:36:43,072
Brother, get some rest

600
00:36:43,073 --> 00:36:44,240
I'll do it myself.

601
00:36:44,307 --> 00:36:45,307
That won't do.

602
00:36:45,408 --> 00:36:46,441
Although you got discharged from the hospital.

603
00:36:46,442 --> 00:36:48,143
you still just had major surgery.

604
00:36:48,144 --> 00:36:49,545
You still need to get some rest.

605
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:52,682
Don't you need to rest more than I do?

606
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:53,783
Sit down
I'll be fine.

607
00:36:57,086 --> 00:36:58,086
And brother.

608
00:36:58,654 --> 00:37:00,323
Are we really moving back to YISHI?

609
00:37:00,423 --> 00:37:02,724
The medical facilities
there are much worse, right?

610
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:04,327
Will it affect the baby?

611
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:07,363
We have no choice, the rent
in JIANGHU is too expensive.

612
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,533
Besides, the medical
care in YISHI isn't that bad.

613
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:12,801
But brother, if we stay in JIANGHU.

614
00:37:12,802 --> 00:37:14,437
Dad contacted me the other day.

615
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,172
You can't give him money anymore.

616
00:37:16,873 --> 00:37:17,873
I know I know.

617
00:37:18,474 --> 00:37:20,209
I changed my phone number.

618
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:23,079
But if we don't move

619
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:24,847
I'm still worried about trouble.

620
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:27,315
You're right

621
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,785
I told you can't contact him anymore.

622
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:31,320
Gao Ming is a bottomless pit.

623
00:37:31,354 --> 00:37:32,088
The more you give

624
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:33,089
the more he gambles

625
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,157
and the more he owes.

626
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:35,825
But

627
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:37,292
given your current condition

628
00:37:37,293 --> 00:37:38,560
wouldn't it be better to stay in a big city

629
00:37:38,561 --> 00:37:40,563
with easy access to major hospitals?

630
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:47,036
If you're worried about the rent

631
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,105
we can get a smaller place

632
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:51,573
even in the suburbs.

633
00:37:51,574 --> 00:37:53,819
But that would make it
inconvenient for you to attend classes.

634
00:37:53,843 --> 00:37:55,111
YISHI is a bit small.

635
00:37:55,444 --> 00:37:57,412
But the educational
resources are pretty good, so...

636
00:37:57,413 --> 00:37:58,281
Brother.

637
00:37:58,282 --> 00:37:59,916
You're not alone now.

638
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:01,349
You can't just think of me.

639
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,085
You have to think about the baby.

640
00:38:03,753 --> 00:38:04,587
Oh.

641
00:38:04,654 --> 00:38:06,187
Doctor Wang of the
Pheromone department of HECI

642
00:38:06,188 --> 00:38:07,890
holds free clinics every Sunday

643
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,157
I asked the nurse for help

644
00:38:09,158 --> 00:38:10,638
and got his assistant's phone number.

645
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,228
You can find him in the future.

646
00:38:13,863 --> 00:38:14,863
Brother.

647
00:38:14,997 --> 00:38:16,399
Let's stay in JIANGHU.

648
00:38:16,766 --> 00:38:18,467
Big cities have better medical resources

649
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:19,601
and more opportunities.

650
00:38:19,635 --> 00:38:20,969
When I graduate and start earning money

651
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,039
I can support the family with you, okay?

652
00:38:24,807 --> 00:38:25,807
Good.

653
00:38:26,642 --> 00:38:27,642
Mm.

654
00:38:46,228 --> 00:38:47,228
Tea's ready.

655
00:38:47,597 --> 00:38:49,632
Shall I bring it over to you?

656
00:39:17,426 --> 00:39:20,630
Hello, the number you
dialed does not exist.

657
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,365
Please check it and dial later.

658
00:39:27,303 --> 00:39:30,506
Hello, the number you
dialed does not exist.

659
00:39:30,606 --> 00:39:32,241
Please check it and dial later.

660
00:39:36,312 --> 00:39:39,315
Hello, the number you
dialed does not exist.

661
00:39:42,451 --> 00:39:45,687
Hello, The number you
dialed does not exist.

662
00:39:45,688 --> 00:39:47,323
Please check it and dial later.

663
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,320
Hey.

664
00:40:19,455 --> 00:40:20,455
What's up.

665
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:22,358
Gao Tu's phone number got disconnected.

666
00:40:22,692 --> 00:40:23,692
So?

667
00:40:23,793 --> 00:40:25,728
How did his number become disconnected?

668
00:40:26,128 --> 00:40:28,140
When a number's no longer
in use, it becomes invalid.

669
00:40:28,164 --> 00:40:29,165
It's just common sense.

670
00:40:29,598 --> 00:40:31,000
How am I supposed to contact him?

671
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:33,268
You already agreed to let him resign.

672
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:34,436
Why are you still contacting him?

673
00:40:34,437 --> 00:40:36,204
Is there some law that says once he quits

674
00:40:36,205 --> 00:40:37,965
I'm not allowed to reach
out to him anymore?

675
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:40,241
Hua Yong.

676
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,011
Gao Tu moved.

677
00:40:42,244 --> 00:40:43,446
But he didn't go back home

678
00:40:44,246 --> 00:40:45,815
and he hasn't joined another company.

679
00:40:46,391 --> 00:40:47,725
And he also deleted his number.

680
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,750
Do you think...

681
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:50,965
something might have happened to him?

682
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:53,988
And you went to his
hometown to look for him?

683
00:40:54,123 --> 00:40:55,123
Yeah.

684
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:56,358
What's the problem?

685
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:00,595
Wenlang.

686
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,250
Secretary Gao's probably the
kind of person who has a plan.

687
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:06,801
I think he just doesn't want to
be around people and things from the past.

688
00:41:06,802 --> 00:41:07,803
How can that be?

689
00:41:08,504 --> 00:41:09,504
Why not?

690
00:41:13,776 --> 00:41:14,776
Wenlang.

691
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:16,945
Do you like Secretary Gao too?

692
00:41:16,946 --> 00:41:17,946
How can that be?

693
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:19,948
Wait.

694
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,385
What do you mean by “too”?

695
00:41:23,953 --> 00:41:25,087
Who else likes him?

696
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:27,989
Nobody.

697
00:41:28,357 --> 00:41:30,091
I hate talking to idiots.

698
00:41:30,092 --> 00:41:30,726
That's all.

699
00:41:31,093 --> 00:41:31,627
Wait a second.

700
00:41:31,927 --> 00:41:32,927
Hua Yong.

701
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:35,407
Don't forget who helped you put on
that act to win over Sheng Shaoyou

702
00:41:35,431 --> 00:41:37,008
Are you planning to burn
the bridge after crossing it?

703
00:41:37,032 --> 00:41:38,032
Hmm?

704
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,367
Burning the bridge after crossing it

705
00:41:39,368 --> 00:41:40,636
is not against the law.

706
00:41:41,237 --> 00:41:42,237
You.

707
00:41:44,907 --> 00:41:45,907
What's wrong?

708
00:41:47,109 --> 00:41:48,810
If you can't look yourself in the eye.

709
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:50,731
No matter how many
times you call, it's useless.

710
00:41:51,013 --> 00:41:53,248
Wenlang, wait until you figure it out

711
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:55,250
whether you like Secretary Gao or not.

712
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:56,051
Wait, wait.

713
00:41:56,118 --> 00:41:57,118
What?

714
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,720
I've thought it through.

715
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:01,123
What do you think we should do?

716
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:04,693
Do what?

717
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,328
How can I find Gao Tu?

718
00:42:08,831 --> 00:42:11,634
So you're admitting that
you like Secretary Gao.

719
00:42:11,967 --> 00:42:13,802
Can you stop talking that much?

720
00:42:13,803 --> 00:42:16,071
Tell me, how do I find Gao Tu?

721
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:20,108
Wenlang, at this point

722
00:42:20,109 --> 00:42:22,011
it's probably too late to fix things.

723
00:42:22,111 --> 00:42:23,111
What do you mean?

724
00:42:24,013 --> 00:42:25,881
Do you know who Omega was that night?

725
00:42:26,081 --> 00:42:28,083
Gao Tu said the hotel's CCTV was down

726
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:29,851
and he didn't get a picture of that face.

727
00:42:30,352 --> 00:42:32,488
What's this got to do
with me finding Gao Tu?

728
00:42:35,191 --> 00:42:36,692
Do you mean that.

729
00:42:37,393 --> 00:42:39,495
Gao Tu was in league with that Omega?

730
00:42:39,528 --> 00:42:40,848
They plotted against me together.

731
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,531
Gao Tu was Omega that night.

732
00:42:43,432 --> 00:42:44,432
What did you say?

733
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:46,936
I've sent the photo to Secretary Gao.

734
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:49,438
Let him decide if he
wants to tell you the truth.

735
00:42:49,872 --> 00:42:50,973
The result is

736
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:55,511
seems like he's made up his
mind not to continue with you.

737
00:42:55,678 --> 00:42:57,313
That's why he chose to quit.

738
00:42:58,013 --> 00:42:59,048
How can that be?

739
00:43:00,115 --> 00:43:01,317
Gao Tu is a Beta.

740
00:43:02,184 --> 00:43:03,184
Wenlang.

741
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:04,586
Secretary Gao should be your

742
00:43:04,587 --> 00:43:06,555
only acceptable Omega left.

743
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:08,224
You'd better hold on tight

744
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,426
or you might end up growing old alone.

745
00:43:13,028 --> 00:43:14,028
I'll leave you to it

746
00:43:14,129 --> 00:43:16,097
I have to keep making soup for Mr. Sheng.

747
00:43:16,098 --> 00:43:17,098
Good Luck.

748
00:43:31,714 --> 00:43:33,749
Lao Gao, you gambled
all night again yesterday.

749
00:43:35,117 --> 00:43:36,251
Fucking hell, what a bummer

750
00:43:36,252 --> 00:43:38,012
I've been losing for a
whole month straight.

751
00:43:38,187 --> 00:43:39,187
That's not work.

752
00:43:46,195 --> 00:43:47,328
Hello? Who's there?

753
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:48,230
Oh, Hi

754
00:43:48,306 --> 00:43:50,374
I work for Omega Protection Agency.

755
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,635
Are you Mr. Gao Ming,
family member of Gao Tu?

756
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:55,538
Omega Protection Agency.

757
00:43:55,871 --> 00:43:56,405
No,

758
00:43:56,406 --> 00:43:58,474
What does this have to
do with my son, Gao Tu?

759
00:43:58,974 --> 00:43:59,974
It's because

760
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:02,545
Mr. Gao Tu suffers from a
severe pheromone disorder.

761
00:44:02,645 --> 00:44:04,013
And he've been seeing a doctor.

762
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:06,749
But he hasn't been to
the hospital for two weeks.

763
00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:08,183
Considering his safety.

764
00:44:08,184 --> 00:44:09,344
The doctor called the police.

765
00:44:10,386 --> 00:44:12,554
No, what the hell are you talking about?

766
00:44:12,888 --> 00:44:14,957
Mr. Gao is in critical condition.

767
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,691
Omega with a pheromone disorder

768
00:44:16,692 --> 00:44:18,336
shouldn't have gotten
pregnant without authorization.

769
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,929
We can't reach him now.

770
00:44:19,995 --> 00:44:21,897
If you, as a family
member, can contact him.

771
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:23,851
Please make sure he gets medical attention.

772
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:46,288
Boss.

773
00:44:46,722 --> 00:44:49,358
The ads you ordered
are all set.

774
00:44:51,278 --> 00:44:52,260
Hmm.

775
00:45:39,842 --> 00:45:41,210
Have you seen the news yet?

776
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:44,145
X Hotel, which never accepts ad placements.

777
00:45:44,146 --> 00:45:47,182
The billboard is actually looping
a marriage proposal today.

778
00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:49,017
The one being proposed to

779
00:45:49,018 --> 00:45:51,153
is Mr. Sheng from SHENGFANG Biotech.

780
00:45:51,253 --> 00:45:52,553
Of course.

781
00:45:52,554 --> 00:45:54,756
It's been trending all morning.

782
00:45:54,757 --> 00:45:56,091
That's so romantic.

783
00:45:56,525 --> 00:45:58,259
You know who?

784
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,094
Who the hell is it?

785
00:45:59,095 --> 00:46:00,328
That's very thoughtful.

786
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:01,896
It's not just about thoughtfulness

787
00:46:01,897 --> 00:46:03,699
it's about money and love.

788
00:46:03,866 --> 00:46:05,633
Do you even know what
kind of place X Hotel is?

789
00:46:05,634 --> 00:46:07,835
Even a standard room costs
tens of thousands a night.

790
00:46:07,836 --> 00:46:10,072
Let alone a high-profile ad like this.

791
00:46:10,906 --> 00:46:11,906
Look at this.

792
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,242
It's all over the Internet.

793
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:14,709
They say the one who proposed in public

794
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,979
is the mysterious head of X Holdings.

795
00:46:17,713 --> 00:46:19,782
Mr. Sheng is an S-class Alpha, right?

796
00:46:19,915 --> 00:46:22,817
Who would've thought the
all-powerful head of X Holdings

797
00:46:22,818 --> 00:46:24,852
.turns out to be an Omega chasing love?

798
00:46:24,853 --> 00:46:26,555
That's wild.

799
00:46:27,189 --> 00:46:28,489
So jealous.

800
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:29,991
Who could say no to that?

801
00:46:29,992 --> 00:46:31,426
A public confession like that.

802
00:46:31,427 --> 00:46:34,128
Yeah, back when I had a
fight with my Alpha in school.

803
00:46:34,129 --> 00:46:36,297
He posted a public
apology on the bulletin board.

804
00:46:36,298 --> 00:46:38,434
I was so touched, I nearly
married him on the spot.

805
00:46:39,468 --> 00:46:41,003
A public apology?

806
00:46:42,171 --> 00:46:43,172
Mr. Shen.

807
00:46:47,009 --> 00:46:48,009
Nosy.

808
00:46:49,178 --> 00:46:50,978
Why did my father call
me here in such a hurry?

809
00:46:50,979 --> 00:46:52,213
Is it a recurring condition?

810
00:46:52,214 --> 00:46:53,649
The chairman's condition is stable.

811
00:46:53,715 --> 00:46:54,216
You're here

812
00:46:54,217 --> 00:46:56,452
about the X Hotel
billboard proposal, I assume
