00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:37,968
[Episode 12]

2
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,527
Drive. Don't lose them.

3
00:02:15,527 --> 00:02:18,931
The one in that car is my Alpha.

4
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:33,913
Boss, should we kill him now

5
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:36,583
or cut out his glands first?

6
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,184
Start with the glands.

7
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:41,421
If we get a recording
of the torture after gland removal,

8
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:43,722
the client's willing to pay extra.

9
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:50,463
Shit, he's awake.

10
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:51,765
Damn it.

11
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:55,368
Wasn't that dose enough
to knock out an elephant for a day?

12
00:02:55,368 --> 00:02:58,638
This is what an S-class Alpha is like?

13
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:01,541
Like a freaking monster.

14
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,476
What are you panicking for?

15
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:05,511
It's good that he's awake.

16
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:08,681
Now I can see for myself...

17
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:15,521
how an S-class dies at the hands
of low-level Alphas like us.

18
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:42,882
Gentlemen.

19
00:03:42,882 --> 00:03:45,218
We've never even met before.

20
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:47,720
I doubt we have any bad blood between us.

21
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,101
You two.

22
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:06,940
The Sheng family may not be saints.

23
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,676
But we rarely make enemies.

24
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:15,547
If you're here for money...

25
00:04:17,117 --> 00:04:21,920
Why not free me first

26
00:04:22,522 --> 00:04:25,225
and talk this out calmly?

27
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:26,326
Shut up.

28
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:27,827
Cut the crap.

29
00:04:27,827 --> 00:04:29,596
You've only got one choice.

30
00:04:29,596 --> 00:04:31,264
Lie down and get castrated.

31
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:33,032
Castrated?

32
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,415
By you two?

33
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:24,717
You think you can castrate me?

34
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:40,400
This is an anesthetic laced with cyanide.

35
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,602
So what if you're an S-class?

36
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:44,170
Take one of my darts

37
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,607
and even a Z-class would be dead.

38
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:50,710
Fuck, how dare you ambush me.

39
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,845
I'll take your life.

40
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:55,047
Go to hell!

41
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:07,860
Who the hell are you?

42
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,695
How did you get in?

43
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:17,303
First, there's no such thing
as a Z-class Alpha.

44
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:20,306
S-class is the top of the food chain.

45
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:22,208
Second,

46
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,877
your knife is blinding my eyes.

47
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:27,713
Third,

48
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:31,383
he's my Alpha.

49
00:06:32,318 --> 00:06:34,420
You want his life?

50
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:38,791
Who the hell do you think you are?

51
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:10,890
Kneel and apologize to Mr. Sheng right now

52
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,393
I'll spare your lives out of humanitarianism.

53
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:20,833
My patience is running thin.

54
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,569
I'll count to three.

55
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:26,205
One.

56
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:35,948
- Three.
- Fuck, you can skip numbers?

57
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:56,869
Who the hell are you?

58
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:08,748
Shitty aim by the way

59
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:10,717
I only brought two bullets.

60
00:08:10,717 --> 00:08:12,085
You're out of ammo.

61
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:13,685
Oh.

62
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:16,188
Now what?

63
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:27,800
As much as I want you dead...

64
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,568
But...

65
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:35,707
Never mind.

66
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:41,380
Cyanide is highly toxic.

67
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,150
A hit means certain death.

68
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,519
Killing is illegal.

69
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,921
Mr. Sheng is so kind.

70
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:51,724
He gets furious even when I lie.

71
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:53,559
He'd never like a murderer

72
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,061
who kills in front of him.

73
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,369
Consider yourselves lucky.

74
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:30,863
Mr. Sheng.

75
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:34,233
Permanent marking should be a beautiful thing.

76
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:37,403
I wanted to save it for after marriage.

77
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:40,138
But now, we have to
go through the formalities later.

78
00:09:43,943 --> 00:09:47,180
Mr. Sheng, you've been poisoned.

79
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,348
If I don't permanently mark you,

80
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:51,650
I can't save your life.

81
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,355
You must forgive me.

82
00:09:56,355 --> 00:10:00,292
Or I'll go crazy with sadness.

83
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:55,681
Mr. Sheng.

84
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,384
You finally belong to me.

85
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:02,622
I'll always be good to you.

86
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:04,823
I'll give you anything.

87
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,965
Be my exclusive Omega.

88
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,195
So pitiful.

89
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,832
The heat from permanent marking

90
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,434
must be awful for Mr. Sheng.

91
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:18,130
I'm so hot and uncomfortable.

92
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,968
Mr. Sheng.

93
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:26,471
Do you know who I am?

94
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:31,710
Hua Yong.

95
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:46,359
Hua Yong.

96
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:49,461
Mr. Sheng, it's me.

97
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:52,565
Are you sure you don't hate me anymore?

98
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:55,033
Are you sure you'll talk to me?

99
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,142
You're so annoying.

100
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:05,344
I hate liars.

101
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:07,479
I hate lunatics.

102
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,115
But, Hua Yong...

103
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,852
I really like you so much.

104
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:14,419
Hua Yong, one more time, okay?

105
00:13:42,681 --> 00:13:45,384
Relax, darling.

106
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:47,620
Good.

107
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,221
Honey.

108
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:24,824
Hello, Mr. Shen?

109
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:26,392
Do you know where Mr. Sheng is?

110
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:29,261
How would I know where Sheng Shao You went?

111
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:32,063
Then could you try contacting Mr. Hua?

112
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:35,601
Sorry, I can't reach Mr. Sheng either.

113
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:37,470
And Mr. Hua isn't answering his phone.

114
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,038
That's why I called you.

115
00:14:39,038 --> 00:14:40,639
I couldn't reach either of them.

116
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,409
Sorry, I can't help you.

117
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:44,876
Okay.

118
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,050
Secretary Gao.

119
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,985
Secretary General.

120
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:54,420
You're finally back.

121
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,990
You have no idea how lost Mr. Shen's been
while you were gone.

122
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,425
The rest of us in the secretarial office

123
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:00,926
were walking on eggshells every day.

124
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:05,164
We're afraid of getting caught
for any little thing.

125
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:06,899
Sorry.

126
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,268
Some things came up.

127
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:11,470
And my sister had surgery, too.

128
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,240
So, I took a few days off.

129
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,474
Is everything okay now?

130
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:17,309
Did the surgery go well?

131
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:18,377
All settled.

132
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:19,779
The surgery went fine, too.

133
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:21,113
Thank you for your concern.

134
00:15:21,113 --> 00:15:22,848
I...

135
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:24,316
Secretary Gao, are you all right?

136
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:26,351
You look really pale.

137
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:28,721
Sorry.

138
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:30,790
I need to use the restroom.

139
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,390
Go on.

140
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,154
Secretary Gao, are you okay?

141
00:16:02,154 --> 00:16:04,490
Did you eat something bad?

142
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,792
Maybe.

143
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:08,627
Our neighbor, she's an Omega.

144
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:10,529
She's been throwing up a lot, too.

145
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:12,364
But she's in early pregnancy,

146
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:13,899
so it's probably morning sickness.

147
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:16,669
For you, it might just be acute gastritis.

148
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:17,903
Take it seriously

149
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:19,004
and make sure you take your meds.

150
00:16:19,004 --> 00:16:22,741
If it gets worse, go see a doctor.

151
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:26,145
Okay.

152
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:28,780
I will, thank you.

153
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:49,768
All right, anything else?

154
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:53,806
Our neighbor, she's an Omega.

155
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:55,741
She's been throwing up a lot, too.

156
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:57,610
But she's in early pregnancy,

157
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,577
so it's probably morning sickness.

158
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:04,049
Grab me a pregnancy test kit too.

159
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:06,484
Sure, here it is.

160
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:45,224
Morning, Secretary Gao.

161
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:46,825
Morning.

162

[Resignation Application Form]
[Applicant: Gao Tu, Signature]

163
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,830
Secretary Gao.

164
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:29,835
Could you drop the R&D report
at Mr. Shen's office?

165
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:32,701
Sure, I'll take it there now.

166
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:35,167
[Resignation Application Form]
[Applicant: Gao Tu, Signature]

167
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:14,879
Good morning, Mr. Sheng.

168
00:19:21,387 --> 00:19:23,422
What time is it?

169
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:25,391
12:30.

170
00:19:25,391 --> 00:19:29,894
But you've been asleep for two days now.

171
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,915
Still feeling unwell?

172
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:08,366
What about those kidnappers?

173
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:11,002
I sent them to the police.

174
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:15,474
Mr. Sheng, you were out for over 24 hours.

175
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:17,942
You must be thirsty, have some water.

176
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:23,715
You turned them to the police.

177
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:24,983
Yeah.

178
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:26,118
I figured you wouldn't be happy

179
00:20:26,118 --> 00:20:27,553
if I handled it myself.

180
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:29,822
Mr. Hua, coming from a background
like X Holdings,

181
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:32,124
born from arms trading
and used to life being cheap...

182
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:35,627
I'm surprised you'd bother
sending two kidnappers to the police.

183
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:37,729
You're exaggerating, Mr. Sheng.

184
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:39,598
Life being cheap? Really?

185
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:42,601
X Holdings has operated for years in Country P.

186
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:45,270
Sure, there are some rumors
from back in the day.

187
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,640
Special times called for special means.

188
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,642
But now, Jiang Hu is a society ruled by law.

189
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:54,178
So, of course, we let the law handle it.

190
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,584
That's why you called the police

191
00:20:58,584 --> 00:21:01,019
and made me come change your door code.

192
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,620
Yes.

193
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:05,724
That's what the banner said
in the neighborhood.

194
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:08,192
"In trouble? Call the police."

195
00:21:09,194 --> 00:21:12,598
How did you even get in without the code?

196
00:21:12,598 --> 00:21:14,900
It's just a door code.

197
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,201
Not a big deal.

198
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:18,169
But you've been ignoring me.

199
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:23,308
That's my biggest problem in life.

200
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:26,678
Stop playing the victim

201
00:21:26,678 --> 00:21:28,247
I'm not pretending.

202
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:30,148
I really am pitiful.

203
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:36,921
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheng.

204
00:21:38,023 --> 00:21:39,625
I didn't mean to deceive you.

205
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,760
A lie is a lie.

206
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,730
Doesn't matter if you meant it or not.

207
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,599
Hua Yong, you planned everything,

208
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,234
step by step.

209
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:51,302
What exactly do you want?

210
00:21:53,071 --> 00:21:55,506
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheng.

211
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:59,311
I like you.

212
00:21:59,311 --> 00:22:02,580
So, I wanted to become someone you'd like, too.

213
00:22:05,751 --> 00:22:07,885
I was hoping you'd like me back.

214
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,758
You like me, so you lied to me?

215
00:22:12,758 --> 00:22:15,960
No. I never meant to lie to you.

216
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:19,965
It's just... the kind of person you like,

217
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,833
is so different from who I really am.

218
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,402
- So...
- I told you.

219
00:22:23,402 --> 00:22:25,671
I don't like Alphas.

220
00:22:25,671 --> 00:22:28,040
But I already
marked you permanently, Mr. Sheng.

221
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,675
You sound delusional, go get that checked.

222
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:31,009
A permanent mark?

223
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:34,345
What, you really think I'm an Omega?

224
00:22:35,581 --> 00:22:38,583
I'm not lying, Mr. Sheng.

225
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:44,122
You hate lies.

226
00:22:44,122 --> 00:22:46,958
So, I won't ever lie to you again.

227
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:54,433
Mr. Sheng, are you hungry?

228
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:56,168
I'm okay.

229
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:58,002
I'm not too hungry

230
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,738
I'll go take a shower.

231
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:39,945
Mr. Sheng, let me help.

232
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:41,680
Sorry.

233
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,748
It's my fault I lost control.

234
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:50,589
Mr. Sheng, stop pretending to be fine.

235
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:51,957
You're the one who'll end up hurt.

236
00:23:51,957 --> 00:23:53,358
And I'm the one who'll suffer with you.

237
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:55,060
We both lose.

238
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,794
What's the point?

239
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:09,139
Come in.

240
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:26,558
What is it?

241
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:28,326
Spit it out.

242
00:24:31,863 --> 00:24:34,766
Gao Tu, say what you need to say.

243
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,567
Stop beating around the bush.

244
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:41,072
Mr. Shen...

245
00:24:41,907 --> 00:24:44,642
I have a question.

246
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:50,648
Then ask.

247
00:24:54,112 --> 00:24:55,712
What if...

248
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:59,424
I mean, hypothetically...

249
00:24:59,424 --> 00:25:04,496
What if an Omega

250
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:05,497
got pregnant with your child?

251
00:25:05,497 --> 00:25:07,432
An Omega?

252
00:25:07,432 --> 00:25:09,201
Pregnant with my child?

253
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:10,601
Yeah.

254
00:25:12,037 --> 00:25:13,472
Obviously, I'd tell them to get rid of it.

255
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,006
What else?

256
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:17,109
Disgusting.

257
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:18,709
Oh.

258
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,349
Gao Tu.

259
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:26,717
You found that Omega from that night?

260
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,387
No.

261
00:25:29,387 --> 00:25:31,989
I was just wondering.

262
00:25:34,926 --> 00:25:37,429
Can you not ask such dumb questions?

263
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:40,898
You know I hate Omegas.
(Watch on www.kisskh.ovh or www.kisskh.la to support Admin)

264
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,602
Anything else?

265
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:48,940
Do you not like kids either?

266
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,342
Nope.

267
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,909
Hate them.

268
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:57,482
But forcing an Omega to get an abortion...

269
00:25:57,482 --> 00:25:59,851
Gao Tu, do you really want to talk to me

270
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:02,520
about Omega pregnancies right now?

271
00:26:07,926 --> 00:26:10,027
Wait...

272
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:15,234
Don't tell me the heat-crazed Omega
you've been seeing is pregnant?

273
00:26:15,234 --> 00:26:17,435
N-No.

274
00:26:17,435 --> 00:26:18,770
Gao Tu, get real.

275
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,605
You're a Beta.

276
00:26:20,605 --> 00:26:22,541
Your chances of knocking up an Omega

277
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:24,910
are lower than winning the lottery.

278
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,679
Even if they're pregnant,

279
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,282
don't get tricked into taking responsibility.

280
00:26:30,282 --> 00:26:32,517
With those heat-driven things...

281
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:35,387
Even if one ends up pregnant,

282
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:37,389
you think it's your baby?

283
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,324
Don't be naive.

284
00:26:39,324 --> 00:26:40,958
Mr. Shen.

285
00:26:42,127 --> 00:26:44,930
Stop insulting Omegas.

286
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,466
This violates the ABO Equality Agreement.

287
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:50,602
What's wrong with you, Gao Tu?

288
00:26:50,602 --> 00:26:53,437
Are you going to sue me for an Omega as a Beta?

289
00:27:16,061 --> 00:27:17,662
Mr. Shen.

290
00:27:22,968 --> 00:27:24,634
[Resignation Application Form]
[Applicant: Gao Tu, Signature]

291
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:28,234
Do you want to resign?

292
00:27:28,234 --> 00:27:29,207
Yes.

293
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:32,377
Gao Tu, just because I said a few words
about that Omega,

294
00:27:32,377 --> 00:27:34,246
you want to quit?

295
00:27:34,246 --> 00:27:35,847
Have you lost your mind?

296
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:38,382
Do you know what you're doing?

297
00:27:39,017 --> 00:27:41,119
I do.

298
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,589
Mr. Shen, I know exactly what I'm doing.

299
00:27:46,725 --> 00:27:49,928
Thanks for your care so long.

300
00:27:49,928 --> 00:27:51,663
But because of my personal affairs...

301
00:27:51,663 --> 00:27:54,499
I can't continue this job.

302
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:57,302
Don't you need to pay for Qing's medical bills?

303
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:59,604
Do you think jobs are easy to find?

304
00:27:59,604 --> 00:28:02,274
I know it's hard

305
00:28:02,274 --> 00:28:05,477
and Qing will need more expenses

306
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:07,078
but...

307
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,087
My Omega is pregnant.

308
00:28:16,087 --> 00:28:17,722
What?

309
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,358
I have to take care of them.

310
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:22,827
I knew it.

311
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:26,264
Gao Tu, you're leaving the company and me

312
00:28:26,264 --> 00:28:28,500
for a pregnant Omega?

313
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,168
I'll never agree.

314
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:32,570
Did you leave your brain at home?

315
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:34,606
Get out.

316
00:28:34,606 --> 00:28:36,341
Go think it through.

317
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:39,410
Don't come back until you do.

318
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,138
But...

319
00:29:08,106 --> 00:29:10,508
I didn't mean to say that.

320
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:16,281
Wen Lang, to be honest...

321
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:17,882
Do you have a crush on Secretary Gao?

322
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:21,820
Bullshit, did the earthquake shake your brain?

323
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,988
No?

324
00:29:22,988 --> 00:29:25,689
I think your crush is quite obvious.

325
00:29:27,158 --> 00:29:29,226
He has an Omega now.

326
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:32,563
Who would like him?

327
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:50,982
Mr. Sheng, is your back sore?

328
00:29:50,982 --> 00:29:51,983
Not really.

329
00:29:51,983 --> 00:29:53,885
Let me massage you in bed.

330
00:29:53,885 --> 00:29:55,486
No.

331
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:59,090
Please, I'm good at massages.

332
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,592
I want to eat.

333
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:02,660
I'm starving.

334
00:30:04,396 --> 00:30:09,200
Don't worry, you will never starve.

335
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,869
I'm great at keeping you fed.

336
00:30:12,504 --> 00:30:14,238
Stop touching me.

337
00:30:17,242 --> 00:30:19,377
I'll hire a maid to cook.

338
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:21,112
You're too shy

339
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:23,748
for me to carry you out.

340
00:30:23,748 --> 00:30:27,218
But if I don't massage your sore muscles,

341
00:30:27,218 --> 00:30:29,587
how will you walk out?

342
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:32,523
Who do you think caused this?

343
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,460
I apologize.

344
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,262
It's all my fault.

345
00:30:37,262 --> 00:30:39,864
Punish me, Mr. Sheng

346
00:30:39,864 --> 00:30:42,066
I'll atone for my sins my whole life.

347
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:45,402
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

348
00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:13,230
Porridge?

349
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:29,180
Mr. Sheng, liquid food is very friendly
to awakening gastrointestinal functions.

350
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,749
Just take one sip, okay?

351
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:32,317
I hate porridge

352
00:31:32,317 --> 00:31:34,352
I know.

353
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,553
- You know?
- Yeah.

354
00:31:35,553 --> 00:31:37,589
You used to prepare porridge,

355
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:40,158
noodles, and buns for breakfast every day.

356
00:31:40,158 --> 00:31:43,394
The stuff you liked to eat

357
00:31:43,394 --> 00:31:46,897
was either too cold, spicy, or salty.

358
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:49,901
You have too little experience.

359
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:53,505
If you don't regulate your stomach well now,

360
00:31:53,505 --> 00:31:55,639
you'll have diarrhea.

361
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,513
Are you rich in such experiences?

362
00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:05,115
No, I only like Mr. Sheng.

363
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,953
Mr. Sheng, just take one sip.

364
00:32:08,953 --> 00:32:11,155
Just to accompany me, okay?

365
00:32:30,341 --> 00:32:32,210
My Omega is pregnant.

366
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,844
What?

367
00:32:34,445 --> 00:32:36,347
I have to take care of them.

368
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:48,393
There are only a few common reasons
why employees want to leave.

369
00:32:48,393 --> 00:32:50,862
First, salary issues.

370
00:32:50,862 --> 00:32:53,598
Second, felling wronged or mistreated.

371
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:56,801
Third, external interference or temptations.

372
00:32:56,801 --> 00:32:58,403
To retain someone,

373
00:32:58,403 --> 00:32:59,470
you have to identify the cause

374
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,405
and address it directly.

375
00:33:02,674 --> 00:33:05,143
There are a few key approaches.

376
00:33:05,143 --> 00:33:07,245
First, retain them with competitive pay.

377
00:33:07,245 --> 00:33:09,179
Second, retain them
through emotional connection and trust.

378
00:33:10,882 --> 00:33:13,150
Third, retain them
by offering leadership opportunities.

379
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:17,288
What a mess.

380
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:18,556
His Omega is pregnant.

381
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:20,391
He needs to take care of them.

382
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:22,459
What can I do?

383
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:31,702
Gao Tu.

384
00:33:32,737 --> 00:33:34,605
Why don't you just...

385
00:33:37,742 --> 00:33:39,543
Can you not...

386
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:52,523
If you leave,

387
00:33:52,523 --> 00:33:54,125
it'll be hard for the secretariat
to find someone

388
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:56,860
who can handle Mr. Shen's personal affairs.

389
00:33:58,196 --> 00:34:01,266
Secretary Hua will definitely be fine.

390
00:34:01,266 --> 00:34:02,967
Although he's an Omega,

391
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:06,004
Mr. Shen clearly likes Secretary Hua a lot.

392
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:08,606
I like Hua Yong?

393
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:10,541
Secretary Hua is different from you.

394
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:14,811
I think Mr. Shen relies on you emotionally.

395
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:16,714
I'm not sure about Secretary Hua.

396
00:34:16,714 --> 00:34:18,049
But compared to him,

397
00:34:18,049 --> 00:34:20,584
Mr. Shen likes you more.

398
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:23,621
Secretary Gao, if Mr. Shen
personally asks you to stay,

399
00:34:23,621 --> 00:34:25,189
would you?

400
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:26,791
No.

401
00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:29,660
There's never a shortage
of capable people around Mr. Shen.

402
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,098
It's been tough

403
00:34:34,098 --> 00:34:36,000
to keep up with everyone.

404
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,368
To be honest,

405
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:40,637
I've wanted to resign for a long time.

406
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:42,740
Is that so?

407
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,175
But our company's benefits

408
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:46,778
are famous in the industry.

409
00:34:46,778 --> 00:34:51,281
Isn't it a pity to resign now?

410
00:34:57,922 --> 00:34:59,690
Not at all.

411
00:35:01,526 --> 00:35:03,227
I've thought it through.

412
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:05,829
No one can change my mind.

413
00:35:06,764 --> 00:35:07,999
Unless...

414
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:09,666
Unless what?

415
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:15,305
Unless Mr. Shen gives me
15 percent HS Group's shares.

416
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:19,543
Then, I'll consider staying.

417
00:35:26,382 --> 00:35:27,884
Just kidding.

418
00:35:27,884 --> 00:35:30,521
Didn't expect you to joke, too.

419
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,939
No one can change his mind.

420
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:49,707
He has wanted to resign for ages.

421
00:35:49,707 --> 00:35:52,276
He's even asking for
15 percent of shares to stay.

422
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,712
Fuck it, leave.

423
00:35:54,712 --> 00:35:56,247
Stay or leave as he likes.

424
00:35:56,247 --> 00:35:58,315
I won't be reluctant at all.

425
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:14,365
Heard about it?

426
00:36:14,365 --> 00:36:16,634
Mr. Shen approved Secretary Gao's resignation

427
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:18,903
and transferred him
to the General Administrative Office

428
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:20,605
to hand over work there.

429
00:36:20,605 --> 00:36:22,540
The General Administrative Office?

430
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,475
That's on a different floor.

431
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:28,445
Exactly, it's clear Mr. Shen
doesn't want to see Secretary Gao anymore.

432
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,381
Keep your voice down.

433
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,817
Secretary Gao.

434
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,423
Work hard when I'm gone.

435
00:36:38,423 --> 00:36:39,857
Okay.

436
00:36:39,857 --> 00:36:42,827
We'll miss you, Secretary Gao.

437
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:44,428
Thanks.

438
00:36:52,203 --> 00:36:53,805
What did you say?

439
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:59,544
The boss means all X Holdings employees
get a paid day off.

440
00:36:59,544 --> 00:37:00,978
Why?

441
00:37:00,978 --> 00:37:03,081
Says there's good news.

442
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:06,651
X Holdings headquarters and all subsidiaries

443
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:08,986
took a day off.

444
00:37:08,986 --> 00:37:11,622
It's not the first day he's been like this.

445
00:37:11,622 --> 00:37:13,558
The boss means

446
00:37:13,558 --> 00:37:15,059
on such a good day,

447
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:18,196
HS should join in, too.

448
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:20,098
Can't he be crazy alone?

449
00:37:20,098 --> 00:37:22,566
Why does he want the whole world to join him?

450
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:31,109
Is this foot bath water?

451
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:33,978
- Sorry, this is Zhilan white tea silver needle.
- Too busy, not attending.

452
00:37:33,978 --> 00:37:36,914
Secretary Gao said this is your favorite tea.

453
00:37:36,914 --> 00:37:38,583
Shall I get you another cup?

454
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:40,118
I only drink boiled white tea.

455
00:37:40,118 --> 00:37:41,886
- Sorry.
- Are you new here?

456
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,721
I'll change it right away, sorry.

457
00:37:48,226 --> 00:37:50,461
Why are you so angry?

458
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:54,098
But the boss
seems to be in a good mood recently.

459
00:37:54,098 --> 00:37:56,000
Really?

460
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,668
Sheng Shao You is willing to see him now?

461
00:37:57,668 --> 00:37:59,370
More than that.

462
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,805
Early this morning,

463
00:38:00,805 --> 00:38:03,841
the boss contacted a wedding planner.

464
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:05,810
He said to hold a wedding

465
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,578
that satisfies Mr. Sheng as soon as possible.

466
00:38:09,714 --> 00:38:11,582
Then let him marry in.

467
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:15,319
He seems suitable for being an Omega for love.

468
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:18,823
That might be hard for an Enigma.

469
00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:21,993
Nothing can be harder than

470
00:38:21,993 --> 00:38:23,728
Hua Yong learning to cry.

471
00:38:23,728 --> 00:38:25,096
Back then,

472
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:27,999
just because Sheng Shao You
liked crying Omegas,

473
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:31,068
he consulted almost
all psychologists in Country P

474
00:38:31,068 --> 00:38:33,237
but still couldn't learn to cry.

475
00:38:33,237 --> 00:38:35,540
So, he suspected his tear ducts were broken

476
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,908
and went to see an ophthalmologist.

477
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:42,880
The boss has really
suffered a lot for Mr. Sheng.

478
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,348
By the way,

479
00:38:44,348 --> 00:38:46,417
the targeted drug Sheng Shao You wants

480
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:48,286
doesn't need to be delivered by me, right?

481
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:50,021
Just let Hua Yong send it over himself

482
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:52,723
as a love token.

483
00:38:52,723 --> 00:38:54,225
Gratitude for saving his father

484
00:38:54,225 --> 00:38:55,560
by repaying with his body.

485
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,527
Perfect.

486
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:05,169
Mr. Sheng, district leaders
are inspecting this afternoon.

487
00:39:05,169 --> 00:39:06,904
Susan from PR
has been appointed to receive them.

488
00:39:06,904 --> 00:39:09,340
Mr. Sheng, you didn't answer the phone.

489
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,409
Will you attend the 10:30 meeting?

490
00:39:11,409 --> 00:39:13,911
Mr. Sheng, I'll arrange the meeting
to proceed normally.

491
00:39:13,911 --> 00:39:15,446
You can join anytime
when you arrive at the company.

492
00:39:15,446 --> 00:39:16,881
Are you okay, Mr. Sheng?

493
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:18,082
Why is your phone off?

494
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:19,383
I'm fine.

495
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:20,918
I'm now in Tangcheng Binjiang.

496
00:39:20,918 --> 00:39:23,854
Prepare a car for me to return to the company.

497
00:39:26,757 --> 00:39:29,226
Mr. Sheng.

498
00:39:29,226 --> 00:39:30,328
These past few days...

499
00:39:30,328 --> 00:39:31,996
These past few days?

500
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:33,898
I was unconscious.

501
00:39:33,898 --> 00:39:36,367
I don't remember what I said or did.

502
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:39,704
Let's just pretend like nothing happened.

503
00:39:39,704 --> 00:39:44,041
But you've accepted my mark.

504
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:45,543
Mark?

505
00:39:45,543 --> 00:39:48,479
Hua Yong, do you really take me for an Omega?

506
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:53,350
No, I know better than anyone
that you're an Alpha.

507
00:39:54,418 --> 00:39:58,155
Then stop saying stupid things about marks.

508
00:39:58,155 --> 00:40:00,291
- But...
- No buts.

509
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:02,360
Hua Yong, I'm an Alpha.

510
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,196
How can I accept being used
as an Omega by another Alpha?

511
00:40:05,196 --> 00:40:06,897
Used?

512
00:40:06,897 --> 00:40:08,432
Mr. Sheng.

513
00:40:08,432 --> 00:40:11,469
How can you use such a discriminatory word?

514
00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:13,271
Besides...

515
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:16,207
Why say I used you?

516
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:17,708
Not that you used me?

517
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:19,342
You...

518
00:40:22,113 --> 00:40:25,549
I don't want to argue
about these boring issues anymore.

519
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:28,119
Did you eat? Where are you going?

520
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,488
Back to the office

521
00:40:30,488 --> 00:40:32,489
I'll come with you.

522
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:36,127
Aren't you busy?

523
00:40:36,127 --> 00:40:37,795
Isn't X Holdings a massive company?

524
00:40:37,795 --> 00:40:39,196
Doesn't the boss need to manage it?

525
00:40:39,196 --> 00:40:41,599
Well, I'm pretty free these days.

526
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,034
I even took a three-year sabbatical

527
00:40:43,034 --> 00:40:45,669
just to win you over.

528
00:40:49,006 --> 00:40:50,808
Now you stay in Jiang Hu,
pulling strings from behind the curtains.

529
00:40:50,808 --> 00:40:52,710
Out of sight, out of mind.

530
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,045
You better be careful.

531
00:40:54,045 --> 00:40:56,580
What if someone wipes out
your base in Country P while you're away?

532
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,317
Mr. Sheng, are you worried about me?

533
00:41:00,317 --> 00:41:02,419
Don't flatter yourself.

534
00:41:05,723 --> 00:41:08,592
If that day really comes,

535
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:10,728
I'll come running to you.

536
00:41:10,728 --> 00:41:13,464
I'll eat your food, spend your money,

537
00:41:13,464 --> 00:41:16,466
and stay quietly by your side, forever.
Is that okay?

538
00:41:18,903 --> 00:41:20,637
No.

539
00:41:21,305 --> 00:41:24,475
I hate stray dogs.

540
00:41:24,475 --> 00:41:27,344
Oh? So, you only like winners.

541
00:41:27,344 --> 00:41:29,480
Perfect. Winning's kind of my thing.

542
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,448
And I never lose.

543
00:41:36,387 --> 00:41:38,355
Mr. Sheng, are you all right?

544
00:41:38,355 --> 00:41:40,424
I'm fine. Is the car ready?

545
00:41:40,424 --> 00:41:42,059
Yes, it's waiting in the garage.

546
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:43,326
Good.

547
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:46,463
Mr. Sheng.

548
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:50,267
You didn't have to send someone to pick you up.

549
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:52,069
I could've driven you myself.

550
00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:54,071
Chen Pin Ming has the car ready.

551
00:41:54,071 --> 00:41:56,140
No need to trouble you, Mr. Hua.

552
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,943
All right. Then I'll get changed, too.

553
00:42:04,749 --> 00:42:06,550
I'll ride with you.

554
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,239
Mr. Sheng, are you really okay?

555
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:29,707
If Secretary Chang hadn't messaged me,

556
00:42:29,707 --> 00:42:31,809
I would've called the police.

557
00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:33,144
It's just some scrapes.

558
00:42:33,144 --> 00:42:35,246
I already had the family doctor check it out.

559
00:42:35,246 --> 00:42:36,947
Nothing serious.

560
00:42:37,915 --> 00:42:39,316
What happened?

561
00:42:39,316 --> 00:42:42,253
Did you call the police?
Where are the attackers?

562
00:42:42,253 --> 00:42:44,288
They've already been caught.

563
00:42:44,288 --> 00:42:46,724
Secretary Chen handled it.

564
00:42:46,724 --> 00:42:48,458
You don't have to worry.

565
00:42:49,326 --> 00:42:50,927
Mr. Hua.

566
00:42:51,962 --> 00:42:53,964
You're so responsible.

567
00:42:53,964 --> 00:42:56,200
Security at the company is a total mess.

568
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,769
You didn't even know Mr. Sheng was kidnapped.

569
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:00,137
Enough.

570
00:43:00,137 --> 00:43:02,706
Don't discuss this at the door.

571
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:04,475
What's next on the schedule?

572
00:43:04,475 --> 00:43:06,877
A progress meeting in 30 minutes.

573
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:08,478
Right.

574
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:11,281
By the way, Mr. Sheng...

575
00:43:13,384 --> 00:43:15,585
About your father's medication this month...

576
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:20,266
Hua Yong.

577
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:24,504
Are you threatening me?
