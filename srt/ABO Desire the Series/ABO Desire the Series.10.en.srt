00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,300
"Desire the Series"

2
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,600
(Episode 10)

3
00:01:39,037 --> 00:01:40,638
I'm your real sister

4
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:42,874
why take his side when I mention him?

5
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:45,543
Yes, he paid my surgery fees

6
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,679
I'll pay him back double.

7
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:51,516
But I don't think you're happy working for him.

8
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:54,119
When I make money in the future,

9
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:56,588
we'll repay him with principal and interest

10
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:59,124
will that make you happier?

11
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:03,828
Alright, stop overthinking.

12
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:05,597
I'm not unhappy.

13
00:02:05,797 --> 00:02:06,598
Stop acting cute

14
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:08,466
you have a checkup soon.

15
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:10,168
Here.

16
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:14,806
Thanks, Brother.

17
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,163
Omega in heat.

18
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:41,766
Who sent you?

19
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,035
You smell so good.

20
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:45,637
Let me go!

21
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:48,173
Filthy Omega

22
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:51,142
you did this on purpose, right?

23
00:03:36,254 --> 00:03:39,023
"Three days absent and now more leave?

24
00:03:39,324 --> 00:03:40,592
Is your brain waterlogged?"

25
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:43,895
Family of Gao Qing?

26
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:47,932
Yes!

27
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,134
Come sign at the nurse station

28
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:51,402
the patient needs a test.

29
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:53,771
Ok.

30
00:03:54,873 --> 00:03:55,974
Okay, sorry!

31
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:57,308
I'll be right there.

32
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:07,752
"Three days absent and now more leave?

33
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:09,287
Is your brain waterlogged?"

34
00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:12,490
Mr. Shen, sorry.

35
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:14,626
I had something urgent

36
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:15,927
and couldn't request leave.

37
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:18,229
Truly sorry,

38
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:19,664
it won't happen again.

39
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:22,000
Where are you?

40
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:26,638
At home.

41
00:04:37,182 --> 00:04:37,949
Where the hell are you?

42
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,317
Mr. Shen, I'm at home

43
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,418
I'll ask again

44
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:42,220
where are you?

45
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:45,757
Mr. Shen,

46
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:47,759
why are you here?

47
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,161
Open the door.

48
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:51,029
Oh.

49
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:01,206
Would white tea work?

50
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:04,943
You said there was no tea last time,

51
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:07,946
so I stocked up.

52
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:09,847
Mm.

53
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:40,078
What's so important that you skipped three days?

54
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:42,513
Is that Omega in heat again?

55
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:49,587
It's okay, the water spilled.

56
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:55,760
Please sit and have tea.

57
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:13,811
What crappy tea,

58
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:15,280
tastes awful!

59
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:21,719
Look at the email you sent last week.

60
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:23,788
Did you even go to school?

61
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,924
How can you mix up

62
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:28,726
half-width and full-width characters?

63
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,000
Sorry,

64
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:39,637
since it was a spam unsubscribe reply,

65
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:40,438
I thought.

66
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:41,406
Use my account to reply.

67
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:43,374
Even junk mail needs care.

68
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:46,310
Emails go out under my name

69
00:06:46,878 --> 00:06:48,379
do you want people to think

70
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,548
I'm an idiot who can't use punctuation?

71
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:52,383
Sorry,

72
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:55,353
that's not what I meant.

73
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:57,155
Can't even do this right,

74
00:06:57,722 --> 00:06:59,590
yet you skip work to accompany your Omega.

75
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:02,026
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

76
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:04,162
I didn't mean to.

77
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:10,368
All you do is request leave.

78
00:07:11,402 --> 00:07:12,203
Gao Tu,

79
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:14,939
do you think money grows on trees?

80
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:15,606
I'm sorry

81
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:18,509
for not requesting leave in advance.

82
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:20,445
But

83
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:23,681
my previous leave

84
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:25,483
was traded from accumulated annual leave.

85
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,018
So you didn't skip work

86
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:28,553
to be loyal?

87
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:31,889
You saved up leave to

88
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:33,491
accompany your heat-prone Omega.

89
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:34,959
Mr. Shen,

90
00:07:36,994 --> 00:07:38,362
what's wrong with Omega?

91
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,933
Why can Secretary Hua take leave for heat, but I.

92
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:42,834
Don't compare to him.

93
00:07:44,802 --> 00:07:45,603
Yes,

94
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:47,705
I can't compare

95
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:50,308
he's the only Omega

96
00:07:50,308 --> 00:07:51,709
who stays by your side.

97
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:54,245
Can you stop saying "Omega" all day?

98
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:55,880
It's disgusting.

99
00:07:57,148 --> 00:08:00,451
Also, when we were at X Hotel last time,

100
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:02,353
why did you disappear?

101
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:05,022
Were you with that Omega in heat again?

102
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:11,529
Do you know what happened to me?

103
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:20,972
Why do you look like that?

104
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:23,808
Don't tell me.

105
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:26,544
You

106
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:27,345
and that Omega planned this?

107
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:28,479
I don't know.

108
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:32,917
I didn't.

109
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,720
Well.

110
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:37,155
Kidding.

111
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:38,723
You wouldn't dare.

112
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:41,726
When you return,

113
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,394
investigate X Hotel

114
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:45,329
find the Omega

115
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:47,598
who slept around in staff lounges

116
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:51,068
I'll kill them if I find out.

117
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:53,638
Understood.

118
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:06,784
Gao Tu,

119
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:09,320
didn't you say you never let Omega stay overnight?

120
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:10,988
What do you mean?

121
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:14,992
Look at that inhibitor patch.

122
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:17,628
Remind her to take her things.

123
00:09:18,262 --> 00:09:19,931
Omegas are scheming

124
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:22,733
claiming territory by leaving stuff.

125
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:25,169
You're a Beta, can't mark anyone

126
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,871
why would she leave things on purpose?

127
00:09:26,871 --> 00:09:28,439
Why would she leave things on purpose?

128
00:09:29,473 --> 00:09:30,308
Fine,

129
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:32,844
I'll tell her.

130
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:34,912
Enjoy your leave.

131
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:36,113
Come back

132
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:37,682
without smelling like Omega.

133
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:03,074
Can you talk now?

134
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:04,842
Yes

135
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:07,144
I've checked the backgrounds

136
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:09,013
of the two who broke into your suite.

137
00:10:09,614 --> 00:10:11,015
They're low-grade Alpha

138
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:12,517
but professional kidnappers.

139
00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:14,452
They've abducted many high-ranking Alphas

140
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:17,054
and sold them on the secret market for high prices.

141
00:10:17,855 --> 00:10:20,091
This time they must be working for someone

142
00:10:20,324 --> 00:10:21,225
doing it for money.

143
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:22,994
Whose money?

144
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:27,565
No clue yet.

145
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,267
How about

146
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:31,068
grabbing them for questioning?

147
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:34,272
Not yet.

148
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:39,110
Let's see where these rats in the hole want to go.

149
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:40,711
Understood.

150
00:10:52,323 --> 00:10:56,160
Sorry, the number you dialed is busy

151
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:57,895
please try again later.

152
00:11:09,173 --> 00:11:12,243
Mr. Sheng, the special drug sent by Mr. Shen has been administered.

153
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,911
The doctor says it's extremely effective.

154
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:15,246
At this rate

155
00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:17,315
the chairman's condition will stabilize soon.

156
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:19,483
Mm.

157
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:20,718
Got it.

158
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,921
Aren't you coming to check in person?

159
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:25,489
I'm not a doctor.

160
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:27,525
What would I do there?

161
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:30,494
Mr. Shen delivered the drug himself

162
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:32,229
and Mr. Hua was also there.

163
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:37,335
Keep them occupied.

164
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:38,102
Tell the driver to prepare the car

165
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:39,003
I'll be there right away.

166
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,291
Hua Yong.

167
00:12:01,158 --> 00:12:01,959
Hua Yong.

168
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:03,494
Mr. Sheng.

169
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:05,496
Hua Yong.

170
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:09,166
Hua Yong.

171
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:14,271
Hua Yong.

172
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:16,907
Yong, get off. Come back with me.

173
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:17,808
Yong.

174
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:25,850
Mr. Sheng.

175
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:29,120
Surrounding me in broad daylight

176
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,654
what the hell do you want?

177
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,360
A Yong, come home with me. Listen to me.

178
00:12:37,728 --> 00:12:38,562
Home?

179
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:42,466
Hua Yong, will you go back with him?

180
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:47,471
Surround the car!

181
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:55,046
Hua Yong go with him or stay with me.

182
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:56,280
It's up to you.

183
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,651
Mr. Sheng,

184
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:02,553
you should go back.

185
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:07,892
Did you hear that?

186
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:10,961
Sheng Shaoyou, stop deluding yourself and leave.

187
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:24,475
Hey, what's wrong?

188
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:30,214
Hua Yong!

189
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:33,250
Be good, come with me.

190
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:43,527
Mr. Shen, can I talk to Mr. Sheng alone?

191
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:54,238
Why won't you come home with me?

192
00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:06,117
Don't cry.

193
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:10,087
I'm not crying.

194
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:11,856
Good.

195
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:13,924
If you're not crying,

196
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,128
come home with me

197
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:18,462
okay?

198
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:26,103
Better not.

199
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:29,874
Why?

200
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:35,146
If it's because of Shen Wenlang

201
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,447
don't worry

202
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:39,049
I'll kill him right now.

203
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:40,851
No.

204
00:14:42,453 --> 00:14:45,089
Your father needs that drug once a month...

205
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,925
Mr. Shen only sent one bottle today.

206
00:14:55,232 --> 00:14:56,333
Did that bastard

207
00:14:57,802 --> 00:15:00,070
do something to you?

208
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:10,114
I don't care.

209
00:15:10,848 --> 00:15:11,649
Hua Yong...

210
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,884
I don't care anymore.

211
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:16,120
Come home with me.

212
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:19,723
What about the drug?

213
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:23,160
Leave that to me

214
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:24,094
I have to care.

215
00:15:24,862 --> 00:15:26,497
It's for Mr. Sheng's father.

216
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,571
Mr. Sheng,

217
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:36,207
don't blame yourself.

218
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:40,444
I did this voluntarily.

219
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:44,615
Honestly,

220
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:49,119
it doesn't matter who I'm with now.

221
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:56,126
I'm just glad.

222
00:15:57,895 --> 00:15:59,196
I can still help you.

223
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:09,907
Don't be upset.

224
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,743
This was my choice,

225
00:16:14,311 --> 00:16:15,613
so don't blame yourself.

226
00:16:16,647 --> 00:16:18,148
Don't try to make it up to me.

227
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,351
I want nothing

228
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:23,554
just for you to be happy.

229
00:16:49,713 --> 00:16:50,614
Mr. Sheng,

230
00:16:52,349 --> 00:16:55,085
you'll definitely find someone better

231
00:16:55,686 --> 00:16:57,121
and more suitable for you.

232
00:16:57,488 --> 00:16:58,289
No.

233
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,293
There's no one better or more perfect.

234
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:07,031
There will be, Mr. Sheng.

235
00:17:08,632 --> 00:17:09,633
Forget about me.

236
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:13,203
Don't go, Yong!

237
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:16,807
I can't forget you.

238
00:17:16,974 --> 00:17:18,375
Come home with me.

239
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,084
Mr. Sheng,

240
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:30,354
maybe one day

241
00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:33,490
you'll realize.

242
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:36,226
I'm not as good as you think.

243
00:17:38,962 --> 00:17:40,164
And when that day comes,

244
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:43,567
when that day comes

245
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:46,670
you'll see

246
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:48,472
I'm nothing special.

247
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:53,544
Hua Yong,

248
00:17:55,212 --> 00:17:57,414
none of us are perfect.

249
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,451
I like you,

250
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:03,153
not some perfect ideal.

251
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:31,348
Wenlang, the boss means

252
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:33,751
for those projects snatched by SHENGFANG Biotech,

253
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:35,319
let SHENGFANG take over.

254
00:18:35,786 --> 00:18:36,787
For external supplies,

255
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:39,156
help them secretly where we can.

256
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,158
How long

257
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,193
do I have to keep up this act?

258
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:45,229
You didn't see.

259
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:47,564
Sheng Shaoyou's face just now

260
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:48,799
if I'd pissed him off enough to spit blood,

261
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:51,001
Hua Yong would make me pay with my life.

262
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:54,571
Don't worry, the boss won't let that happen.

263
00:18:56,106 --> 00:18:57,007
Won't let it?

264
00:18:57,674 --> 00:19:00,477
He'd do anything for Sheng Shaoyou.

265
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:02,479
That little lunatic just asked

266
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:04,615
if he could talk to Sheng Shaoyou alone.

267
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:06,049
Let him fucking go!

268
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:09,453
I wish he'd go home with Sheng Shaoyou right now,

269
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,155
lock themselves together forever,

270
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:12,923
and stop messing with innocent people.

271
00:19:13,524 --> 00:19:15,492
I must have cursed

272
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:16,927
to get stuck in this.

273
00:19:18,395 --> 00:19:19,163
Come in.

274
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:21,432
Mr. Shen, about that night.

275
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:24,234
Secretary Chang.

276
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:25,769
Yes.

277
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:27,838
Sorry, Mr. Shen

278
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:29,339
I didn't know you had a guest.

279
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:33,410
No problem, we were just finishing up.

280
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:35,479
Wenlang, I'll take my leave.

281
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:36,413
Mm.

282
00:19:47,357 --> 00:19:48,158
Have a seat.

283
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:01,672
Mr. Shen, I checked all hotel surveillance,

284
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:04,508
but the staff lounge corner was a blind spot

285
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:07,077
couldn't make out the Omega's face.

286
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:08,045
Is that so?

287
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:12,349
Then ask the hotel to pull all surveillance footage from that night.

288
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,418
There must be a camera

289
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:16,487
that caught the Omega in the same clothes.

290
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,626
Why so nervous?

291
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:24,761
Don't tell me

292
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:27,464
you really colluded with that Omega.

293
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:28,732
I didn't!

294
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,568
Just kidding

295
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:34,104
look at you, pale as a sheet.

296
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:36,673
We've known each other so long

297
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:39,510
do I not know what you're like?

298
00:20:40,677 --> 00:20:42,880
A stubborn fool like you

299
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:45,582
plotting against me

300
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:48,385
is less likely than aliens attacking Earth.

301
00:20:52,122 --> 00:20:54,158
I've stressed to X Hotel that

302
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:56,727
Mr. Sheng lost something valuable at the banquet,

303
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:58,762
needing detailed surveillance to find the suspect.

304
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:00,764
But the hotel is being difficult

305
00:21:00,931 --> 00:21:02,966
refuses to hand over the footage.

306
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,171
Mr. Sheng,

307
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:09,640
should we call the police

308
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,874
and let them intervene?

309
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:12,609
If we can't find it, forget it.

310
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:16,013
Though valuable,

311
00:21:16,813 --> 00:21:18,315
it's not worth

312
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:20,183
deploying excessive police force.

313
00:21:21,652 --> 00:21:22,853
Understood.

314
00:22:16,473 --> 00:22:17,441
Mr. Sheng.

315
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,050
Mr. Sheng

316
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:29,653
it's dirty.

317
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,632
I want to move to the guest room.

318
00:22:49,206 --> 00:22:50,073
Because I'm dirty?

319
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:54,144
Then I'll go wash up too, okay?

320
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:50,634
Mr. Sheng.

321
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:53,570
Mr. Sheng.

322
00:23:54,905 --> 00:23:55,906
The floor's cold.

323
00:23:58,875 --> 00:23:59,676
Morning.

324
00:24:04,347 --> 00:24:05,148
Morning.

325
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:49,192
Mr. Sheng.

326
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:51,728
Stop sleeping on the floor.

327
00:24:52,195 --> 00:24:53,497
It's too hard on you.

328
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:58,068
Then stop sleeping in the guest room.

329
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:01,505
Come back to them main bedroom with me, okay?

330
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:06,943
You're not saying no.

331
00:25:07,711 --> 00:25:08,912
Then I'll take that as a yes.

332
00:25:17,888 --> 00:25:18,989
Put me down.

333
00:25:21,424 --> 00:25:23,527
Mr. Sheng, put me down.

334
00:25:55,258 --> 00:25:56,059
No.

335
00:26:11,508 --> 00:26:13,410
If you say no, we won't have sex.

336
00:26:17,614 --> 00:26:18,415
I'm sorry.

337
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:29,392
It's not your fault.

338
00:26:29,893 --> 00:26:30,794
It's my fault.

339
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:32,662
I was too impatient.

340
00:26:35,966 --> 00:26:37,000
I won't do it again.

341
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:39,236
From now on, even if I just want a kiss

342
00:26:40,003 --> 00:26:41,605
I'll notify first.

343
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:43,039
Okay?

344
00:26:48,678 --> 00:26:49,679
But you still kissed me.

345
00:26:56,987 --> 00:26:58,555
Then may I ask, Mr. Hua.

346
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:00,524
Do I have your permission?

347
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,231
Mr. Sheng, you're so silly.

348
00:27:09,032 --> 00:27:10,400
Can't even tell I'm joking.

349
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,253
Here, try this.

350
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,001
Too sweet.

351
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:25,008
I already cut the sugar in half.

352
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,543
Still too sweet.

353
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,985
Even without sugar, anything you make is sweet.

354
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:51,368
Do we really need to pack cake for the library?

355
00:28:51,434 --> 00:28:52,002
Hmm.

356
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:55,005
The café there makes it too sweet.

357
00:28:55,005 --> 00:28:56,072
You might not like it.

358
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,108
As long as we pay a cleaning fee

359
00:28:58,108 --> 00:28:59,242
we're allowed to bring our own food.

360
00:28:59,242 --> 00:29:00,477
So I thought, why not bake some?

361
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:03,113
A date without shopping or restaurants

362
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:04,247
but library

363
00:29:04,614 --> 00:29:06,650
and also with homemade cake.

364
00:29:07,317 --> 00:29:08,918
So easy to please

365
00:29:08,985 --> 00:29:10,286
and so good at everything.

366
00:29:11,054 --> 00:29:13,623
Being your Alpha is just way too lucky.

367
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:15,625
That's all it takes to be lucky?

368
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:18,194
You're the one who's too easy to please, Mr. Sheng

369
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:20,797
I'll treat you even better from now on.

370
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:22,532
Give you everything I have.

371
00:29:25,068 --> 00:29:26,202
I don't need anything.

372
00:29:27,637 --> 00:29:29,406
Just take care of yourself

373
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:31,107
that's all I could ask for.

374
00:29:47,323 --> 00:29:48,358
You like quiet places, right?

375
00:29:48,758 --> 00:29:49,959
Let's head to the reading room.

376
00:29:50,026 --> 00:29:51,027
Mm, okay.

377
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:51,728
Hmm.

378
00:31:44,774 --> 00:31:47,477
Mr. Sheng, I want to pick out a few books.

379
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:49,145
But I can't concentrate with you like this.

380
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:49,946
How am I supposed to choose?

381
00:31:50,446 --> 00:31:51,915
You figure it out.

382
00:31:53,783 --> 00:31:55,585
Our Hua Yong is so smart.

383
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:57,654
I'm sure you'll think of something.

384
00:32:13,102 --> 00:32:15,038
Mr. Sheng, are you okay?

385
00:32:16,472 --> 00:32:17,273
I'm fine.

386
00:32:17,974 --> 00:32:18,775
Don't be scared.

387
00:32:31,187 --> 00:32:32,322
Leave.

388
00:32:33,122 --> 00:32:34,424
Go find an open space first

389
00:32:34,557 --> 00:32:35,892
I'll be right there.

390
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,148
Good afternoon.

391
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:34,550
The current time is 4:30 AM, UTC+8.

392
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,352
Here's an urgent news bulletin.

393
00:33:36,552 --> 00:33:38,554
A sudden earthquake struck Jinghe District, JIANGHU City,

394
00:33:38,588 --> 00:33:40,189
with an epicenter depth of about 3 km.

395
00:33:40,323 --> 00:33:41,357
The entire city felt the tremor.

396
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:44,427
The VIP reading room of Jinghe Library's branch collapsed,

397
00:33:44,427 --> 00:33:45,428
with two people trapped.

398
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:51,701
Hello, the user you dialed…

399
00:33:58,241 --> 00:33:59,309
How do you feel now?

400
00:33:59,676 --> 00:34:00,743
My stomach is still bloated.

401
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:01,811
Does your back hurt?

402
00:34:01,878 --> 00:34:02,679
No.

403
00:34:03,012 --> 00:34:03,579
Hello?

404
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,647
Hello?

405
00:34:05,281 --> 00:34:06,015
Where are you?

406
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:07,850
I'm at the hospital with my sister.

407
00:34:08,117 --> 00:34:08,851
What's wrong?

408
00:34:08,851 --> 00:34:10,053
There's an earthquake in Jinghe!

409
00:34:10,286 --> 00:34:11,921
Your place is too dangerous.

410
00:34:12,121 --> 00:34:13,489
Don't go back yet!

411
00:34:13,723 --> 00:34:14,390
But.

412
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:15,558
No "but"!

413
00:34:15,558 --> 00:34:18,127
Stay at my place if you have nowhere to go.

414
00:34:20,196 --> 00:34:22,332
Gao Tu, don't you dare go back!

415
00:34:22,665 --> 00:34:23,633
Got it?

416
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:25,468
It's okay, Mr. Shen,

417
00:34:25,468 --> 00:34:25,868
I

418
00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:27,070
What do you mean "okay"

419
00:34:27,503 --> 00:34:28,671
I'll send someone to pick you up,

420
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:29,872
stay at HECI

421
00:34:30,273 --> 00:34:31,240
don't go anywhere.

422
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:33,276
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

423
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,144
I meant.

424
00:34:35,678 --> 00:34:38,414
My sister had an invasive procedure today,

425
00:34:38,514 --> 00:34:40,116
I need to stay and care for her,

426
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,518
so I'll be at the hospital

427
00:34:42,518 --> 00:34:43,453
and won't go back.

428
00:34:44,287 --> 00:34:45,121
Don't worry.

429
00:34:46,322 --> 00:34:47,924
What about you? Are you safe?

430
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:48,791
Yes,

431
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:50,526
I'm fine.

432
00:34:52,362 --> 00:34:53,529
Stay at HECI

433
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,198
I'll visit Qing

434
00:34:55,365 --> 00:34:56,466
after I finish here.

435
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:57,967
Thanks.

436
00:36:53,149 --> 00:36:56,352
Earthquake! He's hurt!

437
00:36:57,253 --> 00:36:58,554
We need a medical team!

438
00:36:58,988 --> 00:36:59,789
Hurry!

439
00:37:01,624 --> 00:37:03,426
Medical aid and rescue needed!

440
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:04,527
Be right there.

441
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:06,195
Rescue teams are dispatched.

442
00:37:37,193 --> 00:37:38,027
Mr. Sheng.

443
00:37:40,062 --> 00:37:41,330
It hurts.

444
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:46,068
Don't get any closer!

445
00:37:46,068 --> 00:37:47,203
Step back! Step back!

446
00:37:47,603 --> 00:37:48,404
Stretcher! Stretcher!

447
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:49,605
This is terrifying.

448
00:37:49,605 --> 00:37:51,807
The earthquake hit right after I returned my books,

449
00:37:51,807 --> 00:37:53,042
I could barely stand.

450
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:54,243
This way, follow me!

451
00:37:54,243 --> 00:37:56,712
Heard the west VIP reading room on the first floor collapsed.

452
00:37:56,846 --> 00:37:57,914
The building collapsed?

453
00:37:58,014 --> 00:37:59,315
Though the tremor was mild,

454
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:00,583
how could it collapse?

455
00:38:00,683 --> 00:38:03,753
That library is a major taxpayer in our district

456
00:38:03,753 --> 00:38:05,054
funded by SHENGFANG Biotech!

457
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:07,023
My husband used to work there.

458
00:38:07,023 --> 00:38:09,959
Heard SHENGFANG even selected the construction team.

459
00:38:10,593 --> 00:38:12,328
Could it be shoddy construction?

460
00:38:12,328 --> 00:38:14,030
Why else would only that reading room collapse

461
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,197
when other buildings are fine?

462
00:38:15,197 --> 00:38:16,232
I just got here, I have no idea.

463
00:38:18,334 --> 00:38:19,168
Mr. Sheng!

464
00:38:20,002 --> 00:38:20,970
Are you awake?

465
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,674
Don't move!

466
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,410
Your back is injured...

467
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:29,345
maybe broken bones,

468
00:38:30,413 --> 00:38:32,048
better to stay still.

469
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:51,267
Mr. Sheng.

470
00:38:52,468 --> 00:38:54,103
You're an S-class Alpha too?

471
00:38:57,106 --> 00:38:57,807
I…

472
00:38:58,274 --> 00:39:00,142
High-grade soothing pheromones

473
00:39:03,412 --> 00:39:04,513
and light totems.

474
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:07,783
How else do you plan to lie to me?

475
00:39:09,285 --> 00:39:10,253
Mr. Sheng!

476
00:39:11,587 --> 00:39:12,455
There's an earthquake!

477
00:39:14,624 --> 00:39:16,158
Half the ceiling collapsed,

478
00:39:17,727 --> 00:39:19,528
we're waiting for rescue

479
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:22,164
so don't ask questions now,

480
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:24,200
conserve your strength.

481
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:25,268
Hua Yong.

482
00:39:25,835 --> 00:39:27,603
Don't you owe me an explanation?

483
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,038
I'll explain,

484
00:39:30,806 --> 00:39:31,974
but not now.

485
00:39:38,147 --> 00:39:39,649
You hit your head

486
00:39:40,983 --> 00:39:42,485
are you dizzy?

487
00:39:43,853 --> 00:39:45,087
Want to lie down longer?

488
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:48,024
Please?

489
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:51,794
No!

490
00:40:14,116 --> 00:40:16,318
You're the mysterious head of X Holdings!

491
00:40:19,255 --> 00:40:20,756
Don't be angry.

492
00:40:26,796 --> 00:40:28,931
Your palms are sweating,

493
00:40:29,732 --> 00:40:31,600
The Uncrowned King of Country

494
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,969
is nervous about being caught lying?

495
00:40:35,971 --> 00:40:36,839
Mr. Sheng.

496
00:40:38,574 --> 00:40:39,875
It was wrong to lie,

497
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,611
Can you forgive me?

498
00:40:53,322 --> 00:40:55,491
Get away! Stay back!

499
00:41:00,463 --> 00:41:01,364
I'm sorry!

500
00:41:02,565 --> 00:41:03,766
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheng!

501
00:41:04,633 --> 00:41:05,601
Don't be angry.

502
00:41:07,236 --> 00:41:08,270
An apology?

503
00:41:09,405 --> 00:41:11,273
Do I have to accept it?

504
00:41:12,408 --> 00:41:14,110
Is your apology worth gold?

505
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:19,048
Stop using your soothing pheromones!

506
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:31,227
In my life, besides you,

507
00:41:32,695 --> 00:41:34,330
I've never apologized to anyone.

508
00:41:45,307 --> 00:41:46,308
Don't touch me!

509
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:50,813
Who wants your apology!

510
00:41:51,313 --> 00:41:53,082
If I'd known you were an Alpha.

511
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:55,084
I wouldn't have taken that blow!

512
00:41:59,388 --> 00:42:00,389
Stay away!

513
00:42:03,826 --> 00:42:04,760
Mr. Sheng.

514
00:42:06,162 --> 00:42:07,062
I'm so cold.

515
00:42:09,865 --> 00:42:11,167
Can you stay closer?

516
00:42:25,447 --> 00:42:26,749
I'll say it again.

517
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,351
Stay away from me!

518
00:42:30,953 --> 00:42:33,189
We're not on that kind of terms!

519
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:35,324
Disgusting liar!

520
00:43:05,287 --> 00:43:06,789
How did this happen.

521
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:10,159
I'm fine.

522
00:43:13,596 --> 00:43:16,332
Come here, let me check your injuries.

523
00:43:29,311 --> 00:43:30,145
Nothing.

524
00:43:31,747 --> 00:43:32,982
I can't move.

525
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:50,165
Don't get me wrong.

526
00:43:51,734 --> 00:43:53,602
I just don't want to be with a corpse.

527
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:57,139
Getting scammed is bad enough
