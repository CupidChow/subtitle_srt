00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,934
[Episode 9]

2
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:41,403
He's been on medical leave.

3
00:01:42,238 --> 00:01:44,174
It's pheromone gland cancer.

4
00:01:44,174 --> 00:01:49,045
Secretary Chang, I know
your formula is still confidential.

5
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:53,316
But I'm not calling as a biopharm CEO today.

6
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:57,987
I'm calling as a son
begging for help for my father.

7
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,760
Please help me.

8
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:11,835
As long as you're willing to help,

9
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:15,437
name any condition you want.

10
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:22,846
Mr. Sheng, it's not that I don't want to help,

11
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:26,715
but this has exceeded my authority.

12
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:30,787
Secretary Chang,
with your authority at X Holdings,

13
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:33,923
getting the drug shouldn't be too hard, right?

14
00:02:34,991 --> 00:02:36,826
You overestimate me, Mr. Sheng.

15
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:38,495
As the boss's chief secretary,

16
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:41,097
I do oversee many projects,

17
00:02:41,097 --> 00:02:43,433
but anything related to the targeted drug

18
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:45,668
is personally handled by our boss.

19
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:47,637
Even the project proposal two years ago

20
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:49,406
was signed by him personally.

21
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:50,974
Two years ago...

22
00:02:50,974 --> 00:02:53,643
Wasn't that when Father
was first diagnosed with gland cancer?

23
00:02:53,643 --> 00:02:56,446
Our boss is unusually invested in this drug.

24
00:02:56,446 --> 00:03:00,385
Everyone from R&D leads to team members

25
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:03,419
can report directly to him over my head.

26
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,724
So, I need to ask the boss first

27
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:09,559
before I can give you an answer.

28
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:11,194
Understood.

29
00:03:11,194 --> 00:03:14,964
I'll wait for your news, Secretary Chang.

30
00:03:14,964 --> 00:03:16,099
Thank you.

31
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,634
All right, Mr. Sheng.

32
00:03:27,777 --> 00:03:30,180
I invest tens of billions annually,

33
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,116
yet I can't even
get a whiff of the special drug,

34
00:03:33,116 --> 00:03:35,985
while X Holdings developed it in two years.

35
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:42,458
Is this ugly bastard born to curse me?

36
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:30,472
Secretary Chang, it's me.

37
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:32,542
Why are you calling?

38
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:34,077
Why can't it be me?

39
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:38,381
Mr. Shao You, heard you
called Chang Yu yesterday

40
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:42,519
asking for the special drug
for pheromone gland cancer.

41
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,220
What's that to you?

42
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,655
It concerns me very much.

43
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:47,157
What a coincidence.

44
00:04:47,157 --> 00:04:49,765
Yesterday, the gentleman from X Holdings

45
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:53,496
entrusted me to take over
the new drug's development.

46
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:58,300
So, begging Chang Yu is useless.
Beg me instead.

47
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:11,834
[Shen Wen Lang]

48
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:18,021
Don't be so petty.

49
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:21,523
For old times' sake, I can give you the drug.

50
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,962
You have quite a temper.

51
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:27,564
Spit it out!

52
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:30,900
The drug isn't impossible to get.

53
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,104
Instead of making you beg, here's a deal.

54
00:05:35,104 --> 00:05:38,508
Return Hua Yong to me.

55
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:40,543
Didn't you get beaten enough last time?

56
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:44,546
Is this how you beg for help, Mr. Shao You?

57
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,583
You said it yourself.

58
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,117
I'm begging a person.

59
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:49,352
Are you even human?

60
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:51,988
That hurts my feelings.

61
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:53,656
Tell you what.

62
00:05:53,656 --> 00:05:55,725
I know you're reluctant,

63
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:57,627
but just one night.

64
00:05:57,627 --> 00:06:00,496
Send Hua Yong to X Hotel.

65
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:02,465
I'll return him after one night,

66
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:05,101
and deliver the drug to your father personally.

67
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:07,537
A good deal, isn't it?

68
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:09,005
Shen Wen Lang.

69
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:11,708
My terms are generous.

70
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:16,646
Lovers are a dime a dozen,
you can look for another one.

71
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:19,415
But you only have one father.

72
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:21,517
Think about your father's illness.

73
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:29,391
Can you bear to let him suffer
when a targeted drug exists?

74
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:35,531
My matters are none of your concern.

75
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:50,880
I was worried the food will get cold.

76
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,615
Okay, come on.

77
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:05,027
Mr. Sheng.

78
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,764
What's the matter?

79
00:07:23,446 --> 00:07:25,615
Mr. Sheng.

80
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:27,749
Don't be upset.

81
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:50,239
All right.

82
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,941
Go to work.

83
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:54,510
Be careful on the way. Bye.

84
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:17,299
Same here.

85
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:34,317
Was the subway air-conditioning
too cold yesterday?

86
00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:35,885
You might have a slight fever.

87
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:37,686
Don't worry.

88
00:08:38,554 --> 00:08:40,556
I took medicine.

89
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,593
It's already 9 A.M.

90
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:45,794
You'll be late if you don't leave.

91
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:48,463
Be careful.

92
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,600
Bye.

93
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:13,756
Hello, Yu Shan.

94
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:15,391
Hey, Shao You.

95
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:18,094
I remember you wanted to meet X Holdings' owner

96
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:19,896
and asked me to keep an eye out.

97
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:23,065
Yes. Any new info?

98
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:27,670
Heard he'll be
at X Hotel's social banquet tonight.

99
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,838
Is the info reliable?

100
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:30,217
Can't guarantee,

101
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:33,309
but X Hotel's sales team
is tight with sales at Royal.

102
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:37,647
There was a last-minute booking
from X Holdings,

103
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:39,982
and they canceled all reservations

104
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:42,384
with a tenfold deposit compensation.

105
00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:47,957
Security and confidentiality tonight
are unprecedented.

106
00:09:47,957 --> 00:09:53,629
Only that reclusive gentleman
would pull such a scene.

107
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:56,999
Got it.

108
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:58,667
Thanks, Yu Shan.

109
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:13,149
Even S-class Alphas must have weaknesses.

110
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:16,219
That Omega is probably
the bastard's new lover...

111
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:22,358
He's lasted months, a new record.

112
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:24,060
Interesting.

113
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,796
Catch him and bring him to me.

114
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:29,465
But what's the use of catching an Omega?

115
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:32,634
Better target the Alpha directly.

116
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:36,739
You think catching an S-class Alpha

117
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:38,508
is as easy as swatting a fly?

118
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:40,910
If it were, why would I need you?

119
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,112
Strike where it hurts.

120
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:48,885
Catching this Omega should work,

121
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:50,553
given Sheng Shao You's soft heart.

122
00:10:50,553 --> 00:10:52,555
Roger that. The client is always right.

123
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:54,190
We'll grab anyone you want.

124
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,659
We'll get that puny Omega tonight.

125
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:16,285
- Hello?
- Yong organized this banquet.

126
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:19,647
He even invited me,
but he's hiding in his room?

127
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,111
The boss's rut came early.

128
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:23,679
It's an emergency.

129
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,716
I just took him to isolation room 9901.

130
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:27,316
It's no wonder his rut is early.

131
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:29,218
He used luring pheromones

132
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:31,020
on an S-class Alpha in public.

133
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,457
I worry he'll have mating fever again.

134
00:12:34,457 --> 00:12:38,628
His room has special doors
and windows for isolation.

135
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:41,464
Keep the chain in place and close the door.

136
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:46,268
Even with mating fever,
he can't go to Sheng Shao You.

137
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:48,303
Understood.

138
00:13:38,421 --> 00:13:41,123
Who knew this Omega was into kinks?

139
00:13:41,123 --> 00:13:42,158
What is it?

140
00:13:42,158 --> 00:13:44,125
Is this forced play?

141
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:45,854
Hey.

142
00:14:46,822 --> 00:14:48,023
How's it going?

143
00:14:48,023 --> 00:14:49,624
Not bad.

144
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,976
I hope Yong's fever is better.

145
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:26,361
It's late, maybe that ugly bastard won't come.

146
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:31,967
Mr. Shao You.

147
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,406
What are your thoughts
on the targeted drug technology?

148
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:47,683
Why so angry?

149
00:15:47,683 --> 00:15:50,219
As the saying goes, "One night as lovers
brings a hundred days of affection."

150
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:52,555
We definitely can't be lovers,

151
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:55,357
but since we've shared the same Omega,

152
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:59,861
there must be
at least fifty days of goodwill, right?

153
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:17,645
We're in public. It isn't good
to abuse pheromone suppression.

154
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:25,955
Since you know we're in public,

155
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:27,256
you should shut your mouth

156
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:28,724
and stop saying things you shouldn't.

157
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:30,492
You know better than anyone

158
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:32,995
the value of the targeted drug.

159
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:35,431
Giving up cooperation with me for an Omega?

160
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:38,266
What a "wise" move, Mr Sheng.

161
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:43,272
Trading core technology for an Omega...

162
00:16:43,272 --> 00:16:46,841
Likewise, Mr Shen.

163
00:16:48,844 --> 00:16:50,379
Opportunities don't come by every day.

164
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:53,648
Think again.

165
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,135
Gao Tu, as a Beta,

166
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:16,005
why are you so sensitive
to Sheng Shao You's pheromones?

167
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:18,106
Don't tell me...

168
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:23,078
You don't like him, do you?

169
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:24,713
I'm right, aren't I?

170
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:27,182
Does his Drunk Branch scent smell that good?

171
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:30,151
What's so great about the smell of toilets?

172
00:17:31,186 --> 00:17:33,022
Mr. Shen, you misunderstand.

173
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:34,355
I...

174
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:39,194
What's wrong?

175
00:17:40,963 --> 00:17:44,232
Mr. Shen, I need to use the restroom.

176
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:46,868
Go on.

177
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:18,434
That Omega has a strong scent.

178
00:18:18,434 --> 00:18:20,102
Why is he running around in heat?

179
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:22,638
Yeah, that's dangerous.

180
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:25,074
But honestly, he smells good.

181
00:18:25,074 --> 00:18:29,545
What if he meets an unscrupulous Alpha
or one with high compatibility?

182
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:31,947
Should we help him?

183
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:33,282
Mind your own business.

184
00:18:33,282 --> 00:18:34,950
Jiang Hu has good security,

185
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,885
especially in such a nice hotel.

186
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:39,054
Besides, how likely is he to meet an Alpha

187
00:18:39,054 --> 00:18:41,790
with over 90% compatibility?

188
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:46,061
True, only an Alpha
with more than 90% compatibility

189
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:47,763
would lose control around him.

190
00:18:47,763 --> 00:18:50,031
Can't be that unlucky, right?

191
00:19:28,237 --> 00:19:30,238
Why is he taking so long?

192
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,551
He isn't answering his phone.

193
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:59,167
Did Sheng Shao You's scent
trigger his asthma again?

194
00:20:13,315 --> 00:20:14,950
Strange.

195
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,485
Why did Yong call me so many times?

196
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:18,821
Why did you help
that floral-scented Omega earlier?

197
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:20,756
Was it because he smelled good,

198
00:20:20,756 --> 00:20:23,459
or did you want to take advantage of his heat?

199
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:24,860
I didn't!

200
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,495
Do I look like that kind of person?

201
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,297
Yes, you do!

202
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:30,132
Heat.

203
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:32,234
Did Yong come here to find me?

204
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:34,403
- Stop arguing, you definitely did.
- No, I wasn't.

205
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:37,539
I told him to rest at home.

206
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:41,577
Excuse me, where is
the Omega in heat you mentioned?

207
00:20:41,577 --> 00:20:44,146
Near the restroom over there.

208
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:45,446
Thanks.

209
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:06,634
Who are you? What do you want?

210
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:32,994
So fierce.

211
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:41,870
Bastard!

212
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,038
Who the hell are you?

213
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:45,707
Let go! Release me!

214
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:15,037
Such a strong sage scent.

215
00:22:15,037 --> 00:22:18,206
Which Omega is running around in heat?

216
00:22:26,315 --> 00:22:28,783
Why is it suddenly so hot here?

217
00:22:29,484 --> 00:22:31,586
Is the air-con broken?

218
00:24:10,218 --> 00:24:14,057
Did you wear this shirt clip for me?

219
00:24:14,057 --> 00:24:15,857
It's beautiful.

220
00:24:22,364 --> 00:24:25,399
Let go, bastard!

221
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:46,320
Be good, lift your hips.

222
00:24:47,422 --> 00:24:49,357
What for?

223
00:24:50,192 --> 00:24:51,959
I need to use it.

224
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:54,795
Get away!

225
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:01,235
Let me go!

226
00:25:03,238 --> 00:25:06,407
Let go!

227
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:09,544
It hurts.

228
00:25:09,544 --> 00:25:10,879
Be good.

229
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:12,748
Hold on a little longer.

230
00:25:12,748 --> 00:25:14,316
It'll stop hurting soon.

231
00:25:14,316 --> 00:25:16,517
Bastard.

232
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:21,455
You'd better pray I never...

233
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:24,258
I never

234
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,061
find out who you are.

235
00:25:28,797 --> 00:25:31,465
You will someday.

236
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:34,602
You bastard.

237
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,104
Be gentle.

238
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:53,588
Clearly, he came this way...

239
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:56,857
But he's not in the restroom.

240
00:25:57,826 --> 00:26:00,095
He's not answering calls either.

241
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:02,663
Where the hell is he?

242
00:26:32,227 --> 00:26:33,961
Who's inside?

243
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:56,183
Gao Tu.

244
00:28:07,355 --> 00:28:09,623
Mr. Sheng, you're awake.

245
00:28:26,741 --> 00:28:28,509
What time is it?

246
00:28:30,845 --> 00:28:32,814
4 P.M.

247
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:35,150
You've been asleep since last night.

248
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,018
I was worried you were sick

249
00:28:37,018 --> 00:28:38,353
and was going to take you to the hospital

250
00:28:38,353 --> 00:28:40,254
if you didn't wake up.

251
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:51,365
Mr. Sheng!

252
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:54,436
Who brought me back last night?

253
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:56,204
Me.

254
00:28:56,204 --> 00:29:01,509
A staff from X Hotel called,
said you were drunk and asleep in a room.

255
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:03,577
I picked you up.

256
00:29:11,953 --> 00:29:15,724
Mr. Sheng, I need to report something important.

257
00:29:15,724 --> 00:29:17,191
What?

258
00:29:18,393 --> 00:29:20,394
Mr. Hua is missing.

259
00:29:22,497 --> 00:29:24,299
Missing?

260
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:26,668
What do you mean by "missing"?

261
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:28,103
When I brought you back last night,

262
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:31,940
the doorbell rang for ages with no answer.

263
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,875
I found this letter in the foyer.

264
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:38,846
It's from Mr. Hua.

265
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:42,082
It's addressed to you, so I didn't read it.

266
00:29:43,218 --> 00:29:46,687
I sent people to look for him,
but no news yet.

267
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:51,459
To dear Mr. Sheng.

268
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:53,762
Lovers can be found again,

269
00:29:53,762 --> 00:29:56,431
but a father is irreplaceable.

270
00:29:56,431 --> 00:30:00,235
You've always been soft-hearted,
torn between choices.

271
00:30:00,235 --> 00:30:02,737
But I don't want you to have regrets,

272
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:05,640
or see me each day and be forced to remember

273
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,110
the sacrifices you made for me.

274
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,912
I don't want guilt to eat at you.

275
00:30:13,682 --> 00:30:15,550
So...

276
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,384
I'll choose for you.

277
00:30:17,986 --> 00:30:23,057
Kinship deserves priority
over a tainted Omega.

278
00:30:24,626 --> 00:30:26,594
You're so smart.

279
00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:29,897
How could you stumble over
such a simple choice?

280
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:33,435
Mr. Sheng.

281
00:30:33,435 --> 00:30:36,070
You don't have to be unhappy now.

282
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:39,774
Please find happiness.

283
00:30:39,774 --> 00:30:43,978
Only then will I also be happy.

284
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,648
I love you,

285
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:51,886
but you deserve better.

286
00:30:51,886 --> 00:30:53,454
Hua Yong.

287
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,069
Did you sleep well last night?

288
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:09,404
Yeah.

289
00:31:09,404 --> 00:31:11,472
I didn't.

290
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,841
Why not?

291
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:15,777
You tell me.

292
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:19,781
Had a hangover from
downing drinks for Shen Wen Lang?

293
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:21,382
No.

294
00:31:23,218 --> 00:31:25,820
My heart was racing too fast.

295
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,155
Is that so?

296
00:31:27,155 --> 00:31:28,756
Yeah.

297
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:32,393
Faster than ever.

298
00:31:33,595 --> 00:31:35,763
So, you couldn't sleep?

299
00:31:35,763 --> 00:31:37,265
what are you going to do in the future?

300
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:38,866
In the future?

301
00:31:40,335 --> 00:31:42,003
Yeah.

302
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:43,804
What should I do in the future?

303
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:52,680
Mr. Sheng, if we date,
will I get a heart attack?

304
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,782
Why "if"?

305
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:58,886
Hua Yong, what do you see me as now?

306
00:32:03,324 --> 00:32:06,594
What do you do when you're jealous?

307
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:08,362
I'll do this.

308
00:32:16,304 --> 00:32:18,639
Mr. Sheng, you're back!

309
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:31,418
Mr. Sheng.

310
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,722
Don't be sad.

311
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:36,457
I love you,

312
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:40,995
so I want you happy forever.

313
00:32:46,201 --> 00:32:47,868
Same here.

314
00:32:53,308 --> 00:32:56,177
As the heir chosen by his father,

315
00:32:56,177 --> 00:33:00,782
Sheng Shao You never had a day truly his own.

316
00:33:00,782 --> 00:33:05,420
He was the future head,
the Sheng family's pillar...

317
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:11,192
He must be bold, strong, and invincible.

318
00:33:11,192 --> 00:33:15,696
Tears were a sign of weakness...

319
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:19,300
Sheng Shao You couldn't cry.

320
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:25,840
No matter the pain or grievance,
tears were forbidden.

321
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,744
But on this day,
finding he had lost Hua Yong again,

322
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:34,482
the young leader bowed his head in agony,

323
00:33:34,482 --> 00:33:38,186
teetering between endurance and collapse,

324
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:42,723
finally sobbing hoarsely.

325
00:33:43,358 --> 00:33:45,426
Happiness?

326
00:33:45,426 --> 00:33:47,595
No.

327
00:33:47,595 --> 00:33:50,064
Without Hua Yong,

328
00:33:50,064 --> 00:33:53,767
Sheng Shao You will never be happy again.

329
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:13,120
Mr. Shen.

330
00:34:16,457 --> 00:34:19,827
Mr. Shen, please sign here.

331
00:34:32,407 --> 00:34:34,442
Has Gao Tu not arrived yet?

332
00:34:34,442 --> 00:34:35,710
I was just about to tell you...

333
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,179
We've contacted Secretary Gao.

334
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,347
What's his deal?

335
00:34:39,347 --> 00:34:42,517
Secretary Gao said
he needs a few more days off.

336
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:44,975
Three days of unexcused absence.

337
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:49,390
No calls, no texts,
and now he wants more leave?

338
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,792
What the hell is wrong with him?

339
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:56,864
He said he needs to
accompany his Omega partner through heat.

340
00:34:56,864 --> 00:34:59,300
For an Omega who goes into heat
at the drop of a hat,

341
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,035
he forgot to even request leave?

342
00:35:01,035 --> 00:35:03,204
Is his brain waterlogged?

343
00:35:03,204 --> 00:35:04,939
Don't worry, Mr. Shen.

344
00:35:04,939 --> 00:35:07,108
Regarding the absenteeism,

345
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:10,310
the secretarial department
will handle it seriously.

346
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,652
Is there anything else, Mr. Shen?

347
00:35:16,652 --> 00:35:21,021
If not, I'll take this document to Procurement.

348
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:01,934
[Pick up. Is your phone broken?]

349
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:04,953
[Gao Tu, why aren't you answering?
Have you gone missing?]

350
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,937
Three days absent and now more leave?

351
00:36:09,937 --> 00:36:12,506
Do you have a waterlogged brain!

352
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:25,720
What is it?

353
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,756
The targeted drug has passed initial trials.

354
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:32,427
Tomorrow, you and I
will deliver it to Mr. Sheng's father.

355
00:36:32,427 --> 00:36:33,628
Deliver the drug?

356
00:36:33,628 --> 00:36:34,962
Why should I go?

357
00:36:34,962 --> 00:36:38,666
Am I an errand boy
for you and Sheng Shao You?

358
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:40,735
If that's how you choose to see it,

359
00:36:40,735 --> 00:36:42,103
there's nothing I can do.

360
00:36:42,103 --> 00:36:43,805
I'm not going.

361
00:36:43,805 --> 00:36:45,940
Get someone else to pick it up.

362
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,508
You deliver it personally

363
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:49,277
Mr. Sheng is furious...

364
00:36:49,277 --> 00:36:52,246
He'll probably feel better
after beating you up.

365
00:36:52,246 --> 00:36:54,215
Why doesn't he beat you?

366
00:36:54,215 --> 00:36:56,383
Mr. Sheng can't bear to.

367
00:36:57,185 --> 00:36:58,486
Can't bear to?

368
00:36:58,486 --> 00:37:02,223
Hua Yong, don't get cocky.

369
00:37:02,223 --> 00:37:04,592
If Sheng Shao You finds out your true nature,

370
00:37:04,592 --> 00:37:06,961
let's see if he'll still hold back.

371
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:09,697
Don't say such ominous things.

372
00:37:09,697 --> 00:37:13,801
Oh right, heard you slept
with an Omega the other day.

373
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:16,337
Wanna know what he looks like?

374
00:37:16,337 --> 00:37:17,705
What do you mean?

375
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:19,159
With your personality,

376
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:22,977
you should be scouring the world
for the Omega who finally got you laid.

377
00:37:22,977 --> 00:37:25,913
"Got me laid"? Spare me.

378
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:30,084
That filthy Omega who used high compatibility
and heat to trick me into sex...

379
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:32,019
If I find out who he is,

380
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:33,387
he's dead.

381
00:37:33,387 --> 00:37:35,056
Don't think he can get anything from me

382
00:37:35,056 --> 00:37:36,991
with such dirty tricks.

383
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:39,160
Filthy Omega.

384
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,430
Anyway, I got his photo.

385
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,839
Wanna see it?

386
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,601
Show up tomorrow with the drug.

387
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:47,735
How did you get the photo?

388
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:49,103
None of your business.

389
00:37:49,103 --> 00:37:52,839
I'll send it after you do me this favor.

390
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:55,943
Which hospital?

391
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:58,179
He Ci, I'm going with you.

392
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:00,314
- You're coming too?
- Yep.

393
00:38:00,314 --> 00:38:01,949
Why?

394
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:05,786
I left a note for Mr. Sheng
saying I'm with you.

395
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:07,021
I'm not going.

396
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:08,356
Why not?

397
00:38:08,356 --> 00:38:10,224
What am I supposed to do there?

398
00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:12,793
Be Sheng Shao You's punching bag?

399
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:15,263
Relax, I'll go with you.

400
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:16,764
I won't let him lay a hand on you.

401
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:18,365
I said I'm not going!

402
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:25,072
Wen Lang, you know the saying,
"See a thing through to the end".

403
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:27,975
All I know is: "It's easier to invite a god
than send him away".

404
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,844
If that's how you want to see it,

405
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:33,547
I'll have Chang Yu pick you up
at the office at 1 P.M. tomorrow.

406
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:57,037
An Omega in heat.

407
00:38:58,406 --> 00:39:00,307
Who sent you?

408
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:19,827
You smell good.

409
00:39:19,827 --> 00:39:21,828
Let me go!

410
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:28,235
Let you go?

411
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:30,338
Filthy Omega.

412
00:39:30,338 --> 00:39:32,706
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

413
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:14,375
[Gao Qing]

414
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,310
Brother, are you here?

415
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:21,214
The doctor said
a body check needs family signature.

416
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:29,757
Sorry, Qing.

417
00:41:29,757 --> 00:41:31,660
I fell asleep.

418
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,960
I'll come right away.

419
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,628
It's okay, take your time.

420
00:41:34,628 --> 00:41:35,963
Be careful on the road.

421
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:37,364
Okay.

422
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:15,178
Brother.

423
00:42:15,178 --> 00:42:17,471
- Did you have lunch?
- Yes.

424
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,472
Why didn't you sleep longer?

425
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:19,840
I've been lying here all day...

426
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,941
My head feels flat.

427
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:22,643
How can I sleep?

428
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:24,678
Any discomfort?

429
00:42:24,678 --> 00:42:26,180
The nurse said I'm recovering well.

430
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,948
I can be discharged soon.

431
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:29,549
Good to hear.

432
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:33,187
- Here.
- My favorite fruit!

433
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:35,755
Brother, you're the best.

434
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:41,462
Eat slowly.

435
00:42:41,462 --> 00:42:42,630
You just got better.

436
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,633
- Watch your diet.
- Got it.

437
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:48,436
Brother, where were you these days?

438
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:50,704
You didn't answer calls or texts.

439
00:42:50,704 --> 00:42:51,939
I thought something happened.

440
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:53,340
I almost ran out to find you.

441
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,475
I had work issues...

442
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:55,843
Pulled overtime for days.

443
00:42:55,843 --> 00:42:57,678
I was too tired to reply.

444
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:59,113
You're lying.

445
00:42:59,113 --> 00:43:02,082
You never ignored me before.

446
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,255
What's that on your neck?

447
00:43:09,957 --> 00:43:11,925
What?

448
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:16,096
Are you dating someone?

449
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:18,799
No, don't talk nonsense.

450
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:20,501
Then what's on your neck?

451
00:43:20,501 --> 00:43:22,335
And here, too.

452
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:26,040
Mosquito bites, maybe?

453
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,741
The screen window at home is broken.

454
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:31,111
I've been too busy to fix it.

455
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:32,847
Oh.

456
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:36,317
Brother, take care of yourself, too.

457
00:43:36,317 --> 00:43:39,019
Buy new clothes when they get old,

458
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:42,423
fix the screen window when it's broken.

459
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:44,925
You only wear work clothes...

460
00:43:44,925 --> 00:43:48,028
You haven't bought new ones in years.

461
00:43:51,065 --> 00:43:53,267
It's my fault.

462
00:43:53,267 --> 00:43:56,203
If I weren't sick,

463
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:58,072
you wouldn't be so tired.

464
00:43:58,072 --> 00:44:00,708
Nonsense, it's not tiring.

465
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:04,945
Besides, you're almost recovered.

466
00:44:04,945 --> 00:44:07,113
Things will get better.

467
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:09,984
Yeah.

468
00:44:09,984 --> 00:44:13,120
When I'm better, I'll go back to school,

469
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,389
and I'll make big money
after graduation to support you.

470
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:16,924
You can quit that job.

471
00:44:16,924 --> 00:44:20,494
Your boss makes you work like a slave.

472
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:22,429
Don't say that.

473
00:44:23,264 --> 00:44:27,401
Without Mr. Shen, we couldn't have made it.

474
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:29,069
He's a good person.

475
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:30,671
A good person?

476
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:32,606
More like a modern slave owner!

477
00:44:32,606 --> 00:44:36,510
Does he make you
go to his place every weekend to clean?

478
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,045
If he weren't Omega-phobic,

479
00:44:38,045 --> 00:44:40,313
I'd think he had a crush on you.

480
00:44:43,317 --> 00:44:44,918
Don't say that.

481
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,989
Brother, I'm your real sister.

482
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:51,292
Why take his side when I mention him?

483
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:53,861
Yes, he paid my surgery fees.

484
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:56,864
I'll pay him back double.

485
00:44:56,864 --> 00:45:00,500
But I don't think you're happy working for him.
