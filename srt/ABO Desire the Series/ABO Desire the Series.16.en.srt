00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:37,934
[Episode 16]

2
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,035
Why did my father call me here in such a hurry?

3
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,236
Is it a recurring condition?

4
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:43,704
The chairman's condition is stable.

5
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:47,274
You're here about
the X Hotel billboard proposal, I assume.

6
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:01,822
Come in.

7
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,632
Secretary Chen, give us a moment.

8
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,100
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,006
Dad.

10
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:22,876
How long have you known X Holdings' top brass?

11
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:25,112
Not long.

12
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,649
When I was your age,

13
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,618
I was always cornered by different Omegas

14
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:33,020
on my way home from work.

15
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,690
Among those who chased after you

16
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,158
was Shao Qing's mother.

17
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:44,231
Conquest is in every Alpha's nature.

18
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:49,437
I don't think you speak for all Alphas.

19
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:52,939
After all, not everyone
enjoys cheating on their spouse.

20
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:57,745
I admit, emotionally, I failed your mother.

21
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:01,882
But I gave her a life of status and comfort.

22
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,251
She might've had a good life
marrying someone else.

23
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,287
Maybe even better.

24
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:07,888
Of course.

25
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,124
That man might have cheated, too.

26
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:11,492
It's just...

27
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,962
If she hadn't loved him like she loved you,

28
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,531
it wouldn't have hurt so much.

29
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,099
I know all the awful things Shao Qing did.

30
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,169
I've heard everything

31
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,871
I've spoken to his mother, too.

32
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,539
I gave her a piece of my mind.

33
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,441
"A piece of your mind"?

34
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,909
In what sense?

35
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:29,910
Teaching her step by step?

36
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,780
Like hiring the top criminal lawyer
in Jiang Hu?

37
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,715
So, her precious son could get bail quickly?

38
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,284
That kind of reprimand?

39
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,686
As for the legal fees,

40
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:42,155
I'm not paying a cent.

41
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,328
But you'll still cover
her living expenses, right?

42
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,030
Dad.

43
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,432
There's no need
for any of us to fool ourselves.

44
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,567
Even if Sheng Shao Qing wants me dead,

45
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,203
he's still your baby son.

46
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,672
He carries half your blood, after all.

47
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,741
So, you...

48
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,643
You're my child, too.

49
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:06,080
The one I value most.

50
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,083
My one and only heir.

51
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,351
The future of Sheng Fang.

52
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,386
You could have let Sheng Shao Qing,

53
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:15,723
Sheng Shao Qi, or Sheng Shao Lin take over.

54
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,191
Oh.

55
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:20,227
And also Sheng Shao Qian,
Sheng Shao Yue, and Sheng Shao Wan.

56
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,463
They could all take your place

57
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,764
if they were capable.

58
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,403
Being your "most valued" child is a lousy spot.

59
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:30,738
I get all the responsibility.

60
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,773
And they get all the affection.

61
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,910
Selective breeding, top-down screening.

62
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,144
Dad.

63
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,647
You're such a brilliant educator.

64
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,549
There is also a set of advanced concepts

65
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:43,584
even when treating your own children.

66
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,986
You have a style of your own.

67
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,755
I asked you here today

68
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,990
not to talk about that.

69
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,659
Shao You.

70
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,726
What are you going to do

71
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,262
about your relationship with Hua?

72
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:58,699
What?

73
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,168
That young guy from X Holdings.

74
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,170
He's no saint.

75
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,040
I don't know what you did
to attract his attention,

76
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,409
but since he's playing nice now,

77
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,411
that puts us in a better position.

78
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:14,482
I know you're really into Hua.

79
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,650
I'm not saying you have to break up now.

80
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,321
But you need to keep your head clear.

81
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:23,591
Since you've accepted
the proposal from X Holdings' heir,

82
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:26,527
you'd better keep things low-profile
with Hua for now.

83
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,929
When did I say yes?

84
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,498
So, you're going to turn him down?

85
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:34,768
That heir from X Holdings or Hua...

86
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:39,907
Shao You, don't tell me
you don't know which one to pick.

87
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:43,878
Honestly, there's no need to pick.

88
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:45,579
Sometimes,

89
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,782
you can have your cake and eat it, too.

90
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,819
So, you want me to be like you?

91
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,788
Be greedy and take both?

92
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,090
What's wrong with that?

93
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,124
What's so wrong about it?

94
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:05,833
What's wrong with it?

95
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,302
You should ask my mother.

96
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,271
She knows better than anyone

97
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:12,940
what it's like to live with a greedy husband.

98
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,075
We're talking about you now.

99
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,477
Stop talking about anything else.

100
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:19,280
Plus, the guy from X Holdings

101
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,648
is not your mom.

102
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:23,050
No, he's not.

103
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,485
He's not like my mom.

104
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:27,221
He didn't fall for a scumbag as a teenager,

105
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,822
get married, and have kids.

106
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:32,860
My mother had neither power nor background,

107
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,595
so she had to put up with your cheating.

108
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:42,603
What happens between Hua Yong and me
is none of your business

109
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,339
I'm leaving. Take care of yourself.

110
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:46,940
You...

111
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,826
Shao You, heard you're marrying
into a rich family as a live-in son-in-law.

112
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:10,230
So, how about handing Hua over to me?

113
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,865
You out of your mind? Looking to get yelled at?

114
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,234
All right.

115
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:14,835
Just kidding.

116
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,503
Tomorrow, I'm going to meet up with Yu Shan.

117
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:20,507
We're celebrating you winning UKW's heart
from X Holdings.

118
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,109
It's been a long time
since we've hung out together.

119
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,677
You better be there.

120
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,245
Got it.

121
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,685
You're going out drinking
with friends tomorrow night?

122
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:33,721
- Yeah.
- I'm coming, too.

123
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:35,022
Why?

124
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,823
Trying to flirt?

125
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:42,596
I'm going to make sure you don't drink.

126
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,198
Didn't you say your genes were super strong?

127
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,567
The little one's not even afraid of cyanide.

128
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,502
So, what's a little alcohol, right?

129
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,037
I'm sure you wouldn't want

130
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:53,073
for baby Peanut to start life as a boozehound.

131
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,789
Hello? Who is it?

132
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:09,790
Hello.

133
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,859
Nice to meet you, sir.

134
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,327
My name is Shen.

135
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,596
A colleague of Gao Tu.

136
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:19,432
You work with Gao Tu... Shen...

137
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:22,202
You're his boss, right?

138
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,104
He's mentioned you before.

139
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,006
So, what's this about?

140
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,708
Here's the thing.

141
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,810
I'd like to talk to Gao Tu in person
about something.

142
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,880
But he quit and changed his number.

143
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,548
I can't get in touch with him.

144
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,917
So, I figured I'd reach out to his family.

145
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,887
Do you have a way to get in touch with him?

146
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,121
Of course.

147
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,757
I was just on the phone with him.

148
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:47,928
Mr. Shen, what business
do you have with Gao Tu?

149
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,529
I...

150
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,499
There's just been a misunderstanding.

151
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,601
I'd like to clear the air.

152
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,870
Got it.

153
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,174
And...

154
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:01,742
When you ask him out,

155
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,511
could you not say it's me who asked?

156
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,580
I'm afraid he won't dare come over.

157
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,582
Okay, okay.

158
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,317
I'll let you know once I set it up.

159
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,486
All right.

160
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:14,120
Thank you.

161
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,334
Gao Tu is an Omega.

162
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,338
There's this sudden pregnancy

163
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,874
then he vanishes just like that?

164
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:39,046
And that boss of his, Shen, the rich Alpha?

165
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:43,249
He's suddenly acting all worried about Gao Tu?

166
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:50,557
I bet Gao Tu's carrying his baby.

167
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:55,195
Talk about the stars aligning,
just what I needed.

168
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,064
Even the heavens are on my side.

169
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,513
Things are much better now.

170
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:14,348
You'll be discharged from the hospital soon.

171
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,949
Thank you.

172
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,920
Brother.

173
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,954
I have a check-up later.

174
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,356
- Just wait here.
- Okay.

175
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,493
Here you are.

176
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,228
Go on. Call for me if you need anything.

177
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,929
Okay.

178
00:10:37,234 --> 00:10:39,601
[Gao Ming - Don't Answer]

179
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:58,258
Qing, I need to talk
to you and your brother, it's urgent.

180
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,060
Don't worry, it's not about money.

181
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,729
Call me back as soon as you see this.

182
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,560
Hello?

183
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,864
Gao Tu?

184
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,465
Hey, what's going on with you?

185
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,700
Why's your number out of service?

186
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,868
Are you okay?

187
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,237
What's the matter?

188
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:45,105
No, nothing serious. Here's the thing.

189
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,274
That money you gave me
a couple of months ago...

190
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:48,342
I don't need it anymore.

191
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:49,977
So, I was in a rush to return it to you.

192
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,745
But I couldn't get through.

193
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:55,349
So, I figured I'd try my luck
and come find Qing.

194
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,450
You want to...

195
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:00,787
give the money back?

196
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:04,658
There's no need.

197
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,460
If you've got extra cash,

198
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,595
just keep it for yourself.

199
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,196
Just...

200
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,000
don't gamble again.

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,134
Don't worry.

202
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,770
Listen, I've got a real job now.

203
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,872
From now on, money's not gonna be a problem.

204
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,507
And I swear I'm done gambling.

205
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,742
Okay.

206
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,409
That's good.

207
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,412
Dad.

208
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,981
Things have been a bit rough at work lately.

209
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:31,585
I might not be able
to send you money regularly anymore.

210
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:32,786
It's okay.

211
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:35,690
From now on, I won't
have to worry about money anymore.

212
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,991
Oh, where are you right now?

213
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,097
Qing and I are at the hospital for a check-up.

214
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:47,066
I see. Let's grab a meal sometime then.

215
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,270
How about tomorrow?

216
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,240
At the place we used to go to.

217
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,740
Sound good?

218
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,376
Maybe not.

219
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,113
Hey, Tu.

220
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,183
I swear, I'm not calling
to ask for money this time.

221
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:06,053
It's been over a year
since we saw each other, hasn't it?

222
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:10,423
Son, a family should at least
act like one, right?

223
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,167
Tu...

224
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,736
Was Dad really that bad before?

225
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:26,305
No.

226
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,141
It's all in the past.

227
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,376
Then it's settled.

228
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,010
See you tomorrow.

229
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:33,013
Okay.

230
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,615
All right then.

231
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,315
See you tomorrow.

232
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:51,798
What's going on?

233
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,234
Mr. Hua., the Chairman would like to see you
tomorrow at 8:30 A.M.

234
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,402
Please come to He Ci Hospital alone.

235
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,437
He wants to talk to you
about you and Mr. Sheng.

236
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,038
It's nothing.

237
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,345
Shao You.

238
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,947
Why is your glass empty?

239
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,548
Let me pour you something.

240
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,287
Mr. Sheng can't drink alcohol.

241
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,291
Why can't he drink?

242
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,027
Yeah, why not?

243
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,928
Why can't I drink?

244
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,834
Because of me.

245
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:32,105
Excuse me, waiter.

246
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,241
Can we get a pitcher of orange juice
and two glasses of warm water?

247
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,243
Sure, just a moment.

248
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:37,544
Wait.

249
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,046
Shao You.

250
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,715
You came all the way here
just for orange juice?

251
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:45,151
Do you want me to order you
two bottles of kids' milk too?

252
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,021
Yong.

253
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,756
Shao You just got
a public proposal from someone else.

254
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,358
And you're still here fussing over him?

255
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:52,759
Careful, he might just get annoyed...

256
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,462
and marry someone else instead.

257
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:58,598
Bo Qiao. Cut the crap.

258
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,501
Here's your orange juice and warm water.

259
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,937
Enjoy.

260
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:12,879
Boss, there's a commotion outside.

261
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,319
Hey, Yu Shan. Where are you going?

262
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:21,154
Someone's making trouble out front.
I'm going to check it out.

263
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,856
Someone dares cause trouble here?

264
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,258
Heard it's a shareholder
from Country P's X Holdings.

265
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,393
I'll take a look.

266
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,495
X Holdings, huh?

267
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:31,397
Then Shao You has to see this, too.

268
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,635
Yu Shan, I'll go with you.

269
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,236
Let's go.

270
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,167
Hey.

271
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,935
You're the owner here, right?

272
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,536
And you are?

273
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,546
My boss likes this place.

274
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,414
He wants you to clear out.

275
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:22,449
Buddy...

276
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,518
Your boss is welcome as a guest.

277
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:26,353
Guests should act like guests.

278
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,355
You're interfering with my business.

279
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,190
That's not okay, is it?

280
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,758
And what's so bad about that?

281
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,293
Do you even know who my boss is?

282
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,294
Nope.

283
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,764
He's a major shareholder of X Holdings.

284
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:39,199
Be smart about this. Clear this place. Now.

285
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,536
We'll pay you double.

286
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:47,040
Is everyone from X Holdings this arrogant?

287
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,375
Are you done yet?

288
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,311
Is clearing a place out that hard?

289
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:54,547
- Boss.
- Boss, we're just talking.

290
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:01,454
Boss, that's the guy in charge here.

291
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:06,659
So, you're the boss?

292
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:08,695
All these years...

293
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,030
I've never met anyone

294
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,200
who dared to say no to me.

295
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,702
It's happening to you now, isn't it?

296
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,536
What did you say?

297
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:25,378
Wanna keep your left hand or your right?

298
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,881
Hua...

299
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,050
Hua Yong.

300
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,884
Hua Yong.

301
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,623
Mr. Major Shareholder.

302
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:39,025
What happened to your hand?

303
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,694
It doesn't look symmetrical.

304
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,699
Need a hand with that?

305
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,200
No.

306
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,369
No, no. I'm good.

307
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,303
Let's go.

308
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,533
Mr. Sheng, finish your breakfast.

309
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,036
I'm heading out and won't be long.

310
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:26,038
Where are you going this early?

311
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:32,545
To take care of the last obstacle in my life.

312
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,615
So, I won't have to worry about it anymore.

313
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,454
Psycho.

314
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,592
Come in, please.

315
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,802
Uncle.

316
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,209
Don't stand there.

317
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,711
Sit down.

318
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,312
Okay.

319
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,489
You wanted to see me.

320
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,325
Is there something you want to tell me alone?

321
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:24,597
The last time you told me
you were from Country P.

322
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:27,233
Your country has an X Holdings.

323
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,768
You should know that.

324
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,503
Yeah, I know.

325
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,540
So, is your family in business or politics?

326
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,811
I was born into a big family.

327
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:40,013
Some went into business, some into politics.

328
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,415
But on my father's side,
they were mostly entrepreneurs.

329
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:45,118
So, how would you say

330
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:50,457
your father's business
compares to X Holdings today?

331
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:53,226
X Holdings grew from Bei Chao Holdings

332
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,427
and it's undergone massive reforms.

333
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,199
What my father built doesn't even come close.

334
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,834
You're right.

335
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:05,839
I think there isn't a company in Country P now

336
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,975
that can go toe-to-toe with X Holdings.

337
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,412
X Holdings is okay.

338
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,547
Yeah, it's okay.

339
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,751
X Holdings from your country

340
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:22,021
basically holds all the cards, doesn't it?

341
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:30,463
A while back,

342
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,899
the real power of X Holdings

343
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,102
already proposed to Shao You.

344
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:37,837
It's big news.

345
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,940
It's something you should know about.

346
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,209
Yeah, I know.

347
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,011
I'm hoping for Shao You

348
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,814
to be able to say yes to his proposal.

349
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,448
Really?

350
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:54,621
Shao You should be with
the right person for his marriage.

351
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:57,190
Besides, a marriage with X Holdings

352
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:02,061
can also provide greater stability
to Sheng Fang Biotech.

353
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:05,633
Hua Yong, I think...

354
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:08,500
you should probably be able to understand that.

355
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:14,240
I completely understand.

356
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,443
In that case, I'll change my form of address.

357
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,310
Thank you, Dad.

358
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:20,813
Dad.

359
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,784
Who the hell are you?

360
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,555
Hua Yong.

361
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:31,056
The real power behind X Holdings.

362
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,536
Our father...

363
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:51,911
Why did you hang up? Answer it.

364
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,546
What's this?

365
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,615
You just met this morning...

366
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:58,251
And you're already taking his side?

367
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:00,353
Well, he agreed to let me be with you.

368
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:01,754
Of course I'm going to back him.

369
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:02,856
It's called mutual support...

370
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:05,057
A healthy cycle, you know?

371
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,230
- Hello, Dad?
- Shao You.

372
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,065
About you and Hua...

373
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:13,833
I won't oppose it anymore.

374
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,834
Wait, what?

375
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,170
I'm saying I approve.

376
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,705
I'm okay with you two getting married.

377
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:20,940
But if Hua ever treats you badly...

378
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,642
you have to tell me, okay?

379
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:25,245
The Sheng family won't let him off easy.

380
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:26,246
Dad...

381
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:28,147
You tired of playing emperor...

382
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:30,350
And thinking of becoming a judge now?

383
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,218
Just focus on your health.

384
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:33,855
Don't go worrying about everything else.

385
00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:38,090
By the way, when are you going to get married?

386
00:22:43,263 --> 00:22:44,297
No idea.

387
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:46,032
But Yong said...

388
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,666
Yong?

389
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,638
How come you two got all chummy

390
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:53,239
after just one morning meeting?

391
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,074
What did you talk about?

392
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:57,043
You should have told me earlier

393
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:00,146
Yong's the owner of X Holdings.

394
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,715
That way I won't snub him.

395
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,955
If you're polite to everyone,

396
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:12,192
you wouldn't have snubbed Yong at all.

397
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:14,060
You...

398
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,662
Enough.

399
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,996
I've got to go. I'm hanging up now.

400
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:24,036
Our father...

401
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:33,812
Mr. Sheng.

402
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,782
I have something I want to say.

403
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,607
Will you marry me?

404
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:12,452
Why aren't you the one marrying me?

405
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,853
Then I will.

406
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:15,388
As long as you're willing, Mr. Sheng.

407
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,656
I don't care who's marrying who.

408
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,092
So...

409
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,129
Will you marry me?

410
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:01,467
You'll be Mrs. Sheng from now on.

411
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:39,639
- Dad.
- Good evening!

412
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:42,407
I don't think it's the place we always come to.

413
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:58,758
Mr. Shen.

414
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:02,661
I'm sorry, this kid was busy.

415
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:15,041
Mr. Shen, I've got him here.

416
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:19,278
Let's lay everything out today.

417
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,384
Oh, by the way, Mr. Shen...

418
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:28,354
There's one more thing I need to inform you.

419
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:31,023
Gao Tu... He's pregnant.

420
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,327
And the baby is yours.

421
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:36,061
What?

422
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,233
Gao Tu.

423
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,869
Is that true?

424
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:49,975
No.

425
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:52,477
I'm a Beta.

426
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:55,481
Mr. Shen.

427
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,149
Here.

428
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:01,621
This is the hospital report I pulled.

429
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,455
Take a look.

430
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,658
If you still don't believe it,

431
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:09,895
go to the hospital
and run a DNA test on the amniotic fluid.

432
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,345
Mr. Shen, you're such a promising young man...

433
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:31,016
I'm sure you don't want some child
with questionable origins.

434
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:38,291
Ten million.

435
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:39,759
To have us get rid of the baby.

436
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,027
Not a penny less.

437
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:48,333
Gao Tu...

438
00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:51,810
You used my trust.

439
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:55,707
You planned all this just to get pregnant.

440
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,679
So, you could demand ten million

441
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,515
when it came time to abort the child.

442
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,692
Gao Tu...

443
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,626
It's been ten years.

444
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:18,764
You've been by my side for ten years.

445
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,101
And this is what it was all for?

446
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,344
Excuse me.

447
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,714
I need the bathroom.

448
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,786
You...

449
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:40,887
Mr. Shen,

450
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:42,955
Let him go.

451
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:46,592
We are talking about aborting
an Omega's child right in front of him.

452
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:49,662
It's a bit cruel.

453
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:55,167
Why don't we settle the terms
before he returns?

454
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,405
Come on, sit.

455
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,741
Let's talk this through. Come on, sit down.

456
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,008
Take a seat.

457
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:08,939
Mr. Shen.

458
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:46,118
Hey, Brother.

459
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,719
What's going on?

460
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:50,156
Hey, Qing.

461
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:52,024
Pack your luggage now.

462
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:54,259
We have to leave Jiang Hu immediately.

463
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:34,000
Gao Tu, I know you're avoiding me on purpose.

464
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,437
We've never had an open and honest conversation
about many things.

465
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,840
So, there's been a lot of misunderstanding.

466
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,943
I hope that after seeing this video,

467
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:46,145
you'll contact me as soon as possible.

468
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:48,680
I'm not what you think I am.

469
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:51,149
Please come back.

470
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:54,386
Give me a chance to explain in person.

471
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:00,292
Where's Wen Lang?

472
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,728
Not answering the phone for days.

473
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:04,830
Also absent from the group meeting.

474
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,700
Is he playing the same game as Mr. Gao?

475
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,101
We've made contact.

476
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:10,403
He...

477
00:31:10,403 --> 00:31:11,537
is in hospital.

478
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,440
He can't go home until tomorrow.

479
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,875
What happened?

480
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:19,345
The doctor said it's from stress and anxiety.

481
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:21,113
It triggered an early rut.

482
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:25,183
Looks like he won't be able to
work properly for a while.

483
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,320
He brought it on himself.

484
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,655
The chance was right in front of him,

485
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,057
and he still let it slip away.

486
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:33,159
He didn't clear up the last misunderstanding,

487
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:35,561
and then made an even bigger mess.

488
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,431
Now Secretary Gao's avoiding him
like a mouse hiding from a cat.

489
00:31:38,431 --> 00:31:43,335
Even if he posted a missing person ad
on Mars right now

490
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,804
they'd still run even farther.

491
00:32:02,822 --> 00:32:04,422
Hey.

492
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:21,940
Gao Tu.

493
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,825
What did you think of the movie?

494
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,394
Not bad, I don't watch a lot of comedies.

495
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,196
Well...

496
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:45,898
Are you blind?

497
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:48,100
Stay back. Can't you smell him?

498
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,902
It's an S-class Alpha in his rut.

499
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:52,437
It'll be a problem if we get targeted.

500
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:28,474
What are you doing?

501
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,142
This is a common area.

502
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:32,978
It's unethical for you
to disperse your pheromones.

503
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:35,947
We have underage Omega at home.

504
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,851
Put away your pheromones.

505
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:41,820
Or I'll call the police.

506
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,461
Gao Tu.

507
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:50,863
Come out.

508
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:52,731
Gao Tu.

509
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,799
Come out.

510
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:58,437
Who the hell is that?

511
00:33:58,437 --> 00:33:59,772
Stop knocking.

512
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:02,575
- Gao Tu.
- Reel in your pheromones

513
00:34:02,575 --> 00:34:04,543
I don't know any Gao Tu.

514
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,811
Please stop knocking

515
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:06,813
I'm begging you.

516
00:34:06,813 --> 00:34:09,582
- Gao Tu
- I really don't know him.

517
00:34:09,582 --> 00:34:10,649
Gao Tu!

518
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:11,917
I really don't know who's that.

519
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,452
Come out.

520
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:16,688
Help! Help!

521
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:27,200
[Uncle Ying Yi]

522
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,175
What's going on?

523
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:40,479
Nothing.

524
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,081
Spam call.

525
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,748
Go back to sleep.

526
00:35:11,043 --> 00:35:12,478
Uncle Ying Yi.

527
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:15,582
Yong, I'm sorry for disturbing you
in the middle of the night.

528
00:35:15,582 --> 00:35:16,615
It's okay.

529
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:17,850
How can I help you?

530
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,952
I'm in a prickly situation.

531
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:23,022
I've had very little contact with old friends.

532
00:35:23,022 --> 00:35:27,226
But I know Wen Lang's done well
in Jiang Hu all these years thanks to you.

533
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:28,661
You're too kind, Uncle Ying.

534
00:35:28,661 --> 00:35:32,064
You used to be the one
who took care of me the most in Country P.

535
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:35,601
I've never even mentioned you to Wen Lang.

536
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:38,803
If there's anything I can do for you,
just say the word.

537
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:43,409
Wen Lang's in a bit of trouble right now.

538
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,344
But it's not convenient for me to step in.

539
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,712
Could you go on my behalf?

540
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,950
Gao Tu.

541
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,785
Come out.

542
00:35:52,785 --> 00:35:54,386
Gao Tu!

543
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:57,088
I miss you. Come on out.

544
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,792
Oh my God.

545
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:01,460
That's scary.

546
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,930
The target is an S-Class Alpha
who's having mating disorder.

547
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,964
He will indiscriminately attack anyone

548
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:07,132
who prevents him from seeing his mate.

549
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:09,001
Standby.

550
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,702
Yes, sir.

551
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,340
- Sir!
- Gao Tu.

552
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,709
You're suspected of unlawful entry.

553
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:18,744
Stop this dangerous behavior immediately.

554
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:21,380
- Gao Tu.
- Or the police will take further action.

555
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,449
- Gao Tu.
- We're here to ensure public safety.

556
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:25,984
- Gao Tu.
- Sir!

557
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,719
Sir!

558
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,522
Gao Tu.

559
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,924
Gao Tu.

560
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:33,960
- What's going on?
- Get out of there.

561
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,959
We're out of options.

562
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,595
The target's got a bad case of mating disorder.

563
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,497
There's no way
to communicate rationally anymore.

564
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:39,832
Get the tranquilizer gun.

565
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:41,033
The rest of you move.

566
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,735
- Gao Tu.
- First team, this way.

567
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:45,970
- Second team, over there.
- That's really scary.

568
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,152
Gao Tu.

569
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:02,955
- Get out of there.
- Fuck, the target is moving too far.

570
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:04,957
- Get out of there.
- It's hard to shoot.

571
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:07,459
- Request for reinforcements.
- Get out of there.

572
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,060
Gao Tu.

573
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,296
Gao Tu.

574
00:37:31,151 --> 00:37:33,786
I'm sorry for the scare.

575
00:37:33,786 --> 00:37:36,388
At the request of Mr. Shen's family,

576
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:39,458
I'm here to help resolve the situation.

577
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,126
Sorry for the trouble.

578
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:43,395
Everything's under control now.

579
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:45,063
Let's all move along.

580
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,405
Mr. Sheng, we exceeded our expectations,

581
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:54,740
completing multiple projects
and reaching objectives this year.

582
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,141
Various medical enterprises at home and abroad

583
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:57,709
are all in tight cooperation with us.

584
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,477
The market response has been great,

585
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,920
so our goal for next quarter

586
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,491
is to keep expanding the market share
of our new products overseas...

587
00:38:06,185 --> 00:38:08,887
Mr. Sheng? Are you okay?

588
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:20,065
Blood...

589
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:22,000
What happened? Mr. Sheng?

590
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,136
Get the entire medical team in here!

591
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:27,239
Chen Pin Ming, get the car
to the hospital! Now!

592
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:29,507
Hurry! Get in here!

593
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:39,433
[Emergency Room]

594
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,092
- Mr. Hua
- Dr. Wang.

595
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:48,760
How is Mr. Sheng?

596
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,729
Mr. Sheng is an Alpha.

597
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:53,599
The gestational sac formed
after he was permanently marked.

598
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,234
The sac wall is quite thin.

599
00:38:55,234 --> 00:38:57,369
And the fetus is unusually active.

600
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,071
The sac has ruptured.

601
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:01,240
He's lost a lot of blood.

602
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,108
It's very serious.

603
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,176
You need to be ready for the worst.

604
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:18,056
Chang Yu.

605
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,826
Go get Wen Lang.

606
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:22,293
Yes.

607
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:48,319
Where's Sheng Shao You?

608
00:39:57,663 --> 00:39:58,664
Hey.

609
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:00,632
Are you okay?

610
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,233
Wen Lang.

611
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:05,903
If anything happens to Mr. Sheng,

612
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:08,873
I'm counting on you
to look after Little Peanut.

613
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:12,811
I'll name you as the legal guardian
until they come of age.

614
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:15,346
Why don't you raise your own kids?

615
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:18,183
I'll go wherever Mr. Sheng goes.

616
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:20,018
Don't be silly.

617
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:22,387
The child is so young.

618
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:24,289
That's your child with Sheng Shao You.

619
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:25,357
Hua Yong.

620
00:40:25,357 --> 00:40:26,425
Can't you at least think of the baby?

621
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:29,193
If something happens to Mr. Sheng,

622
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:32,430
we're all done for.

623
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:39,904
It'd be me and them who killed Mr. Sheng.

624
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:45,010
If they didn't have
half of Mr. Sheng's blood in them,

625
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,311
do you really think I'd let them live?

626
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,916
Don't you love your child at all?

627
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,807
I do.

628
00:40:58,336 --> 00:41:00,171
If I didn't...

629
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,228
Mr. Sheng would be heartbroken.

630
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:14,439
Daddy Wen Lang, take me to the theme hotel.

631
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,508
We'll take you there
when they come back from Europe.

632
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:19,811
No, Daddy Wen Lang take me.

633
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,713
Let's wait for them.

634
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,415
Let Sheng Shao You take you there.

635
00:41:23,415 --> 00:41:25,817
Dad's busy. He needs to rest.

636
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,919
Father doesn't agree.

637
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:31,223
And the event is almost over.

638
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:33,659
Please, Daddy Wen Lang.

639
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,460
Just take him there.

640
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,029
Peanut is so well-behaved.

641
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:39,197
He won't be too much trouble, right?

642
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,699
He won't be trouble?

643
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,467
Why didn't you take him to Europe?

644
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:45,036
Your family honeymooned with the kids?

645
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:46,905
Sorry.

646
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:48,140
I forgot.

647
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,241
You don't have a wife.

648
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:50,609
Who doesn't have a wife?

649
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:51,877
No, I'll correct it.

650
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:53,145
It's not that.

651
00:41:53,145 --> 00:41:55,147
Your wife ran away.

652
00:41:55,147 --> 00:41:57,548
Daddy, where's Father?

653
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,185
Honey.

654
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:02,387
Daddy Wen Lang took me out.

655
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:05,990
There were mice and big dinosaurs.

656
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,260
It's not a mice.

657
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,461
It's Mickey Mouse.

658
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:11,797
It's a mouse.

659
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:13,398
Black ears.

660
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:14,833
Sharp mouth.

661
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:17,769
The mouse in the strappy pants.

662
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:18,970
Honey.

663
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,539
It's Mickey Mouse

664
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:21,940
Mickey Mouse.

665
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,308
Yeah, Mickey Mouse.

666
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:24,710
Peanut.

667
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,545
Whether the ears are black or white,

668
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:29,081
a rat or cat with a pointed
or protruding mouth,

669
00:42:29,081 --> 00:42:31,383
can you tell me when you're sure?

670
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:32,584
Your father's tired now

671
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:34,119
and need rest.

672
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,254
We have a time difference here.

673
00:42:35,254 --> 00:42:36,254
It's still dark.

674
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,090
Daddy's taking a break.

675
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,591
Only with proper rest

676
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,625
can we have the strength to go home.

677
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,260
Do you understand?

678
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,429
Okay.

679
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,465
How could a kid understand

680
00:42:46,465 --> 00:42:48,900
the kind of filth running through
your pervy brain?

681
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,302
Go do whatever you were doing.

682
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:52,771
I'll take Peanut
and get to the bottom of that rat.

683
00:42:52,771 --> 00:42:55,707
Okay. Bye, Daddy.

684
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:58,309
Bye-bye.

685
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:02,113
- Hurry up.
- Wait.

686
00:43:03,148 --> 00:43:04,383
Daddy Wen Lang.

687
00:43:04,383 --> 00:43:05,484
I'm going on my own.

688
00:43:05,484 --> 00:43:07,351
Yeah, okay.

689
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:10,755
Go on.

690
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,462
Watch out!

691
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:18,497
Peanut.

692
00:43:18,497 --> 00:43:20,999
- Sir.
- Young master.

693
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:22,667
Are you all right?

694
00:43:24,403 --> 00:43:26,370
Is the young master hurt?

695
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:30,175
- Is he injured?
- Daddy, don't worry.

696
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,309
I just took a little fall.

697
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:33,077
It doesn't hurt.

698
00:43:53,024 --> 00:43:54,625
Gao Tu.

699
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,215
Hua Yong, Hua Yong.

700
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:15,152
Don't be so disrespectful.

701
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:21,960
Come on, put your socks on, Peanut.

702
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,329
The kindergarten teacher said

703
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:30,302
a name is a symbol for all.

704
00:44:30,302 --> 00:44:34,339
We should learn to listen.

705
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:37,541
Learn to subpoena.

706
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,378
It's called calling each other.

707
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:42,881
Only when the police, prosecutors,
or court summon a suspect,

708
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:44,416
that's what they call a subpoena.

709
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:46,852
Dad, what's the police, prosecutors, and court?

710
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:49,621
It's short for the police,
the prosecutor's office, and the court.

711
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:52,991
So, what's a suspect?

712
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:55,260
It's someone who's done
something seriously wrong.

713
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,695
Just like Daddy Lang.

714
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:59,664
Is Daddy Wen Lang that kind of person?

715
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:08,039
You could think of it that way.

716
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:17,315
Daddy Wen Lang is basically on death row
with reprieve now.

717
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:19,717
What's a death sentence with reprieve?

718
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:24,189
It's just a little better than being executed.

719
00:45:24,189 --> 00:45:26,358
Reprieve from death penalty.

720
00:45:26,358 --> 00:45:29,593
Really? Is Daddy Wen Lang going to die?

721
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:33,398
He won't.

722
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:34,900
But it's worse than death.

723
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,101
It's all about faith.

724
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:39,437
It's all thanks to
Uncle Gao's magical breath keeping him alive.

725
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,840
Stop teaching nonsense.

726
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:45,310
Quit pinching Peanut's cheeks.

727
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,412
He'll drool in his sleep.

728
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:48,980
Look, his cheeks are all red now.

729
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,549
He won't!

730
00:45:50,549 --> 00:45:53,952
Peanut loves it
when I pinch his face, don't you?

731
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:54,953
No, no I don't!

732
00:45:54,953 --> 00:45:56,588
Go away, Hua Yong.

733
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,256
Don't pinch my face

734
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,659
I'll be drooling at night.

735
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:04,829
Look at your son.

736
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:07,631
One day, you're gonna end up
climbing all over my head.

737
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:16,307
You were already climbing on Daddy yesterday.

738
00:46:17,676 --> 00:46:19,177
That's not allowed, show some respect!

739
00:46:19,177 --> 00:46:22,012
Father, I was just joking.

740
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:27,284
You'd better be.

741
00:46:30,689 --> 00:46:32,724
What's going on?

742
00:46:32,724 --> 00:46:34,325
It's nothing.

743
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,361
You're not having another baby, are you?

744
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:38,996
Don't say anything with the kid around.

745
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:44,035
Even after his death,
Pangu continued to hold up the earth.

746
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:47,205
The sun and moon hung in the sky,
keeping it from collapsing.

747
00:46:47,205 --> 00:46:49,040
So, the heavens would never fall.

748
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,410
Mountains and seas
weighed down the land from below,

749
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,646
so the earth would never rise.

750
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:56,247
From that moment on,

751
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:59,851
the world became vibrant and full of life.

752
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:01,853
Daddy.

753
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:06,758
Father says you might have another baby.

754
00:47:06,758 --> 00:47:09,293
What does that mean?

755
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:17,836
Peanut.

756
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:20,805
Would you like to have a brother or sister?

757
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:22,207
Yes.

758
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:24,409
If I have a younger sibling,

759
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,945
I'm the big brother.

760
00:47:26,945 --> 00:47:28,780
Do you want to be a brother so badly?

761
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,848
Yes.

762
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:33,818
Being an older brother
means I can protect my younger siblings.

763
00:47:35,654 --> 00:47:38,923
Daddy, I'll protect you, too.

764
00:47:38,923 --> 00:47:41,026
Who are you to protect my Alpha?

765
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:42,293
Get in line.

766
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:45,363
You're so annoying. Get out.

767
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:46,665
What did you say?

768
00:47:46,665 --> 00:47:49,401
You're bullying a kid. Shame on you.

769
00:47:49,401 --> 00:47:51,603
You can't talk to your father like that

770
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:54,705
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

771
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:01,446
Go to bed early.

772
00:48:01,446 --> 00:48:03,781
You have to go to kindergarten tomorrow.

773
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:47,492
The little thing is so mean to me.

774
00:48:47,492 --> 00:48:50,061
You were the one who was being rude.

775
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:52,464
Don't steal attention from the kid.

776
00:48:52,464 --> 00:48:54,199
He's 36 months old.

777
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:55,866
How old are you?

778
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:02,573
I'm only 300 months old, too.

779
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:11,348
Okay, stop it.

780
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:15,487
Peanut said...

781
00:49:15,487 --> 00:49:18,623
he wants a brother or a sister.

782
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,090
No.

783
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,161
Goodness...

784
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:30,135
It was just a stomach bug today.

785
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:32,904
But I was scared out of my mind.

786
00:49:32,904 --> 00:49:35,206
Please don't ever scare me like that again.

787
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:37,641
Once was more than enough.

788
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:40,612
Okay.

789
00:49:40,612 --> 00:49:42,646
It was a casual mention.

790
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:48,819
Mr. Sheng.

791
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:51,456
I'm a coward.

792
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:53,557
Don't ever say that again.

793
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,795
If you dare to say that again,

794
00:49:58,897 --> 00:50:00,664
I'll go get sterilized.

795
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,173
You little maniac.
