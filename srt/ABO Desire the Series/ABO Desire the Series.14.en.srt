00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:37,968
[Episode 14]

2
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,300
To put it simply,

3
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,468
I need to know

4
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,771
if you've been sexually active
with a partner lately.

5
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,472
I...

6
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,876
He has.

7
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,167
Congratulations, Mr. Sheng.

8
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:56,349
Your pheromone imbalance
has been completely resolved.

9
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,985
I'd suggest that during future ruts,

10
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:02,355
you should stay with that same partner.

11
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,723
What?

12
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,059
Your compatibility with that Omega

13
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,295
is likely over 90 percent.

14
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,131
Their soothing pheromones
work especially well for you.

15
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,934
Being intimate helps stabilize your condition.

16
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:25,678
You're telling my Alpha
to sleep with another Omega?

17
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,484
Don't go crazy.

18
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,420
I didn't.

19
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,228
Got it, got it.

20
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,231
If you two are of
a minority sexual orientation,

21
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:49,302
you could try using artificially extracted
calming pheromones.

22
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,505
Because most patients with pheromone disorder

23
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,375
will be better after
receiving the solace of this pheromone.

24
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,042
We don't need it.

25
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,914
Mr. Sheng has me.

26
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,431
Mr. Sheng.

27
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,166
Did you hear what Doctor Wang just said?

28
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,735
Yes, I heard him.

29
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,603
He says I should have sex with Omegas.

30
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,605
Nah.

31
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,207
Lately...

32
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,543
You haven't had sex with anyone else besides me

33
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,880
or let anyone else comfort you
with their pheromones.

34
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,714
Shut up.

35
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,970
Mr. Sheng, are you busy?

36
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:06,451
Yeah, I'm busy.

37
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:08,118
Stay away from me.

38
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,155
If I'm trying to get in your bed,

39
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:16,522
I can't keep my distance.

40
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,692
Did I say you could?

41
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,927
You're not invited.

42
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,434
The doctor advised you
to have intimate relations with your partner.

43
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,270
Mr. Sheng, are you ignoring
the doctor's orders?

44
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,038
The doctor was talking about an Omega.

45
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,706
Are you?

46
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,341
I'm not.

47
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,311
But I want to kiss you.

48
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,646
May I, Mr. Sheng?

49
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,349
I'll step out for a bit.

50
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,120
You don't need to.

51
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,056
What if...

52
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,390
What?

53
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,160
Do you think you're dirty?

54
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,063
Mr. Sheng, why do you misunderstand me so much?

55
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,967
I haven't touched anyone but you.

56
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,368
Are we going to do it or not?

57
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,204
Why all the fuss?

58
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,439
Well, what if it happens?

59
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,740
Don't blame me.

60
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,445
There's a limit to your madness.

61
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,746
You think I'm an Omega?

62
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:00,426
Hey.

63
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,761
Mr. Sheng.

64
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,796
You finally answered the phone.

65
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,064
You owe my boss over 30 million dollars.

66
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,932
When do you plan to pay up?

67
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,502
Stop fucking nagging me.

68
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,838
I lost a fortune at your damn place.

69
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,540
But when have I ever missed a payment?

70
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,741
Fine.

71
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,609
You've got three more days.

72
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,678
If you don't pay in time,

73
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,779
don't say I didn't warn you.

74
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,885
Annoying.

75
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:31,736
Damn it!

76
00:06:56,382 --> 00:07:00,520
No wonder the ancients said governing a nation
is like cooking a small dish.

77
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,788
Who would ever know

78
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:06,693
the owner of X Holdings could whip up
eggs Benedict and avocado toast?

79
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,528
You're quite the homemaker.

80
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,530
Yep.

81
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,265
I'm not really much of a cook.

82
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,200
To be able to make breakfast for you,

83
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,902
I studied with a chef for three months.

84
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:19,906
Such dedication.

85
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,240
Yeah.

86
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,779
What's the reward?

87
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,416
What are you doing?

88
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,152
Just testing our product quality.

89
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:12,492
X Holdings monopolizes
global inhibitor production.

90
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,761
But exploiting that power is unethical.

91
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:18,764
Mr. Hua, where's your shame?

92
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,635
Your rut is approaching.

93
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,604
The first rut after permanent marking

94
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,040
presents severe separation anxiety symptoms.

95
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,808
You have to be by my side at all times.

96
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,513
Permanent marking?

97
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,183
You're addicted to acting, aren't you?

98
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,150
Maniac.

99
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,647
Do you have an appointment, sir?

100
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,759
Me, Sheng Shao Qing.

101
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,728
Do I have to make an appointment
to come to my office?

102
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,963
I'm sorry, who are you looking for?

103
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,000
Sheng Shao You, my elder brother.

104
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,868
Just a moment.

105
00:08:57,743 --> 00:08:59,038
Hello, Secretary Chen.

106
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:03,209
Mr. Sheng Shao Qing is here to see Mr. Sheng.

107
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,346
Oh, okay.

108
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,914
I'll get him to take a seat first.

109
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,249
Please wait over there.

110
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,493
Why the delay?

111
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,265
Mr. Hua.

112
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,601
Mr. Sheng has been in the lounge
for almost two hours.

113
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,270
He's not answering calls or the door.

114
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,871
I'll check it out.

115
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,909
This door blocks pheromones.

116
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,145
Yeah, installed last week.

117
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,247
Mr. Sheng is an S-Class Alpha.

118
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,614
To protect others during his rut,

119
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:19,451
we replaced it with an isolation door.

120
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,455
Mr. Sheng.

121
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:34,519
Hua Yong.

122
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:40,365
Mr. Sheng.

123
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:45,830
Mr. Sheng, are you there?

124
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,720
Mr. Sheng isn't seeing anyone.

125
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,753
Secretary Chen, mind your place.

126
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,944
What's going on?

127
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,146
My brother hasn't shown up after all this time.

128
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,714
Jokes on me?

129
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,116
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheng is in a meeting.

130
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,451
As soon as the meeting is over,

131
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,986
I'll inform him as soon as he's free.

132
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,931
Big Brother.

133
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,799
It's been a long day.

134
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,171
Are you tired from the meetings?

135
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,772
Let me get you a glass of water.

136
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,207
No need.

137
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,108
Get to the point.

138
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,716
Here's the thing.

139
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,452
Brother, I really know I'm wrong.

140
00:11:58,452 --> 00:11:59,986
Please, just one more time.

141
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:03,389
You embezzled money
from the charity fund, didn't you?

142
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,925
No! Absolutely not.

143
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:10,229
I'm a scumbag,
but I wouldn't touch charity money.

144
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,664
Actually, to be honest,

145
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,300
I haven't been in charge over these years.

146
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,468
The Fund's operations

147
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,637
has always been handled by my secretary.

148
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,240
But funny you mention that.

149
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,142
He left exactly half a month ago.

150
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,276
But don't worry.

151
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,744
I'm tracking him down.

152
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,913
I'll make it right.

153
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,582
What a coincidence.

154
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,684
The reading room you oversaw the donation of
half a month ago collapsed.

155
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,420
Chen Pin Ming began investigatin
the flow of funds.

156
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,956
Your secretary vanished right then?

157
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,924
That's right.

158
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,327
Sheng Shao Qing.

159
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,830
Just admit you're running from the law.

160
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,433
No charity money was stolen?

161
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,968
Go back and ask your mother.

162
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,037
Let's see if she buys your bullshit.

163
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,905
Brother, please!

164
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,407
I'm… I'm sorry

165
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,642
I know I was wrong!

166
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,145
You were right the other day at the hospital.

167
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,213
I've been a spoiled brat all these years.

168
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:02,582
All talk, no skill.

169
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,150
I've never accomplished anything.

170
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,686
I never pushed myself.

171
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:09,189
Looking back, I...

172
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,390
I've disgraced our father.

173
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,993
And I've failed you.

174
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,265
Brother, please.

175
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,900
Help me.

176
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,368
Just this once, please

177
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,601
I know you.

178
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,971
You're tough on the outside but kind inside.

179
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:25,938
All these years,

180
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:29,041
you've been good to our siblings.

181
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,143
Please, I need your help.

182
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,845
Now, for Dad's sake, will you?

183
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,913
One last favor.

184
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,747
I'm begging you.

185
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,884
How about this?

186
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,552
Brother, I...

187
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,153
I swear.

188
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,889
I'll never go to the casino again.

189
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,358
If I ever gamble again,

190
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,159
I, Sheng Shao Qing...

191
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,562
I'm a beast.

192
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,363
If I gamble again,

193
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,567
may I get hit by a car with my mom.

194
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,238
Brother, please.

195
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,673
I'm on my knees here.

196
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,143
How much did you lose?

197
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,413
Well...

198
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,983
37 million.

199
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,921
Pathetic.

200
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,358
You're crying over pocket change.

201
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,293
Even your mom's done with you?

202
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,362
She...

203
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,431
I blew through all she gave me.

204
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,603
Bring me the checkbook.

205
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,145
I'll get it.

206
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,095
Never again.

207
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,930
I swear, never again.

208
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,331
Thank you.

209
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,733
I swear it won't happen again

210
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,438
I'll get out of your hair.

211
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,806
Call me if you need me.

212
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,650
Where's Hua Yong?

213
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,785
Secretary Hua is there.

214
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,652
Should I get him?

215
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,788
You can get off work.

216
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:23,856
What about you?

217
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,426
Secretary Hua will drive me.

218
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,859
Yes.

219
00:15:33,786 --> 00:15:35,387
Hua Yong.

220
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,670
Stop lurking.

221
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,437
Give me a hand.

222
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,646
You can't stand?

223
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,548
How cute.

224
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,610
You've got a death wish?

225
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,987
By your side,

226
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,390
even eternity wouldn't be enough.

227
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:45,404
You're good at everything.

228
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,474
Just too trusting.

229
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,342
I'll have to keep a closer eye on you.

230
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,744
If anyone tricks you,

231
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,479
I'll be heartbroken.

232
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,347
Stop talking nonsense.

233
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,284
I'm tired. Let's go home.

234
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,353
Okay.

235
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,879
You're busy even on the weekends.

236
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,126
Shouldn't you rest?

237
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,961
I'm not tired.

238
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:54,874
Hey.

239
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,875
Brother, brother.

240
00:17:57,683 --> 00:17:59,584
Are you free tomorrow?

241
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,046
What is it?

242
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,050
Nothing urgent.

243
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,119
I just wanted to treat you to a meal.

244
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:10,789
It's not a big deal.

245
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,060
No need for that.

246
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,525
No, no. Brother, listen.

247
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,627
Hear me out.

248
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:18,030
This time, I owe you for helping me.

249
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,368
And to celebrate me...

250
00:18:20,368 --> 00:18:24,439
turning over a new leaf.

251
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:28,207
Just do me a favor, okay?

252
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,341
Fine.

253
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,278
Got it. Send me the address.

254
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,012
Okay, then.

255
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,818
Who was it?

256
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,120
Sheng Shao Qing.
(Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.ovh to support Admin)

257
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,422
He asked me out for lunch tomorrow.

258
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,303
Got it.

259
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,903
I'll be right there.

260
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,307
What's going on?

261
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,878
My dad's awake.

262
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,046
Change your clothes.

263
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,947
We'll go to the hospital.

264
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,216
Mr. Sheng, why aren't you going in?

265
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,424
Dad.

266
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,762
You're here.

267
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,490
Uncle Sheng.

268
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,591
Nice to meet you.

269
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,525
My name is Hua Yong.

270
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,528
Hua Yong.

271
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,398
Shao You.

272
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,967
It took me so long to wake up.

273
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,869
Now that I've woken up,

274
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,671
you bring him to visit me.

275
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:43,108
You must be quite close, huh?

276
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,811
Uncle Sheng.

277
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,480
Mr. Sheng and I are dating.

278
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,281
Dating?

279
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,751
Among Jiang Hu's elite families,

280
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,354
I don't know any Huas.

281
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,089
Young man.

282
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,926
What's your father's name?

283
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,095
Uncle Sheng, I'm from Country P.

284
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,596
I moved here last year.

285
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,431
My father is dead.

286
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,566
What about your mother?

287
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,266
Gone, too.

288
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,037
And who else is in your family?

289
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:15,560
You just woke up and already interrogating him?

290
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,594
Aren't you tired?

291
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,482
You and Hua...

292
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,150
How long has it been going on?

293
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,851
Not long.

294
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,089
It didn't take long for you
to bring him to me.

295
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,625
He's quite young.

296
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,994
But he's quite the charmer.

297
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,397
You flatter me, Uncle Sheng.

298
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,599
I have my ways.

299
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,493
Okay, I get it.

300
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:12,931
Uncle Sheng.

301
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,133
You just woke up.

302
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,501
You should rest.

303
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,236
If that's all,

304
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:18,837
Mr. Sheng and I will take our leave now.

305
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,305
I'm not tired.

306
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,308
Hua, wait outside.

307
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:25,978
I need a word with Shao You.

308
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,212
It's fine.

309
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,447
There's nothing he can't hear.

310
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:36,989
Mr. Sheng.

311
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,624
It's been a long time since you two talked.

312
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:40,159
You should chat.

313
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,527
I just had a call to return.

314
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,861
I'll wait for you outside.

315
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,462
Okay.

316
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,852
What's wrong?

317
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:10,022
Yong, why aren't you answering my calls?

318
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,356
What's going on?

319
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,624
You've called a dozen times.

320
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:13,992
This better be important.

321
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,427
Are you in Jiang Hu?

322
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,162
Yeah.

323
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,431
How about meeting up?

324
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:19,565
Are you in Jiang Hu, too?

325
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,467
Yeah, here with Bea and the kids.

326
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,069
So...

327
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,039
You want me to be your guide?

328
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,508
You've changed, Yong.

329
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,877
You were always so serious.

330
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,447
You ignored my last call.

331
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,682
Chang Yu and Wen Lang

332
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:39,484
all told me to contact you directly.

333
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,120
What's going on?

334
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,755
My mom asked

335
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,860
if you're coming back to P
for grave sweeping this year.

336
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,562
For Uncle, your father.

337
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,130
He's been dead for years.

338
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,435
Have you visited any of the family graves?

339
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,436
Nothing else?

340
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,103
Then I'm hanging up.

341
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,841
No, there's something else I need to ask you.

342
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,377
What is it?

343
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:07,012
My anniversary with Bea is soon.

344
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:10,114
Any gift ideas?

345
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,452
Give her your heart.

346
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,887
Or undying loyalty.

347
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,024
Do you even know what loyalty is?

348
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,127
I'm just not very good at Chinese.

349
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,596
Not illiterate.

350
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:27,466
Yong, stop dodging the question.

351
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,636
I know people doubt us.

352
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,804
Every month, tabloids say

353
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,607
Bea and I are splitting up.

354
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,409
Last week, Durian Daily also said

355
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,245
I'm the meanest Omega ever.

356
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:44,016
Lucky to land a clueless and pretty Alpha.

357
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,985
Bea's not blind.

358
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,854
They're always talking nonsense.

359
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,289
So what?

360
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,224
The point is you love her to death.

361
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,625
Even had kids.

362
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,960
Why listen to them?

363
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,764
Oh.

364
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:02,967
If you really want to make her happy,

365
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,637
give her another baby.

366
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:09,741
Another child would make her happy?

367
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:10,776
Yong.

368
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:13,379
If your partner had a baby for you,

369
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,747
would you be happy?

370
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,582
Yes.

371
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,383
How happy?

372
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,222
If Auntie can convince Mr. Sheng

373
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:27,326
to give me a child,

374
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,927
I'll visit the graves at once.

375
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,996
Huh?

376
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,731
That extreme?

377
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,932
Then I see.

378
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,033
Yong.

379
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,669
An anniversary gift is a big deal.

380
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,505
I'd like to get your opinion.

381
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:43,008
Let's meet, shall we?

382
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,744
Are you really that busy?

383
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:46,945
- No meet-ups.
- Not even half an hour?

384
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,513
No time.

385
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,114
That's all.

386
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,491
You're settled down with him?

387
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,703
What do you think?

388
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,839
He's young.

389
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,273
But shrewd.

390
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,010
Seems well brought up, too.

391
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,313
If you like him
and want him to join the family,

392
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,014
I won't stop you.

393
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,951
I do like him.

394
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,719
But for him to marry into the family...

395
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,154
Even if you agree,

396
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,689
he may refuse.

397
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,191
You're an S-class Alpha.

398
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,727
Heir to Sheng Fang Group.

399
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,296
Being the Sheng family's matriarch

400
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,866
is every Omega's dream.

401
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:42,601
Hua won't do it?

402
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,836
Then he's a fool.

403
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,153
What are you looking at?

404
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:03,755
See, baby care is complicated.

405
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,656
It's a bit hard.

406
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,728
Challenging or not, what's it to you?

407
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,564
We'll need this knowledge sooner or later.

408
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:16,567
Once you agree to bear my child.

409
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:20,105
Dreams have limits.

410
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,141
I'm a dreamer.

411
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,211
And I'm good at making dreams come true.

412
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,579
Any examples?

413
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,181
Share them with me.

414
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,648
You!

415
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:35,186
Being with you is my greatest dream.

416
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:40,325
Did Uncle Sheng discuss me with you just now?

417
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,626
What does he think of me?

418
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,862
You're not only good at dreaming

419
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:47,966
but also good at communicating efficiently
with the older generation.

420
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,669
I do please elders well.

421
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,305
Yeah. He approves of you.

422
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,907
Probably named our future child already.

423
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,408
Hua Sheng!

424
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,078
I've been thinking about it since I was 16.

425
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,647
Mr. Sheng's first child
will be named Hua Sheng.

426
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,916
His nickname is Peanut.

427
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,984
You're a dreamer.

428
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,989
Don't you think it's a perfect name?

429
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,390
The first one is called Hua Sheng.

430
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,025
And the second one...

431
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,527
How about...

432
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,061
What?

433
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,667
[Sheng Fang Bio Group]

434
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:31,811
Manager Huang.

435
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,456
The driver will take you home.

436
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,825
I'll be back after dinner.

437
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,928
Mr. Sheng, I've met your father.

438
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:49,961
Why leave me behind now

439
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,563
when you're dining with my future in-laws?

440
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:55,834
Guess I'll starve tonight.

441
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,837
You can't eat without me around?

442
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,639
I hate eating alone.

443
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,207
Mr. Sheng, take me with you.

444
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,408
I'll be your driver, okay?

445
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,914
They're inviting me to dinner.

446
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,382
But I bring you along...

447
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:12,017
Secretary Hua.

448
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:13,852
Not appropriate, is it?

449
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,789
In Country P, guests don't
dictate terms either, right?

450
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,524
I rarely attend dinners there.

451
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,529
No one dares to invite you, right?

452
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,098
You're not sociable.

453
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:32,270
It's true that I'm not as pleasant as you.

454
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,239
I didn't know you knew flattery.

455
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,708
I'm telling you the truth.

456
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,210
Flattery isn't my strength.

457
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,947
But for you, I can learn.

458
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,181
When's the lesson?

459
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,715
Well...

460
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,585
Maybe this week.

461
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,487
I'll prioritize it.

462
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,323
Those who want to woo you

463
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:53,558
are more than the cockroaches at the kitchen.

464
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:54,593
I can't slack off.

465
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:56,595
Disgusting.

466
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,295
Let's go.

467
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,349
Brother, are you on the way now?

468
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,284
Yeah, on my way.

469
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,053
It's okay. Inner ring's jammed now.

470
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:24,990
Take your time and drive safely.
I'll be waiting.

471
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,191
Okay.

472
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,826
By the way, I'm bringing someone.

473
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,563
Who is it?

474
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,031
What's wrong? Is it awkward?

475
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,167
Not really.

476
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:40,038
Thought it'd be nice
since we barely dine together.

477
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:42,307
It's a rare opportunity.

478
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,808
Who's coming along?

479
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:47,311
It can't be Chen Pin Ming, can it?

480
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:49,713
No.

481
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,684
Your future in-law.

482
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,023
Can you drive?

483
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,358
Me? Hello?

484
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,527
I'm not talking to you.

485
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,560
We'll be there in half an hour.

486
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,562
Order first.

487
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,240
Why brake so hard?

488
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,841
The red light.

489
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,210
You've claimed me as your partner.

490
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,548
It's up to you.

491
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,050
I'll behave.

492
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,720
You're not doing so well right now.

493
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,623
- Really?
- Yeah.

494
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:37,062
You volunteered to drive,
but you're driving terribly.

495
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,596
I seldom drive.

496
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,932
But if you want me to,

497
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,666
I'll learn.

498
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,169
Idiot.

499
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:00,718
Why did you put up the inhibitor patch?

500
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:05,290
And an Omega pheromone spray.

501
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,393
First impressions matter.

502
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,427
He's not that fragile.

503
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,605
- Brother.
- Hey.

504
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,741
This must be my future in-law?

505
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,942
You've got a good taste.

506
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,412
Let me.

507
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:30,748
Please, sit.

508
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:37,288
Why did you pick this place?

509
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,257
Trendy spot lately.

510
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,759
A viral restaurant.

511
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,328
Didn't want crowds interrupting.

512
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,963
So, I just booked this place.

513
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:49,233
Invest that money properly.

514
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:53,438
Yeah, you're right.

515
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,039
Have you ordered yet?

516
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,840
All set.

517
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,010
Want anything else?

518
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,945
Should we ask them to add more?

519
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,181
No, this is fine.

520
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,083
All right. Waiter, serve the dishes.

521
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,962
I'm sorry.

522
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,397
What's going on?

523
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,999
- I'm sorry.
- Scram.

524
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,705
- Unbelievable.
- Doesn't matter.

525
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,908
Tonight, I brought a special bottle.

526
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:31,843
Romanee Conti, 1990

527
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,846
I've been thinking, we've never shared a drink.

528
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,481
Don't be upset by these people.

529
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,049
We should just enjoy ourselves.

530
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,416
Yeah.

531
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,758
Come on, eat up.

532
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,414
I told you to stay home.

533
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,049
But you had to tag along.

534
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,317
Is it good?

535
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,385
Yeah, it's delicious.

536
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,287
Then have more.

537
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,392
Don't worry, Mr. Sheng.

538
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,395
I won't starve with you around.

539
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,032
Don't just eat your vegetables.

540
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,034
Drink up.

541
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,105
Come on.

542
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,609
My pleasure to meet you.

543
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,947
Sorry, I don't drink.

544
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,514
Then learn.

545
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:46,084
Mr. Hua, to join the Sheng family,

546
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,285
you must drink.

547
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,790
Then to enter your life,

548
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,258
must I drink?

549
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,792
It's okay.

550
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,629
Why don't you just let brother drink for you?

551
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:58,563
How can I do that?

552
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,132
If he's drunk,

553
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:01,400
I'll be worried.

554
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,301
Stop making excuses.

555
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:08,273
Brother, Omegas rarely drink.

556
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,108
Omega?

557
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,911
Mr. Hua, is that right?

558
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:15,479
If you say so.

559
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,127
Go on, go on.

560
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:32,229
Let's drink.

561
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,374
Don't stop.

562
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,735
Mr. Sheng.

563
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:11,502
You're drunk.

564
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,511
Mr. Sheng.

565
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,344
Mr. Sheng

566
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,011
Mr. Sheng.

567
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,315
Hey,, is my wine bad?

568
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,084
You refuse to drink?

569
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,255
- I don't drink.
- Then learn.

570
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,422
Listen.

571
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,091
An Omega like you?

572
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:36,593
You'll have plenty of chances
to wait on others while they drink.

573
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:39,763
Drink this.

574
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,733
Drink up.

575
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,385
Swallow.

576
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:00,585
What are you doing?

577
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,755
He's drunk, but you wouldn't drink with me?

578
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:04,555
Are you looking down on me?

579
00:37:06,236 --> 00:37:08,338
It's pretty good.

580
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,687
What do you want?

581
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,522
What?

582
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,292
Guess.

583
00:37:44,435 --> 00:37:46,436
What do I want?

584
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,967
Damn useless fools.

585
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,702
Took my money

586
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:54,105
but still failed to remove his glands.

587
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,840
I've got no choice then.

588
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,242
I'll have to do it myself.

589
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,445
My dear brother.

590
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:03,347
Born with superior glands.

591
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,984
So, he treats us like trash.

592
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,454
An S-Class Alpha.

593
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:14,392
I wonder if he loses these glands,

594
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,094
what would he be?

595
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,332
But, you...

596
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,967
Don't be afraid.

597
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,535
Without him,

598
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,570
you still have me.

599
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,782
You're not an Omega.

600
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,000
Mr. Sheng, you saw it.

601
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,435
He attacked first.

602
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,569
It was self-defense.

603
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,639
It's impossible.

604
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,908
No.

605
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,042
How can that be?

606
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,512
Gland removal is fatal.

607
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,747
No one survives that.

608
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,450
How can you be okay?

609
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,552
What's impossible?

610
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:17,355
You're lower than a roach,

611
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,157
but it's a travesty that
the same blood as Mr. Sheng flows in you.

612
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,627
Nothing more absurd than this.

613
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:25,363
You could be Mr. Sheng's brother.

614
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,664
What else is impossible?

615
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,829
Shameless.

616
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,765
How dare you?

617
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:03,533
"Without him, you still have me."

618
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,871
I don't need you.

619
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,941
Am I supposed to save you
for New Year's dinner?

620
00:40:08,941 --> 00:40:10,708
Listen.

621
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,010
Only Sheng Shao You deserves my wrath.

622
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,579
Run, if you value your life.

623
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,507
Seeing as you're a brother-in-law,

624
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:45,909
I've spared you so far.

625
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,113
But you want Mr. Sheng dead.

626
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,481
And you damaged my glands.

627
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,356
It hurts.

628
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:00,557
So, now, Shao Qing...

629
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,594
You'll pay dearly.

630
00:41:21,205 --> 00:41:23,173
Get out of the way!

631
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:27,051
B and C-Class Alphas.

632
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,885
Plus two Betas.

633
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,823
Murder's illegal.

634
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,425
Mr. Sheng won't be happy.

635
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,093
Pathetic.

636
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,062
Barely worth my effort.

637
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,597
Can you do me a favor?

638
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,432
Step aside.

639
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:44,435
I'll just teach Sheng Shao Qing a lesson.

640
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:47,304
A small one, I promise.

641
00:41:49,032 --> 00:41:51,134
Any volunteers?

642
00:41:52,983 --> 00:41:54,984
No takers?

643
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:26,110
In a rush? Where are you going?

644
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,011
Do you need any help?

645
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,182
Get lost.

646
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:31,576
Hello, Secretary General.

647
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:33,511
Secretary Gao.

648
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:35,413
After all these years working together,

649
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:37,782
it's really hard to switch titles overnight.

650
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,683
It's okay, Secretary General.

651
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:41,585
What can I do for you?

652
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:44,088
When a colleague retires,

653
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,756
we usually throw a farewell.

654
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,625
You've been having gastroenteritis lately
and not at your best.

655
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,293
Let me know when you recover.

656
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,463
We'll treat you to dinner.

657
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:53,230
Yeah, okay.

658
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,165
Thank you, Secretary General.

659
00:44:12,617 --> 00:44:13,852
Gao Tu.

660
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:16,953
Where are my black cufflinks?

661
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,927
Left cabinet in the break room.

662
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:25,428
Second drawer.

663
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:31,001
Oh, thank you.

664
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,504
No problem.

665
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:47,951
So, when will you
marry that Omega in heat?

666
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:05,935
I'm sorry. It's private.

667
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,139
How is that private?

668
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,976
I'm just asking for a date.

669
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:13,044
Why are you so sensitive?

670
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,745
Private, my ass.

671
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,647
What does your Omega look like?

672
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:17,715
Do you have a picture?

673
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,616
Send it to me.

674
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,254
I'm sorry, no photos.

675
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,225
Who doesn't take photos?

676
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:32,395
Gao Tu, when did you become so petty?

677
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:57,167
[Gao Tu]
[Who doesn't take photos? Gao Tu, when...]

678
00:45:58,602 --> 00:46:01,337
Stop ignoring me, Gao Tu.

679
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:09,485
Why guard an Omega so fiercely?
