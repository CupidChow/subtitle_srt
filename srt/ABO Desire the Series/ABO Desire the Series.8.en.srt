President Sheng.

22
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:52,337
How do you feel?

23
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,805
I'm fine.

24
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,492
Was anyone else hurt?

25
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:15,094
One colleague twisted their ankle on their way out.

26
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:16,462
They've already been approved for medical leave.

27
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:18,998
There are no other serious issues.

28
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:20,500
Okay.

29
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,234
Good to hear.

30
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,576
Director Wang, what's wrong with President Sheng?

31
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:32,846
The blood test results are out.

32
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:36,215
Our preliminary diagnosis is pheromone dysregulation syndrome.

33
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:37,483
What?

34
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:38,685
His free-type pheromone level, type T,

35
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:41,087
is more than five times the normal range.

36
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:43,856
That's extremely abnormal for an Alpha.

37
00:02:43,856 --> 00:02:47,926
Even Omegas only reach that level during heat.

38
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:50,997
Is it serious, Director Wang?

39
00:02:50,997 --> 00:02:52,865
How do we treat it?

40
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:57,670
Logically, President Sheng is still young and is an S-class Alpha,

41
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,772
he shouldn't be developing this.

42
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:02,075
But considering his high stress,

43
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:05,478
long working hours, and irregular lifestyle,

44
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:08,781
we have to take the possibility seriously.

45
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,419
For now, I'll prescribe oral medication

46
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:18,325
to prevent extreme overflow that could harm others.

47
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:22,893
Let's wait until he's hospitalized and conduct a comprehensive inspection.

48
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:24,596
"Hospitalized"?

49
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:27,467
Can't I just take the meds?

50
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:30,770
President Sheng, I know you're very busy,

51
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,339
but no matter how busy, your body belongs to you.

52
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:37,944
Pheromone dysregulation is a serious endocrine disorder.

53
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:40,879
We still don't fully understand the cause.

54
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,718
It's already mid-stage on your first checkup.

55
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:47,686
Please take this seriously.

56
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:53,059
But I don't have the time to be hospitalized.

57
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:56,462
It's your body and your time.

58
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:59,465
But as your doctor, this is my honest advice.

59
00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:02,869
At this point, I don't think you're fit for discharge.

60
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:05,772
- Thank you, Doctor.
- All right.

61
00:04:05,772 --> 00:04:07,672
- President Sheng.
- Let's go.

62
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:12,944
You should listen to the doctor and rest in the hospital.

63
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:19,752
Fine.

64
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:22,255
Then, I want daily summaries of meetings

65
00:04:22,255 --> 00:04:24,856
and project updates delivered to me.

66
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:29,262
Don't worry. I'll have everything organized and reported to you daily.

67
00:04:29,262 --> 00:04:30,496
Okay.

68
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:34,800
And don't tell anyone that I'm sick.

69
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,369
All right, President Sheng.

70
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:37,870
Good.

71
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:12,631
Come in.

72
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:18,804
President Sheng.

73
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:21,239
These are flowers from Mr. Hua.

74
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:27,647
He's orchid-scented, but he sent me sunflowers.

75
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:30,638
Sunflowers symbolize sunshine and health.

76
00:06:30,638 --> 00:06:35,121
By the way, President Sheng, Mr. Hua said he'd like to visit you.

77
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:37,590
An Omega shouldn't be coming here.

78
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,426
Tell him to stay home and rest.

79
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:42,962
Okay, got it.

80
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:44,730
Put these flowers in a vase.

81
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,031
Okay.

82
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:10,122
Did you need something?

83
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:12,158
I heard Sheng Shao You is sick.

84
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:13,626
Who told you that?

85
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:15,628
That's none of your business.

Hua Yong, there's a limit to being crazy.

87
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,368

88
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:23,703
Only you'd think of that.

00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:29,041
What, Mr. Hardcore Bachelor going to teach me how to pursue my alpha?

90
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,310
I'm not here to teach you.

91
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,981
Just heard Sheng Shao You's is hospitalized with pheromone disorder.

92
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:36,515
I just wanted to warn you.

93
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:39,151
Do not add another case study to the medical textbooks.

94
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:44,055
No one would expect an S-class Alpha to go into heat.

95
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:56,334
What are you doing?

96
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:58,470
Making soup.

97
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:01,073
You can cook?

98
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:03,274
Who are you planning to poison?

99
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,912
- Shut up.
- Hey!

100
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:09,415
You're not going to send soup to Sheng Shao You, are you?

101
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:11,117
So domestic.

102
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:16,389
Shen Wen Lang, you should worry about yourself if you have the time.

103
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:21,525
Oh, when are you paying back the money you borrowed for your start-up?

104
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:25,030
W-Well, I'm busy. I'm getting back to work.

105
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,166
Talk later, okay?

106
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:30,936
Wishing you and your heat-prone S-class Alpha

107
00:08:30,936 --> 00:08:32,304
a lifetime of happiness together.

108
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,806
Hope you have a child soon.

109
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:35,875
May you always be of one heart and mind

110
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,009
and grow old together lovingly.

111
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:50,989
Why are you here?

112
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,192
Didn't I tell you to stay at home?

113
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:57,096
I haven't seen you in so long. Didn't you want to see me?

114
00:08:57,096 --> 00:08:59,265
We video chat every day.

115
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:01,233
I have pheromone disorder.

116
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:04,669
What if my leaking dominant pheromones hurt you?

117
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,873

118

119
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,011
Okay.

120
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,148
You shouldn't have come. What if I hurt you?

121
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:50,349
I won't get hurt.

122
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:51,951
That's nonsense.

123
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:53,953
An orchid-scented Omega like you?

124
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:56,120
I could break 10 of you with one hand.

All indicators have improved significantly.

After one more week of observation,

133
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:25,351
you can be discharged if there's no recurrence.

134
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:27,152

181
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:22,426
Thanks to your master's hospitality, it's my first afternoon tea here

182
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,297
with inspectors standing guard and commissioners directing traffic.

183
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:27,533
Even a small country president's private visit

184
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:30,803
wouldn't have this much fanfare.

185
00:13:30,803 --> 00:13:32,004
You flatter us.

186
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:35,406
We owe it all to your city's kindness. This way, please.

187
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,313
Have you thought about how this will end?

188
00:13:41,313 --> 00:13:42,714
I have.

189
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:44,016
I love him.

190
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:46,285
I could play an omega beside him forever.

191
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,954
What if he's willing to permanently mark you one day?

192
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,956
I'll remove my gland,

193
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:54,359
say it was injured, and I became a Beta.

194
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:56,428
Remove it? Don't say that so easily.

195
00:13:56,428 --> 00:13:58,030
You think it's a tonsillectomy?

196
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,032
Accidental pheromone gland injury has a zero-percent survival rate.

197
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:04,637
My body functions better than S-class Alphas'.

198
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,872
I might survive.

199
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,309
You might survive?

200
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,111
You're completely insane.

201
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:15,347
All this trouble for love.

202
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:17,215
How touching.

203
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:19,918
It's nothing.

204
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:22,620
This way, President Sheng.

205
00:14:29,394 --> 00:14:31,663
Please have a seat, President Sheng.

206
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:35,801
These are the key heads of X Holdings' pharmaceutical division.

207
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:40,872
Our boss said you'd share common ground with them.

208
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,747
I'll leave you all to chat.

209
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:50,648
Excuse me for a moment.

210
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:55,854
Secretary Chen, since there's no seat for you,

211
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:58,157
please stand for a while.

212
00:14:58,157 --> 00:15:01,226
Boss, President Sheng from Shengfang Biotech is here.

213
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:06,130
Chang Yu, bring a chair for President Sheng's secretary.

214
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:28,586
Secretary Chen, please sit.

215
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:35,994
Pin Ming, sit when told.

216
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:37,395
Yes, Sir.

217
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:47,770
President Sheng, why not take this opportunity to introduce your company?

218
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:56,013
I didn't know I came for a job interview.

219
00:15:57,116 --> 00:15:58,917
What are you saying, President Sheng?

220
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:03,589
X Holdings had an industry exchange conference.

221
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:08,026
Shengfang Biotech's absence was a real pity.

222
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:10,950
We've invited you today in hopes of using this chance

223
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:15,200
to build basic mutual understanding.

224
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,704
X Holdings is a global industry leader.

225
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:23,407
It's our honor that you wish to learn about Shengfang Biotech.

226
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:27,346
Pin Ming.

227
00:16:27,346 --> 00:16:28,913
Yes.

228
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:33,352
Hello, everyone. I'm Chen Pin Ming.

229
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:35,687
I'm the head of President Sheng's secretariat.

230
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:40,392
Please allow me to introduce Shengfang Biotech to everyone.

231
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:42,361
Founded over 20 years ago,

232
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:45,764
we specialize in biopharmaceutical research

233
00:16:45,764 --> 00:16:48,734
and are one of the companies that hold the most targeted drug patents

234
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:53,105
in Jianghu and nationwide.

235
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:56,076
Next, I'll detail our targeted drugs.

236
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:59,120
- Our targeted drugs' technology...
- Look at your Mr. Sheng,

237
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,314
acting diplomatic and charming on the surface,

238
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:05,784
but arrogantly treating everyone with contempt.

239
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:09,221
Would it kill him to make an introduction?

240
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:14,459
Wen Lang, it seems like it'll kill you if you don't badmouth my Alpha.

241
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:18,197
Your Alpha? Is he really yours?

242
00:17:18,197 --> 00:17:20,332
Is he really yours to claim?

243
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:24,900
Chang Yu said at the last banquet, an omega named Shu Xin

244
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,372
called herself Sheng Shao You's girlfriend.

245
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:29,440
Do you know about that?

246
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,445
Shengfang's patented active targeted drug delivery

247
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:37,983
based on blood circulation and penetration technology

248
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:39,151
is widely used in the industry.

249
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:41,220
Orchid scent? It's Hua Yong.

250
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,555
No, this pheromone is too dominant.

251
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:44,923
It isn't Hua Yong.

252
00:17:44,923 --> 00:17:47,458
It seems to be an S-class Alpha's.

253
00:17:48,894 --> 00:17:50,329
Seduction pheromones?

254
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:53,431
Targeted, too? Are you crazy?

255
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,433
Next, I'll introduce our core technology.

256
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:03,843
Shengfang Biotech has the exclusive worldwide patent for the fourth-generation CRISPR.

257
00:18:03,843 --> 00:18:06,921
It is three times more efficient than regular CRISPR* models.
(*Genetically modify DNA)

258
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:09,548
The MOP rate* is lower than 0.1.
(*Mismatched rate)

259
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,850
President Sheng, what's wrong?

260
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,552
You don't look well, President Sheng.

261
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,721
President Sheng.

262
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,491
President Sheng!

263
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,045
Secretary Chang, it's a misunderstanding.

264
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:42,915
President Sheng has been suffering from pheromone disorder recently.

265
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:45,650
Shut up! Hands on your head!

266
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:02,401
Secretary Chang, we meant no offense.

267
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:05,871
Besides, if there's a misunderstanding,

268
00:19:05,871 --> 00:19:10,242
X Holdings shouldn't be killing anyone in broad daylight.

269
00:19:10,242 --> 00:19:11,843
Quiet.

270
00:19:33,231 --> 00:19:34,765
Boss.

271
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,836
He fainted.

272
00:19:37,836 --> 00:19:38,837
Yes.

273
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:41,606
Sir, please believe that President Sheng didn't do it on purpose.

274
00:19:41,606 --> 00:19:43,508
- He—
- What if he did?

275
00:19:43,508 --> 00:19:45,343
And what if he didn't?

276
00:19:45,343 --> 00:19:46,911
But...

277
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:51,716
Are the room and doctor ready?

278
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:54,240
Yes, all arranged.

279
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,647
So pitiful.

280
00:20:23,915 --> 00:20:26,384
An S-class Alpha like you

281
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:30,688
would never have thought you'd go into a forced heat like an omega.

282
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:39,130
No wonder you unconsciously released suppressive pheromones in panic.

283
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,039
Since you look so handsome today,

284
00:20:49,508 --> 00:20:51,409
let me help you.

285
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:17,302
If I had known you'd go crazy, I wouldn't have come.

286
00:21:17,302 --> 00:21:21,072
Do you know how much Sheng Shao You's suppressive pheromones hurt me?

287
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:24,075
No, I don't feel any pain.

288
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:30,215
Using targeted seduction pheromones in public?

289
00:21:30,215 --> 00:21:34,397
Hua Yong, any S-class Alpha with an ounce of shame

290
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:37,756
wouldn't use such advanced abilities openly.

291
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:41,826
You already said it. "S-class Alphas."

292
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:43,994
What's that to me?

293
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:49,835
Hua Yong, have some decency.

294
00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:52,671
Inducing an S-class Alpha to have their heat in public...

295
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:56,708
If word gets out, you'll be dissected in a lab.

296
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,076
Stop overreacting.

297
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:02,340
Whether it's an omega or an alpha,

298
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,980
whomever I set my sights on will become mine.

299
00:22:12,324 --> 00:22:18,597
To make that proud S-class Alpha my exclusive omega,

300
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:20,866
I need to put in the effort.

301
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:23,068
Mr. Sheng is so precious.

302
00:22:23,068 --> 00:22:26,504
He has more admirers than ants.

303
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:29,908
Without some tricks, I'd never get close to him.

304
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:33,043
How precious? Is he embedded with diamonds?

305
00:22:33,878 --> 00:22:38,648
Wen Lang, envy gets you nowhere. You should learn from me.

306
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:50,127
Let's stop here. Mr. Sheng is waking up. I'm leaving now.

307
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,510
[X Hotel]

308
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:15,986
President Sheng, how do you feel?

309
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:32,203
Where am I?

310
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,506
This is a suite at X Hotel.

311
00:23:34,506 --> 00:23:37,075
You suddenly suffered from pheromone disorder,

312
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:40,145
released suppressive pheromones, then fainted.

313
00:23:40,145 --> 00:23:44,616
The man from X Holdings arranged this room for you to rest and called a doctor.

314
00:23:44,616 --> 00:23:46,918
The doctor wanted to inject an inhibitor,

315
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:49,788
but I refused out of concern.

316
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:51,156
Got it.

317
00:23:51,156 --> 00:23:54,258
Did you see that person's face?

318
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:56,795
They had guns.

319
00:23:56,795 --> 00:24:01,198
Before that man appeared, bodyguards blindfolded me.

320
00:24:03,034 --> 00:24:05,904
Despicable tactics.

321
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,671
Someone's coming.

322
00:24:18,516 --> 00:24:21,052
Secretary Chen, don't be anxious.

323
00:24:21,052 --> 00:24:23,955
Earlier, because my boss was present

324
00:24:23,955 --> 00:24:27,125
and President Sheng released suppressive pheromones suddenly,

325
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,160
we had to take precautions.

326
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:34,165
Secretary Chang, please thank your boss for the room and the doctor.

327
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:36,034
You're welcome.

328
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:42,150
I'm here to say my boss won't pursue your mistake.

329
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,576
You can leave anytime.

330
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:52,517
President Sheng, rest well.

331
00:24:52,517 --> 00:24:55,552
We'll see each other soon.

332
00:25:13,872 --> 00:25:17,574
You're back late today. Did everything go well?

333
00:25:28,553 --> 00:25:30,254
What's wrong?

334
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:33,624
I ran into a lunatic.

335
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:44,869
Did you eat dinner yet?

336
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:47,671
Yes. What about you?

337
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,875
I went straight to the office after it ended.

338
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:53,111
Didn't have time to eat.

339
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:54,946
Why don't I make you some noodles?

340
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:57,816
Or do you want the mung bean soup I made this afternoon?

341
00:25:57,816 --> 00:26:00,150
Do you want it hot or cold?

342
00:26:01,052 --> 00:26:02,387
Either's fine.

343
00:26:02,387 --> 00:26:03,555
Okay.

344
00:26:03,555 --> 00:26:05,790
I also made a double-boiled conch with cordyceps flowers.

345
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,393
I can use it as broth for the noodles.

346
00:26:08,393 --> 00:26:11,161
Or would you rather have rice?

347
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:15,967
You even know how to make soup?

348
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:19,204
- Yes.
- Our Hua Yong is good at everything.

349
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:20,772
I'm not that good.

350
00:26:20,772 --> 00:26:24,007
I dozed off this afternoon and let the first pot boil dry.

351
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:27,010
This is a fresh batch.

352
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,547
Go sit on the couch.

353
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:32,282
I'll heat the broth and make noodles. It won't take long.

354
00:26:55,707 --> 00:26:57,942
Do you want to eat with me?

355
00:26:57,942 --> 00:27:01,379
Okay, I'll have some mung bean soup first.

356
00:27:01,379 --> 00:27:03,114
If you want some later, I'll get more for you.

357
00:27:03,114 --> 00:27:04,515
Okay.

358
00:27:18,563 --> 00:27:21,232
Did your afternoon schedule not go well?

359
00:27:21,232 --> 00:27:23,635
Yes. I met a lunatic.

360
00:27:23,635 --> 00:27:27,906
I offended him slightly, and he issued a statement immediately,

361
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:31,342
saying he won't cooperate with Shengfang Biotech in the short term.

362
00:27:31,342 --> 00:27:34,379
Now, everyone in the industry is asking about it.

363
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:38,550
The PR team is still working overtime.

364
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,585
How could this happen?

365
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,454
Cowardly bastard.

366
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,756
Better not let me find out what he looks like.

367
00:27:46,991 --> 00:27:49,327
You don't know who he is?

368
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:50,962
Yes.

369
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:53,230
Few have seen him.

370
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:58,068
I wonder what he looks like.

371
00:28:00,438 --> 00:28:02,140
A person's face reflects the heart.

372
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,343
With such a filthy heart, he can't be good-looking.

373
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:08,313
Yes, you're right.

374
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,614
So what now? Will it have a big impact?

375
00:28:10,614 --> 00:28:12,217
No.

376
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:13,559
Before the market closed,

377
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,956
someone spread rumors Shengfang has cash flow issues and is facing a financial crisis.

378
00:28:17,956 --> 00:28:21,860
It indeed caused stock fluctuations at first,

379
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,395
but the PR department has publicly denied it.

380
00:28:24,395 --> 00:28:26,030
It's not a huge problem.

381
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,499
Okay. That's good.

382
00:28:57,996 --> 00:29:00,631
President Sheng, it's me.

383
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:03,234
What is it?

384
00:29:03,234 --> 00:29:05,904
Secretary Gao from HS called

385
00:29:05,904 --> 00:29:11,708
saying President Shen wants to talk with you urgently.

386
00:29:13,978 --> 00:29:16,714
I've got nothing to say to a bastard.

387
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:19,550
I'm very busy, don't bother me with things like this again.

388
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,754
But...

389
00:29:20,754 --> 00:29:25,389
Shen Wen Lang said he wants to talk to you about the targeted drug patent.

390
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:30,495
That's all they have of value.

391
00:29:30,495 --> 00:29:33,164
There's nothing to discuss.

392
00:29:33,164 --> 00:29:35,233
I don't believe

393
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:40,939
X Holdings can develop drugs that Shengfang can't.

394
00:29:40,939 --> 00:29:46,010
But Secretary Gao said if you agree to President Shen's terms,

395
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:49,814
HS is willing to do an equity swap

396
00:29:49,814 --> 00:29:53,115
and merge the companies. And in the future...

397
00:30:02,193 --> 00:30:03,828
Mr. Sheng.

398
00:30:03,828 --> 00:30:05,663
It's a boring proposal.

399
00:30:05,663 --> 00:30:07,464
Ignore them.

400
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:31,456
The terms are very favorable.

401
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:34,024

Yes.

Listen, it's better to bury the hatchet.

422

We're in the same circle

Yu Shan, you don't need to go through the trouble.

00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:35,413
We'll never get along.

Seeing him ruins my appetite.

429

I just want to kill him.

430
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:44,188
Truth is, if murder weren't illegal,

431
00:32:44,188 --> 00:32:47,024
he'd have eaten his last meal months ago.

432
00:32:47,024 --> 00:32:51,229

Wen Lang called me multiple times last night asking me to mediate.

00:39:22,853 --> 00:39:27,658
His tumor originally remained in place and had no signs of spreading.

538
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:31,662
but now, it has signs of infiltrating surrounding tissues.

539
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:36,863
If there is still no targeted drug once the tumor spreads, it will reach the mid to final stages.

540
00:39:36,863 --> 00:39:42,970
Even with a drug then, it may be too late.

541
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,308
I understand.

542
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:46,076
A pharmaceutical friend said this.

543
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:50,910
X Holdings' targeted drug has completed formulation with excellent results.

544
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:54,450
If we can contact the person in charge to get the drug early,

545
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:58,355
it would help the chairman significantly.

546
00:40:11,435 --> 00:40:13,871
I went grocery shopping for dinner.

547
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:16,073
If there's something you want to eat,

548
00:40:16,073 --> 00:40:18,475
text me when you see this note.

549
00:40:18,475 --> 00:40:21,644
I'll pick it up on the way. Hua Yong.

550
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:32,356
Hello, Mr. Sheng.

551
00:40:32,356 --> 00:40:33,724
Are you done?

552
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:36,192
Yes. I just got home.

553
00:40:37,594 --> 00:40:39,697
I've bought the groceries and will be back soon.

554
00:40:39,697 --> 00:40:42,800
Anything specific you wanted to eat? I'll get it for you.

555
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,368
No.

556
00:40:44,368 --> 00:40:47,071
Should I send a driver to pick you up?

557
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:50,139
No, the subway is convenient.

558
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:57,581
Why leave a note instead of messaging directly?

559
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:01,149
I wasn't sure if you were busy and didn't want to disturb you.

560
00:41:01,819 --> 00:41:03,754
Mr. Sheng, it's my turn to pay.

561
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:06,222
I'll hang up. See you soon.

562
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:08,259
Okay.

563
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:10,059
See you soon.

564
00:41:21,572 --> 00:41:26,273
If there is still no targeted drug once the tumor spreads, it will reach the mid to final stages.

565
00:41:26,273 --> 00:41:31,848
Even with a drug then, it may be too late.

566
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:53,834
[Chang Yu]

567
00:41:54,938 --> 00:41:59,274
Mr. Sheng, I just finished shopping and will be back soon.

568
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,317
Mr. Sheng, I'm on the subway and will be home shortly.

569
00:42:17,761 --> 00:42:21,031
Boss, President Sheng just called me.

570
00:42:21,031 --> 00:42:23,133
Should we call back immediately?

571
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:24,468
No.

572
00:42:24,468 --> 00:42:27,538
He's probably asking about the targeted drug.

573
00:42:27,538 --> 00:42:29,373
Call back in two hours.

574
00:42:29,373 --> 00:42:30,840
Understood.

575
00:42:33,444 --> 00:42:36,647
The drug formulation has just finished.

576
00:42:36,647 --> 00:42:38,115
The maximum dosage test for human application

577
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:42,453
can start earliest on the day after tomorrow.

578
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:43,853
Got it.

579
00:42:44,955 --> 00:42:47,691
I've already reminded Wen Lang.

580
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:51,395
Tell Mr. Sheng that the drug's person in charge will contact him.

581
00:42:51,395 --> 00:42:52,829
Yes.

582
00:42:54,164 --> 00:42:57,468
Boss, you oversaw this personally.

583
00:42:57,468 --> 00:43:00,904
The research teams worldwide rushed the progress

584
00:43:00,904 --> 00:43:04,441
to expedite it for President Sheng's father.

585
00:43:04,441 --> 00:43:10,114
Wouldn't it be a pity if he didn't know your intentions?

586
00:43:10,114 --> 00:43:12,482
It doesn't matter if he knows.

587
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:18,621
I never wanted his gratitude, so there's nothing worth pitying.

588
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,420
Here.

589
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:50,120
I forgot my book in the bedroom.

590
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,854
I'm going to get it.

591
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:06,133
[Chang Yu]

592
00:44:21,385 --> 00:44:23,355
Hello, Secretary Chang.

593
00:44:23,355 --> 00:44:25,022
President Sheng.

594
00:44:25,022 --> 00:44:27,324
Why the sudden call?

595
00:44:27,324 --> 00:44:30,727
I would like to get your advice on something.

596
00:44:30,727 --> 00:44:33,029
Is it convenient to talk now?

597
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:37,199
Yes, go ahead.

598
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,505
I heard X Holdings' targeted pheromone gland cancer drug

599
00:44:41,505 --> 00:44:43,574
has completed formulation.

600
00:44:43,574 --> 00:44:45,509
News travels fast.

601
00:44:45,509 --> 00:44:46,910
Yes.

602
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:49,913
Our drug is indeed near clinical trials.

603
00:44:49,913 --> 00:44:53,115
Why are you suddenly asking about that?

604
00:44:55,953 --> 00:45:01,087
To be frank, my father needs this drug.

605
00:45:01,992 --> 00:45:05,796
You mean Shengfang's chairman?

606
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:07,220
Yes.

607
00:45:07,931 --> 00:45:11,133
He's been on medical leave for some time now.

608
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:13,170
It's pheromone gland cancer.

609
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:18,008
Secretary Chang, I know your formula is still confidential.

610
00:45:18,008 --> 00:45:22,479
But I'm not calling as a biopharm CEO today.

611
00:45:22,479 --> 00:45:27,149
I'm calling as a son begging for help for my father.

612
00:45:31,788 --> 00:45:33,856
Please help me.
