Mu Liu,

3
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,070
you can't get away from me.

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,750
Who?

5
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,560
(Hello, your takeout.)

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,070
Wrong place.

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,430
(No, it's Room 5188.)

8
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:48,920
Who?

9
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,510
You pervert!

10
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,350
What?

11
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,920
Just after being drunk and acting crazy,

12
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,310
you were trying to kill me?

13
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,350
Look,

14
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,200
that's what you did.

15
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:05,760
What?

16
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,480
No.

17
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
So my clothes were...

18
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,280
Stop.

19
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,240
A waitress did it.

20
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,680
New clothes are coming.

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,870
Oh.

22
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,840
Thank you.

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,310
Next time,

24
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,030
don't flaunt your superiority.

25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,470
OK.

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,120
Got it.

27
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,000
Now you believe me?

28
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:39,910
Yes.

29
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,750
Then can you

30
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,430
accompany me back to the birthday party?

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,190
(Flora Island)
(I put a recorder pen in my bag.)

32
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,470
(Now we need
to get this pen back quickly.)

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,750
Then how can you get it back?

34
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,800
What are you trying to do?

35
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,470
Aunt.

36
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,520
Liu,

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,190
weren't you with Song Yuan?

38
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,520
I asked him
to prepare the agreement documents.

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,190
Well then,

40
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,240
let's celebrate in advance.

41
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,840
Hello, Ms. Mu.

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,800
I've been looking for you.

43

46
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,120
Ms. Mu,

47
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,800
happy birthday.

48
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,470
Oh,

49
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,710
it's a great honor.

50
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,710
You're really the star here, Ms. Mu.

51
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,680
You are the most gorgeous tonight.

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,470
With you here, Mr. Mo,

53
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,360
I'm totally overshadowed.

54
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:40,960
Ms. Mu,

55
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,870
excuse me,

56
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,470
I need to go to the restroom.

57
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,080
Well,

58
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,870
let me take you there.

59
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,430
I was surprised,

60
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:52,960
Mr. Mo.

61
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,910
What a nice trick with your beauty.

62
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,400
Never again.

63
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,080
You are mean!

64
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,470
Come on.

65
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,870
Yuan,

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,150
I find that Mu Liu

67
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,280
(is like a different person now.)

68
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,240
(What did she say about the shares?)

69
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,120
(Forget it.)

70
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,030
She just gave me a bag.

71
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,360
No matter how she changes,

72
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,240
she can't get away from me.

73
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,920
(Do whatever it takes)

74
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,040
(to get the shares.)

75
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
(Don't worry, baby.)

76
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,630
Just wait and see how I get her tonight.

77
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,510
I'll kick her out of the way

78
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,240
(when she gives all her shares to us.)

79
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,950
What a terrible couple!

80
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,510
Wait!

81
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,560
Don't be impulsive!

82
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,040
Let's go back and discuss it.

83
