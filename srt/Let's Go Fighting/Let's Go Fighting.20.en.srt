00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,350
Chen,

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,000
you finally came.

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,870
Should I call you Mo Feng

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,640
or Mr. D?

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,920
As you please.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,640
What tricks do you want to play now?

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,750
Nothing.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,600
I just prepared a gift

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,710
for you and Mu Li.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,750
Why are you so far away?

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,110
I'm afraid

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,750
that there are bombs inside.

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,390
I warn you

15
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,240
not to touch Mu Li.

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,350
I have nothing else

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,280
to say to you.

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,320
Mu Li

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,390
will definitely like this gift.

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,110
Since you're not interested,

21
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,240
just forget it.

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,400
Bombs?

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,350
You're exaggerating.

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,760
Wait.

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,070
You thought there were bombs

26
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,120
and asked me to open it?

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:13,950
But,

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,070
you're okay, right?

29
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,950
This is
MOHS successors competition agreement.

30
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,920
(MOHS Successors Competition Agreement)
(The one who finally acquires Mu)

31
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,200
(will become the new president of MOHS.)

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,120
Let's talk,

33
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,680
shall we?

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,680
How do you think

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,430
Miss Mu will feel when she knows

36
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,790
our competition agreement?

37
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,200
Mo Chen.

38
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,310
Why are you here?

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,590
There is a document

40
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,680
I want to ask you about.

41
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,950
Mo Feng gave it to you?

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,590
Yes.

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,590
I know he's trying to sow discord.

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,870
That's good.

45
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,120
So?

46
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,590
So it's been a lie

47
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,870
from the beginning?

48
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,590
You want to acquire the Mu Group

49
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,630
just to obtain

50
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,030
the qualification of inheriting MOHS.

51
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,560
That's why you signed

52
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,520
an agreement with my father.

53
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,080
So what about cooperating with me now?

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Is that the same?

55
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,000
Li,

56
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,630
it's not what you think.

57
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,560
Then what?

58
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,360
In the beginning,
I tried to acquire the Mu Group

59
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,190
to win the competition indeed.

60
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:26,800
The MOHS Group

61
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,710
was originally founded by my mother.

62
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,360
But the one who betrayed her

63
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,280
was the one she trusted.

64
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,470
My father

65
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,360
kicked my mother and me out

66
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,280
to take over the company.

67
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,840
When my mother died,

68
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,840
I just wanted to take back her company.

69
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,590
So, to take back

70
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,750
your mother's company,

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,470
you didn't hesitate to use

72
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,150
my father and sister.

73
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,080
Now you're even using me

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,190
for your purpose.

75
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,870
It was true before,

76
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,470
but later,

77
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,120
it changed.

78
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,400
Changed?

79
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,470
What changed?

80
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,430
You fell in love with me,

81
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,120
so your purpose has changed?

82
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,360
You don't want MOHS anymore?

83
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,840
Your purpose

84
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,710
hasn't changed from beginning to end.

85
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,120
You just want to acquire the Mu Group.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,120
I will ask Mr. Luo

87
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,630
to talk to you
about the shares you want.

88
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,240
That's it.

Yes.

94

Let Lu Xingjie take it away.

95
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,680
Do you really want to move?

96
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,910
I think

97
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,590
it's better to...

clean the room?

Go.
