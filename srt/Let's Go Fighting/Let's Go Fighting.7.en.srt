(Recording)

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,430
I've got to go, bye.

4
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,110
Bye.

5
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,880
Aunt.

6
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,960
Liu,

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,150
where's your mask?

8
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,000
Well,

9
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,640
there wasn't enough time,

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,000
so I didn't find one.

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,880
Where did you buy this bag?

12
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:55,600
Aunt,

13
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,840
if you like this bag,

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,670
I can give it to you.

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,430
Just take it

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,110
as a gift from me

17
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,070
for your birthday.

18
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,640
Besides this bag,

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,560
there should be something else, right?

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,120
What about the shares
that we talked about before?

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,120
Aunt,

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,150
what's your purpose

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,590
in taking my shares?

24
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,590
Why are you talking like this?

25
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,870
Don't you believe me?

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,790
What's wrong, Ms. Mu?

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,640
You are not happy

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,510
with my fiancee's decision?

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,000
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Mo.

30
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,230
This is the Mus' family affair,

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,870
so you don't need to intervene.

32
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,710
You'd better take care of yourself.

33
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,400
You!

34
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,230
Aunt,

35
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,680
excuse us, we're going over there.

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,760
Let's go.

37
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,040
Don't think

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,710
that if you spoke up for me,

39
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,950
I will forgive you.

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,840
If I didn't come,

41
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,790
who would help you out?

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,510
Mr. Mo, you didn't need

43
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,920
to come over here

44
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,000
and help me out.

45
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,430
Or

46
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,790
did you come to the dance

47
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,680
for another dirty secret?

48
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,760
No good deed goes unpunished.

49
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,280
Go in by yourself.

50
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,430
I'll walk around and leave.

51
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,200
Hem.

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,280
Goodbye!

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,400
Let's go.

54
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,200
Mr. Luo.

55
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,800
Mr. Mo,

56
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,750
I heard

57
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,310
that Miss Mu wanted
to break off the engagement.

58
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,280
When other shareholders heard the news,

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,470
they were ready
to give up working with you.

60
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,080
Mr. Luo,

61
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,680
I have a good relationship with her.

62
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,560
Don't worry.

63
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,470
OK.

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,310
(He didn't come for me.)

65
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,360
Liu,

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,470
I'm so happy

67
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,870
to see you back safely.

68
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,630
Who are you?

69
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,310
I'm Song Yuan.

70
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,630
You have changed

71
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
and become more beautiful.

72
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,430
Mr. Luo.

73
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,400
Excuse me.

74
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,750
(So he is Song Yuan.)

75
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,000
What?

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,960
It's been a long time,

77
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,750
so you forgot about me?

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,800
Return my money!

79
00:02:59,520 --> 00:02:59,960
What money?

80
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,800
Two million RMB and return it quickly!

81
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,030
We have

82
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,150
donated the money as you said,

83
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,000
haven't we?

84
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,000
You forgot?

85
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,960
I...

86
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,520
Ah,

87
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,310
I had an accident

88
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,150
and hit my head.

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,000
I can't remember many things clearly.

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,840
Tell me more about it.

91
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:18,870
Come on.

92
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,840
Let's

93
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,560
drink

94
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,190
and recall it.

95
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,560
Why are you

96
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
still hanging with such a man?

97
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,630
Whoever I hang with,

98
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,630
it has nothing to do with you, OK?

99
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,120
Why don't you tell me

100
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,680
what were you sneaking around for?

101
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,840
Anyway, I'm not going

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,150
to hang with such a deadbeat.

103
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,400
It is hard to change one's nature.

104
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
Then please, Mr. Mo,

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,030
leave quickly.

106
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,080
Don't let me get in your way.

107
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,190
I thought you changed

108
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,190
when you came back this time.

109
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:55,870
Let's go.

110
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,430
It is hard to change one's nature?

111
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,840
Come on!

112
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:08,710
Cheers!

113
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:09,960
Cheers.

114

Liu,

115
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,310
you know what,

116
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,310
Xia Xingrun

117
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,720
has cast his covetous eyes

118
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,040
on the position of president

119
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,800
since Mr. Mu is not in the company.

120
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,800
Mu Liu,

121
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,070
you must help your aunt.

122
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,190
Xia Xingrun

123
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,070
is trying to win popular support.

124
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,160
The Mu Group

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
is going to be Xia's.

126
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,560
Only if you give your shares

127
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,160
to your aunt

128
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,160
can she defeat Xia Xingrun.

129
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,480
I won't do it!

130
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,240
Are you alright?

131
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,160
Huh?
