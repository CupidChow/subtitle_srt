00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,830
Mo Chen

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,280
will take my place

4
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,550
in this M&A project.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,230
I disagree!

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,800
Feng,

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,120
as a shareholder,

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,280
you have no right
to decide on personnel.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,070
That's ridiculous.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,550
Mo Chen is our competitor.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,510
How can you let him

12
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,560
participate in the Mu's management?

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,750
Do you want to hand over

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,640
(Mu Group)
the Mu Group to him?

15
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,240
Hand over?

16
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,070
If some insatiable person

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,240
had not transferred

18
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,560
the shares to him,

19
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,320
would he be sitting here today?

20
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,710
It seems that

21
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,670
you two have made up again.

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
Congratulations, Chen.

23
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,520
Miss Mu,

24
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,430
the operation of the company
is not a game.

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,070
What Mo Chen did before

26
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,030
really made us unable to believe him.

27
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:57,920
Dear all,

28
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,560
according to the Articles of Association
of the Mu Group,

29
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,670
the management right
of the Mu Group belongs to me

30
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,750
and you have no right to interfere.

31
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,040
It is my decision.

32
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,590
Mo Chen

33
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,640
will participate in

34
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,790
this M&A as my fiance.

35
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,150
Then I hope you

36
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,950
can give us a feasible plan.

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:24,790
Li,

38
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:25,560
I'm not worth it.

39
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,070
I am not only for you

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
but also for myself.

41
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,840
Get ready.

42
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,680
If you are free tomorrow,

43
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,710
we go to the park together

44
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,640
to collect the data

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,760
so as to improve the information.

46
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,560
I'm very disappointed in you.

47
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,200
Shouldn't you know

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,510
Mo Chen's whereabouts best?

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,280
Why did he join hands with Mu Li

50
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,590
and I didn't know about it?

51
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,430
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,230
You're an adult.

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,680
Next time,

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,000
if you don't report
Mo Chen's whereabouts

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,070
to me the first time,

56
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,400
your mother

57
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,000
in the ward

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,950
will not be able to continue treatment.

59
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,520
I will keep you informed

60
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,150
of his movements.

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,680
Get out.

62
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,000
I won't let you

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,680
make it!

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,680
Aren't you pushing yourself

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,840
into the fire?

66
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,560
Mo Feng is already...

67
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,870
They're coming out.

68
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,430
I need you to act with me

69
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,190
to make them believe
that we are in a relationship.

70
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,030
So, Mo Feng can't do anything to us.

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,150
How?

72
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,150
Isn't that Miss Mu?

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,150
Young people nowadays

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,710
are so bold.

75
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,800
So bold.

76
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,470
Let's go.

77
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,980
(Mu Li and Mo Chen
seemed to be pretending to be intimate.)

78
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,560
I really want to see

79
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,120
how far you two

80
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,000
fake lovers can go.

81
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,220
(Country House)

82
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,240
This is the last building
in the industrial park.

83
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,240
It is finally over.

84
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,240
Stay here one night and

85
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,080
go back tomorrow morning.

86
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,120
Ah.

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,030
Let's go.

88
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,280
Hello,

89
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,120
please arrange...

90
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,840
Two rooms for us.

91
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,680
Not enough rooms.

92
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,400
We received a group order today

93
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,310
and there is only one room left.

94
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:56,910
OK?

95
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,470
Many young lovers

96
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,840
come to live here.

97
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,360
(Have all the rooms)

98
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,000
(been reserved?)

99
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,750
There is only a king room left.

100
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,630
Let's see

101
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,310
what they do next.

102
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,960
Is this all arranged by you?

103
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,240
How did I know

104
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,120
there were so many people here today?

105
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,040
Or,

106
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
let's ask in other country houses.

107
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,000
Have you thought it over?

108
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:20,830
Ah...

109
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,480
We'll take it.

110
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,160
OK.

111
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,240
It was not my intention.

112
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,310
Mo Feng is out there.

113
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,390
Here you are.

114
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,950
Second floor.

115
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,390
OK.

116
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,680
