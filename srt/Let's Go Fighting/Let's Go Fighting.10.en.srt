Why did you prepare dinner for me?

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,600
I know you

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,120
like these dishes.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,550
I will cook for you every day.

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,350
OK?

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,550
What do you want?

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,280
I wanna marry you.

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,350
Eh?

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,200
What are you doing?

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,470
You said you wanna marry me
in the morning.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,200
Why do you regret it now?

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,750
Mo Chen,

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,150
I heard what you said
in the study that day.

15
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,520
I know why you pretend to be lame.

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,240
I know why you broke up with me.

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,920
I know everything.

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,710
You know everything?

19
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes.

20
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,350
But it's OK,

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,320
I don't mind.

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,710
You don't mind?

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,640
Yes.

24
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,960
Love knows no gender.

25
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,560
You must have had a hard time.

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,000
What are you thinking about

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,000
every day?

28
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,510
Ah?

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,790

gay?

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,280
So you and Xu Weilai...

Go.

(Party A: Mu Qingyun Party B: Mo Chen)

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,590
So,

36
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,920
you want to marry me

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,640
because of this shareholding agreement?

38
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,950
Mr. Mu wants me to help you.

39
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,710
So,

40
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,120
he gave me the appropriate shares.

41
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,760
I never thought

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,120
marriage was a deal.

43
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,680
Ah!

44
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,310
What are you doing?

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,870
I don't want
to keep it from you anymore

46
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,000
or do anything

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,070
that makes you misunderstand
due to this agreement.

48
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,310
I've figured it out.

49
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,310
My father must have cooperated with you

50
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,760
to defend the Mu Group.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,950
What do you think, Mr. Mo?

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,040
Do you dare

53
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,150
to cooperate with the new director

54
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,790

Don't worry.

your bad behavior in recent years?

122
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,070
You were ostensibly marrying Mo Chen

123
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,190
but secretly allied with Mr. Song,

124

damaging our company's reputation.

125

You also used Mr. Song

Eh?

127

It's none of my business.

128

It was Mu Liu who made me do that.

Luckily, he knew he was wrong

130

Ms. Mu,

your performance is really wonderful.

it's my turn.

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,720
Please look at the files in your hands.

140
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,070
You use my signature

141
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,120
to transfer the group's funds

142
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,750
to a private account through Song Yuan.

143
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,190
You also want to cheat me

144
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,430
and let me transfer the rest of

145
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,510
the Mu Group's shares to you.

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,240
And your shares in the Mu Group

147
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,040
have been almost sold by you.

148
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,720
You are really anxious to
betray the Mu Group.

149
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,070
Security,

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,070
take her out

151

to the relevant authorities.

152
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,560
I'll go by myself.

153
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,120
Then our succession meeting

154
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,630
