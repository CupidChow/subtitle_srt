2
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,120
Looks like they have made a move

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,280
on the Mu Group ahead of us.

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,160
I also got their address.

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,280
They're in Huamao Building.

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,150
(Why doesn't she sleep?)

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,000
(I have to find a way
to get rid of her.)

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,670
(He must want
to sneak to Huamao Building.)

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,320
(I can't sit still.)

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,750
(I must take the initiative.)

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,430
You are still awake this late?

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,470
Eh.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,520
Yes.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,750
I've been having insomnia

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,030
and nightmares recently.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,880
Really? You have nightmares?

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,640
Because dreams without you

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,430
are all nightmares.

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,790
If you don't sleep,

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,960
I can't sleep either.

21
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,150
In fact,

22
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,200
I haven't slept well recently either.

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,230
Why?

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,040
I miss you so much

25
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,070
that I can't sleep.

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,840
Today,

27
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,120
thanks for helping me stop Mo Feng.

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,680
I misunderstood you before.

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,760
That was because you didn't love me

30
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,150
and didn't know me.

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,230
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,480
What are you doing?

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,280
Didn't you say I didn't love you?

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,430
Give me a chance

35
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,430
to prove my love for you.

36
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,070
What?

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,590
Let me down!

38
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,280
I suddenly feel sleepy.

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,790
I'll go to bed first.

40
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,150
Good night.

41
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,430
Where are you going dressed like this?

42
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,430
I can't sleep.

43
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,790
I want to have a night run and sweat.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,430
How about you?

45
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:05,870
What a coincidence!

46
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,070
I can't sleep either.

47
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,590
I want to have a night fishing.

48
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,630
Well,

49
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,190
wish you

50
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,960
catch a big fish.

51
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,750
I gotta go.

52
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,310
Eh.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,560
You!

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,190
Don't you have a night run?

55
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,470
Don't you have a night fishing?

56
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,080
What are you doing here?

57
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,240
I should ask you that.

58
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,190
To be honest,

59
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,030
besides pretending to be lame,

60
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,910
do you have anything else
to hide from me?

61
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,840
I hide from you?

62
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,870
You hide from me, ok?

63
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,000
What did I hide

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,520
from you?

65
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,430
What are you doing?

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,280
(Get out!)

67
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,870
Why should I avoid him?

68
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,520
I can't let people know

69
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,680
I'm not lame.

70

71

Oh,

72
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:49,800
I have a way.

73
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,030
Now,

74
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,870
you go there and hide.

75
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,870
I'll distract him with my long legs.

76
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,870
OK, my bro,

77

I'll go first.

79

Take care of yourself.

80
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,240
Go!
