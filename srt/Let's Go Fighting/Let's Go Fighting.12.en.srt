00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,020
=Let's Go Fighting=
=Episode 12=

2
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,510
You are also quite handsome

3
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,870
when you're quiet.

4
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,710
Are you crazy?

5
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:14,870
Get up!

6
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,430
What did you do last night?

7
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,710
What‘s wrong?

8
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,070
Don't you know?

9
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,710
You sleepwalked yesterday.

10
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,510
Don't you remember?

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,510
I was drunk and sleepwalking, right?

12
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,840
Then

13
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,950
I'll sleepwalk again.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,510
No.

15
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,480
Go away!

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,480
Boss,

17
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,790
I have found

18
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,950
all the travel information for Miss Mu

19
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,840
that you asked me to check.

20
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,840
Miss Mu

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,560
studied in Italy before.

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,150
And she goes to Italy

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,590
every winter and summer.

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,230
Go ahead.

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
So I guess

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,840
Miss Mu and Mr. Lu met

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,040
when they were

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,200
studying abroad.

29
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,310
No, boss,

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,150
according to time,

31
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,920
you are the third party.

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,350
Do you want
to go to the project in Africa?

33
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,070
No!

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,870
So,

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,190
will Mu Liu

36
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,400
fall in love with Lu Xingjie?

37
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,360
You are jealous?

38
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,910
I'm jealous?

39
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,030
Am I?

40
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,080
Now you need to make sure

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,800
whether Miss Mu

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
fancies you or not.

43
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,400
How?

44
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,240
You asked her to go

45
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,960
to a couple's restaurant after work.

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,910
If she doesn't fancy you,

47
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,960
she will definitely refuse you.

48
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,470
Lu!

49
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,870
Leave work so early?

50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,120
Miss Mu and I are going to have dinner.

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:42,870
What a coincidence!

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,800
I

53
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,150
am here to pick up

54
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,360
my fiancee for dinner.

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,750
If you have nothing to do,

56
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,430
just go.

57
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,430
What are you doing, Mo Chen?

58
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,470
So weird.

59
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,310
Let's go, Lu.

60
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,240
Let's go for dinner.

61
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,940
(Pu)

62
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,360
I saw you

63
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
order these when I was having dinner

64
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,150
with you before.

65
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,240
OK.

66
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,030
(How can I talk to him?)

67
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,360
Don't worry.

68
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,590
With me in the future,

69
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,910
no one could bully you in the Mu Group.

70
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,280
Excuse me, sir.

71
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,840
Today,
our restaurant have a themed activity.

72
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,360
Only lovers can go in for dinner

73
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,840
or you can only go
to the general dining area.

74
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,280
Oh, no, my girlfriend just went in.

75
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,000
That was her.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,710
Nor will that work.

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,910
Please come inside.

78
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:40,960
What?

79
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,910
Does it work?

80
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,470
Eh.

81
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,520
Yes.

82
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,030
This

83
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,240
is my girlfriend.

84
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,800
OK.

85
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,080
He, looking very handsome

86
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,400
is an otaku.

87
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,310
Lu,

88
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,190
do you remember Tang Xue

89
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,000
I mentioned to you?

90
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,080
Yes.

91
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,000
She is your

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,430
best friend, right?

93
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:58,800
Yes.

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,470
You were inseparable

95
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,470
when you were abroad.

96
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,960
It is because of this

97
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,310
that a beautiful misunderstanding

98
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,120
has been created.

99
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,520
Wow, Lu!

100
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,080
What a coincidence.

101
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,560
Mo Chen,

102
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,870
what are you doing here?

103
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,560
Why can't I come?

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,800
You don't own the restaurant.

105
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,070
Can't I have a date?

106
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,680
Where is your girlfriend?

107
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,120
Here she is.

108
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,190
When did your screensaver

109
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,510
become so cute?

110
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,600
None of your business.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,430
Look at your phone.

112
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,510
It's been ringing for a long time.

113
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:33,720
Hello?

114
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,560
OK.

115
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,430
Got it.

116
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,800
I'll be back later.

117
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,040
Men should put careers first.

118
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:40,950
Just go.

119
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,240
Xiaoliu,

120
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,600
I'll be back in a minute.

121
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,720
Are

122
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,240
you

123
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,600
jealous?

124
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,630
Me?

125
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
No way.

126
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,070
Then why do you come here?

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,870
Can't I just pass by?

128
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,600
Pass by?

129
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,390
Really?

130
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,830
(The couples' activity starts now.)

131
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,750
(Please go to the stage area.)

132
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,920
(Just eat.)

133
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,020
(There are wine and stories.)

134
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,160
Can you join the couple activities
in our store?

135
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,560
As long as you take intimate photos,

136
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,360
you can get

137
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,950
this Polaroid for couples.

138
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,870
Oh, no.

139
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,430
Thank you.

140
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,160
Eh?

141
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,430
How to take photos?

142
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,120
This way, please.

143
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,600
Look at the camera.

144
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,630
The boy can hold the girl.

145
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,040
Oh, you're so rude.

146
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,240
It's a face-to-face hug.

147
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,310
Be closer.

148
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,680
Don't be shy.

149
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,830
Yes,

150
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,270
Closer.
