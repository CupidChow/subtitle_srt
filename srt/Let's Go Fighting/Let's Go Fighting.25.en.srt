76
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,560
Why are talking like that?

77
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,960
Mo Chen.

78
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,800
Didn't you two

79
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,360
go out of town the other day alone?

80
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,870
Why are you like this again?

81
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,800
Right.

82

Didn't you two

83
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,280
have anything special then?

84
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,750
If you two have nothing to do,

85
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,560
just go.

86
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,430
Then I'm leaving.

87
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,590
I wanted to help you.

88
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,710
Hey, wait.

89
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,470

92

What?

94
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,630
A wounded dog.

95
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,190
You'd better shut up.

96
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,510
I mean,

97
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,750
Mo Chen can get sympathy

98
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,190
when he is like this.

99
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,800
Sympathy?

100
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,070
Got it!

101
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,750
You can pretend to be ill!

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,720
Forget it.

103
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,680
Do you want to stay with Li?

104
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,800
There is nothing wrong between you.

105
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,680
You just need someone

106
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,160
to push it behind the scenes.
