I know it now.

00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,150
The one who has been taking care of me

4
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:36,880
is you.

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,150
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,560
You're always like this.

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,320
I won't take care of you next time.

8
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,240
(Mr. D: I wonder if you can come over
for the matter about the Mu Group.)

9
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,640
Boss,

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,430
congratulations!

11
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,920
You finally got Miss Mu.

12
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,150
What's wrong, boss?

13
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,520
Mr. D has asked me to meet tonight.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,590
Will you go?

15
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,040
Yes.

(Berewed in badger)

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You are Mr. D?

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,120
You must be Mr. Mo.

19
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,710
Mr. D is on his way.

20

(he has arrived.)

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,000
This is a secluded place.

23
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,430
I wonder

24
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,400
if a man

25
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:34,480
who has licentious behaviour

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,350
will be favored

27
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,350
by Mu Li.

(where Mo Chen is?)

31
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,710
Mr. Mo,

32
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,920
if you want to know,

33
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,120
can we

34
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,870
have a drink first?

35
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,710
(Xu Weilai, what's wrong with Mo Chen?)

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,150
I don't know, Miss Mu.

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,000
I called him

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,920
all day!

39
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,070
He didn't answer

40
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,200
or text me back!

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,760
Boss said he was going to see Mr. D.

42
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,120
Don't lie to me with him!

43
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,310
I don't believe you!

44
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,360
Oh,

45
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,870
isn't this Li?

46
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:12,800
Don't worry.

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,750
Chen

48
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,840
will be back soon.

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Do you know where he is?

50
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,360
If I'm not wrong,

51
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,120
he must have gone to see Mr. D.

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,120
Mr. D?

53
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,800
He's the boss

54
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,150
of Starwu Investment.

55
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,750
The last time I saw him

56
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,120
was in a club.

57
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,000
Why don't you

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,310
take me to Chen?

OK.

62
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,000
Mo Feng, where is Chen?

63
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,590
(So, you're Mr. D.)

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,190
Chen,

65
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

66
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,030
Mr. Mo,

67
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,750
just stop it.

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,120
Chen.

69

Li.

70
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,910
I admit

71
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,800
I knew Mr. D was here.

72
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,680
But you said

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,030
I was Mr. D?

74
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,360
It's funny, isn't it?

75
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,430
I didn't expect you

76
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,360
to get carried away as easily as you did

77
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,470
when you were little.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,190
I just dialed

79
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,360
Mr. D's number.

80
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,150
Alright, Chen,

81
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,400
it looks like

82
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,030
you found it out again.

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,750
But,

84
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,360
it's OK.

85
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,520
Then,

86
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,750
I can play with you

87
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,560
without hiding behind the scenes.

88
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,840
Don't be so childish.

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,960
Enough is enough.

90
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,710
Tell me,

91
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,800
how did you

92

manage to escape

93
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,840
from that female secretary?

94
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,430
When I thought of you,

95
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,470
I was invincible.

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,750
Mealy-mouthed.

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,520
Tell me!

98
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,280
Kiss me first.

99
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,910
Who

100
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,590
on earth are you?

101
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,600
Mr. Mo, if you want to know...

102
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,160
Then,

103
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,270
I took the chance to text Mr. D.

104
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,360
That's it?

105
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,190
Yes.

106
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,270
OK, not bad.

107
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,190
Here.

108
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,390
I am childish?

109
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,800
Enough is enough?

110
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,510
Soon,

111
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,630
