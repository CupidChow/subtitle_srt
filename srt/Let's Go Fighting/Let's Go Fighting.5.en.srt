Stop!

No,

I can't run.

Or you stay here.

I rented the office there,

00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,880
and it's okay if you get caught.

10

What about you?

11
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,670
If I get caught,
they'll know I'm not lame.

You're trying to lie to me again?

No.

It's urgent.

17

It's none of your business.

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,840
Since that,

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,510
I'm going to let go.

I'll leave you here if you fall.

It's none of your business.

You're still recovering from surgery.

Why do you have to come out?

You know what I've been through?

I know.

33

You want to find out the truth
about the accident.

34

But I've already investigated.

That was an accident.
