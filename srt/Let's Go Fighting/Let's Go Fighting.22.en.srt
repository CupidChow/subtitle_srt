Either you'll lose everything,

00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,070
or Muli will lose everything.

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,760
What do you think, Chen?

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,800
Do you love

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,480
the options I gave you?

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:28,190
Look,

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,600
it's starting to rise.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,420
(Overall Increase
in the Index of the Mu Group)

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,640
Xue,

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,920
help me check the source of funds.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,280
And

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,280
I want to see the companies' heads

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,150
that help us

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,640
to thank them face to face.

16
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,200
Well...

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,470
It seems that the MOHS
took the initiative to quit.

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,390
No way!

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,280
They also raised the prices

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,750
of relevant enterprises.

21
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,030
So our valuation

22
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,840
has been raised.

23
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,750
It's Mo Chen, right?

24
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,920
I don't know.

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,560
I really don't know.

26
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:09,590
Boss,

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,230
Mr. Mo's instructions were delivered.

28
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,640
Mr. Mo thinks

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,640
this is the best opportunity
to acquire the Mu Group.

30
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,400
You were too irrational

31
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,310
in what you have done.

32
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,740
(Notice on Suspension
of Deputy General Manager of the MOHS)

33
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,430
I've guessed it.

34
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,230
Can we explain it

35
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,710
to Mr. Mo?

36
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,150
He acquiesced

37
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,000
in the marriage after all.

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,000
Don't bother.

39
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,070
I've nothing to say to him.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,560
Boss,

41
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,280
I have one more thing.

42
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,870
Feng came to me

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,230
and I will go to work

44
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,710
for him tomorrow.

45
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,040
OK.

46
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,710
Now you even use me

47
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,590
for your purpose.

48
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,680
This is what you want to do?

49
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,070
(Your purpose
hasn't changed from beginning to end.)

50

(You just want to acquire the Mu Group.)

51
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,760
Boss.

52
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,630
Why are you here?

53
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:10,960
Feng asked me to

54
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,120
take back the car key.

55
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,910
That's the property of the Group.

56
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,910
You remember it very well.

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,280
Boss, then I...

58
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,680
Go.

59
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,240
Xu Weilai,

60
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,120
don't take it too far.

61
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,470
Mo Chen.

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,120
Why are you here?

63
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,000
I knew everything.

64
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,680
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,630
We still have a chance.

66
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,240
This is a project

67
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,560
that the Mu Group negotiated before.

68
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,140
(Investment Introduction Plan
of the Industrial Park)

69
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,360
The project was put on hold

70
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,120
because of my dad's accident.

71
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,240
I want to restart it.

72
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,240
With a blessing in disguise,

73
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
our company has an extra cash flow.

74
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,910
If this project

75
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,000
is successfully implemented,

76
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,150
you can also get the chips
to return to the MOHS.

77
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,080
I don't need it.

78
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,630
I've lost.

79
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,680
And,

80
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,840
I don't deserve your help.

81
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,560
I want you to keep

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,120
the most important thing to yourself.

83
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,710
Even it's for me.

84
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,000
Mo Feng has started
to meddle in Mu Group's affairs.

85
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,710
He colluded with some
of our shareholders.

86
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,520
The majority of shareholders voted

87
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,800
to approve the transfer of shares

88
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,870
at today's general meeting.

89
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,000
What?

90
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,190
Li,

91
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,080
do you really want
to deal with Mo Feng alone?

92
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,430
Xingjie and I

93
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,520
can help you at the meeting.

94
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,560
No.

95
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,470
You need to help me

96
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,590
keep every business of the Mu Group

97
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,750
and never give Mo Feng

98
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,030
any chance to get involved.

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,840
And

100
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,710
I have already found a helper.

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,800
(Mu Group)
Do you

102
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,000
have any questions?

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,120
This is an upgrade
to the new catering form.

104
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,950
Our park

105
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,950
will be built into a trendy food resort,

106
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,070
integrating eating, drinking,
and playing.

107
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,120
I wonder

108
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,390
if you have arranged

109
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,190
the project leader.

110
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,390
I think...

111
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,070
Feng,

112
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,000
don't worry about that.

113
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,120
I've found the right person.

114
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,600
Mo Chen

115
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,120
will take my place

116
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,390
in this M&A project.

117
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,720
I disagree!
