2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:19,710
Mr. Xia,

3
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:21,480
you told me to come here

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,190
in such a hurry

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,960
just because of Mr. Lu.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,710
Boss,

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,760
(Mu's New CEO Lu Xingjie is a "Spy")
Mr. Lu took over

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,600
the ENI Dessert project

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,480
that we've been approached for recently.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,670
Miss Mu,

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,920
I'm afraid you need to explain it.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,710
Mr. Lu has made a serious mistake

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,670
this time.

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,750
Guys,

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,390
as a professional CEO,

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,240
what I can do is strive

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,350
for the best interests of the group.

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,710
And the parties

19
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,840
signed the M&A agreement willingly.

20
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,200
I'm just a matchmaker.

21
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,030
It seems that someone in the Mu Group

22
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,560
has joined hands with Starwu.

23
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,030
This article simply means

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,200
that Mr. Lu is a spy

25
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,240
that you sent to the Mu.

26
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,520
As for commercial espionage,

27
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,150
it's nonsense.

28
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,120
Due to Mr. Lu's dereliction of duty,

29
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,760
Mu's project
has been taken away by MOHS.

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,150
It's true, isn't it?

31
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,200
Mr. Xia,

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,920
it's not the end of the matter.

33
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,590
Don't jump to conclusions, OK?

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,510
Miss Mu,

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,040
take it easy.

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,510
I'm afraid Miss Mu

37
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,590
will also be involved.

38
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,680
Mu Liu?

39
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,590
Now it's your turn.

40
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,510
Guys,

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,680
please look at the screen.

42
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,780
(Name of the Deceased: Mu Liu)

43
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,230
Lady,

44
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,040
please tell us

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,040
who you are.

46
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,680
(Medical Certificate of Death)
You're not Mu Liu.

47
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,680
(Medical Certificate of Death)
Xia Xingrun, are you crazy?

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,680
Who asked you to attack Miss Mu

49
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,120
with the false certificate?

50
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,040
Guys,

51
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,840
I'm Mu Qingyun's youngest daughter.

52
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,950
Mu Liu and I are twin sisters.

53
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,280
I was diagnosed

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,840
with congenital heart disease at birth,

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
so I've been recuperating abroad

56
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,430
since childhood.

57
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,230
It's normal

58
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,150
that you don't know me.

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,870
But please believe me.

60
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,840
I'm really the rightful heiress
to the Mu Group.

61
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,080
What a good story.

62
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,590
Xia,

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,870
it's a serious matter.

64
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
We should focus on handling it.

65
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,240
We'll believe what you said for now.

66
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,630
You have three days

67
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,680
to provide relevant identification.

68
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,190
I didn't expect a real and fake Miss Mu.

69
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:34,960
Mu Liu!

70
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,280
Mu Liu!

71
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,400
Mr. Mo,

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,960
are you here
to pick up Miss Mu from work?

73
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,470
None of your business.

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
I wonder

75
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,190
if you have time to talk.

76
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,680
I have a secret.

77
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,310
Mr. Mo,

78
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,190
you'll like it.

79
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,470
How long did I faint?

80
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,080
You're awake?

81
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,710
Not long.

82
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,400
Take a rest.

83
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,710
Yes.

84
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,710
You haven't fully recovered.

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,590
It's all Xia's fault.

86
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,240
Damn it.

87
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,470
We don't have much time.

88
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,710
Only three days.

89
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,630
I didn't expect Xia Xingrun

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,080
to have such sources of information.

91
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,310
I think

92
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,360
the robot told him that.

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,080
The robot?

94
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:28,910
Yes.

95
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,870
(He always talks mysteriously)

96
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,750
(with a robotic voice)

97
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,750
(on the landline in his office.)

98
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,710
(Mr. Mo,)

99
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,400
I'd like to warn you.

100
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,400
Even if a couple

101
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,470
sleeps in the same bed,

102
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,030
they still have different minds.

103
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,030
What do you mean?

104
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,310
Can a car accident

105
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,710
really change

106
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,560
one's character completely?

107
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,520
I know

108
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,310
that you and Mu Qingyun
have a cooperation agreement.

109
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,680
Mr. Xia,

110
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,710
you really know everything.

111
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,840
We are businessmen.

112
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
You want the shares

113
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,400
and I want money.

114
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,030
I can give you 30% of the Mu Group

115
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,240
(Company Acquisition Contract)
that the old guy

116
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,750
talked to you about.

117
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,400
What do you want?

118
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,800
Mr. Mo,

119
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,030
if you transfer the money to me,

120
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,800
the shares will be yours.

121
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,630
Why should I trust you?

122
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,870
It's OK if you don't believe me.

123
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,070
But you need to know

124
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,000
that those directors

125
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,630
support the real Mu Liu,

126
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,270
not the fake one.

127
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,510
Mr. Mo,

128
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,120
just think about it.

129
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,920
I don't want to see you

130
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,270
end up with nothing.

131
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,040
Mu Liu.

132
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,750
What's wrong with you?

133
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,950
Mo Chen.

134
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,950
Please leave us alone.

135
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,430
Actually, I'm not Mu Liu.

136
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,870
I'm her twin sister,

137
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,000
Mu Li.

138
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,310
I've already found it out.

139
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,630
You've already found it out?

140
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,160
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

141
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,920
When I came back,

142
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,720
I didn't know

143
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,560
if you had anything to do

144
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
with my parents' accident,

145
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,360
so I lied to you.

146
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,430
Do you believe me?

147
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,190
Of course, I believe you.
