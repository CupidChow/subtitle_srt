00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,480
Boss,

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,670
I have already checked.

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,070
Mu Liu has no sisters.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,440
Did she have plastic surgery?

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,710
How about

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,030
taking some more photos

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,160
for the doctor to compare?

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,440
OK.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,350
Go for it.

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,230
OK.

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,550
Anything else?

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,280
Boss,

14
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,560
it's more convenient for you

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,600
to take photos.

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,520
Me?

17
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,840
Where's this?

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,670
Didn't you ask Mu Bingyun to meet you?

19
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,790
But it's at a coffee shop.

20
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:45,920
It's right around here.

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,920
What are you shooting?

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,200
Let me see.

23
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,790
You made me look so bad.

24
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,470
I think they look good.

25
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,350
How beautiful.

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,880
Eyes, nose,

27
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,960
and everything are here.

28
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,350
Beautiful?

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,230
Alright,

30
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,430
I haven't done this before.

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,870
Let me teach you.

32
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,000
Teach me?

33
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,790
Lower.

34
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,230
OK.

35
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,870
One, two, three.

36
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:40,870
Ah,

37
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,040
my aunt is here.

38
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,230
I'll go find her first.

39
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,790
(Aunt,)

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,870
(where are you?)

41
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,000
(I haven't seen her before.)

42
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,070
(How can I find her?)

43
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,680
Aunt.

44
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,950
Liu.

45
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,870
I am very worried about you.

46
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,560
Sit down.

47
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,750
OK.

48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,520
What's wrong with you?

49
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,280
Why do you contact me so late?

50
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,000
It's mainly my fault.

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,430
But I didn't know
such a big thing happened suddenlly.

52
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,280
Take care of yourself.

53
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,190
OK.

54
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,240
Aunt,

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,470
I have something to ask you.

56
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,360
Do you know the Starwu International
that is against the Mu Group?

57
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,560
I...

58
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,590
I don't know.

59
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,000
OK.

60
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,430
I heard recently

61
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,800
that someone
was selling the Mu Group's shares

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,150
to this company.

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,310
Do you know this?

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Where did you

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,240
hear that?

66
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,000
You also know

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,560
that I just have a few shares.

68
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,910
I couldn't say anything

69
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,150
on the board of directors.

70
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,360
How can I sell shares?

71
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,590
Maybe it's one of your uncles.

72
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,080
By the way,

73
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,150
I have finished what you asked me to do

74
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,190
between you and Song Yuan.

75
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,910
Song Yuan?

76
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,560
What thing?

77
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,470
You asked me
to transfer two million RMB to him.

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
I have done it for you.

79
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,360
When will you give me your shares?

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,030
Oh,

81
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,430
I'm sorry, aunt.

82
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,870
Since my surgery,

83
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,360
I have not been well.

84
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,630
Can you give me some time

85
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
to recover?

86
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,750
(Boss,)

87
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,240
(the doctors who saw the photos said )

88

(that Miss Mu
had never had plastic surgery.)

89

91

How many hairs are enough for testing?

92

Mr. Mo,

93
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,430
you have this kind of hobby?

94

Your room is too messy

95
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,870
and I just clean it for you.

we were investigating secretly?)

Boss,

102
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,840
the results came out.

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,680
She's really Mu Liu herself.

104

(Result: Sister probability is 95.99%.)

105
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,310
Isn't that still a 4.01% probability?

106
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,080
Continue to check.

107
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:16,920
Boss,

108
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,160
I think you are different too.

109
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,390
Where?

110
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,000
Become blind.

111
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,160
This is probably

112
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,060
the power of love.

113
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,070
("Pollen Shop of Dream")

114
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,310
Power of love?

115
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:29,560
Yes.

116
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,750
Spare my life, boss.

117
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,510
Take your cartoon

118
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,630
and report to the Personnel Department.

119
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,560
Now!

120
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,510
(If they're the same person,)

(does she plan to share the Mu Group
with Mu Bingyun?)

122
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,430
Go on a date?

123

No.

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Go to my aunt's birthday.

125
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,630
Don't go.

126
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,750
Why?

127
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,270
Mu Bingyun wasn't loyal
to the Mu Group,

128
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,630
and the Song Yuan you loved

129

is using you.

130
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,430
I loved?

131
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,560
Didn't you quit your marriage with me

132
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,190
to be with him?

133
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,430
Eh.

134
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,390
That was all in the past.

Mr. Mo,

136
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,160
are you

137
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,040
jealous?

Don't flatter yourself.

I'm just a friendly reminder.

Lest you overestimate yourself.

141
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,270
You keep so many secrets from me

142

and don't let me investigate,

143
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,270
then why should I listen to you?

144
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,160
I didn't tell you

145
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,040
for a reason.

146
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,070
What is the reason?

147
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,870
You took my hair
for DNA testing secretly.

148
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,600
And want me to believe you?

149

The premise of my belief

150

is that you should be sincere, right?

151
