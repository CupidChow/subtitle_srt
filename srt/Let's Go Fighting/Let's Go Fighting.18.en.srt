OK.

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,190
Stop.

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,870
Yoo-Hoo!

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,670
Are these

6
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,840
all arranged by you?

7
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,320
Yes.

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,600
Like it?

9
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,390
Yes.

10
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,280

I will bring you here.

00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,470
OK.

OK?

28
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,870
Lu Xingjie, you idiot!

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,150
You've ruined the atmosphere!

30

What are you doing?

What are you doing?

Nothing.

Just go on.

- Go on.
- Go on.

35
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,470
- No.
- Go on.

36
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,680
You and Mo Chen

37
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,800
were very sweet just now.

38
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,400
Stop it.

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,310
Why did you peek at us?

40
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,560
Are you happy?

41
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,630
Jack shall have Jill.

42
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,710
Stop it.

43
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,630
Tell me about you and Lu.

44
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,000
How did you and Lu

45
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,960
get along this afternoon?

46
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,360
Luckily, he's not completely blind yet.

47
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,400
Not completely blind yet?

48
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,870
That means there is progress.

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,590
You're in a relationship?

50
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,080
You're going too far.

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,190
It's not that fast.

52
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,870
Do you want me to help you?

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,240
How?

54
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,400
What do you want to do?

55
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,000
What are they doing?

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,190
They are packing up

57
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,030
the tableware over there.

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,000
Action!

59
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,120
You have a plan?

60
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,560
Now that

61
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,430
they started to

62
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,750
have feelings for each other,

63
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,000
we should do something

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,800
to help them.

65
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,630
Take action with my instructions

66
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,800
when we play cards.

67
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,470
What's going on?

68
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,680
We didn't win once all night.

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,280
So I think

70
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,870
maybe we should stop here tonight.

71
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,630
No!

72
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,710
Go on!

73
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,400
OK.

74
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,120
One more time.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,840
Come on, Mo Chen,

76
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,560
take a card!

77
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,520
Last-gasp goal!

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,470
Straight Flush!

79
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,400
Come on.

80
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,190
Admit defeat for the bet.

81
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,520
It's OK,

82
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,560
we can afford to lose.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,750
Oh really?

84
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,280
You can afford to lose?

85
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,960
Yes.

86
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,920
OK.

87
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:17,830
Draw lots.

88
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,100
(Kiss for 30 seconds)

89
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,310
Dare.

90
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,630
Kiss for 30 seconds.

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,630
Kiss.

92
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,360
Or forget it.

93
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,830
That won't work.

94
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,040
When we just lost,

95
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,000
we were punished like this.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,720
But...

97
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,430
Or

98
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,240
I drink

99

the rest of the wine alone.

100
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,510
Are you sure?

101
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,560
Don't regret it.

102
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,430
Sure.

103
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,270
I...

104
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,070
Just drink.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,560
Drink.

106
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,070
OK.
