2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:15,800
It contains data

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,000
about Xia Xingrun's collusion

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
with Mo Feng.

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,550
So what?

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,440
I thought Miss Mu

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,510
found something

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,550
amazing.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,350
See it carefully.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,480
Mr. D of Starwood

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,320
and Xia Xingrun

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,960
signed this
Valuation Adjustment Mechanism.

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,640
(Party A: Xia Xingrun Party B: Starwu)

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,430
He cheated my parents

15
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,280
to go abroad

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,320
on the excuse of the ENI Dessert project

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,150
to take the opportunity

18
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,000
to take Mu Liu

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,150
and Mu Bingyun's shares.

20
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,110
But he didn't expect

21
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:43,920
that my parents

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,880
had an accident abroad.

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,470
You are the one

24
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,110
who plotted everything
from the beginning.

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,520
You make a great point,

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,110
Miss Mu.

27
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,390
Although I sympathize with you,

28
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,430
what evidence do you have

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,510
to prove it's me?

30
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,590
Eh?

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,640
Feng,

32
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:10,760
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,870
Hmm.

34
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Xia Xingrun has invested

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,120
in many businesses here.

36
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,400
There is also a project

37
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,870
called ENI Dessert.

38
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,640
What do you want to say?

39
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,680
Boss,

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,560
this is the Mu Group's fund
Xia Xingrun lost, right?

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,120
Could it be

42
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
that you and Xia Xingrun

43
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,510
cheated the Mu family

44
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,400
to go abroad

45
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,400
to avoid investigation?

46
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,280
Don't

47
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,920
say something

48
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,790
without evidence,

49
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,480
or you'll be sued for slander.

50
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,920
Get out.

51
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,070
Xu Weilai

52
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,120
also dares to investigate me.

53
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,150
Chen,

54
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,920
I will fire him immediately

55
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,200
and you won't find out

56
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,920
the truth about the accident.

57
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,230
(I will destroy you)

58
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,760
(and the Mu Group together.)

59
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,840
If so,

60
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,840
we can't accept

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,120
Mo Feng holding

62
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,870
the Mu Group's shares.

63
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,360
All directors, please rest assured

64
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
that Mo Feng will not

65
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,470
take any of our shares.

66
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,630
It was he

67
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,800
who signed
the Valuation Adjustment Mechanism

68
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,750
with Xia Xingrun.

69
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,710
According to the content,

70
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,960
he should also return

71
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,910
the Mu Group's funds he misappropriated.

72
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,840
Your Starwu's funds

73
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,400
should not be enough.

74
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,150
Just give up.

75
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,590
Mo Feng.

76
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,590
Haw-haw.

77
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,750
Give up?

78
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,430
Why should I give up?

79
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,680
Why did I have to lose to you

80
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,520
since I was a child?

81
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,870
Why does everyone

82
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,280
compare me with you?

83
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,000
Mo Feng,

84
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
nobody wants to compete with you.

85
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,430
If you want the MOHS Group,

86
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,590
I'll give it to you.

87
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,240
I have a more important thing to guard.

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,030
Give it to me?

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,310
Are you sympathizing with me?

90
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:55,960
Mo Feng.

91
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,520
Do you remember this doll?

92
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,430
I only won you that time

93
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,750
since I was a child.

94
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,190
What I want is for me to win you,

95
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,000
not for you to give up to me.

96
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,870
I didn't lose.

97
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,030
I'm Mr. D.

98
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,280
I didn't lose.

99
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,870
I didn't lose!

100
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,910
I didn't lose!

101
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,590
Ha-ha ha-ha!

102
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,190
I didn't lose.

103
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,750
I didn't lose.

104
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,100
(Mo Feng and others were co-investigated
and severely punished)

105
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,500
(by the CSRC and other departments
for their illegal market manipulation.)

106
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,680
How is Mo Feng?

107
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,520
He was taken

108
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,280
to the authorities for investigation.

109
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,240
I didn't realize it was true

110
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
that you told me

111
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080
he was mentally ill.

112
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,240
Where are Lu and Tang Xue?

113
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,840
Tang Xue took him back to Italy

114
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,910
to meet her parents.

115
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,750
Yes.

116
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,750
They should

117
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,400
hurry up.

118
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,150
What do you think?

119
00:03:59,520 --> 00:03:59,910
Do you feel familiar?

120
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,840
This is the place I promised

121
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,520
to bring you often.

122
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,400
Let me show you something.

123
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,870
Pretty?

124
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:09,960
Yes.

125
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,240
What do you think?

126
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,630
Where did you

127
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,870
get so many photos of me?

128
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,430
Because it's not enough

129
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,950
to see you all the time.

130
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,950
So,

131
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,000
I saved these photos.
