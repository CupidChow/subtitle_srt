(Starwu)
Hello,

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,390
we are

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,960
the electricians that Xu Weilai asked

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,480
to repair the network.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,830
Really?

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,670
Then go in.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,640
Wait!

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,390
Wrong way.

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,320
It's not over here,

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,280
but over there.

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,510
Oops,

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,320
I forgot it.

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,030
Thank you.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,390
I wonder

16
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,790
(Starwu)
what your plans are

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,280
after you take over these businesses.

18
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,390
Well,

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,520
we plan to do the Internet of Things

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and upgrade the catering system.

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,880
You

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,560
are going to make our catering machine

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,030
intelligent?

24
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,390
Yes.

25
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:55,880
This is it.

26
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,110
OK.

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,520
Provident.

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,070
Is this the graphic design here?

29
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
It's different.

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,560
It should have been decorated.

31
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,640
(Starwu)
I heard that there was something wrong

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,200
with Starwu's patent project before.

33
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't know if it is true.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,280
Miss Tang,

35
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,400
where did you hear the rumor?

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,640
Maybe I'm mistaken.

37
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,350
We've been talking for so long.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,590
Is it possible

39
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,710
to sign the contract now?

40
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,310
Hmm...

41
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,280
I want to know more

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,350
about the details of the contract.

43
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,200
Didn't Xu Weilai

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,840
send you

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,120
the details

46
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,790
of our contract before?

47
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,710
Yes.

48
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,840
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

49
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,430
But I still want

50
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,590
to communicate with you
more about the content.

51
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,870
Miss Tang,

52
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,750
don't you want to cooperate with me?

53
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,910
No, it isn''t that.

54
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,150
OK.

55
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,680
Then I'll bring you the contract first.

56
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,310
Mo Chen,

57
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:22,680
go!

58
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,800
(Mo Feng is going back.)

59
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,580
(Starwu)

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,960
Mr. Mo,

61
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,960
I have something urgent
to go back first.

62
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,560
(As for the contract,)

63
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,310
(I need to reconfirm it
with the legal department.)

64
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:31,800
OK.

65
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,800
(Xue,)

66
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,470
I think you just acted very well.

67
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,190
Right?

68
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,240
I almost believed it.

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,470
OK.

70
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,630
Now it's our turn to fight back.

71
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,000
(Investment Introduction Plan
of the Industrial Park)

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,630
Looks like everyone is waiting for me.

73
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,750
This is

74
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
the document

75
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,120
that Miss Mu and I

76
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,750
found in Xia Xingrun's safe.

77
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:03,870
It contains data

78
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,080
about Xia Xingrun's collusion
with Mo Feng.

79
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,870
So what?

80
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,120
I thought Miss Mu

81
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,080
had found something

82
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,000
amazing.

83
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,400
See it carefully.
