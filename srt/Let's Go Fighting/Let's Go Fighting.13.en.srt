2
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,160
- Today...
- Today...

3
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,230
You go first.

4
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:29,600
You...

5
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,280
You've been different

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,110
since you came back.

7
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,640
Maybe it is

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,560
because I've experienced some accidents.

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,350
Oh,

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,920
I just hate to see

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,920
you and Lu so close.

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,280
It's nothing between Lu Xingjie and me.

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,880
I don't believe it.

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,880
He just misunderstood.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,710
He had

16
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,390
a story

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,000
with my best friend abroad.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,320
He thought that was me.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,320
So I...

20
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,000
So you went to the restaurant today

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,110
just to make it clear?

22
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,640
What else?

23
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,750
Idiot.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,480
Let's go.

25
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,760
Boss.

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:17,950
Boss.

27
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,310
Sign it.

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:26,940
OK.

29
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,230
Boss,

30
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,480
explain it.

31
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,340
(Party A (Signature): Mu Liu)

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,120
(Tang Xue, you're finally here!)

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,000
If you hadn't called and told me,

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,430
I wouldn't have known

35
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,590
that Lu Xingjie was so heartless

36
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,920
and blind.

37
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,590
Well, if you had told him

38
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,000
the truth,

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,120
that wouldn't have happened, right?

40
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,070
I was just afraid that he would

41
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,400
think of me as a snobbish woman.

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,590
But now,

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,350
I don't know how to explain it to him.

44
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,560
Come on.

45
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,510
You just came back
and you're thinking so much.

46
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,560
Put your things down.

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's go to the company.

48
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,200
What do you think?

49
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,950
After a tour

50
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,120
of the Mu's departments,

51
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,800
which one do you want to go to most?

52
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,470
If I really work here,

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,240
of course, I'll want to go to...

54
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:14,960
Where?

55
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,310
Li,

56
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,800
there's a contract

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,910
that you need to deal with.

58
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,960
Lu,

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,280
don't you see

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,280
that there is one more person here?

61
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,520
You're...

62
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,520
Li, let's solve

63
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,310
Xia Xingrun's problem first.

64
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,560
What's wrong with him?

65
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:39,910
Xue,

66
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,960
don't worry.

67
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,120
Wait here for me.

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,710
So blind and heartless!

69
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,430
Mr. Xia,

70
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,310
your plan seriously violates

71
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,430
the competition regulations.

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,710
Please take it back and revise it.

73
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,400
Otherwise,
Mr. Lu and I will never sign it.

74
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,630
In business competition,

75
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,240
what matters are the interests.

76
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,120
Who cares what the means are?

77
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,240
Mr. Lu, are you sure

78
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,800
that you haven't done this before?

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,240
I've never done

80
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,030
such a dirty thing.

81
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,400
Young man,

82
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,520
don't say it so early,

83
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,150
or you'll eat your words.

84
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,960
There's something wrong
with his development plan.

85
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,400
I knew it.

86
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,310
That's why I got you here.

87
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,360
ENI is mentioned in his plan.

88
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,520
I saw the name of the company
in the archives before.

89
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,960
You said you wanted to help me.

90
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,000
I think you need my help.

91
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,800
Who are you?

92
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,310
Oh,

93
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,870
I'm Li's best friend, Tang Xue.

94
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,280
Li?

95
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,710
Eh,

96
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,280
she is

97
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,960
Mu Liu.

98
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,680
We call her Li at school.

99
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,680
Let's go.

100
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,080
I'll take you to her.

101
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,710
Li,

102
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,870
do you find it over there?

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,750
Not yet.

104
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,560
I found it!

105
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,470
Here.

106
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,150
Thank you.

107
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,360
Li,

108
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,310
actually, I've been...

109
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
What are you doing?

110
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,680
Ah!

111
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,630
I...

112
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,480
Hey!

113
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,310
Oh no!

114
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,920
This is a big misunderstanding!

115
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,950
It's OK.

116
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:38,950
We didn't do anything.

117
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,040
Come on!

118
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,240
But,

119
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,270
why should I look for him?

120
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,040
Looking for me?

121
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,600
Yes.

122
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,070
Enjoy your meal.

123
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Mo Chen,

124
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,560
I...

125
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,600
Did Lu

126
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,390
confess to you?

127
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,480
Didn't I tell you

128
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,680
that he mistook me for Xue?

129
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,950
If it were me who just confessed,

130
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,630
