Mo Chen.

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,190
What happened?

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,550
Mo Feng wants to fund the project

00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,760
(Investment Introduction Plan)
of the Industrial Park.

Here it is again.

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:29,710
He seems to be trying to force you

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,670
to dilute your shares.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,670
Are we just going to

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,750
watch him get his way?

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,000
Can we find evidence

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,920
of what Xia Xingrun said?

16
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,280
What evidence?

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,280
(Mu Li,)

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,150
let me give you a hint.

19
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,000
I have something

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
you need in my safe.

21
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,470
Whether you can get it

22
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,670
depends on your ability.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,470
Xia Xingrun has a document

24
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,520
proving that Mr. D
manipulated the market illegally

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,600
in the safe.

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,430
But we

27
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,520
can't find it.

28
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,320
Looks like

29
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,000
it's time to wrap it up.

30
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,670
A rare guest.

31
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,560
What

32
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,430
are you doing here?

33
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,960
Feng,

34
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,920
I want to give you

35
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,070
two options.

36
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,870
Really?

37
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,680
Read it first.

38

(The Mu's and the MOHS's Shares)
Competition agreement.

39
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,870
Complete the investment attraction
of the industrial park?

40
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,480
Interesting.

41
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,790
I just wonder

42
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,840
if you dare to compete with me

43
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,680
this time.

44
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,920
According to the competition agreement,

45
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,150
Mo Feng will definitely

46
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,150
use Starwu to fund.

47
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,680
What is this

48
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,510
thing for?

49
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,560
This is the gen

50
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,350
Xia Xingrun gave me.

51
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:30,950
Xia Xingrun?

52
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,000
Why?

53
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,430
OK.

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,870
I like

55
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,200
playing games the most.

56
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,040
But,

57
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,560
this time,

58
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,200
I wanna bet on something bigger.

59
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,920
Go ahead.

60
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,350
Whoever loses the project
of the industrial park

61
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,590
will leave the Mu Group.

62
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,230
What do you think?

63
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,280
This is Starwu's graphic design.

64
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,760
His office is here.

65
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,310
The meeting room is here.

66
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,040
Mu Li and I

67
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,150
will go to his office

68
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,790
to find the safe.

69
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,040
But Mo Feng

70
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,040
is always in the company,

71
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,710
so it is difficult for us
to get the document.

72
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,950
What should we do?

73
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,140
(Xu Weilai: A buyer has been found
for Starwu's business.)

74
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,750
Are you afraid,

75
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,360
Miss Mu?

76
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:12,800
OK.

77
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,470
It's a deal.

78
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,310
Then I'll hold Mo Feng off.

79
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,630
No.

80
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,750
It's obviously my job.

81
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You've been on the news.

82
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,280
Just news.

83
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,750
It's OK.

84
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:23,870
No.

85
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,750
I have to go to ensure

86
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:26,960
that nothing goes wrong.

87
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,910
I will always be with you.

88
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,360
Later, Lu and Tang Xue

89
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,430
will find Mo Feng to sign a contract.

90
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,470
Pay attention to business points

91
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,120
and don't blow your cover.

92
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,960
What about you?

93
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,710
We will pretend to be electricians

94
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,310
to find the agreement.

95
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,190
You must hold Mo Feng off

96
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,030
in the meeting room.

97
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,120
Eh,

98
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,800
how can we get in?

99
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,870
Xu Weilai will come to meet us.

100
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,470
- Xu Weilai?
- Xu Weilai?

101
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,280
This time, when I help Mu Li,

102
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,120
he may take the opportunity
to hold me down.

103
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,680
Boss,

104
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,590
I can do everything for you

105
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,080
without hesitation.

106
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,910
I want you to sneak up on Mo Feng

107
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,910
to investigate the Starwu.

108
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,800
Ah.

109
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,630
Boss,

110
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,430
you let me go to Feng,

111
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,120
which is too difficult.

112
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,960
It is time to pay
your mother's medical bills.

113
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Let's see if he will take the bait.

114
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,310
So these

115
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,280
are your ideas.

116
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,910
But Xu Weilai

117
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,560
is a little clumsy.

118
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,630
Is he reliable?

119
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,590
Sure!

120
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,630
Go.

121
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,280
Boss,

122
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,360
I was kicked out by Feng.

123

(Starwu)

124
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,310

Yes.

Yes.

I feel like

00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,120
Eh.

135
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,910
He is the bodyguard I hired from abroad.

Really?

OK.
