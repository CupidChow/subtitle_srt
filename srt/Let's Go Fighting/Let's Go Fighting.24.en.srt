2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,510
You're talking too much.

3
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,440
What are you doing?

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,550
Acting.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,230
Mo Feng is still behind us.

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,070
Xu Weilai, you stay away from me.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,110
Go.

8
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,350
Or

9
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,640
let's go back.

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
Mo Feng is right outside.

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,710
Are you sure?

12
00:00:59,030 --> 00:00:59,640
So

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,200
how do we sleep at night?

14
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,430
Don't worry.

15
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,430
You sleep on the bed

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,430
and I sleep on the stool.

17
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,400
I'd better take a look at the camera.

18
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:19,560
Eh.

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,680
OK.

20
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,580
(What do you want to do?)

21
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,380
(This is in the company.)

22
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,800
(I want to talk to you nicely.)

23
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,000
What

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,430
is this?

25
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,400
I...

26
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,280
I'm going to take a bath.

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,470
Don't peek at me.

28
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,590
Hey,

29
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,870
are you cold?

30
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,710
Will you catch a cold?

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,910
You have to drive

32
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,240
for several hours tomorrow.

33
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,150
Or...

34
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:03,750
Ah!

35
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,750
Ah!

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,960
What are you doing?

37
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,360
I won't let you sleep on the floor.

38
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,150
No!

39
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,190
I mean

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,150
I can give you the quilt.

41
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,360
If you give me the quilt,

42
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,360
what will you cover yourself with?

43
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,590
Just sleep.

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:17,910
Ah...

45
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,520
My waist hurts.

46
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,630
Good night.

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,680
Xu Weilai,

48
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,590
you stay away from me.

49
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,360
(What if you have back pain tomorrow?)

50
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,000
(Lower your voice.)

51
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,710
(The sound insulation
of the hotel is poor.)

52
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,030
It's disgusting.

53
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,400
Go ahead

54
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,280
and report to me later.

55
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,310
OK.

56
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,910
Well, we have a deal.

57
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,560
No one is allowed to cross the line.

58
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,910
Whoever crosses the line

59
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,840
is a puppy.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,070
Don't pull the quilt.

61
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,160
I'm a little cold.

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,870
Warm now?
