=Episode 11=

2
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,880
Then our succession meeting

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,870
for new directors

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,550
can continue.

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,760
Let's vote with a show of hands.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,120
Since

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,000
everyone has no objection

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,760
to Miss Mu's appointment

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,230
as Executive Director of the Mu Group.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,640
I disagree!

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,110
Mu Liu,

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,560
you are the only heir of the Mu Group.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,320
I

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,560
am the first to support you.

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,790
But you are completely unfamiliar

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,280
with the company's business.

17
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,070
Dear directors,

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,790
I know that I am inexperienced,

19
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,920
and not very familiar with

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,430
managing a company.

21
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,070
But,

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,150
he

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,240
is the professional I found.

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,350
Tomorrow is the shareholders' meeting.

25
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,350
I'm afraid I can't hold it.

26
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,310
Can you teach me some tips?

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,230
Leave it to the professional people.

28
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,000
I have a professional CEO.

29
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,510
Eh,

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,640
I have found

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,840
a professional CEO

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,920
to manage the Mu Group.

33
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,920
I believe that under his leadership,

34
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,350
the Mu Group will develop better.

35
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,200
Hello, everyone.

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,790
I am the new CEO of the Mu Group,

37
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,400
Lu Xingjie.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,920
(Senior?)

39
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,000
(Why are you?)

40
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:27,950
I have been featured

41
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,710
in major media outlets.

42
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,070
So, I won't introduce myself anymore.

43
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,790
Then,

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,950
let's go straight to the topic.

45
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,430
Dissatisfied?

46
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,280
Satisfied.

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,760
I just

48
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,870
didn't expect it would be him.

49
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,310
You know each other?

50
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,760
I'll tell you when we go back.

51
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,680
(Business Analysis)
In the next month,

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,070
(Inadequate work)
I'll adjust the Mu Group's personnel...

53
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,510
What are you looking at?

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,920
It's none of your business!

55
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,510
(Thanks for watching!)
The above

56
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,070
is my next plan

57
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,680
for the Mu Group.

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,120
Great.

59
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,470
Ah,

60
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,150
I believe Mr. Lu's plan

61
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,310
is clear, right?

62
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,310
Mr. Xia,

63
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,960
what else are you worried about?

64
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,150
I hope my worries are unnecessary.

65
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,630
Since everyone

66
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,310
has no objection,

67
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,080
let's adjourn the meeting.

68
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,000
Ah,

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,310
by the way,

70
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,520
Mr. Lu,

71
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,910
please come

72
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,030
to my office later.

73
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,960
I have something

74
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,680
to hand over to you

75
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,470
at work.

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,520
Eh,

77
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,000
Mr. Mo,

78
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,080
the next meeting

79
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,960
may involve

80
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,360
the Mu Group's business secrets.

81
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,470
I think

82
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,030
you better not attend it.

83
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,000
What do you mean?

84
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,520
Are you going to

85
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,400
burn the bridge?

86
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,360
Our cooperation does not

87
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,080
involve the core business
of the Mu Group.

88
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,910
Thank you.

89
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,470
I...

90
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,080
Eh?

91
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,240
Let's go.

92
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,080
So how did you get to know each other?

93
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,910
We are childhood friends.

94
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,150
Since childhood,

95
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,190
he had only one friend, me.

96
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,150
Even one is more.

97
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,310
How did you know him?

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,800
So,

99
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,680
nobody here knows your identity here.

100
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,630
In any case,

101
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,910
I must keep the Mu Group.

102
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,590
Li,

103
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,280
you still have me.

104
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,590
I'll always be at your side.

105
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,840
Ah.

106
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,400
I...

107
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,190
But

108
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,840
Mo Chen

109
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,310
doesn't know

110
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,630
that I am Mu Li.

111
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,710
Can you keep this secret for me?

112
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,400
OK.

113
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,870
Eh,

114
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,560
your speech today

115
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,150
was great.

116
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,190
Those people were stunned at once.

117
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,360
That's because
you haven't seen my speech.

118
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,190
Really?

119
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,870
What's the matter with you today?

120
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,360
You guys were high-fiving

121
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,950
and holding hands.

122
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,600
You peeked?

123
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,070
No.

124
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,040
Don't you say you don't fancy her?

125
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,920
Even if I don't fancy her,

126
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,240
she's my fiancee.

127
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,360
Do you remember I told you

128
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,830
that I fancied a girl when I was abroad?

129
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,630
It's her.

130
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,750
That's all I can say.

131
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,390
This time

132
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,720
we compete fairly.

133
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,560
Guys,

134
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,000
I found a good wine.

135
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,510
Let's celebrate!

136
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,000
No.

137
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,040
Why?

138
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:45,830
Where are chicken wings?

139
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,480
Go and take them.

140
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,360
Ah right,

141
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,160
I almost forgot.

142
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,600
What?

143
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,830
Afraid?

144
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,920
Of course not.

145
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,070
Here come the chicken wings!

146
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,360
You are drinking so happily!

147
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,480
I'll drink one too.

148
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,920
To celebrate

149
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,390
our long-awaited reunion.

150
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,190
- No!
- No!

151
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,720
Why?

152
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,310
You'll be crazy when you're drunk.

153
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,510
Don't drink.

154
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,240
You just had your surgery.

155
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,430
I help you.

156
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,630
You asked for it.

157
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,830
Cheer!

158
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
I am gonna go to the bathroom.

159
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,720
Let's continue when I am back.

160
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,310
OK.

161
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,600
Do you smell anything?

162
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,430
What smell?

163
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,720
The smell of vinegar.

164
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,510
The smell of vinegar?

165
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:56,830
Oh,

166
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,160
stop it.

167
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,950
Do you remember

168
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,510
I was drunk on the street?

169
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:02,950
Yes,

170
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,750
what's the matter?

171
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,830
I've been looking for you

172
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,750
for a long time since you left.

173
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:06,750
(Oh no,)

174
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,920
(he mistook me for Tang Xue.)

175
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,270
It's

176
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:12,950
