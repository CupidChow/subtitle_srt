You'll explain later.

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,000
Why?

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,280
It's your script!

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,870
You're all here.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,870
Don't you have aphasia,

7
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,230
amnesia,

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,670
and mobility problems?

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,640
Don't you have a neural meningioma?

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,430
I even showed the report

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,880
to foreign experts.

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,000
Couldn't you be more careful

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,110
when you were faking it?

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,200
I can explain.

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,110
Li,

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,320
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,560
It's all my fault.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,350
Li,

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:46,600
I...

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,280
Do you know why I believed

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,750
your nonsense?

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,200
Do you know what terminal illness

23
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,110
means to me?

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,840
Since childhood,

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,710
I've been kept alive

26

by medical equipment.

27
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,120
My parents are gone

28

and so is my sister.

29

Do you know

30
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,920
what you mean to me?

31
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,070
Do you know

I'm sorry.

I know

42
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,870
I let you down.

43
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,560
I don't know how to express it.

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,310
It's my childishness

45
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,070
that broke your heart.

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,560
But I never wanted

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,120
to lie to you.

48
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,310
I didn't want

49
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,350
to use you.

50
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,840
I just don't want to lose you.

51
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,760
That's I used

52
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,950
this stupid method.

53
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,630
I thought

54
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,470
I could keep you.

what Miss Mu will choose.

Ha ha.

69
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,870
Come in.

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,520
Boss,

71
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,520
here are

72
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,430
all the reports

73
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,470
about Starwu's investment business.

74
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,560
Some have been sued

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,520
by the Mu Group.

76
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,910
The rest has low valuations.

77
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,240
Then do something to make them higher.

78
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,430
I'm wondering

79
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,430
what the hell you did when you worked

80
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,280
for my stupid brother.

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,520
Li,

I'm sorry.

83

It's my bad idea.

I don't blame you.

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,120
Mo Chen and I

86
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
have to thank you both.

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,750
Huh?

88
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,360
So you've made up?

89
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:30,750
Yes.

92

How did you make up?

93
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,120
Tell me.

94
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,560
Mo Feng has laid hands
on the industrial park.

95

Now they are in the meeting room.

Mo Feng,

100

what do you want to do?

101
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,910
The project
of the Fashion Food Industrial Park

102
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,150
is a key project

103
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,470
of the Mu Group now, isn't it?

104
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,630
What do you want to do?

105
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,400
The person in charge of the park

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,470
came and talked to me,

107
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,000
hoping to get more investment.

108
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,430
Don't try to inject the funds of MOHS.

109
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,560
Then,

110
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,360
the industrial project

111
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
that we have won

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,280
will be lost.

113
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,840
Even if we lose the industrial park,

114
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,680
I won't support
the introduction of new funds,

115
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,710
which will dilute

116
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,150
everyone's equity.

117
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,390
Since everyone has no intention,

118
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,870
this meeting is unnecessary.

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,750
It doesn't matter to me.

120
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,600
If the industrial park project is lost,

121
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,360
my poor brother

122
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,560
will be kicked out again.

123
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,070
You should think it over.

124
