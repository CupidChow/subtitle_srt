you are looking for?

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,140
(I'm the biggest fool in the world.)

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,550
I just want to see

00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,000
if someone

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,640
is really

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,840
the biggest fool

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,430
in the world.

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,640
What?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,790
It hurts?

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,790
But I remember

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,960
you can't feel your legs.

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,320
No,

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,840
I must be hallucinating.

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,240
I am hallucinating.

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,000
So you pretended to be lame

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,790
to make my...

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,320
me

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,520
call off the engagement.

21
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,150
No.

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,470
It's because of my brother Mo Feng.

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,840
Your brother?

24
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,070
My half-brother.

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,950
He's been forced by his mother

26
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,870
to surpass me since he was a kid.

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,560
Something is wrong with him here.

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,590
So I pretended to be lame

29
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,840
to make him think that he's over me.

30
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,950
What a good story.

31
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,840
Why don't you be a screenwriter?

32
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,000
So you think

33
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,560
what I was doing

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,310
and sacrificing for my family

35
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,590
is just a story?

36
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,070
I'm so sorry.

37
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,760
I didn't know
you were doing it for your family.

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,640
I shouldn't have said that.

39
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,310
But you pretended to be lame

40
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,200
and fooled me indeed.

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,790
I can keep your secret
if you want me to.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,070
Promise me one condition.

43
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,150
Alright, just say it.

44
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,870
Give me free access

45
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,150
to your office.

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,560
Why?

47
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,590
The MOHS Group

48
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,030
is so big.

49
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,590
Why I don't see anyone?

50
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,190
Stop.

51
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,710
How do you usually go up there?

52
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,590
Usually,

53
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,400
Xu Weilai carries me up.

I'll carry you up.

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,360
Come on.

58
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,030
Are you sure?

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,240
Yes.

60
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,190
Hurry up.

61
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,430
Come on.

62
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,750
Oh,

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,870
forget it.

64
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,520
What?

65
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
No one is around here today.

66
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,630
I'll do it by myself.

67
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,560
I'll walk up on my own.

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,190
OK.

Chen,

86

are your legs

What are you doing?

89

He doesn't like people touching him.

90

91

caring about him.

92
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,120
When did they

93
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,520
get so close?

94

Does it need cleaning?

105

No.

106

Just have a rest.

107

Let me help you clean up the cabinet.

are you sure
you want to give me the Mu's shares?

Why do you want me
to get engaged to Mu Liu?

Only if she marries into your Mo family

can the Mu Group
