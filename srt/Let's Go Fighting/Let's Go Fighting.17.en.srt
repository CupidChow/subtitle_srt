2
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,920
Is this the surprise you gave me?

3
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,030
No.

4
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,440
This is the breakfast for you.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,760
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,550
I'm here to help Xiao Li
carry her luggage.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,430
What's wrong?

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,390
It's inappropriate

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,670
for you two to live together.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,350
It's not that.

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,520
Before,

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,350
I lived here as my sister

13
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,110
to investigate the truth.

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,070
Since the matter is settled,

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,350
it's not suitable for me to live here

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,390
and I can move out.

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,350
I don't mind.

18
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,240
Don't move out.

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,390
I bought four tickets
for outdoor camping.

20
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,240
Let's go and relax together!

21
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,070
Xue,

22
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:54,560
I...

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,200
What's wrong with you?

24
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,150
Don't like this kind of activity

25
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,320
after being rich?

26
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,110
Dear me,

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,350
that's not what I meant.

28
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,470
Oh.

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,110
Li,

30
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,000
you still owe me a reward.

31
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,640
Li.

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,480
Don't you like Mo Chen?

33
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,350
Why do you move away?

34
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,000
I used to live with him

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,640
as my sister.

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,200
But now he knows my identity.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,400
I feel a little uncomfortable.

38
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,280
But isn't it better to

39
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,710
clear the air?

40
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,870
Unlike me and Lu Xingjie.

41
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,560
Hey,

42
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,350
Do you give up?

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,710
Lu,

44
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,920
what the hell is going on with you?

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,150
Why did you hide Xia Xingrun's affairs

46
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,000
from me?

47
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,000
It was too urgent at the time.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,790
Stop it.

49
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,430
In fact, from that day on,

50
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,310
I knew

51
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,480
Li only had eyes for you.

52
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,280
Lu...

53
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,950
Stop it.

54
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,230
It is me who was heartless

55
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,870
and blind.

56
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:01,920
Ah?

57
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,480
One more time.

58
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:03,870
OK.

59
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,480
Come on.

60
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,520
I think

61
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,080
he's avoiding me on purpose.

62
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,560
Then you should take the initiative.

63
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,080
Look at me.

64
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,710
Let me try.

65
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,710
So impressive!

66
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,560
Sure.

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,150
Let's go.

68
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's go cycling.

69
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,150
Go.

70
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,710
Go.

71
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,240
Come on!

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,750
They are catching up!

73
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,360
Go!

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,710
Hurry up!

75
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,310
You don't make an effort!

76
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,360
How can we win them?

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm tired

78
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,080
and don't want to ride anymore.

79
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,430
Let's go and see.

80
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,870
I didn't say anything.

81
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,240
Why are you angry?

82
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,630
Let me try.

83
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,120
Lu,

84
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,680
what's wrong with you?

85
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,150
I don't know.

86
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,280
Lu,

87
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,520
it was Xue

88
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,560
who took care of you.

89
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,430
You were so drunk

90
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,360
that you were almost beaten to death
on the roadside.

91
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,520
It was she

92
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,120
who took care of you every day.

93
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,430
I vaguely guessed it.

94
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,400
Then why are you avoiding her?

95
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,190
That's why

96
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,710
I don't know how to face her.

97
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,590
You have to know what you want.

98
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,240
Once you miss some people,

99
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,120
you may not be able to get them back.

100
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,030
The process is very tortuous,

101
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,280
but I think

102
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,630
it is the best start now.

103
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,710
Li,

104
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,800
thank you.

105
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,520
I bought water.

106
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,080
Thank you.

107
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,240
Let's get back on the bike.

108
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,280
Bye!

109
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,190
Let's go.

110
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,470
I'll take you somewhere.

111
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,630
Where?

112
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,400
Let's go.

113
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,190
Why haven't we arrived yet?

114
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,240
OK, stop.

115
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,510
Yoo-Hoo!
