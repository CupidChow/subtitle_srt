2
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,190
Our company has no problem with funds.

3
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,670
It's just that we have many suppliers.

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,160
(Mu Has a Major Funding Problem)
The financial side also needs time.

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,830
Xia Xingrun made such a big mess.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,120
Why didn't anyone find it out?

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,550
Why is there such a large funding gap?

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,920
Report to me immediately
if you have any news.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,320
No, we're not frauds.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,070
(Xia Embezzled the Group's Funds)
You have to trust us.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,070
Details of Xia Xingrun's defalcation

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,350
are already available online.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,790
If this continues,

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,470
more and more people
will urge for payment.

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,920
Our capital chain will break.

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,240
No wonder Xia Xingrun

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,670
has tried to skim off money.

18
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,670
He did it throughout the Group.

19
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,710
In fact, our business

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,560
is very good.

21
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,110
It only takes a while

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,710
to fill in the funding gap.

23
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,640
Mo Feng is really cruel

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,470
to challenge us

25
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,430
at this time.

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,880
Is there any other way now?

27
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,350
Yes, there is.

28
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,560
Can the Group

29
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,320
sell some assets for money?

30
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,320
Guys,

31
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,640
now the Group

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,200
(Mu Group)
has a major financial crisis.

33
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,960
I believe you all know it.

34
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,560
We are meeting here today

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,510
to talk about how we can
get through the risk

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
by selling off some assets.

37
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,640
The leaders of all departments are here.

38
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,310
I hope
you can take the initiative to think

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,040
about what can be sold in your business.

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:16,870
Miss Mu,

41
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,230
someone from MOHS has talked to me.

42
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,560
Besides selling off some assets,

43
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,040
we can also get investment from MOHS.

44
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,430
Is it Mo Feng?

45
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,040
Don't you know

46
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,430
that this risk of the Group

47
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,120
is caused by none other than him?

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,590
Where is Lu Xingjie?

49
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,590
He went to the hospital
with a stomach ache.

50
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,070
What are you doing?

51
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,760
I need to disguise myself.
What should I do if I'm caught?

52
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,150
I came to see you.

53
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,950
To Mu Li, it's like

54
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,040
collaborating with the enemy.

55
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,150
She hates me

56
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,640
so much now?

57
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,950
Do you know
what problem the Mu Group has?

58
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,230
It's mainly the funding gap

59
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,310
that Xia Xingrun left.

60
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,560
Now the only way

61
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,070
is to sell off some assets.

62
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,950
I don't know
if the board of directors will approve.

63
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,150
If I help her,

64
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,000
can she get through the crisis?

65
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,430
Are you sure?

66
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,310
If you do, you won't get

67
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,150
support from others in the MOHS Group.

68
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,400
Are all other groups bidding so low?

69
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,680
The assets for sale

70
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,750
are those with lower valuations.

71
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,150
They're not stupid.

72
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,680
Who will pay a high price?

73
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,030
I found an enterprise

74
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,310
that's willing to contribute.

75
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,080
They are very interested

76
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,910
in what we are selling now.

77
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,520
Besides,

78
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,520
they can pay immediately.

79
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,710
(Mu Group; Overall Decline)

80
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,840
Check out what's going on.

81
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,630
Haven't we started buying?

82
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,840
Let me ask what happened.

83
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,680
Hey, what's up?

84
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,560
What?

85
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,430
It's Mo Feng and others.

86
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,800
The more we buy,

87
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,150
the more they sell.

88
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,470
Now it's a matter of money.

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,910
We won't last long.

90
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,520
So I'll let that investment company

91
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,310
start to buy this business.

92
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,750
OK.

what else

96
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,240
we have in common with MOHS.

97
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,800
OK.

at what price do we buy?

103
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,680
The original one.

104
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,910
The original one?

105
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,470
Shall we make it a little lower?

106
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,030
No.

107
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,080

It seems that Mo Feng
has already set the trap.

00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,630
What?

112
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,470
I found

113
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,360
that their business has much

114
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,240
in common with ours.

115
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,750
Although theirs came later than ours,

116
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,430
the technology is almost the same.

117
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,590
Xia Xingrun must have disclosed

118
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,680
the patented technology.

119
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,630
Check it later.

120
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,470
The new company has entered.

121
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,960
I guess we'll see the results soon.

122
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:36,960

How large a funding gap

does the Mu Group has?

129

How much do we need now?
