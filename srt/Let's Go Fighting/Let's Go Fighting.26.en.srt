are you alright?

Lie down here.

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,830
Hey, come on.

00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,830
What's wrong with you?

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,350
What happened?

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:26,920
So hot!

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,280
You...

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,710
Go and get the thermometer.

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,640
- The thermometer.
- Let me see.

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,280
None of your business.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,710
You don't care anyway.

14
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,110
What's going on?

15
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,390
Why are you suddenly uncomfortable?

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,350
The thermometer.

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,000
Come on.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,430
Mo Chen.

19
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,030
Why don't we go to the hospital?

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,110
Let's take his temperature first.

21
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:41,710
I'm not going.

22
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,000
You can't be willful now.

23
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,670
Don't be careless.

24
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,150
Go and get him a glass of water.

25
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,790
He can't think straight
because of the fever.

26
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,320
Alright.

27
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,750

(Donghai First People's Hospital
Radiology CT Examination Report)

34
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,870
(Name: Mo Chen)
The doctor said

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,480
that he didn't rule out the possibility

36
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,640
of a severe malignant tumor.

37
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,480
A malignant tumor?

38
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,070
Yes.

39
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,790
(Could you do it
more seriously next time?)

40
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,640
We said that the tumor was in the lung,

41
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,150
but the report shows
that it's in the brain.

42
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,710
My legs were shaking
when I took it to Li.

43
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,640
Could you stop paying attention

44
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,510
to these details?

45
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,200
I'll make it more perfect next time.

Hey,

47
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,400
stop arguing.

48
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,350
You've made me miserable.

49
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,000
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

50
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,150
Just follow the script

51
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,590
that I gave you.

52
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,920
I...

53
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,200
What script?

54
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,510
Eh.

55
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,790
We're talking

56
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,070
about his illness.

57
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,200
I don't understand this.

58
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
What exactly is the tumor?

59
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,230
- Meningioma.
- Neuroma.

60
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,950
- Neural meningioma.
- Meningeal neuroma.

61
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,560
Why are you so unreliable?

62
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,040
Forget it.

63
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,070
I'll show it to an expert.

64
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,790
Hey,

65
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,840
give it to me.

66
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,790
I have a sister

67
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,000
who is an expert in this field.

68
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,350
Oh, yes.

69
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,870
Yes,

70
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,560
an expert.

71
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, here's the thing.

72
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,910
I just had cosmetic surgery.

73
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,520
I'm still recovering,

74
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,360
so I can't show you my face.

75
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,190
You don't mind it?

76
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:13,840
Oh,

77
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,750
no, I don't.

78
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,080
I've read your report.

79
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,960
Indeed,

80
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,080
he has

81
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,190
a neural meningioma.

82
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,030
He can have
aphasia, amnesia, and the like.

83
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,030
So, doctor,

84
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,870
what can we do?

85
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,240
I'll arrange the surgery
for next week right away.

86
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,400
However,

87
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,590
(he needs to be taken care of)

88
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,000
(before the surgery.)

89
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,470
(For example, have some porridge)

90
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,120
(and massages.)

91
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't worry about next week's surgery.

92
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,840
I will find more experts

93
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,560
to help you.

94
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,750
Mu Li,

95
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,470
I...

96
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,630
It's OK.

97
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,190
I will always take care of you.

98
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,680
We'll be there for you.

99
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,840
Can you take care

100
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,750
of Mo Chen for me?

101
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,120
I have to go to the industrial park.

102
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,360
Then take him with you.

103
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,910
Anyway, the expert said

104
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,400
he should go out more to relax,

105
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,910
right?

106
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,680
It's good for his health.

107
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,360
Just think of it as a trip.

108
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,710
(Country House)
Now that we are here,

109
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,560
then

110
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,120
it's time to launch
the general offensive.

111
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:21,960
What is it?

112
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,560
Didn't the expert say it?

113
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,710
You should be more intimate.

114
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,400
This will

115
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,430
stimulate the brain.

116
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,000
It's a way

117
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,470
to improve your relationship.

118
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,750
I still think

119
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,840
this is not good.

120
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,590
Do you want to get Li back?

121
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,000
Of course.

122
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,150
But...

123
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,870
Forget it.

124
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,630
Let's get out of here.

125
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,080
Hey.

126
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,000
A special situation needs special means.

127
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,430
Anyway, I've talked
to the receptionist downstairs.

128
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,470
Li won't get a room when she comes back,

129
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,960
so she can only stay in your room.

130
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's go.

131
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,120
Lu.

132
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,000
Come on!

133
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,470
Mr. Lin,

134
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,360
what do you think

135
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,590
about the investment project
of the Fashion Food Industrial Park

136
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,430
that I gave you?

137
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,470
(The plan is OK,)

138
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,080
(but I've already made a deal
with Miss Mu.)

139
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,680
After my additional investment,

140
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,630
the Mu's shares and projects

141
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,720
will all be mine.

142
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,560
Think it over.

143
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,270
Chen,

144
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,040
I will destroy you

145
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,800
along with the Mu Group.

146
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,750
Oh no!

147
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,390
Li just called

148
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,480
and asked me about the clothes

149
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,360
in the trunk.

150
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,430
What clothes?

151
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,160
The wig

152
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,630
and the doctor's coat

153
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,190
I put in the trunk.

154
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:42,800
She...

155
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,510
She got to know

156
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,560
I was pretending to be ill?

157
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:44,920
Yes.

158
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,950
You'll explain later.

159
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,390
Why?
