Are you fucking scared of me, you asshole?

654
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,142
That fucking good-for-nothing bastard!

655
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,061
[cackles]

656
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:55,273
[dramatic music plays]

657
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,696
[exclaims]

658
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,905
[grunts]

659
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,867
[Suk-bong groans]
Why the fuck…

660
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,996
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Why the fuck?

661
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,872
Why for fuck's sake?

662
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,126
I was just getting started,
you fucking bastard.

663
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,336
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Fuck!

664
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,756
-I guess you caught the asshole.
-You…

665
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,925
This is how far you can go,
you fucking loser!

666
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,678
You bastard!
Stay right there, you dickhead!

667
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,097
-Are you taking him to the police station?
-[Suk-bong] You asshole.

668
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,267
-[Jang-soo] He's going to jail, right?
-[Suk-bong] You fucking bastard!

669
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,854
-Hey.
-[Sung-bokl] Fucking asshole.

670
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,481
Jang-soo.

671
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,568
Be grateful that you've been discharged.

672
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,074
[groans]
What the fuck are you losers on about?

673
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,413
Hey, you asshole!
Stay right there, you fucker!

674
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,874
[Suk-bong] Hey, stop him! Fuck!

675
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:58,002
Jun-ho, stop that fucker! Please! Fuck!

676
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,796
Fucking stop him! Shit!

677
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,631
[Beom-gu puffs]

678
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,222
[cell phone buzzes]

679
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,896
I was going to register you two
as deserters after sunrise.

680
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,940
[Ho-yeol]
<i>The sun comes up late because it's winter.</i>

681
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,735
[sighs]
Gosh, you punks.

682
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,613
[exhales]

683
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:28,949
[Beom-gu] <i>Hey, Ho-yeol.</i>

684
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,620
<i>Settle things with the cops
and come back to the unit.</i>

685
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,039
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

686
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:40,961
Cho Suk-bong.

687
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,632
Killing someone
isn't how you take revenge.

688
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,553
Do you think people repent
when they're about to die?

689
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,723
They just die.

690
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,060
Fucking peacefully at that.

691
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,313
But the person who killed them…

692
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,649
ends up regretting it.

693
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:09,323
That fucker didn't even repent
although I killed him.

694
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,161
But it's too fucking late
to even hold him responsible.

695
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,332
And you end up regretting it forever…

696
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,044
thinking you should've let him live

697
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,257
and make him pay for what he did.

698
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,764
[Suk-bong] My ass…

699
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,057
What?

700
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,104
You knew everything.

701
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,773
You all just sat back and watched.

702
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,943
Private Cho.

703
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,529
Why should I be punished?

704
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,031
-He's the one who did wrong!
-Suk-bong!

705
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,825
Why am I the one getting punished?

706
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,118
-Fucking why?
-[Jun-ho] Suk-bong!

707
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,954
-Why? Fucking why?
-[Jun-ho] Suk-bong!

708
00:40:57,037 --> 00:41:01,041
-Suk-bong! Stop!
-Why? Fuck! Why?

709
