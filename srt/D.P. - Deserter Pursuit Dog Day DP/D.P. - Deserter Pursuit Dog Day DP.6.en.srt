Ah.

00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,047
You fucking fat-ass.

661
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,427
Did you shoot yourself in the head too?

662
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,847
Why can't you get anything right?

Hey, let him get changed first.

665
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,147
He might shoot you.

666
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,315
Okay, sir.

667
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,026
You have one minute.
Put your gun inside and get changed.

What are you doing?

670
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,585
I should at least do something.
