"I'll see you again."

167
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,675
You're allowed to say that.

168
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,438
[Beom-gu] Are you on your way?

169
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,691
What's with Ho-yeol?

170
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,943
If I get stressed,
I'll get urinary stones.

171
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,613
Do you want to see me die or what?

172
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,282
[woman] Look at your face.

173
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,576
[Jun-mok sighs]

174
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,245
[woman] Aren't you going to greet
your mom? We haven't met in ages.

175
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,749
Jun-mok.

176
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,878
You can start over again.

177
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,506
Those guys who bullied you
will be tried in court and be punished…

178
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,799
Mom, are you dumb?

179
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,388
This country isn't like that.

180
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,937
The guys who made me wear a gas mask
are being transferred.

181
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,231
They're going to a different unit.

182
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,234
They won't become convicts

183
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,363
or go to jail.

184
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,743
They'll just be sent somewhere else
as if nothing happened.

185
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:04,997
Excuse me.

186
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,376
You're high in rank, right?

187
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,335
Me?

188
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,128
Is this true?

189
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,926
We're carrying out
a thorough investigation.

190
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,135
We're not sure about the trial yet.

191
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,264
Does that mean there might not be a trial?

192
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,392
That's just wrong!

193
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,935
Ma'am, the thing is…

194
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,189
He joined the army to protect the country,
but he was beaten and harassed.

195
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,149
That's why he deserted!

196
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,859
[Jun-mok] Mom, that's enough.

197
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,904
Why isn't anyone taking responsibility?

198
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,325
-[Jun-mok] Please, mom…
-[mother] Say something, will you?

199
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,702
[speaks Hangul]

200
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,331
Well…
[clicks tongue]

201
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,792
The military judge will hold the trial.

202
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,923
And the judge…

203
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:02,054
surely won't reach a verdict

204
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,224
merely for the interest of a certain unit

205
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,393
or personnel.

206
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,728
Nor should he be able to.

207
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,154
[mother] See? What did I tell you?

208
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,364
The world has changed.

209
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,493
It'll all work out.

210
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:29,957
My life's become a lot easier
thanks to you two.

211
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,792
I mean, we live in a different age.

212
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,337
The military police
need to be careful of human rights

213
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,591
and have to make sure
not to offend the soldiers.

214
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,759
This won't help us
develop strong soldiers.

215
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,596
It'll only weaken
the discipline of the military.

216
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,932
If a war breaks out, we won't have
what it takes to carry out a mission.

217
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,772
[commander sighs]

218
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,233
But our unit is different.

219
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,653
You two are doing a great job.

220
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,031
And it makes me feel very reassured.

221
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,909
And that guy who snores.

222
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,744
What was his name again, Captain Lim?

223
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,163
Ah. It's Private Choi Jun-mok.

224
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,498
[commander] Yes, Choi something.

225
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,292
We decided to keep things quiet

226
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,961
about what happened in his unit,
so keep that in mind.

227
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,838
But isn't the issue a bit too serious…

228
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,468
Right.

229
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:26,597
I heard the general there
is being promoted soon.

230
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,265
You taught me another lesson, sir.

231
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,814
Captain Lim.

232
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,941
Yes?

233
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,238
You really need to watch what you say.

234
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,449
Who do you think you are
to talk out of your ass like that?

235
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,662
I'm sorry, sir.

236
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,374
A captain makes decisions
for the entire organization.

237
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,543
[commander] Do you understand?

238
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,836
-Yes, sir.
-[commander] Drink up.

239
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:07,429
-[alarm blares]
-[mysterious music plays]

240
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,439
[man] <i>We were really startled too.</i>

241
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,776
The guys searched the mountain all night
but couldn't find him.

242
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:23,404
Did you notice anything unusual?

243
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,530
Oh.

244
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,241
Our unit is directly controlled
by the army corps.

245
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,035
So it's very important
to keep things clean.

246
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,328
You know how it is.

247
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,747
We train them hard,
so they're too tired to bully anyone.

248
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,916
If anyone loses it,
they might shoot someone.

249
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,335
He was a sergeant,
so no one really messed with him.

250
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,504
And he was picked as a model soldier
two times.

251
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,090
Were there any soldiers
who had issues with Sergeant Heo

252
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,134
or frequently got into arguments with him?

253
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,677
Right.

254
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,512
[comrade 1] Sergeant Heo…

255
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,266
still owes some money at the PX.

256
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,603
Chi-do really loved money.

257
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:59,773
He tore his shoulder muscle,
but he still insisted on rappelling.

258
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,567
"Rappel"?

259
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:06,363
We do helicopter rappel training
four times a year.

260
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:10,868
The soldiers get paid 155,000 won
for training as it's dangerous.

261
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,370
Gosh, I don't know where he spends
all his money.

262
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:17,291
We gathered our paychecks and made a bet.-

263
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,626
What kind of a bet?

264
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,004
[comrade 2] All sorts of stuff.

265
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,090
Soccer. <i>Yut</i>. Guessing who'd come
first place in <i>The Music Trend.</i>

266
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,259
The medical officer warned Chi-do

267
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:32,181
that he could severely hurt his arm
if he rappelled.

268
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,391
[Chi-do's captain chuckle]
But this is what he said.

269
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,852
"What's the probability of that?"

270
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,855
Sergeant Heo was the one
who started the bets.

271
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,149
And he always took everything.

272
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,069
What do you mean?

273
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,198
Oh, well…

274
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,952
Sergeant Heo never lost a bet.

275
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:58,499
[comrade 1] Sergeant Heo,
are you a professional gambler?

276
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,335
By any chance,
is your father Heo Yeong-man?

277
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,254
-"The hand is faster than the eye."
-[comrade 2 sighs]

278
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,591
I always keep a close watch,
but you always win.

279
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,553
I told you we should stop earlier.

280
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,099
How did you get four of a kind?

281
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,851
[comrade 2 sighs]

282
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:18,852
Hey.

283
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,314
You can never beat me.

284
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,067
Do you know why?

285
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,820
Look.

286
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,114
There are three doors.

287
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,785
[Chi-do] If you open the right door,

288
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,705
you get a six-day leave.

289
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,039
Yeong-sik, pick a door.

290
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,379
Okay. Yeong-sik picked door number one.

291
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:50,342
But then, he finds out
that door number three isn't it.

292
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,387
Then let me ask you one more time.

293
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,808
Yeong-sik, will you stick
with door number one?

294
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,394
Or will you switch to door number two?

295
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,610
I'll just stick with the first one.
I don't want to switch.

296
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,737
Why not?

297
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,613
Because I might trick you?

298
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,283
Or because you don't want to switch
to the wrong door?

299
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,202
Gosh, either way, it's a 50-50 chance.

300
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,287
It's one or the other.

301
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,371
[Chi-do] Do you think so?

302
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,459
[deep inhale]
Okay. Here's the answer.

303
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,129
[soldiers shout]

304
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,465
[soldiers speak Hangul]

305
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,384
[Ho-yeol]
They do that just for 150,000 won?

306
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:34,762
[Jun-ho] Of course.

307
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,223
My monthly pay is 122,500 won.

308
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,349
I would never.

309
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,393
Even if they paid me 468,000 won.

310
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,352
Never.

311
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,732
So he used all that money
he worked so hard to save up

312
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,192
and just vanished.

313
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,527
"Vanished"?

314
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,863
Yes, he just took off.

315
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,699
You'd have to be crazy to run away
when you're in the middle of nowhere.

316
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,161
But he seems to be quite rational
from what we heard.

317
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,162
No.

318
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,124
I wouldn't say he's rational.
There's something about him.

319
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,043
He was pretty determined too.

320
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,254
What do you mean?

321
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,007
Okay, listen. Jeong Hyeon-min
went on leave

322
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,384
and didn't return out of impulse

323
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,887
because he was having fun
playing games and drinking.

324
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,806
