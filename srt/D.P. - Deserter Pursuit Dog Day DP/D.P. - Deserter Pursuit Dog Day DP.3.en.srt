[indistinct chatter]

164
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,935
You couldn't possibly afford to come here
with the money you get.

165
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,981
But you're wearing a shiny suit
and you're dressed like a penguin.

166
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,109
You must use your mother's credit card.

167
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,112
I love my mother's credit card.

168
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,072
[in English] A penguin…

169
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,869
[in Hangul]
I heard you're here to assist us.

170
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,079
"Assist"?

171
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:02,208
We're here to help because you've been
struggling to catch this guy.

172
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,335
Ah…

173
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,337
[whispers] Is there a problem?

174
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:07,922
I'm fine.

175
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,468
Okay.
[chuckles]

176
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,678
Seong-gon.

177
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:17,723
We traced his whereabouts
and tried to guess where he went.

178
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,643
Take a look. This is where
Jeong Hyeon-min's father lives.

179
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,312
And this is where his girlfriend lives.

180
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,314
They're busy,

181
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,441
so just keep it short.

182
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,026
I'm sorry, sir.

183
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,696
You just need to go here.

184
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,824
We'll go to his father's place instead.

185
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,660
You're okay with that, right?

186
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,328
Okay, sure. Go ahead.

187
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,497
[Gyu] We'll be off.

188
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,335
Thank you in advance.

189
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,089
-Let's go.
-[Seong-gon] Thank you in advance.

[tranquil music playing in the restaurant]

191
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:54,927
This is annoying.

192
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,139
They must use good beans.

193
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,849
I love the acidity.

194
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,685
Why did you act that way earlier?

195
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,354
Well, you see, I don't like Choco Pies.

196
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,482
But I really craved them
when I was in boot camp.

197
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,902
So I went to church and got one.

198
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,196
But instead of eating it,
I kept it in my locker.

199
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,615
Why do you think I did that?

200
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,368
So I could save it
until the fifth week of training

201
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,954
and have it once it was all over.

202
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,040
But there's this jerk who stole it.

203
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,626
What would you have done?

204
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,670
I would have killed him.

205
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,798
Kim Gyu was that asshole.
But he doesn't remember.

206
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,508
He's one sick son of a bitch.

207
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,885
Hold it in. Stay put.

208
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,804
This is no longer a joke.
We're going to catch Jeong Hyeon-min.

209
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,725
His girlfriend's place
is obviously not important.

Unit 307, Haeundae-gu 432-7, Busan.

211
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,105
It's Jeong Hyeon-min's father's address.
I memorized it.

212
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,025
I'm impressed you caught that.

213
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,818
Let's go get him before they do.

No, I can't. This isn't the NIS.

475
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,326
First, get an interception warrant
for civilians.

476
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,119
It's for a soldier, not a civilian.

And not many, just one.

[exclaims]

485
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,893
What's his name again?

486
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,561
[Gi-yeong] Kim Gyu?

487
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,231
I want mustard sauce.

488
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,150
[Jun-ho] Yes, we just got here, sir.

489
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,444
But are you sure
it's the department store, sir?

490
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:29,116
[Gi-yeong] <i>Yes. Corporal Kim Gyu used
the Wi-Fi there for the last three days.</i>

491
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,076
He came here to do a stakeout?

492
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,452
Not shopping?

493
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,453
Thank you, sir.

494
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,704
Over there.

495
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,501
Hello.

496
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,503
By any chance, have you seen this guy?

497
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,008
Some people came earlier and asked me
a bunch of questions about him.

498
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,553
[woman] What's going on?

499
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,887
So do you know him?

500
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,764
I said I don't know him that well.

501
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,976
He's Yeong-ok's boyfriend,
so I just said hello to him once.

502
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,936
"Yeong-ok"?

503
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,065
Just go.

504
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,608
I'm working right now.

505
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,028
[woman groans]
This is so annoying.

506
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,739
I know it's hard.

507
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,535
My little sister also worked
at a department store.

508
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,786
So I know how hard it is.

509
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,289
I figured you might need it.

510
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,670
It's waterproof.

511
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,429
Thank you.

512
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,848
Don't mention it. Thank you for this.

513
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,187
So Mun Yeong-ok
is Jeong Hyeon-min's girlfriend?

514
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,188
Yes.

515
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:46,401
Yeong-ok used to work here too,
but she took a long leave.

516
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,529
-She won't answer her phone either.
-[clicks tongue]

517
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,657
You said you met Jeong Hyeon-min once.
Where did you meet him?

518
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,119
Oh, well…

519
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,624
A shop.

520
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,376
What shop?

521
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,797
Well, you know where people drink

522
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:09,925
and sing…

523
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,761
-Ah…
-[woman] Mm.

524
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,888
With guys.

525
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,729
[woman] <i>This job can be pretty stressful,
so we sometimes go to relieve our stress.</i>

526
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,524
<i>That night, after a team dinner,
we were deciding where to go.</i>

527
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,027
<i>Then Yeong-ok told us to follow her.</i>

528
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,405
[host 1] That's just wrong. Yes.

529
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,574
[Ho-yeol] Right, does anyone know him?

530
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,785
Okay.

531
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,871
[host 1] Yes, of course. You're right.

532
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,457
Isn't this Hyeon?

533
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,793
-It's Hyeon.
-No, not today.

534
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,670
-Hey, Jjang-gu.
-Yes, okay.

535
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,880
-Weren't you close with Hyeon?
-I love you.

536
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,632
[host 1] Hyeon? What about him?

537
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,510
We're looking for him,
but it's very hard to reach him.

538
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,804
-He's like that. He's a grasshopper.
-"A grasshopper"?

539
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,057
He doesn't work for just one bar.
He freelances here and there.

540
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,852
Do you happen to know her?
Her name is Mun Yeong-ok.

541
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:04,980

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,235
Hey, this girl…

544
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,113
She's the one Hyeon tried to con.

545
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,950
She bought him a used car, paid his rent,
and even promised to wait

546
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:20,620
until he was discharged from the army.
I think she even paid off his prepayment.

547
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,913
[chuckles]
His prepayment.

548
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,833
[host 1] Where does she get all that money
working at a department store?

549
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,336
[host 3] I just don't get why anyone
would do something like that.

[Ho-yeol]
<i>Jeong Hyeon-min is a real asshole.</i>

He's not an asshole. He's trash.

Yes, he's trash.

Hey, Jun-ho.

554
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,763
My back hurts so much.
Can we go to a dry sauna first?

555
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,724
-There are 22.
-What? Dry saunas?

556
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,018
Host bars in Haeundae.

557
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,772
He freelances, so I'm sure
he's working in one of these bars.

558
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,149
Okay, let's go.

559

Of course. What else can we do?

Mun Yeong-ok is head over heels
for Jeong Hyeon-min.

Do you think she'll gladly guide
two D.P. soldiers

to where her boyfriend is hiding
if we ask her where he is?

You got us in this mess,
so you'd better take responsibility.
