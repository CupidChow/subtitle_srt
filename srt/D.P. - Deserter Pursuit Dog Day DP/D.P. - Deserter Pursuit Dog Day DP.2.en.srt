from the noodles,

I was sick, you see.

269
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,113
I had problems breathing,
so I went to the medical corps,

Deserters tend to be hooked on video games

or hopeless romantics who have
to send emails to their girlfriends.

00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,417
But in order to do that,
we need to visit each firm,

we need to access this site

What kind of a fool would use his own ID

after having deserted from the army?

376
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,947
They create new IDs
using other people's information.

Then what do you think we need to do

I don't talk to him."

None of that matters.
Just question everyone.

Why do you think we should?

386
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,310
To predict what the deserter
might have done?

387
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,769
No. Wrong answer.

388
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,397
Deserters don't do the things
they normally do

389
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,316
or things that are predictable.

390
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,068
They intuitively know that it's dangerous.

I sometimes go to church
with my friends to play table tennis,

My dream is to become a public servant,
and my nickname is Acorn Jelly."

Why "Acorn Jelly"?

533
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,629
Because of his name

534
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,923
and because he has no personality.

The general asked us to plant them.

807
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,284
He thinks the barracks look too deserted.

00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,286
Where did you get that tree?

809

Well…

You're a special forces soldier.
Why can't you do this properly?

815
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:35,219
I want you to dig a hole,
not caress the damn soil.

816
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,596
-How is this so hard?

[Jun-ho] Do you want one?

831
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,931
