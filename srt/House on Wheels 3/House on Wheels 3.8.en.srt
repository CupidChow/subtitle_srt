1
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:27,328
(Swaying)

2
00:00:28,598 --> 00:00:33,127
(The color of autumn brightens their mood today.)

3
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:34,967
(Exclaiming)

4
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,097
The autumn foliage...

5
00:00:36,098 --> 00:00:37,898
I know, right?

6
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:43,438
(Meeting the autumn air by rolling the window down)

7
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:45,207
(Inhaling)

8
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:47,278
The air feels different.

9
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,348
(Inhaling)

10
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,617
(Exhaling)

11
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:54,018
(The fresh smell of autumn greets them.)

12
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:58,427
They're yellow, red, brown, and green.

13
00:00:58,658 --> 00:00:59,687
Exactly.

14
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:01,756
(Naerin Stream flows.)

15
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:03,257
There's even a stream.

16
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:05,268
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

17
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,798
(Naerin Stream flows.)

18
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:10,396
The colors...

19
00:01:10,397 --> 00:01:12,407
on our way there are so...

20
00:01:12,408 --> 00:01:13,437
It's beautiful.

21
00:01:15,507 --> 00:01:17,877
Doesn't that look like a painting?

22
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,378
Right?

23
00:01:20,577 --> 00:01:21,817
Where are we?

24
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:23,947
We're in Korea.

25
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:25,516
(We're in Nae-myeon, Hongcheon-gun.)

26
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:26,948
South Korea!

27
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:29,017
(Clapping)

28
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:31,157
(You guys are cute.)

29
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:33,827
- This is unbelievable.
- Over there...

30
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:37,258
The colors are insane.

31
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:41,198
- And the mist behind it.
- Exactly. The mist.

32
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:44,467
The mist swallowed the mountain.

33
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:47,508
He said the mist swallowed the mountain.

34
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:48,838
(Amazed)

35
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:50,436
His expressions, right?

36
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:51,606
It's autumn.

37
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:53,678
Now that it's autumn...

38
00:01:56,077 --> 00:01:59,687
(The big brother who's absorbed in the autumn vibe)

39
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:01,717
(Impressed)

40
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:04,417
(Exclaiming)

41
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:05,788
Those colors.

42
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:08,428
(Looking around)

43
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,868
(Youngest is busy appreciating the autumn view.)

44
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:16,097
Youngest doesn't know where to put his eyes.

45
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,668
Because it's so gorgeous.

46
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:21,237
They're all... How should I put it?

47
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:24,937
I like how the mountains are meanderingly bent.

48
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:26,648
He said, "Meanderingly."

49
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:31,148
Now that it's autumn, your expressions sound...

50
00:02:31,787 --> 00:02:33,147
like those from a literature textbook.

51
00:02:33,148 --> 00:02:36,458
(They describe things like on a textbook.)

52
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,858
Play some songs that suit the fall, Youngest.

53
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,657
- There's that autumn song.
- Which one?

54
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,328
"Leisure"...

55
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:47,328
- What?
- "Leisure" something.

56
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:50,966
It's a song by Bank. It goes, "Autumn..."

57
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:53,337
- "Legends of the Fall"?
- Yes, "Legends of the Fall."

58
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:55,138
- Is that a song? I don't know.
- By Bank.

59
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:57,678
I think you'll know. It's very famous.

60
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,446
("Legends of the Fall" by Bank)

61
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:00,808
(You know it, right?)

62
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,416
Turn up the volume. I want to be immersed.

63
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,717
(The big brother wants to be immersed in autumn.)

64
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:08,087
I haven't listened to this song for so long.

65
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,417
(A distant look)

66
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:18,398
(Driving across the autumn mountains while listening to an autumn song)

67
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:23,197
Before I knew it.

68
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:30,238
(I'm walking alone into those memories)

69
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,777
This is the first time Hee Won ever hummed a song.

70
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:36,577
Because I believe in our promise.

71
00:03:36,578 --> 00:03:38,888
(Pulling out his hair)

72
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,387
But

73
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,858
I can't hit these high notes.

74
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:46,058
(He still feels happy.)

75
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,156
Don't be sorry.

76
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:49,256
"Don't be sorry".

77
00:03:49,257 --> 00:03:53,167
(The family members are pleased to hear Hee Won's humming.)

78
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:57,604
(While the three are immersed in autumn, )

79
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:01,472
(House on Wheels 3 drives on a winding road...)

80
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:05,644
(over the mountains and across the water.)

81
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:08,926
We might get to North Korea at this rate.

82
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:09,966
I know, right?

83
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:12,335
(Oh, right!)

84
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,537
When will the guests arrive today?

85
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:17,737
- The guests?
- Yes.

86
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:20,736
It's so far away and deep in the mountains,

87
00:04:20,737 --> 00:04:22,645
so I doubt they'll get here on time.

88
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:23,677
(They forgot about the guests for a moment.)

89
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:27,246
(Calling them right away)

90
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:29,246
- Hi, Dong Il.
- Hey, it's me.

91
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:32,357
- Where are you?
- I'm...

92
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:35,686
on my way to the destination with the house. You?

93
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:38,142
- I'm also on my way.
- Yes?

94
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:41,597
But the winding road is unending.

95
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:44,466
- Right. If you keep going, - Yes?

96
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:47,737
you'll see a North Korean checkpoint. Show them your ID.

97
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:49,537
- Really?
- Yes.

98
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:52,075
Then you need to write the immigration papers.

99
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:53,436
That's how we get there.

100
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:55,646
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

101
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:57,676
It's so far away.

102
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:59,146
(He believed that?)

103
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:01,146
It sounds nice, though.

104
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:02,217
It does?

105
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:06,255
(Today's guest will be fun to trick.)

106
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:07,616
And...

107
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:10,487
you can tell them who you are when you get there.

108
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:13,027
- All right.
- Bye.

109
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:16,467
- He's hiding his identity, right?
- What?

110
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,266
- Is he hiding who he is?
- Do you all know?

111
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:21,667
- I could tell from his voice.
- Exactly.

112
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:23,266
Is that so?

113
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,336
I'm always a little slow.

114
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:26,375
(I was the only naive one.)

115
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:27,777
And the second guest.

116
00:05:28,136 --> 00:05:30,446
(Who is it this time?)

117
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:31,805
Hello, Dong Il.

118
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:34,016
Hi.

119
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,946
How has your voice never changed?

120
00:05:38,857 --> 00:05:40,786
- Goodness.
- Thank you.

121
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:41,816
You're so cheerful.

122
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,527
Are you on your way?

123
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:45,926
Yes, I'm on my way.

124
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:48,756
The road is very curvy here.

125
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:51,796
It's curvy right now,

126
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:53,635
- Right?
- but when will it stop being curvy?

127
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:56,866
Well, I told the other guest who was coming today.

128
00:05:57,436 --> 00:05:59,406
You'll be inspected at a North Korean checkpoint.

129
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:00,706
(He's at it again.)

130
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:04,407
What? I don't think I got past it yet.

131
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:06,746
You'll see a checkpoint. The North Korean soldiers...

132
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:08,417
will ask for your ID.

133
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:10,886
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

134
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,056
- But I didn't bring my ID card.
- I'm sure they'll know who you are.

135
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:16,755
Anyway, don't rush.

136
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:17,885
- Don't rush.
- I'll get there somehow.

137
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:20,055
- Okay. Drive safely.
- I will.

138
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:22,196
- All right? Bye.
- Okay.

139
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:26,135
- They all seem to believe you.
- I think so too.

140
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,136
(I was thinking the same thing.)

141
00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:29,806
This is how high my credit is, Hee Won.

142
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,136
You're regretting things, aren't you?

143
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:33,936
But they'll figure it out after spending a night here.

144
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:36,376
Just one night.

145
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,546
I was so surprised...

146
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:41,047
that they believed the North Korean checkpoint joke.

147
00:06:42,347 --> 00:06:46,917
(This man who's easily tricked by Dong Il)

148
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:49,186
(Who is it?)

149
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:53,956
(He and Dong Il were like brothers on "The Fugitive: Plan B".)

150
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:58,667
(Actor Jung Ji Hoon visited at the right time.)

151
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:03,435
(And another guest who came with Ji Hoon!)

152
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:04,506
(Who?)

153
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:06,136
(Long time no see.)

154
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:10,177
(Actress UIe who acted with Dong Il on "Jeon Woo-chi")

155
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:12,076
(I was on my way to see you on House on Wheels.)

156
00:07:12,477 --> 00:07:14,547
(Excited)

157
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:19,487
(The two welcome guests are coming.)

158
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:24,826
How beautiful will it be when we get there?

159
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:26,037
(They keep going with full hearts.)

160
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:28,867
"Ginkgo Forest Road".

161
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:30,337
(The signpost guides them to the front yard.)

162
00:07:30,837 --> 00:07:33,107
There are ginkgo trees.

163
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:36,247
(A gingko forest)

164
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:40,217
Look at that. On the trees...

165
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:42,218
(The road to the front yard is surrounded by trees.)

166
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:45,517
(Looking forward to it)

167
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:50,057
(Past the maple trees, )

168
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:52,086
It's beautiful, right?

169
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:53,157
(the ginkgo tree road greets them.)

170
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:54,197
Check out the trees.

171
00:07:55,705 --> 00:07:57,705
They're all...

172
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:00,845
- ginkgo trees.
- It's a ginkgo forest.

173
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:04,543
(The ginkgo tree road puts them in awe.)

174
00:08:04,544 --> 00:08:06,513
- This is...
- I know, right?

175
00:08:06,514 --> 00:08:08,384
The straight road is so pretty.

176
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,054
- It's such a pretty road.
- It is.

177
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:13,284
It's unbelievably beautiful.

178
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:18,325
(Approximately 2,000 ginkgo trees grow here.)

179
00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:21,825
(And the maple trees surround the forest.)

180
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:28,335
(The sunlight through the branches warms the house.)

181
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,434
(The ginkgo leaves that colored the fall yellow)

182
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:33,244
It's all yellow.

183
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,863
(They fell one by one due to the autumn wind...)

184
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:46,743
(and dyed the earth gold to create a picture.)

185
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:49,942
(As you walk in the woods, )

186
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:54,513
(you see a small treehouse straight out of a fairy tale.)

187
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:58,383
(A different type of rest to be enjoyed amidst those)

188
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:02,452
(A place where you can feel the composure of rest)

189
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:07,792
(This is today's front yard, Hongcheon Ginkgo Forest.)

190
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:12,292
It's rare to see a ginkgo forest without any ginkgo leaves.

191
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:14,003
- Right.
- Am I right?

192
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:17,252
If it rained a little,

193
00:09:17,253 --> 00:09:19,692
it would be another great sight.

194
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:22,722
It's just like what we talked about.

195
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:25,323
Right. It's lonesome.

196
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:26,993
Lonesome.

197
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:31,363
Okay.

198
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:32,832
(They successfully moved into the center of autumn.)

199
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:33,872
Okay.

200
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:34,873
(They successfully moved into the center of autumn.)

201
00:09:35,772 --> 00:09:37,072
Bring the gloves.

202
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:38,302
(Safely filmed with the permission from the landowner)

203
00:09:39,073 --> 00:09:40,171
Gloves.

204
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:42,012
(Youngest goes to get gloves.)

205
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,511
We won't have to set up the tarp today, right?

206
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:45,641
(There are no falling leaves.)

207
00:09:45,642 --> 00:09:48,052
We should because of the dew.

208
00:09:49,052 --> 00:09:51,651
Fine. Let's set up the tarp since the leaves will fall.

209
00:09:51,652 --> 00:09:52,992
(Laughing)

210
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,152
There aren't any leaves to fall.

211
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,362
- Myoung, hold the other end.
- Okay.

212
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,592
(Setting up the tarp before the leaves fall)

213
00:09:58,593 --> 00:09:59,593
Hang it.

214
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:01,762
(Setting up the tarp before the leaves fall)

215
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,502
It's cold, touching the steel.

216
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:06,902
- Of course, it is.
- Yes.

217
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,733
It's cold out.

218
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:12,203
Right. No wonder the ginkgo leaves couldn't stand it.

219
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:13,712
(Laughing)

220
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:14,713
It's freezing.

221
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:19,552
(Standing)

222
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,753
We should build the fire first today.

223
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:26,092
- It's chilly.
- Because it's chilly.

224
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,151
(They need the bonfire early on as it's chilly.)

225
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:29,792
(Struggling)

226
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:32,791
(Building the fire first for the guests to feel warm)

227
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,593
Let's try welcoming them warmly today.

228
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:38,463
Wow.

229
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:40,132
The sun is shining.

230
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:43,242
We're done setting it up, so it should.

231
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,603
(The gloomy weather...)

232
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:48,872
(turns into warm rays of autumn sunlight...)

233
00:10:48,873 --> 00:10:49,911
Okay. Good.

234
00:10:49,912 --> 00:10:52,412
(as if it's welcoming House on Wheels.)

235
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,323
(The quick-witted youngest...)

236
00:10:58,182 --> 00:11:02,392
(is making hot coffee for the older ones.)

237
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,892
(Meanwhile, they're...)

238
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:06,561
What do we talk about in fall?

239
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:07,633
- In fall?
- Yes.

240
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:09,662
- Death.
- Death?

241
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:11,532
Parting.

242
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,532
- When we talk with our guests?
- Yes.

243
00:11:15,003 --> 00:11:16,171
Don't you think it's too heavy?

244
00:11:16,172 --> 00:11:18,242
- What about emptiness?
- Emptiness?

245
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:19,243
Something like that.

246
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:22,072
Why do we end up talking about these things?

247
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:23,483
It's a nice autumn day.

248
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:25,781
Look at those leaves falling!

249
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:28,012
(Look at those leaves falling!)

250
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:30,551
Don't you think this place is so cool, Dong Il?

251
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:32,552
- It is.
- Right? The ground is...

252
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:36,291
It's nice that there are fallen leaves on the ground.

253
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:37,323
I know.

254
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:40,691
It's beautiful and nice.

255
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:42,262
(It's beautiful and nice.)

256
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,301
Come here.

257
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:46,372
- I'll make you a man of autumn.
- What?

258
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,472
Come here.

259
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,703
- I don't want to be one.
- Just come.

260
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:52,002
- Come.
- Why do you want to do that?

261
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,073
Just come here.

262
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,142
Stand here. Wait.

263
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:58,282
I think this will work.

264
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:01,312
(Shaking)

265
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:04,723
"Dong Il! Don't go!"

266
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:11,392
(Dong Il whom I love...)

267
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:14,463
(Hee Won...)

268
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:16,463
Okay. Stop it now.

269
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:20,031
(Sulking)

270
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,742
Dong Il, these leaves are on the tree even in this cold weather.

271
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:25,243
I'm sure they will be on it through the whole winter.

272
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,712
They're hanging in there in this cold.

273
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,681
They'll be on it through this winter.

274
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,682
- I see.
- Yes.

275
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:34,311
(The coffee is ready just in time.)

276
00:12:34,312 --> 00:12:35,682
Coffee is ready.

277
00:12:36,552 --> 00:12:37,752
(Thanks, Myoung.)

278
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:40,623
(Steam rises from the coffee.)

279
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:44,421
(The big brother takes a sip too.)

280
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:46,391
- This is nice, right?
- It's so nice.

281
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:49,302
- It's so good.
- What's your favorite season?

282
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:52,573
My favorite season is...

283
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,233
- Summer.
- That's right.

284
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,671
Do you know how I got it right?

285
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:58,602
- You enjoy many sports in summer.
- That's right.

286
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:00,573
Hee Won wouldn't have known it if you had asked him.

287
00:13:01,243 --> 00:13:02,441
(Are you talking about me?)

288
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:04,612
I'm not interested in someone who will leave us.

289
00:13:04,613 --> 00:13:08,012
(I'm not interested in someone who will leave us.)

290
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:13,022
(This is about what had happened a few days ago.)

291
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:16,161
(The news about Myoung's enlistment was released.)

292
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,292
("Gong Myoung Will Join the Military")

293
00:13:18,593 --> 00:13:20,791
I'm not interested in someone who will leave us.

294
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:22,603
(Hee Won is already getting ready to let him go.)

295
00:13:22,963 --> 00:13:25,363
I won't be waiting for you.

296
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:28,272
I'm a person who finds someone else right away.

297
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:29,503
So take care and come back safely.

298
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:30,641
- I will.
- Okay.

299
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:33,141
At least he's telling you to come back.

300
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:34,542
Not just take care.

301
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:36,583
It will only hurt my feelings if I care about you.

302
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:38,042
Just take care.

303
00:13:39,213 --> 00:13:41,282
Look at him tearing up.

304
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:42,681
He burst into tears.

305
00:13:42,682 --> 00:13:44,281
(Crying)

306
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,922
(Laughing)

307
00:13:47,753 --> 00:13:50,223
(Getting up)

308
00:13:50,823 --> 00:13:53,562
(He takes his favorite camera.)

309
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,761
Today's not a good day. It's a gloomy day.

310
00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:58,863
- My goodness.
- Why are you only taking his photo?

311
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:01,233
I took your photo already.

312
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,473
(Take a photo of me too.)

313
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:06,912
(Taking photos)

314
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:08,243
Yes.

315
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:10,883
(A photo that Dong Il got after begging)

316
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:12,713
I will take one for you.

317
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:16,122
- Dong Il, am I in it too?
- You're in it too.

318
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,182
- You're in.
- Wait a second.

319
00:14:18,052 --> 00:14:20,093
I should turn up my collar since it's fall.

320
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:22,723
(Extremely cool)

321
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,622
But the focus is on Myoung, okay?

322
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:26,192
- Okay.
- In 1, 2, 3.

323
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:30,062
(The focus is on Hee Won who closed his eyes.)

324
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,902
Is my collar turned up okay?

325
00:14:33,402 --> 00:14:35,431
- Yes.
- The hood is...

326
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:37,002
Why are you taking his photo again?

327
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:39,171
The hood covered my collar.

328
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:40,941
(Another photo for Dong Il)

329
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:43,282
(Cute)

330
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:45,642
(Laughing)

331
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:47,181
(With the members who Myoung likes)

332
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:49,052
This is so good.

333
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:51,982
It's the most beautiful time of the year, colorwise.

334
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:53,021
Yes.

335
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:55,022
(The fall they enjoy in their front yard)

336
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:58,962
You'll join the military without giving us the photos, right?

337
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:01,892
(While the house owners are enjoying taking photos...)

338
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:07,801
(On the soft ginkgo leaf carpet...)

339
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:09,073
The weather is so nice.

340
00:15:11,302 --> 00:15:13,572
It's nice to come out like this.

341
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:14,613
That's right.

342
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,083
- Need a hand?
- No need at all.

343
00:15:19,113 --> 00:15:20,182
Not at all.

344
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:22,112
- I should help you, right?
- It's okay.

345
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:23,252
(Today's guests, UIe and Jung Ji Hoon)

346
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:25,051
I have something important in here.

347
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:26,723
- In there?
- Yes.

348
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:30,191
(Ji Hoon packed a lot in his cart.)

349
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:32,162
(Is it okay?)

350
00:15:33,262 --> 00:15:34,761
(They find the House on Wheels.)

351
00:15:34,762 --> 00:15:35,762
We're here.

352
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:37,863
What should I do? I'm nervous.

353
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:40,902
Hello.

354
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:44,742
(Surprised)

355
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:45,743
They're here?

356
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:47,843
UIe.

357
00:15:47,844 --> 00:15:48,873
(They're here?)

358
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:51,343
- Hello.
- Hello.

359
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:53,051
- Ji Hoon is here too.
- Is it Ji Hoon?

360
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,113
- Yes.
- Hello.

361
00:15:55,383 --> 00:15:57,182
- It's been a while.
- How long has it been?

362
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,691
(How long has it been?)

363
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:01,853
You've been doing well, right?

364
00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:05,522
- How have you been, Hee Won?
- It's been a while.

365
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,761
Myoung! How were you?

366
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:10,362
- Yes.
- You've become more handsome.

367
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:11,633
(Shy)

368
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:15,333
(It's been a while, Ji Hoon.)

369
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:16,572
- Hello.
- Hello.

370
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:18,572
- Hello.
- Hello.

371
00:16:18,573 --> 00:16:20,441
- Hello.
- Isn't he Rain?

372
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:21,511
Yes, I am.

373
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:23,312
Rain who does this and that.

374
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:24,313
Well...

375
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:28,612
(He's so excited to see him.)

376
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,282
- Welcome.
- Let us unpack our things first.

377
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,353
Okay.

378
00:16:32,523 --> 00:16:33,751
(Gosh. It's so pretty.)

379
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:34,823
It's so pretty.

380
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:37,691
(Amazed)

381
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:38,722
Wait, let me...

382
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:40,532
- Give that to me.
- Thank you, Ji Hoon.

383
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,191
Are you guys moving in or something?

384
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:43,563
(They already pushed in a lot of luggage.)

385
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:45,862
What is that you brought with you?

386
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:47,172
It's something interesting.

387
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:49,843
- Gosh. This is...
- This is so interesting.

388
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,641
What's this?

389
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:54,072
Well, this is nothing special.

390
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:55,442
But I need your help.

391
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,651
(What did he bring?)

392
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:00,812
But I need your help.

393
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:03,883
(What is this mysterious chunk that he packed tightly?)

394
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:06,452
(Surprised)

395
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:07,652
- My goodness.
- This is...

396
00:17:08,323 --> 00:17:10,092
(Myoung is frozen.)

397
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:11,363
This is Korean beef.

398
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:14,162
(Her eyes become wide open.)

399
00:17:14,863 --> 00:17:15,991
(It even made Dong Il surprised.)

400
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:17,303
My goodness.

401
00:17:17,962 --> 00:17:19,462
It's beef ribs.

402
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,431
(Ji Hoon's surprise gift)

403
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:24,772
(Whole beef ribs)

404
00:17:24,773 --> 00:17:27,842
I had this, and it made me dumbfounded.

405
00:17:27,843 --> 00:17:28,873
(It looks like this when it's unpacked.)

406
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:33,583
I brought one part of oblique muscle of abdomen from a Korean cow.

407
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,711
(He brought beef ribs as a whole?)

408
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:36,853
Ji Hoon, this is...

409
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,593
He got really big hands.

410
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,063
You see this? Can you see the meat here?

411
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:46,161
This part is...

412
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:47,532
(Two people can barely lift it.)

413
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:51,303
If you see here... These are beef ribs.

414
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,832
We can have this later.

415
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,032
(The whole beef ribs are huge.)

416
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:58,373
For dinner, I will cut them and grill them for you.

417
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,441
You don't need anything for this. Just eat it with salt.

418
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:02,612
(When they are impressed by Ji Hoon's gift...)

419
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:04,212
Then it will taste like milk.

420
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:07,082
(This person is somewhat worried.)

421
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,083
Goodness.

422
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:11,822
- It's one part of a cow, right?
- That's right.

423
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:14,853
Yes, but not the whole part.

424
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:17,421
(This is so nice, but...)

425
00:18:17,422 --> 00:18:19,323
The grade is two plus.

426
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:22,492
This is the best part.

427
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,763
- I should've opened mine first.
- So we will...

428
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:27,471
- This is crazy.
- I should've opened mine first.

429
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:30,441
(What she had in mind came out.)

430
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,602
I should have opened my gift first.

431
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:33,211
- She said she should've gone first.
- My gosh.

432
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,873
- This is...
- Who can go after this?

433
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:39,553
(I'm just so happy, that's all.)

434
00:18:40,113 --> 00:18:43,922
(What did UIe, who's worried, bring?)

435
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:45,822
(Let's talk after sitting comfortably.)

436
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:46,852
- Let's have a seat.
- Okay.

437
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:48,952
Come here. You can sit here.

438
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:52,161
Ji Hoon, that's too much.

439
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:53,691
No. That's not too much.

440
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:55,132
- It is.
- Is that so?

441
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:58,103
Even we can't prepare something like that for our guests.

442
00:18:58,502 --> 00:18:59,671
That looks so good.

443
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,941
I've been seeing you often lately,

444
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,872
but it's been a while since I met Hee Won.

445
00:19:04,873 --> 00:19:06,201
(He met him in 3 years.)

446
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:09,241
Myoung is actually my traveling partner.

447
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:10,283
Really?

448
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,911
We got the Open Water Diver Certification together.

449
00:19:12,912 --> 00:19:13,951
- We got it together.
- You did?

450
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,211
We got it together.

451
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:16,353
(They got the certification together.)

452
00:19:16,883 --> 00:19:18,482
So we go on a trip together.

453
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:23,692
And UIe has a tiring schedule these days.

454
00:19:23,922 --> 00:19:26,191
And I only slept like 2 or 3 hours yesterday.

455
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:27,192
- Right.
- Right.

456
00:19:27,193 --> 00:19:29,862
We should have something good for our bodies.

457
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:31,633
So I brought tuna roe.

458
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,502
I brought it.

459
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:38,141
So I will slice it thinly later...

460
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:39,242
(They can't wait to have dinner today.)

461
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:42,343
(This is for the members of House on Wheels.)

462
00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:43,941
(It's Ji Hoon's performance that no one has ever seen before.)

463
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:45,543
(Everyone is focusing on him.)

464
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:48,112
(He opens.)

465
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:50,282
(He cuts.)

466
00:19:50,283 --> 00:19:52,582
(He grills.)

467
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,853
(He feeds.)

468
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:58,222
(This is so delicious.)

469
00:19:58,793 --> 00:20:01,962
(He will be in charge of today's dinner.)

470
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:05,202
(You can trust me today!)

471
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:07,872
Oh, right. You should have some coffee.

472
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,931
- You should have some coffee.
- Have a seat.

473
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:11,141
- But...
- Guests shouldn't work.

474
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:12,401
I brought some apples.

475
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:13,472
- You did?
- Really?

476
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:15,711
Do we have to peel the apples?

477
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:16,812
I will do it.

478
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:17,941
- Really?
- Don't do that.

479
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:19,681
- We will do it.
- No, I can...

480
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:22,212
- No. Just sit here.
- I should give them my gift.

481
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:24,882
I should give them my gift.

482
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:25,952
(He sits right away.)

483
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:29,451
- The beef made her intimidated.
- I brought a gift too.

484
00:20:29,452 --> 00:20:30,991
- I'm sorry.
- My gosh.

485
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:33,231
The beef made her intimidated.

486
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,232
I'm sorry.

487
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,862
- Ji Hoon. Mine is so small.
- It's okay.

488
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:38,501
This is really small compared to his gift.

489
00:20:38,502 --> 00:20:39,562
We're not comparing or anything.

490
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:41,902
Since you brought up apples...

491
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:44,941
I made some wooden forks.

492
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:47,211
- My gosh.
- This one has your name on it.

493
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,472
It has my initials on it. "DI".

494
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:50,842
- This is for you, Myoung.
- Thank you.

495
00:20:50,843 --> 00:20:52,981
- Thank you.
- And since we're guests,

496
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:55,112
and there will be more guests, so these have no names on them.

497
00:20:55,113 --> 00:20:58,853
We'll use them and leave them here.

498
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:03,692
(Curious)

499
00:21:03,823 --> 00:21:05,721
Gosh. I wonder what it looks like.

500
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,732
- Did you make it yourself?
- I did.

501
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:12,502
Goodness. This is so cute.

502
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:15,172
(She's relieved.)

503
00:21:16,002 --> 00:21:17,741
(We're a couple.)

504
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:20,442
I guess every family runs a carpentry shop these days.

505
00:21:20,972 --> 00:21:22,141
Families of actors.

506
00:21:22,142 --> 00:21:23,313
(Feeling proud)

507
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,512
(Gong Myoung, Dong Il, Hee Won)

508
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:28,783
(Cute wooden forks that UIe made herself)

509
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:31,422
Here. This is a gift too.

510
00:21:31,752 --> 00:21:33,991
- Is this a cutting board?
- No, it's not a cutting board.

511
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,662
- It seemed you already had one.
- Right. What is it?

512
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,461
This one is pretty too.

513
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:40,232
(It's carefully wrapped.)

514
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:43,432
(Surprised)

515
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:45,063
I hope you like it.

516
00:21:46,303 --> 00:21:48,202
(Curious)

517
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:51,401
- I really wanted to have this.
- Really?

518
00:21:51,402 --> 00:21:53,171
- I mean it. I'm so surprised.
- I'm glad to hear it.

519
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:55,112
Did she carve our faces on it?

520
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,442
You're completely wrong.

521
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,612
You're completely wrong.

522
00:21:58,613 --> 00:21:59,613
(UIe's second gift)

523
00:21:59,614 --> 00:22:00,912
That is so pretty.

524
00:22:01,452 --> 00:22:04,882
I heard many people use billboards when they camp.

525
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:05,921
That's right.

526
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:07,322
I brought many small gifts.

527
00:22:07,323 --> 00:22:10,063
- My grandmother grew these.
- These are so nice.

528
00:22:10,523 --> 00:22:12,062
You brought so many gifts.

529
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:14,661
- My mom made these scouring pads.
- Scouring pads?

530
00:22:14,662 --> 00:22:16,362
It seemed like you used them often here. These are all I have.

531
00:22:16,363 --> 00:22:18,103
- We can use these.
- I don't have anything else now.

532
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:19,971
- These are all small gifts.
- I love this.

533
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,401
- These are great. So pretty.
- Thank you.

534
00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:24,201
- They are thoughtful gifts.
- Right.

535
00:22:24,202 --> 00:22:25,802
(They are thoughtful gifts.)

536
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:29,043
In fact... I'm not saying this because of Jung Hoon.

537
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:31,181
Food goes to waste if we eat it,

538
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:33,251
but this is something we can keep.

539
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:34,782
Ji Hoon will get upset.

540
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:37,652
- I'm okay. I don't care at all.
- Ji Hoon.

541
00:22:38,053 --> 00:22:40,823
I'll have some good food and have fun here.

542
00:22:41,222 --> 00:22:43,123
(That's Ji Hoon I know.)

543
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:46,491
- Ule, have you met Hee Won?
- I've never met him before.

544
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:48,292
- What do you think about him?
- Yes?

545
00:22:48,293 --> 00:22:50,702
- Be honest. There's no need to lie.
- That's right.

546
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,062
If you don't like his face,

547
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:54,971
you can say that.

548
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:56,272
- Or you can say he seems nice.
- But we first met today.

549
00:22:56,273 --> 00:22:59,502
I guess it'd be okay to say that she doesn't like my face?

550
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:01,773
(They burst into laughter)

551
00:23:02,573 --> 00:23:03,612
I'm fine with that.

552
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:04,681
(He wants to look strong.)

553
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:05,912
Be honest. What do you think about him?

554
00:23:06,313 --> 00:23:08,282
He seems...

555
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:11,152
It's okay. You can say it. We're here for you.

556
00:23:11,652 --> 00:23:12,823
Well...

557
00:23:13,023 --> 00:23:14,553
(Curious)

558
00:23:14,992 --> 00:23:17,293
(Expectant)

559
00:23:17,692 --> 00:23:19,863
(We met for the first time. What do I do?)

560
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,731
He doesn't seem bad, but he doesn't seem nice either.

561
00:23:23,732 --> 00:23:24,732
(He doesn't seem nice either.)

562
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,302
He doesn't seem nice either.

563
00:23:26,303 --> 00:23:28,432
(I see.)

564
00:23:29,002 --> 00:23:32,202
(UIe's honest answer makes everyone laugh.)

565
00:23:32,902 --> 00:23:33,911
But...

566
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,211
(She feels sorry.)

567
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:38,042
She doesn't hate my face at least. That's a good thing.

568
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:39,981
It would have been worse.

569
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:40,982
(It wasn't bad.)

570
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:42,353
I'm flustered.

571
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:43,353
(I hope we get along well.)

572
00:23:43,354 --> 00:23:44,721
Then...

573
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:47,251
- Let's eat. Okay.
- I'll prepare apples. Please wait.

574
00:23:47,252 --> 00:23:48,323
Hold on.

575
00:23:49,023 --> 00:23:50,792
I should wash my hands first.

576
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:52,492
(He goes into the kitchen right away.)

577
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:54,492
Gosh. This is...

578
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,932
- I've only seen this on TV.
- Right.

579
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:01,803
- Now that I'm here, it's so cozy.
- It's nice.

580
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:04,343
(Glad)

581
00:24:04,972 --> 00:24:08,642
(Our house is even prettier when you see it up close.)

582
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,083
(Interested)

583
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:15,412
(He carefully washes his hands first.)

584
00:24:16,883 --> 00:24:18,451
(Taking out his stuff)

585
00:24:18,452 --> 00:24:20,093
- Why did you bring so many things?
- I...

586
00:24:20,952 --> 00:24:24,523
I have a big build, you know.

587
00:24:25,462 --> 00:24:26,891
(Interested, focused)

588
00:24:26,892 --> 00:24:27,992
What is he doing?

589
00:24:28,863 --> 00:24:32,202
(From Ji Hoon's bag)

590
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:34,302
That one is great.

591
00:24:34,303 --> 00:24:35,633
(Something comes out.)

592
00:24:36,273 --> 00:24:40,813
(Many new things will come out of his bag.)

593
00:24:42,873 --> 00:24:44,842
- When guests come here, - Yes.

594
00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:46,981
we don't let them work. They just sit back and relax.

595
00:24:46,982 --> 00:24:48,211
- Really?
- Right.

596
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:50,353
- You're our guest.
- This would be enough.

597
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:55,123
(He's the first guest to work in the kitchen upon arrival.)

598
00:24:56,152 --> 00:25:00,492
(Ji Hoon skillfully peels...)

599
00:25:00,763 --> 00:25:03,161
(the apples he brought from home.)

600
00:25:03,162 --> 00:25:05,332
(The peel does not break.)

601
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,402
You're good at it.

602
00:25:07,103 --> 00:25:09,033
Dong Il. I'm not the person who can sit back and relax.

603
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,471
- That's why you like to work out.
- Right. That's why I work out.

604
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,513
(While Ji Hoon chats with Dong Il while peeling the apples...)

605
00:25:15,373 --> 00:25:16,373
(Exclaiming)

606
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,712
Goodness.

607
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,853
I saw that bed on TV, but I didn't know it was here.

608
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:25,921
- You can unfold it.
- Can two people sleep there?

609
00:25:25,922 --> 00:25:27,652
- No, it's for one person.
- I see.

610
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,662
I saw people coming down from there.

611
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,421
You can step on this.

612
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:34,191
(Here are the stairs!)

613
00:25:34,192 --> 00:25:35,692
So you use this as stairs.

614
00:25:36,392 --> 00:25:38,501
(Amazed)

615
00:25:38,502 --> 00:25:41,532
- We didn't have this before.
- I've never imagined it'd be here.

616
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:42,971
- It's a bit uncomfortable.
- Is that so?

617
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:44,803
(You could bump your head and get hurt.)

618
00:25:45,442 --> 00:25:47,171
- This one is really comfortable.
- That's what I heard.

619
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,372
It's very comfortable. It has stairs here.

620
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:50,513
(I see.)

621
00:25:50,942 --> 00:25:53,412
(Did they become close to each other already?)

622
00:25:54,412 --> 00:25:57,022
(This is our fridge.)

623
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:58,182
(Exclaiming)

624
00:25:59,152 --> 00:26:00,992
This honey is very delicious.

625
00:26:02,152 --> 00:26:03,292
- It's buckwheat honey.
- Gosh.

626
00:26:03,293 --> 00:26:05,792
- The buckwheat honey you had?
- Right, it's the buckwheat honey.

627
00:26:05,793 --> 00:26:06,793
(He tells her his favorite treat while showing her around.)

628
00:26:07,263 --> 00:26:08,762
(UIe is extremely satisfied.)

629
00:26:08,763 --> 00:26:10,702
(Showing off)

630
00:26:11,432 --> 00:26:15,332
(Meanwhile, Myoung is preparing snacks.)

631
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,972
Let's eat a lot.

632
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:21,343
I think the house is more crowded compared to other times.

633
00:26:22,472 --> 00:26:23,941
(They all prepared the snacks together.)

634
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:25,682
(Glad)

635
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,251
- Did you bring the rice cake?
- No, I didn't.

636
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,712
It's from Myoung's mom. She asked us to take good care of him.

637
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:32,123
(The soul food of our house, buckwheat honey)

638
00:26:32,652 --> 00:26:35,152
(They plate the apples Ji Hoon prepared too.)

639
00:26:35,752 --> 00:26:36,961
(It's time to enjoy their snacks.)

640
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,962
(Rummaging)

641
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,792
(Ji Hoon takes something out of his bag.)

642
00:26:42,793 --> 00:26:43,863
This is...

643
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:46,362
(He shakes it.)

644
00:26:46,363 --> 00:26:48,901
- Right. And...
- Do you want some coffee?

645
00:26:48,902 --> 00:26:50,741
I'll have coffee.

646
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:51,742
(He sprinkles brown powder.)

647
00:26:52,543 --> 00:26:53,613
What is this?

648
00:26:54,472 --> 00:26:56,982
- This is cinnamon powder.
- Yes.

649
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:00,981
My trainer friends in the US eat like this.

650
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:04,023
- The trainers who work out?
- It becomes sweeter.

651
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,152
- It does?
- Yes.

652
00:27:05,452 --> 00:27:07,093
They sprinkle it on strawberries too.

653
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:11,022
Try it. They go well together.

654
00:27:11,023 --> 00:27:12,123
- They do.
- Right.

655
00:27:12,563 --> 00:27:15,932
It's like all the fruits are turned into hangwa.

656
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:20,902
(How does the cinnamon apple taste like?)

657
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:24,942
(He eats with a straight face.)

658
00:27:25,442 --> 00:27:27,942
(How is it? It's good, right?)

659
00:27:29,472 --> 00:27:31,212
Gosh. This is so good.

660
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,553
- It has a unique taste, right?
- Yes.

661
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:36,982
It so funny that I'm eating it like this.

662
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:39,252
- It's different, right?
- Yes, it is.

663
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,950
Old people would love this taste.

664
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,781
(They are enjoying it well.)

665
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:44,550
It's done already?

666
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:47,461
I brought some brewed coffee.

667
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,089
(Thank you.)

668
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,390
It's really good. Try it.

669
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:54,561
Try this. Here's honey too.

670
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,860
- Have some of this.
- Thank you.

671
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,300
Myoung, try the rice cake too.

672
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,530
Gosh. This is so good.

673
00:27:59,531 --> 00:28:00,869
(She takes a mouthful.)

674
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,241
(Exclaiming)

675
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,069
Ji Hoon now knows how to enjoy it with honey.

676
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,110
(Ji Hoon the food expert enjoys it with rice cake.)

677
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:11,110
(Eating)

678
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,720
(He fell for the combination of rice cake and buckwheat honey.)

679
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:17,120
(Slurping)

680
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,491
(Feeling happy)

681
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,260
It tastes different when you eat it outside.

682
00:28:24,261 --> 00:28:25,691
- Sure thing.
- Right.

683
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,430
This is so good.

684
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,600
It really feels like I'm on a trip.

685
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,040
(She can enjoy the view of the front yard now.)

686
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:37,440
This place is well-kept.

687
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:38,471
Right.

688
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:42,879
And it's such a perfect place for camping.

689
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,150
(Then enjoy the late autumn to the fullest in the front yard.)

690
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:48,221
We talked about life before you guys arrived here.

691
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:52,089
"What comes to your mind when you think of autumn?"

692
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,919
Something like that. We just talked about it.

693
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,619
Autumn reminds me of the time I joined the military.

694
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,890
- You joined the military in autumn?
- Yes.

695
00:28:58,261 --> 00:29:01,900
(Why does autumn have to do with the military?)

696
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:04,500
- You two have something in common.
- Gosh, Myoung. Did you hear?

697
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:06,130
Stop it now.

698
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:09,740
Please stop.

699
00:29:09,741 --> 00:29:10,941
(He holds back his laughter.)

700
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,010
- Please!
- But it was winter.

701
00:29:13,011 --> 00:29:15,511
So Myoung will...

702
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:17,849
I think it was October 11th.

703
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,110
- October 11th?
- That's right.

704
00:29:19,781 --> 00:29:22,180
If he joins the army this fall or winter,

705
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,190
he will remember this for the next ten years.

706
00:29:24,191 --> 00:29:27,360
There's this unique smell of the military in fall or winter.

707
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:30,260
- You can smell it outdoors.
- Really?

708
00:29:30,261 --> 00:29:33,231
Yes. Even if the air is fresh, it freezes your bones...

709
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:35,301
and nose.

710
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,230
You cough for no reason.

711
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:38,600
(He is trying hard to keep calm.)

712
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:41,201
But I really liked that smell.

713
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,869
- He said he liked it.
- Okay.

714
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,910
- He liked it.
- Okay.

715
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,940
He said it was cold when he joined the military on October 11th.

716
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:49,839
Imagine how cold it would be if you went there later than that.

717
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,849
You'll feel the cold longer than him.

718
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,920
It'll last for about 15 years.

719
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:57,991
(Hee Won.)

720
00:29:58,551 --> 00:30:00,520
- Sure.
- He's not crying, right?

721
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:02,560
- He's tearing up.
- He's shedding tears.

722
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:03,561
(They have fun teasing Myoung.)

723
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:07,730
- It's better to finish it early.
- Sure thing.

724
00:30:07,731 --> 00:30:09,130
- I think that's better.
- You're right.

725
00:30:10,771 --> 00:30:12,400
(Picking up)

726
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,471
(He fails.)

727
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,410
I should have done a better job. I'm sorry, Hee Won.

728
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,409
- I should've made it sharper.
- It looks like a fork,

729
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,610
but it's more like a spoon.

730
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,180
- I should've carved it more finely.
- It's okay.

731
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:29,520
Dong Il, I'm sorry to interrupt,

732
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:30,521
but when are we going to eat lunch?

733
00:30:31,191 --> 00:30:33,691
(Oh, right. I forgot.)

734
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,260
(I didn't have breakfast.)

735
00:30:36,261 --> 00:30:39,060
- I think we need to eat something.
- Just sit there.

736
00:30:39,061 --> 00:30:40,731
It's really easy to make. Just sit there.

737
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:43,400
Just stay there. There's nothing to do.

738
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:47,070
(I'll make lunch right away.)

739
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,640
What are you going to make?

740
00:30:50,271 --> 00:30:53,041
I'm making potato dough balls. It won't take long.

741
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:56,441
(Grind potatoes finely.)

742
00:30:56,781 --> 00:30:58,551
(Add the potato starch to it.)

743
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,021
(Make potato dough balls.)

744
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:04,620
(Boil them in the broth.)

745
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,261
(Squishy and chewy)

746
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:11,191
(The potato dough balls are perfect for the late fall!)

747
00:31:11,961 --> 00:31:13,129
(Excited and curious)

748
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,630
Usually, potato dough balls...

749
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,731
are served with an anchovy broth.

750
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:21,670
But since it's chilly, I'll make it with a thick soup.

751
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,471
For the broth...

752
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:25,569
- Is it a meat broth?
- It is.

753
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,741
(Gulping)

754
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:31,451
(It's a three-minute long potato dough ball soup recipe.)

755
00:31:32,011 --> 00:31:35,320
(Add potato dough balls.)

756
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:38,650
I got this meat broth from a very nice place.

757
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:42,090
I'll make it thick and savory.

758
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,929
I'll add a lot to make it taste good.

759
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,690
(Impressed)

760
00:31:45,691 --> 00:31:46,691
I'll boil it for a while.

761
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,460
I don't think I've tried potato dough balls before.

762
00:31:49,461 --> 00:31:50,471
- Potato dough balls?
- Yes.

763
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:52,569
- Is it similar to sujebi?
- Yes, it is.

764
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,741
(It's a bit chewier.)

765
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,100
It sounds good.

766
00:31:56,741 --> 00:31:57,741
(Plenty of perilla seeds)

767
00:31:57,742 --> 00:31:59,240
You can add as much as you want.

768
00:31:59,241 --> 00:32:00,410
(Plenty of perilla seeds)

769
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:07,450
(Add perilla seeds and ground garlic and bring it to a simmer.)

770
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:09,021
It smells so good.

771
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,390
(Dong Il is the best.)

772
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,890
Dong Il, I'll just enjoy some moment of relaxation.

773
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:23,599
It would be really nice just to take a walk here.

774
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,700
Go and take a walk.

775
00:32:25,701 --> 00:32:29,070
(Taking a few steps forward to the front yard)

776
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:34,941
(It's a stroll down the road.)

777
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,551
(In all corners, you feel the late autumn vibes.)

778
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:45,691
- This place is so pretty.
- Is it?

779
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:46,951
I want to see it from a distance.

780
00:32:48,691 --> 00:32:51,590
(Backing off)

781
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:54,230
It's so cozy and pretty.

782
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:59,231
(The house looks cozy like a toy through a ginkgo tree forest.)

783
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:03,169
UIe, stay seated. You are our guest today.

784
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,170
Okay, Dong Il.

785
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,941
(Looking around)

786
00:33:09,241 --> 00:33:12,281
(Is there anything that I could do here?)

787
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:17,350
(Sneak peeking with curiosity)

788
00:33:19,691 --> 00:33:22,660
(Bored)

789
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:26,561
(Wandering around)

790
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:30,470
(Fumbling)

791
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,841
(It feels very awkward.)

792
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:37,941
Have a seat.

793
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,770
It will be done soon.

794
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:42,481
(She can't stay seated and only takes off her coat.)

795
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,611
(Let's see.)

796
00:33:45,311 --> 00:33:48,421
(She purses her lips out of awkwardness.)

797
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:51,619
- Does it feel awkward?
- Pardon?

798
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,651
Have a seat.

799
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:56,461
I feel like I should help at least with the utensils...

800
00:33:57,361 --> 00:33:58,591
- or water.
- That's unnecessary.

801
00:34:01,361 --> 00:34:04,470
Now I understand why guests keep moving around.

802
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,500
I know what you mean. They just can't tolerate it.

803
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:10,171
That has to do with the personality too.

804
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:12,409
It feels like you have to be doing something.

805
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,941
- I also want to participate.
- I bet.

806
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,010
This is a show for resisting all such temptations.

807
00:34:20,151 --> 00:34:21,151
(Hee Won's joke make them crack up.)

808
00:34:21,152 --> 00:34:22,849
Then, let me try it out right now.

809
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,591
Sure. This show requires a lot of patience.

810
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,420
(Laughing)

811
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:29,160
I'm serious. You can do anything you want.

812
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:34,061
Just the fact that I came here...

813
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,461
feels special to me.

814
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,099
So, I want to just try something.

815
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,370
What do you want to try? Do you like camping?

816
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:44,139
I've been in a camping car once.

817
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,570
- Just once?
- It was a standing car.

818
00:34:45,571 --> 00:34:46,571
- A standing one?
- Yes.

819
00:34:46,572 --> 00:34:48,311
(I see.)

820
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,179
Camping is just to stay and talk all night long.

821
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,219
- Right.
- It's great.

822
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,719
At night, you get to share things...

823
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,591
you never knew about each other.

824
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:01,190
Also, eating outdoors...

825
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:02,719
with fire in a place like this.

826
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,190
So, that's about it and you eat ramyeon for breakfast.

827
00:35:05,191 --> 00:35:07,330
- That's right.
- That's how things are.

828
00:35:07,861 --> 00:35:10,360
UIe, stay seated.

829
00:35:10,361 --> 00:35:11,771
The guest shouldn't move.

830
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:14,640
But are you normally this impatient?

831
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,210
(Even small jokes are cracking her up.)

832
00:35:18,211 --> 00:35:20,140
I think you need to learn to be more patient.

833
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:23,080
I never knew Hee Won could be that cheerful.

834
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,779
He's got a magical charm.

835
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,410
(Magical charm)

836
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,980
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

837
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:30,049
- Put some wood in there.
- Okay.

838
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:33,050
You can put the wood in. You got something to do now.

839
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:37,989
(Wrapping them up with sleeves...)

840
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,791
(and tossing it)

841
00:35:40,091 --> 00:35:42,060
(Staring)

842
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:43,100
Don't do that.

843
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,270
When handling the wood, you can wear these gloves.

844
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:50,611
(Here are the gloves.)

845
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,639
- Hee Won, the fire turned off.
- It's all fine. It'll light up.

846
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,381
- Right away?
- Yes.

847
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,080
(Much better with the gloves)

848
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,251
You can put about two.

849
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:02,481
Where did you get these firewood from?

850
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,989
Did you get it straight from the forest?

851
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,050
- Do we make the firewood?
- Do you?

852
00:36:07,421 --> 00:36:08,490
No way.

853
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:11,260
- Where are they?
- In the back.

854
00:36:11,861 --> 00:36:12,861
You can go back there.

855
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:15,461
(Hee Won tells UIe what to do one step at a time.)

856
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:19,131
(Hee Won leads with a burner in his hand.)

857
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:21,440
Dong Il, where should I put this?

858
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:23,171
Put it over here.

859
00:36:24,611 --> 00:36:25,671
Move this over there.

860
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,811
Don't we need a wind blocker for this?

861
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:31,751
- Is that the wind blocker?
- No, it's not.

862
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,751
Should we get a wind blocker?

863
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:35,550
- A wind blocker?
- Yes.

864
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,450
- Turn off the heat.
- Should I turn it off?

865
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:41,659
You don't have to do that for this.

866
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,460
You don't need it for that.

867
00:36:43,461 --> 00:36:45,860
UIe said she wanted to try it.

868
00:36:45,861 --> 00:36:46,990
Did she?

869
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:49,030
Put one up here, then.

870
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,329
- Should I bring that?
- We need a wind blocker.

871
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,400
Should I bring that?

872
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:53,631
(So excited)

873
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:54,970
Sure.

874
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:56,800
Do it.

875
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,041
Let me see.

876
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:01,341
Hold the other side.

877
00:37:01,342 --> 00:37:05,111
(Holding each side to set up the panel)

878
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,881
This is just perfect.

879
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:12,321
(Thanks to the wind blocker, the soup is coming along nicely.)

880
00:37:12,821 --> 00:37:15,461
(The camping newbie is please and happy.)

881
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:18,159
That blocks the wind.

882
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,091
(Leaving far away after helping out)

883
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,930
(He's pleased himself.)

884
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,571
(I almost forgot!)

885
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,001
Let's eat green onion kimchi.

886
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,111
Wait, that's not green onion kimchi. What's this?

887
00:37:33,671 --> 00:37:34,680
What do you call this?

888
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,311
Is it seasoned green onion?

889
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:40,880
- This first.
- What's that?

890
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:42,119
(Whatever it is, he's bringing it to the table.)

891
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,389
- That's it.
- Aren't these garlic leaves?

892
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,790
- They are garlic leaves.
- Are they really?

893
00:37:45,791 --> 00:37:46,791
Yes.

894
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:49,090
Did you say Myoung?

895
00:37:49,091 --> 00:37:50,490
(Did you call me?)

896
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:52,561
(Maybe not?)

897
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:54,699
It's your brother.

898
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,961
(I'm sorry.)

899
00:37:56,231 --> 00:37:58,600
(Here are Myoung's brother, garlic leaf, kimchi.)

900
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:00,901
We're all done.

901
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,700
- Potato dough balls?
- These are the dough balls.

902
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:04,210
(It's steaming hot.)

903
00:38:04,211 --> 00:38:05,510
If you need more, you can get more.

904
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,240
- This is sesame oil.
- Is it?

905
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:10,240
(The sesame oil will enhance the nuttiness.)

906
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,910
(Sprinkling on laver flakes)

907
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,280
You cooked it really simple.

908
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,420
(Spicy and sour garlic leaf kimchi)

909
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:18,450
It looks so good.

910
00:38:19,521 --> 00:38:21,360
I'd love to eat this with rice too.

911
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:22,421
(It's super simple potato dough ball breakfast!)

912
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:24,630
Try it.

913
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:25,790
- Give it to me.
- Thank you for the food.

914
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:27,160
Thank you.

915
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:29,131
It's made with potatoes.

916
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:31,401
Even at first glance, it looks amazing.

917
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:33,071
Thank you for the food.

918
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,970
Try it.

919
00:38:38,811 --> 00:38:41,041
(You too?)

920
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:42,780
- It's so good.
- Right?

921
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:48,821
(UIe also tries her first potato dough ball in life.)

922
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,550
(It's so good.)

923
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,060
It's so good.

924
00:38:56,061 --> 00:38:57,061
(It's my favorite food from now on.)

925
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,061
(Truth-telling eyebrows)

926
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,670
(It's so simple yet so good.)

927
00:39:04,671 --> 00:39:05,929
- Who is it, Myoung?
- It's so good.

928
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,001
- It's so good.
- It is, right?

929
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:09,941
(Pleased)

930
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,510
(Trying a piece of the garlic leaf kimchi)

931
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,210
It's thick and savory, right?

932
00:39:18,211 --> 00:39:20,111
- Is the garlic leaf good?
- Yes.

933
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,650
It's really good.

934
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,090
(Spicy and sour garlic leaf kimchi has a subtle garlic flavor.)

935
00:39:24,091 --> 00:39:25,450
It's just so good.

936
00:39:26,151 --> 00:39:27,220
- The garlic leaf kimchi?
- Yes.

937
00:39:29,961 --> 00:39:34,330
(It's a fantastic combination of flavors.)

938
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,199
(Feeling the happiest)

939
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,799
Dong Il, did you add perilla seeds to the gomtang.

940
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,969
I added perilla seeds and potato dough balls.

941
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,341
(Adding potato dough balls to the broth with perilla seeds)

942
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:45,940
I used to enjoy eating perilla seeds porridge.

943
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:48,579
This is exactly it.

944
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,049
(It's a thick and nutty soup.)

945
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,080
I added a lot.

946
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:55,179
That made it thicker and savorier.

947
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,180
It's really nutty.

948
00:39:56,181 --> 00:40:00,151
(It's so nutty it sucks you into it.)

949
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,490
(The soup is amazing.)

950
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:08,001
I love how warm and nice it is.

951
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,200
It's so hearty.

952
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:10,300
(On a chilly mid-fall day, )

953
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,441
(a warm bowl of soup that heats up your heart and soul.)

954
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,071
(It's great that they all love it.)

955
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,381
Okay, after we finish this,

956
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,711
we'll do something to enjoy this autumn.

957
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,980
We went on a monorail before.

958
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:29,981
There is one that goes up very closely.

959
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:31,921
That way, you get to enjoy the view of the mountain truly.

960
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,460
Since it goes up the mountain at a walking pace,

961
00:40:34,461 --> 00:40:36,620
you can see the leaves and flower petals.

962
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:39,829
- I enjoyed that slowness.
- Did you go up there?

963
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,930
(He wants to gift Ji Hoon and UIe a moment of relaxation.)

964
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:45,430
When it's really slow, you get to see all that's around you.

965
00:40:46,231 --> 00:40:48,171
This is the beauty of slowness.

966
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:50,501
So today,

967
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,481
we have an amphibious vehicle, that's specially made,

968
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,611
to travel the valley. I hard it can turn into a boat too.

969
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,409
(Like a boat?)

970
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:02,049
Even when it approaches water, it doesn't stop...

971
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:04,389
and keeps going over the water.

972
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,119
(Fascinated)

973
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,450
- Really?
- It looks like a motorcycle.

974
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:10,360
An amphibious vehicle? That's pretty cool.

975
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:11,591
- I know.
- I wonder how it works.

976
00:41:12,231 --> 00:41:13,530
Like I said, it's an amphibious vehicle.

977
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:17,600
(Like this?)

978
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,770
(Should we pedal on the water like we do on a swan boat?)

979
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:21,771
Not like this?

980
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:22,969
(Come on, Hee Won...)

981
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,970
We don't need to pedal to spin the propeller on the water?

982
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:29,079
So as soon as it goes on the water...

983
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,580
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

984
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,509
- Would you like to hear it?
- Well, amphi... Amphibious...

985
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,579
Vehicar... No, vehicle is...

986
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,720
Amphibious vehicar? Your tongue is twisted?

987
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,520
So we're going to ride that today?

988
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:43,361
Yes. To enjoy the autumn to the fullest.

989
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,461
(They're riding amphibious vehicles to enjoy the autumn differently.)

990
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,071
(They will see different corners of the mountain, )

991
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,901
(and when they reach the valley, the vehicle will go on water.)

992
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,110
(Today, they are going to feel the autumn vibes...)

993
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:03,211
(in the mountain and on the water.)

994
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,179
We will cross over the valley, and come back.

995
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,580
How is that? Are you excited?

996
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,380
All right. We need to digest the food anyway,

997
00:42:10,381 --> 00:42:12,190
so shall we go and try the amphibious car?

998
00:42:12,191 --> 00:42:13,449
- Okay.
- Let's go.

999
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,889
Bundle up, guys. Okay?

1000
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:15,989
- Okay.
- I should?

1001
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,389
Yes, because we will go on water and be exposed to the wind.

1002
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,730
This is exciting.

1003
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:20,960
Yes, totally.

1004
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:22,001
Let's go.

1005
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,930
(As the season has changed, they are in thick jackets.)

1006
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,000
(When they got in the car...)

1007
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:29,001
(Full)

1008
00:42:29,002 --> 00:42:31,541
This is my first time seeing the car squashed up like this.

1009
00:42:32,711 --> 00:42:35,009
- Everyone here is tall, so...
- This is...

1010
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,010
(It seems the car is more crowded as they are all tall.)

1011
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,650
- Actually, for me...
- Isn't it too tight for you?

1012
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:40,881
- No, I'm all right.
- Right.

1013
00:42:42,651 --> 00:42:45,450
(Moving closer to the door)

1014
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,020
Okay, here we go.

1015
00:42:47,021 --> 00:42:48,259
(Leaving their cozy home for now)

1016
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,389
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1017
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,759
I've never seen this many fallen leaves piled up like this before.

1018
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,060
(Crunching through the yellow leaves piled up in the front yard)

1019
00:42:54,061 --> 00:42:57,199
- I feel great.
- The weather is amazing.

1020
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,330
- It's not hot, it's not cold.
- It's perfect, right?

1021
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:03,200
It can't be better than this. This is just perfect.

1022
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:06,441
Are you okay?

1023
00:43:07,171 --> 00:43:08,639
Myoung, you seem uncomfortable.

1024
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,640
- Me?
- Yes.

1025
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,640
- Well, I'm okay.
- So I was going to...

1026
00:43:10,641 --> 00:43:12,981
- sit in the middle, but...
- No, I'm all right.

1027
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:17,921
Myoung is ten thousand times more considerate than me.

1028
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:20,521
And he is one hundred million times more considerate than Hee Won.

1029
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:22,790
(Nodding in silence)

1030
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:24,429
They are...

1031
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,731
(Taking a glimpse at Hee Won)

1032
00:43:26,091 --> 00:43:29,429
It's so funny that Hee Won isn't saying anything after hearing that.

1033
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,171
- How come?
- It's just funny.

1034
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:32,969
- Hee Won is funny?
- Yes.

1035
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,799
What he said was unworthy of a response.

1036
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,940
(Laughing)

1037
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:39,969
See? I knew it. He can say things like this...

1038
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,441
because he knows Dong Il very well.

1039
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,751
(Another day of their close friendship)

1040
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,920
The wind is cold, but I love it.

1041
00:43:47,921 --> 00:43:49,050
- This is nice, right?
- Yes, indeed.

1042
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:52,921
You won't feel cold because we are here with you.

1043
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,160
- Thank you.
- I really think so.

1044
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,590
(As they drive with the excitement of the autumn outing...)

1045
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,231
I feel really great.

1046
00:44:02,631 --> 00:44:03,699
(Exclaiming)

1047
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,631
- It's beautiful.
- This is amazing.

1048
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,170
Ji Hoon, look to your left.

1049
00:44:08,171 --> 00:44:09,869
This is Guryongnyeong.

1050
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,341
- Have a look.
- Oh, I see.

1051
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,010
We are almost at the summit.

1052
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,239
Look at the mountains.

1053
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,680
(In the distance, the ridges are overlapping.)

1054
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,279
Isn't it magnificent?

1055
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,049
(The spectacular autumn view of Guryongnyeong)

1056
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,080
This is splendid.

1057
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,921
(Amazed)

1058
00:44:27,191 --> 00:44:29,220
(Gosh, look at that.)

1059
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:33,230
(The leaves are turning red in the valley of Guryongnyeong.)

1060
00:44:33,231 --> 00:44:34,231
It's so beautiful.

1061
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:35,231
(Guryongnyeong, Hongcheon-gun an altitude of 1,013m)

1062
00:44:35,232 --> 00:44:37,400
(The wonderful scenery of Baekdu Mountain Range...)

1063
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:39,671
(from the summit of Guryongnyeong)

1064
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:44,171
(Ji Hoon's eyes are glued to the scenery.)

1065
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:49,180
Actually, I really didn't like to be in nature before,

1066
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,811
- but now, I just love it.
- Because you're getting older.

1067
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,219
(Immersed in the scenery)

1068
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,620
I can't believe...

1069
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,651
how fast time flies. Don't you think so?

1070
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:03,091
- Yes. Time flies.
- Absolutely.

1071
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,659
I don't remember what I did in my 30s and 40s.

1072
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,429
(He seems lost in thought.)

1073
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:11,631
I'd like to ask you something.

1074
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:13,430
What?

1075
00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:17,909
Do you think success in life results from luck or effort?

1076
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,239
(Does success in life result from luck or effort?)

1077
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,639
Let's say, if you can answer in percentage,

1078
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,041
how would you divide it, Hee Won?

1079
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,340
(Suddenly?)

1080
00:45:23,341 --> 00:45:25,510
(Blinking)

1081
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,310
(He is baffled by Ji Hoon's sudden question.)

1082
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:28,751
- Effort?
- Yes.

1083
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:30,449
Because I asked myself.

1084
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:34,921
As I look back over my career,

1085
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:38,259
I wonder if it was luck or my effort.

1086
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,030
And I can tell you that I made a lot of effort to be who I am now.

1087
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,160
- Yes, you did.
- I surely did.

1088
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:46,401
But at the same time, I think, "Was I just lucky?"

1089
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,840
"Or was it my effort?"

1090
00:45:49,841 --> 00:45:50,901
I just wondered.

1091
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,179
Well, I think luck is very important,

1092
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,980
but when I see those who got ahead,

1093
00:45:57,981 --> 00:45:59,481
I can tell that they made a lot of effort.

1094
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,950
I'm sure of that.

1095
00:46:01,251 --> 00:46:04,420
For sure, they made a lot of effort to get ahead,

1096
00:46:04,421 --> 00:46:05,751
and there is a lot I can learn from them.

1097
00:46:06,521 --> 00:46:08,620
(Nodding)

1098
00:46:08,861 --> 00:46:11,061
I think it depends on one's age.

1099
00:46:11,591 --> 00:46:14,389
I think what is really important in life is...

1100
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:15,830
not just about luck or effort.

1101
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,771
From certain age to certain age, I think effort is more important.

1102
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:21,340
As Hee Won said, depending on how much effort one makes,

1103
00:46:21,341 --> 00:46:24,071
and depending on how hard one tries and how experienced one is,

1104
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:26,969
one will eventually have luck.

1105
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:28,579
(They share their thoughts about Ji Hoon's concerns.)

1106
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,840
Was I too serious?

1107
00:46:29,841 --> 00:46:32,080
- No. I like those questions.
- Me too.

1108
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:34,110
We like talking about something like this.

1109
00:46:34,111 --> 00:46:35,320
- You do?
- Yes.

1110
00:46:35,321 --> 00:46:36,881
(We like talking about something like this.)

1111
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,389
Autumn is the perfect season to talk about life.

1112
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:42,690
(It's the perfect season to talk about something serious.)

1113
00:46:42,691 --> 00:46:44,790
In summer, with the AC on,

1114
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:46,759
- it's not good to talk about life.
- Right.

1115
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,361
(This kind of topic is heavy for summer with the AC on.)

1116
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,029
I feel great today.

1117
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,469
(As they are chatting, they have arrived.)

1118
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:52,501
We're here.

1119
00:46:53,131 --> 00:46:55,501
- Let's get off.
- After you.

1120
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,210
- Hello.
- Hello.

1121
00:46:59,211 --> 00:47:02,080
Hello. Before we begin, I'll hand out raincoats.

1122
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,940
- Do we need to wear it?
- Yes, that's right.

1123
00:47:03,941 --> 00:47:05,079
(Are those amphibious vehicles?)

1124
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,579
There they are. They are the cars we will ride.

1125
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,021
They are amphibious vehicles.

1126
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,321
It's perfect to enjoy the fall weather.

1127
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:14,790
It will slide on the water in the valley.

1128
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:16,390
- Does it float on water?
- Yes, it does.

1129
00:47:16,561 --> 00:47:18,889
- It is exciting.
- I know, right?

1130
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:19,930
It's cool.

1131
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:23,099
- Here.
- Thank you.

1132
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,170
(Touched)

1133
00:47:25,171 --> 00:47:28,400
If you stick your hand out the car,

1134
00:47:28,401 --> 00:47:31,611
you could get hurt by branches, so please be careful with that.

1135
00:47:31,771 --> 00:47:34,310
I will never stick my hand out of the car.

1136
00:47:34,311 --> 00:47:37,409
Three of you can get in that car, and two of you can get in this car.

1137
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,710
Okay, let's divide teams.

1138
00:47:38,711 --> 00:47:40,079
- Who wants to sit with me?
- Depending on our weights...

1139
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,380
Don't we need to decide by our weights?

1140
00:47:42,381 --> 00:47:43,381
What should we do?

1141
00:47:43,382 --> 00:47:45,389
- These three can go together.
- How about the three people...

1142
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,921
- and the two elderly men?
- "Elderly"?

1143
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:50,090
Dong Il, would you like to sit with me?

1144
00:47:50,091 --> 00:47:52,860
I can't believe he literally said, "elderly."

1145
00:47:52,861 --> 00:47:54,130
(Old boy is sad.)

1146
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:55,160
Seriously...

1147
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,860
- The three young people together...
- I'm so sad.

1148
00:47:57,861 --> 00:47:58,900
(I'll go with the young people.)

1149
00:47:58,901 --> 00:47:59,970
Good.

1150
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:01,501
What? Wait.

1151
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,000
- What happened?
- I'm scared.

1152
00:48:03,001 --> 00:48:04,640
(Nervous)

1153
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:08,881
(Getting nervous as the vehicle starts)

1154
00:48:09,111 --> 00:48:10,279
(Checking on Hee Won)

1155
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,850
(He seems very nervous.)

1156
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,450
(Embarrassed)

1157
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,420
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1158
00:48:16,421 --> 00:48:17,550
Are you sure you will be all right?

1159
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,349
- I'm all right.
- This will be fun.

1160
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:20,521
Here we...

1161
00:48:21,091 --> 00:48:22,560
I'm scared. Here we...

1162
00:48:22,561 --> 00:48:24,829
(Leaving like an arrow)

1163
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:25,890
It's fast.

1164
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,561
(The old boy is leaving too.)

1165
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:33,429
Can you please go slower?

1166
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:34,600
(Can you please go slower?)

1167
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:37,401
The clouds are beautiful.

1168
00:48:38,571 --> 00:48:41,239
(They are heading to the woods while feeling the autumn wind.)

1169
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,311
This is great.

1170
00:48:43,341 --> 00:48:44,580
It's marvelous.

1171
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:49,080
(They are finally entering the forest.)

1172
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:50,549
Gosh, look at the scenery.

1173
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:54,151
(Shall we enjoy the autumn forest?)

1174
00:48:54,921 --> 00:48:57,320
(When they thought the car was running smoothly in the mountain...)

1175
00:48:57,321 --> 00:48:58,361
What? One second.

1176
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,490
(Excited)

1177
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:02,530
Wait.

1178
00:49:02,531 --> 00:49:04,400
(Swerving)

1179
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:05,631
Look how quickly it turned.

1180
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,200
(The wheels are revealing their true colors.)

1181
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:12,369
Look how quickly it turned.

1182
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:13,909
(It starts to run like a wild horse.)

1183
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:15,080
Look how it turned.

1184
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,040
(They're going into the deep forest as the car runs at full speed.)

1185
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:21,850
(Laughing)

1186
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:26,850
(As the car entered the forest, they can't help but scream.)

1187
00:49:27,651 --> 00:49:30,160
(Shaking)

1188
00:49:30,321 --> 00:49:33,560
(I thought we were here to enjoy the autumn.)

1189
00:49:33,561 --> 00:49:34,830
(Turning sharply)

1190
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,270
(They are overwhelmed.)

1191
00:49:38,271 --> 00:49:39,271
My goodness.

1192
00:49:39,631 --> 00:49:40,670
No.

1193
00:49:40,671 --> 00:49:42,901
(She can't even keep her eyes open.)

1194
00:49:43,171 --> 00:49:44,401
Gosh, my bottom is hurting.

1195
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:47,240
It would have been better if we walked.

1196
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:50,980
This is so much fun.

1197
00:49:50,981 --> 00:49:52,211
(How are they doing?)

1198
00:49:52,611 --> 00:49:54,579
(Peaceful)

1199
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,750
(Maintaining the posture)

1200
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:57,050
This isn't what I expected.

1201
00:49:58,751 --> 00:50:02,061
Look how tightly Hee Won is holding the bar.

1202
00:50:02,361 --> 00:50:05,561
Look at his hunched shoulders.

1203
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,730
He is hunching forward.

1204
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:08,901
(Hee Won, are you okay?)

1205
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:10,600
- He's holding the bar tightly.
- I know.

1206
00:50:11,631 --> 00:50:13,671
See? He is strongly attached to his life.

1207
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,541
I'm turning the car around.

1208
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,110
- Okay.
- I'm sorry?

1209
00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:21,170
Why? Why are you turning the car?

1210
00:50:21,171 --> 00:50:23,080
(Screaming)

1211
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,611
(Silently screaming)

1212
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:27,909
(They can't relax for a second.)

1213
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:31,321
(Screaming)

1214
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:35,791
(After turning the cars around, they will take a break.)

1215
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:40,360
(He seems stable with only one hand holding the bar.)

1216
00:50:40,361 --> 00:50:42,560
That was a unique turn.

1217
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:43,631
Oh, man. I'm in pain.

1218
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:45,870
You don't need to be too worried.

1219
00:50:46,671 --> 00:50:48,299
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1220
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,239
- Are you really okay?
- I'm sure he has joint pains.

1221
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,300
(He is worried about Hee Won.)

1222
00:50:51,541 --> 00:50:52,570
I feel bad for him.

1223
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:55,040
- Well, I thought... Dong Il.
- What?

1224
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:57,341
Didn't you say that we would see nature?

1225
00:50:57,881 --> 00:50:59,409
Then what did you see on the way?

1226
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:00,880
Did you see any buildings on the way?

1227
00:51:00,881 --> 00:51:04,550
Come on, you know that's not what I am saying.

1228
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:06,389
- Hee Won, hold it tight.
- Okay.

1229
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:07,450
Hold it tight. We're leaving.

1230
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:09,020
My arms are hurting.

1231
00:51:09,021 --> 00:51:11,390
- Is everyone ready?
- Yes.

1232
00:51:12,091 --> 00:51:14,759
Hee Won is an amazing person.

1233
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,001
- He is so funny.
- He is really funny.

1234
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:19,200
Hang in there. We're almost there.

1235
00:51:19,631 --> 00:51:21,171
(Groaning)

1236
00:51:21,271 --> 00:51:22,870
(Screaming)

1237
00:51:23,571 --> 00:51:24,599
(All of a sudden...)

1238
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,210
Can I ever stick my hand out of the car?

1239
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:29,481
(I'm too scared to stick my hand out of the car.)

1240
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:32,210
I really want to know why we have to be in boots.

1241
00:51:32,211 --> 00:51:34,449
Well, it will go on water, so...

1242
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:36,021
- I guess, shortly?
- Yes.

1243
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:39,521
(Let's go on water.)

1244
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,750
(They are on their way to see the best autumn view.)

1245
00:51:40,751 --> 00:51:42,119
Myoung seems really excited.

1246
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,921
Yes, he knows how to enjoy.

1247
00:51:44,961 --> 00:51:46,030
Wait.

1248
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,631
(Sticking his head out)

1249
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:51,430
Finally, we're going on the water.

1250
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:56,271
(Will it really float on water?)

1251
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,070
- Come on, wait.
- We're going on the water.

1252
00:51:58,071 --> 00:51:59,870
(Running at full speed)

1253
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,469
We're going on the water.

1254
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,210
(Screaming)

1255
00:52:03,211 --> 00:52:05,950
Wait. Hold on, please.

1256
00:52:07,111 --> 00:52:09,421
(Very nervous)

1257
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:10,821
(Gosh!)

1258
00:52:11,751 --> 00:52:13,651
(With splashes)

1259
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:17,321
(The wheels are in the water.)

1260
00:52:17,591 --> 00:52:19,590
(Running at full speed)

1261
00:52:19,591 --> 00:52:20,760
(Splashing)

1262
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,660
(With strong splashes)

1263
00:52:25,271 --> 00:52:27,700
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1264
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,711
(Are we alive?)

1265
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,670
(Exclaiming)

1266
00:52:34,671 --> 00:52:37,311
(Looking around)

1267
00:52:37,811 --> 00:52:39,380
(Look, we're on the water.)

1268
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:40,680
(Exclaiming)

1269
00:52:43,981 --> 00:52:48,091
(Looking around)

1270
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:49,861
(A spray of water)

1271
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:50,921
My goodness.

1272
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:57,330
(The vehicle floats on the water with the turning force.)

1273
00:52:57,861 --> 00:52:59,631
This is unbelievable.

1274
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,400
Yes, it's amazing.

1275
00:53:01,401 --> 00:53:03,041
(They seem calm on the water.)

1276
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:04,600
Gosh, the water is splashing.

1277
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,210
This is nice. We can relax now.

1278
00:53:10,211 --> 00:53:11,279
(We can relax on the water.)

1279
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,480
Yes, finally.

1280
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,611
(Serene)

1281
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:17,120
(He seems relaxed as the vehicle is on the water.)

1282
00:53:17,751 --> 00:53:18,820
Isn't it terrific?

1283
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,320
(Are you happy that we are on the water?)

1284
00:53:20,321 --> 00:53:22,591
(Thumbs up at the same time)

1285
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,490
This is so cool.

1286
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,131
I didn't expect that it would actually go into the water.

1287
00:53:27,561 --> 00:53:29,829
I thought it would just pass by the valley.

1288
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:31,029
(Bumpy)

1289
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:32,100
My goodness. Sir.

1290
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:33,529
(The relaxing moment on the water has ended.)

1291
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:36,640
(Bumpy)

1292
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:38,639
Sir, this isn't right.

1293
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,841
(Screaming)

1294
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:43,139
(It gets bumpier on the stony ground.)

1295
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,680
Gosh, a nice turn.

1296
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:50,151
(Strongly shaking)

1297
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:54,120
(Bumpy)

1298
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,990
I don't see any path there though.

1299
00:53:57,691 --> 00:53:59,191
Sir, there isn't any path.

1300
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:00,990
- There is no...
- We're going on the water again.

1301
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,771
(Feeling the bumpiness with their buttocks)

1302
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:09,671
(Bumpy)

1303
00:54:10,271 --> 00:54:15,080
(The vehicle freely goes on and off the water.)

1304
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:20,711
(It can't stop me from being cool.)

1305
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,619
This is like a water ride.

1306
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,550
I mean, there is no path.

1307
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:30,361
(Bumpy)

1308
00:54:30,961 --> 00:54:35,600
(They are going on all different kinds of paths.)

1309
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,259
(Hooray!)

1310
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,529
Myoung is so excited.

1311
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,030
(He is excited even on the bumpy road.)

1312
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,840
- Look at Hee Won.
- Hee Won...

1313
00:54:41,841 --> 00:54:43,001
(Look at Hee Won.)

1314
00:54:43,341 --> 00:54:44,400
(Giddy-up.)

1315
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:46,740
(Like a horse riding)

1316
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,140
Look how he is bouncing.

1317
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,340
(He is so unique.)

1318
00:54:51,341 --> 00:54:52,410
Maybe,

1319
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:54,349
he will have muscle pains tomorrow.

1320
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,080
(I think he will have muscle pains tomorrow.)

1321
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,821
(Groaning)

1322
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:01,150
(I shouldn't laugh, but...)

1323
00:55:01,151 --> 00:55:02,220
It's too bumpy.

1324
00:55:03,361 --> 00:55:06,561
(Please somebody save my hip.)

1325
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:09,200
How can he bounce like that?

1326
00:55:10,861 --> 00:55:13,199
He shouldn't be sitting too stiff.

1327
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,171
(He is feeling each and every gravel on the path.)

1328
00:55:16,041 --> 00:55:19,910
(As they put themselves together and looked around...)

1329
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:25,050
(Maple trees are lined up endlessly along the valley.)

1330
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,349
My gosh, this is brilliant.

1331
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:30,720
(The impressive autumn view is like a piece of watercolor painting.)

1332
00:55:31,481 --> 00:55:36,260
(They are running in the valley while looking at the maple trees.)

1333
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,659
(After they run in the valley for a while, )

1334
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,231
(they go into the woods again.)

1335
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,200
(As they enter the forest...)

1336
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:50,640
- It feels so different here.
- I agree.

1337
00:55:51,071 --> 00:55:53,541
These trees are so beautiful.

1338
00:55:55,611 --> 00:55:59,550
(They are passing through the maple trees.)

1339
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:01,180
Oh my... It's so pretty here.

1340
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,650
It's the smell of the forest.

1341
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:04,651
(The smell of the forest)

1342
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:07,420
(They go on the water, )

1343
00:56:07,421 --> 00:56:10,091
(and they go into the deep mountain...)

1344
00:56:10,521 --> 00:56:13,861
(to see the autumn nature.)

1345
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:16,159
(Shortly after they started to enjoy the autumn views...)

1346
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,030
(Screaming)

1347
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,270
(Passing a hill)

1348
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,401
(Groaning)

1349
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:28,780
(They are going to take a break in the larch forest.)

1350
00:56:29,211 --> 00:56:30,341
Why did we stop here?

1351
00:56:30,981 --> 00:56:32,151
- All right.
- Why are we getting off?

1352
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:33,509
Get off. We will take pictures here.

1353
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,350
- Be honest. Your legs feel weak?
- No. Is there...

1354
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,480
any souvenir shop or something here?

1355
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:38,550
"Shop"?

1356
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:41,120
- It's like a spot we have to stop.
- That's what I am saying.

1357
00:56:42,421 --> 00:56:44,360
- It's really fun.
- It is, right?

1358
00:56:44,361 --> 00:56:45,530
(Thumbs up)

1359
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:48,861
Look how straight they grow. Like a toothpick.

1360
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,961
- Indeed.
- My gosh. Look at this.

1361
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,171
- The smell...
- The sound is from the valley.

1362
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,799
I think so.

1363
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,271
(The smell of the autumn forest is amazing.)

1364
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:01,009
Okay, here we go.

1365
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,410
- Hee Won, your face is too pale.
- Come on...

1366
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,881
I will look nice and pale in the picture.

1367
00:57:06,611 --> 00:57:08,050
One, two...

1368
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:10,420
(We went out for an autumn outing by amphibious vehicle.)

1369
00:57:10,421 --> 00:57:12,151
It's beautiful here.

1370
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,490
- You go first.
- Okay.

1371
00:57:15,361 --> 00:57:17,659
- We should...
- Look how kind Ji Hoon is.

1372
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:20,529
Oh man, it's like lady first.

1373
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:22,660
There you go. Get in quickly.

1374
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,429
(Hee Won teases Dong Il again.)

1375
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,300
Get in quickly.

1376
00:57:27,731 --> 00:57:30,771
- Lady first.
- I shouldn't have said anything.

1377
00:57:31,071 --> 00:57:32,139
This is so exciting.

1378
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,640
(Let's go.)

1379
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:36,110
(This time, Dong Il and Ji Hoon will leave first.)

1380
00:57:36,111 --> 00:57:38,040
They look so relaxed. Both of them.

1381
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:39,881
(Flapping)

1382
00:57:40,311 --> 00:57:42,049
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1383
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:43,119
(Screaming)

1384
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,381
It's so scary.

1385
00:57:45,751 --> 00:57:47,489
(His smile shows that he is now used to it.)

1386
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:49,389
(Of course not.)

1387
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:50,890
(Groaning)

1388
00:57:52,631 --> 00:57:55,861
(He is flapping like a paper doll.)

1389
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,130
(Even on their way back, they aren't still used to going on the water.)

1390
00:57:58,131 --> 00:57:59,771
One moment, please.

1391
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:04,901
(Passing a steep gravel hill)

1392
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:08,941
- I thought I would bounce off.
- I know, right?

1393
00:58:10,441 --> 00:58:14,111
(Finally, they have crossed over the water.)

1394
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:17,921
(The amazing autumn outing is almost over.)

1395
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:21,191
(Braking)

1396
00:58:23,961 --> 00:58:26,091
(Screaming)

1397
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,760
(What is going on?)

1398
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,760
(I see what's coming.)

1399
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:35,900
Oh, my gosh.

1400
00:58:35,901 --> 00:58:37,799
(It seemed it stopped, but suddenly they're going backward.)

1401
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,841
(Splashing)

1402
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:42,981
(With huge splashes)

1403
00:58:43,381 --> 00:58:47,751
(Don't let your guard down until the very end.)

1404
00:58:48,211 --> 00:58:50,179
(It's not easy to go back home.)

1405
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,280
Why only me?

1406
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:53,690
- What happened?
- Your clothes got wet?

1407
00:58:53,691 --> 00:58:56,690
They got Myoung. Great.

1408
00:58:56,691 --> 00:58:59,160
- He got all wet.
- Awesome.

1409
00:58:59,461 --> 00:59:02,029
- This shows how experienced we are.
- Of course.

1410
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:05,671
- We moved forward right away.
- We immediately knew what to do.

1411
00:59:06,571 --> 00:59:08,271
- Luckily, I chose a good seat.
- Myoung, did you get wet?

1412
00:59:09,071 --> 00:59:10,100
My hip.

1413
00:59:12,571 --> 00:59:14,409
(Let's go back home.)

1414
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:15,981
We were so quick.

1415
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:21,550
(Finally, they have arrived.)

1416
00:59:22,881 --> 00:59:24,279
(After the fierce amphibious vehicle riding...)

1417
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,389
- It was exciting.
- I had so much fun.

1418
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,620
It was fun, right?

1419
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:28,921
Yes.

1420
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,990
- Let's go and grill the meat.
- Shall we go then?

1421
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,760
You know what? Now we're heading back,

1422
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,800
and when we arrive at the house, if feels like I'm home.

1423
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,501
- I know what you mean.
- It feels like I'm home.

1424
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:44,369
Gosh, Dong Il.

1425
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:45,869
(Look over there.)

1426
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:47,140
The sun is beautiful.

1427
00:59:47,941 --> 00:59:50,079
The sun is setting.

1428
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,180
(The delicate sunset in Guryongnyeong outside the window)

1429
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:56,021
The summit is pulling down the sun.

1430
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:58,380
The summit is pulling down the sun?

1431
00:59:58,381 --> 01:00:00,119
Yes, it's pulling the sun down.

1432
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,290
(The sunset is the perfect end to the autumn outing.)

1433
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:02,961
- Seriously...
- Look how expressive you are.

1434
01:00:03,091 --> 01:00:05,120
Autumn is the perfect season to be expressive.

1435
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,960
(They are looking at the sunset in Guryongnyeong together.)

1436
01:00:06,961 --> 01:00:09,430
- Isn't it magnificent?
- It's so beautiful.

1437
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,400
We have to go under these trees.

1438
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:14,529
See? I told you. It feels like we're home.

1439
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:17,071
This is what you were talking about.

1440
01:00:17,501 --> 01:00:20,170
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1441
01:00:20,171 --> 01:00:22,440
- Thank you.
- Shall we start cooking now?

1442
01:00:22,441 --> 01:00:24,040
What time is it now?

1443
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:25,810
- It's almost 5pm.
- Is it, already?

1444
01:00:25,811 --> 01:00:26,850
We should hurry up.

1445
01:00:27,251 --> 01:00:30,250
- It's the perfect time to prepare.
- Yes, it is.

1446
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,849
Outside is better, right?

1447
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:33,619
Shall we clean this up and use it?

1448
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:36,560
- Yes, it's better here.
- It's better here?

1449
01:00:36,561 --> 01:00:37,990
I'll start preparing then.

1450
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:41,760
(With resolute determination)

1451
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:44,299
(When he showed up...)

1452
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,300
(My gosh.)

1453
01:00:45,301 --> 01:00:46,430
(Is this real?)

1454
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,000
(Everyone was shocked by...)

1455
01:00:49,001 --> 01:00:51,100
(Surprised)

1456
01:00:51,571 --> 01:00:55,509
(He bought the whole beef ribs as he liked it when he tried it.)

1457
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:58,080
(I'll prep the meat and grill it for you.)

1458
01:00:58,211 --> 01:00:59,211
(Striped cow)

1459
01:00:59,212 --> 01:01:00,280
(Tomahawk steak)

1460
01:01:00,711 --> 01:01:06,591
(So far, they have had all different kinds of meat on House on Wheels.)

1461
01:01:07,021 --> 01:01:08,759
(The ultimate one is here.)

1462
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,061
(Whole beef ribs)

1463
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,159
(The chewy texture and savory marbling...)

1464
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,600
(create a perfect combination.)

1465
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:22,001
(Just one piece brings pleasure to your mouth.)

1466
01:01:22,441 --> 01:01:26,140
(The dinner they'll eat their fill of tonight!)

1467
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:28,410
(Putting on)

1468
01:01:29,711 --> 01:01:32,279
(He gets dressed up...)

1469
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,910
(to take care of the meat.)

1470
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:37,820
(Once he puts on a hat that's the color of the meat...)

1471
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:40,091
- Shall we start?
- Sure.

1472
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,360
Goodness.

1473
01:01:42,361 --> 01:01:45,790
(He takes out...)

1474
01:01:45,791 --> 01:01:48,190
(three knives!)

1475
01:01:48,191 --> 01:01:49,200
Be careful.

1476
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,630
(He even takes out the sharpening stick.)

1477
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:55,171
(Sharpening)

1478
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,211
(Ji Hoon came determined and prepared.)

1479
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,980
(The preparations...)

1480
01:02:04,981 --> 01:02:06,210
(are even fancier than his determination.)

1481
01:02:06,211 --> 01:02:09,579
Gosh, this is... I don't need to sharpen this one.

1482
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:11,719
Yes, it's sharp and nice.

1483
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,251
It's a traditional knife.

1484
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:16,460
- Let's hurry.
- Okay.

1485
01:02:16,461 --> 01:02:17,520
(Hee Won wipes down the table that Ji Hoon will use.)

1486
01:02:17,521 --> 01:02:18,521
Okay.

1487
01:02:20,691 --> 01:02:21,861
Sit here.

1488
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:25,930
Sit here. Feel free to tell me if you need something.

1489
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,970
This is my job here.

1490
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,771
I help the people working.

1491
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,311
That's awesome.

1492
01:02:34,571 --> 01:02:37,009
(Finally!)

1493
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,041
(Groaning)

1494
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:46,021
(The whole beef ribs takes up the entire table.)

1495
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:49,890
- Goodness. That meat...
- Goodness.

1496
01:02:50,861 --> 01:02:52,529
Look at that meat.

1497
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:53,560
(The beef ribs show their pink color.)

1498
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:54,691
It looks incredible.

1499
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,329
Goodness. It's really nice.

1500
01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:57,930
That looks so cool.

1501
01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:59,299
(Laughing)

1502
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,730
It's not cool.

1503
01:03:00,731 --> 01:03:03,799
(It's not cool. It's delicious.)

1504
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,100
That's no joke.

1505
01:03:05,541 --> 01:03:06,869
- It's slippery.
- Okay.

1506
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,540
If you need women's gloves, we have them too.

1507
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:09,880
(He puts on the gloves...)

1508
01:03:09,881 --> 01:03:12,751
(and begins cutting into the whole beef ribs.)

1509
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,620
You should be careful.

1510
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,020
They gave you a good cut.

1511
01:03:19,021 --> 01:03:21,620
(The cast iron knife cuts through the meat without a hitch.)

1512
01:03:22,361 --> 01:03:26,530
(Staring)

1513
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:30,361
(It's captivating.)

1514
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:34,271
(It's everyone's first time seeing this, )

1515
01:03:35,271 --> 01:03:36,639
That looks unbelievable.

1516
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,010
(so everyone is speechless as they watch.)

1517
01:03:40,211 --> 01:03:43,711
(Attracting everyone's attention)

1518
01:03:44,481 --> 01:03:47,180
How is everyone staring at the meat like this?

1519
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:49,180
- I've never seen this before.
- Right?

1520
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:51,180
Goodness, you guys.

1521
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,850
This is insane.

1522
01:03:55,151 --> 01:03:56,290
It's insane.

1523
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:57,591
(He acknowledges that it looks insane.)

1524
01:03:58,421 --> 01:04:00,259
(If it looks insane...)

1525
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:01,329
Take a picture.

1526
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:02,861
(Don't hesitate. Take a picture.)

1527
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:09,501
(He seems entranced as he takes out his camera.)

1528
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:11,441
(He grins proudly.)

1529
01:04:11,771 --> 01:04:14,639
(1 cut)

1530
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,909
(1 exclamation)

1531
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:19,950
Goodness, you can tell it's going to be good by looking at it.

1532
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,280
- Doesn't the knife cut well?
- It does.

1533
01:04:23,881 --> 01:04:26,151
Dong Il. Take a look at the marbling.

1534
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:29,260
Goodness. It looks like a piece of art.

1535
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:32,429
(Everyone's watching...)

1536
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:36,030
(as he cuts the beef.)

1537
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:42,541
(He cuts out a piece of ribs with his meticulous knife skills.)

1538
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,700
It looks like a blanket.

1539
01:04:45,271 --> 01:04:47,010
- What?
- It looks like a blanket.

1540
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,440
Goodness, this is going to be insane.

1541
01:04:51,441 --> 01:04:52,481
(He lays out the meat that he cut out.)

1542
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,620
(He gets up again?)

1543
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:59,751
(He exchanges the cast iron knife for a sashimi knife.)

1544
01:05:00,191 --> 01:05:04,061
(He cuts out the fat with the sashimi knife.)

1545
01:05:04,461 --> 01:05:06,631
- You have to cut out the fat too?
- Yes.

1546
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:09,630
Beef fat isn't good for you.

1547
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,631
(Beef fat isn't good for you.)

1548
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:12,670
Gosh, this is...

1549
01:05:12,671 --> 01:05:15,530
(Exclaiming)

1550
01:05:17,001 --> 01:05:18,800
Ji Hoon, you look like a pro.

1551
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:23,410
(Straight angles)

1552
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,481
Cutting out all of the fat...

1553
01:05:28,611 --> 01:05:30,120
Dong Il, this is the piece I cut out.

1554
01:05:30,881 --> 01:05:32,549
That's so surprising.

1555
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:33,849
There's no fat.

1556
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:36,490
It means you're cutting it out perfectly.

1557
01:05:37,461 --> 01:05:39,090
Do you want a piece with some sesame oil?

1558
01:05:39,091 --> 01:05:40,131
Sounds good.

1559
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:41,860
Give me a piece.

1560
01:05:41,861 --> 01:05:43,961
(He dips it into the sesame oil to give it more savoriness.)

1561
01:05:45,771 --> 01:05:48,330
- Gosh. Eat it right now!
- How is it?

1562
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,071
- Right now?
- I'm serious.

1563
01:05:52,941 --> 01:05:54,969
Give some to Gong Myoung. Youngest, go out and try some.

1564
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:56,611
(Will he give me a piece too?)

1565
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:57,779
It's great.

1566
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:00,880
(He's dancing out of anticipation.)

1567
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:01,909
- What?
- It looks delicious.

1568
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:03,421
You could get a stomachache.

1569
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:05,690
- Ule, do you like this?
- Yes, I do.

1570
01:06:05,691 --> 01:06:07,521
Yes. Raw beef.

1571
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,720
(I want a bite too...)

1572
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,291
Here.

1573
01:06:12,861 --> 01:06:17,759
(She doesn't refuse the raw beef and takes a bite.)

1574
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,961
(Exclaiming)

1575
01:06:20,401 --> 01:06:21,430
It's really good.

1576
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:25,270
- Goodness.
- It's really good.

1577
01:06:25,271 --> 01:06:27,140
(The savoriness spreads in his mouth as soon as he takes a bite.)

1578
01:06:27,311 --> 01:06:28,369
- It's so good.
- Seriously.

1579
01:06:28,370 --> 01:06:30,111
- It's insane.
- It's really good.

1580
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:34,179
(When will he give me some?)

1581
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,510
Ji Hoon, give the youngest a piece.

1582
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,250
Okay.

1583
01:06:37,251 --> 01:06:38,619
(He gets on bended knee to get a bite.)

1584
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,050
It's a masterpiece.

1585
01:06:41,821 --> 01:06:42,960
(Please give me a piece.)

1586
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:43,961
Completely.

1587
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,901
(He cuts off a big piece...)

1588
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:54,001
(and puts it in the youngest's mouth.)

1589
01:06:54,271 --> 01:06:55,869
- A big piece?
- Yes, a big piece.

1590
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:57,570
(It's so good.)

1591
01:06:57,571 --> 01:07:02,140
(He dances the moonwalk out of excitement.)

1592
01:07:03,481 --> 01:07:04,680
Gosh, it's so good.

1593
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,311
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

1594
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:09,580
- Can I have another piece?
- Of course.

1595
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,780
- Go ahead. Keep eating.
- It's all yours.

1596
01:07:12,751 --> 01:07:14,990
- We have a lot of meat.
- We have a lot.

1597
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:18,460
Is this the piece you cut for me?

1598
01:07:18,461 --> 01:07:20,529
- Over here. Have this piece.
- Okay.

1599
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:21,830
(She puts a big piece of raw beef in her mouth.)

1600
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:26,001
(He's addicted to the raw beef.)

1601
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:28,030
This meat is insane.

1602
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:34,139
- There's charcoal on the bottom.
- I'm cutting it in big pieces.

1603
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:35,170
(He begins cutting the meat as he exclaims.)

1604
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,980
(He lines them up...)

1605
01:07:37,981 --> 01:07:40,380
(neatly in a row.)

1606
01:07:40,451 --> 01:07:41,849
The meat is insane.

1607
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:45,520
This meat is really insane.

1608
01:07:45,521 --> 01:07:46,750
(Jung Ji Hoon is all about the visual effect.)

1609
01:07:46,991 --> 01:07:49,089
- Even if we just grill that...
- Hey.

1610
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:50,491
(He suddenly stands up.)

1611
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,259
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

1612
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:58,100
(He gets excited as he brags about it again.)

1613
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:59,530
Isn't the meat really good?

1614
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:02,071
(He's done cutting up the ribs for grilling.)

1615
01:08:02,401 --> 01:08:04,300
Okay. Take this and...

1616
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,940
- I'll put it in like this.
- Put it in.

1617
01:08:05,941 --> 01:08:07,410
(They prepare the pine mushroom rice that goes with the main dish.)

1618
01:08:07,411 --> 01:08:09,411
Rip it up and put a lot in.

1619
01:08:09,611 --> 01:08:10,680
A lot?

1620
01:08:11,441 --> 01:08:12,510
This looks really good.

1621
01:08:15,481 --> 01:08:17,849
- That's great.
- This is a lot. What should I do?

1622
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:18,880
Just put it all in.

1623
01:08:19,121 --> 01:08:22,420
Who puts this much pine mushrooms into pine mushroom rice?

1624
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:27,130
(The wild pine mushroom rice goes into the rice cooker.)

1625
01:08:27,861 --> 01:08:28,889
(I'm in trouble.)

1626
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:31,230
I'm going to end up eating a lot again.

1627
01:08:31,231 --> 01:08:32,331
(A happy worry)

1628
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:36,839
I'm going to make the braised kimchi and mackerel a bit spicy.

1629
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:37,999
Ji Hoon, give it to me.

1630
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,840
Should I add more kimchi? What do you think? Is this enough?

1631
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:43,180
- Should I add more?
- A little more.

1632
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:48,411
(The youngest never refuses to more food.)

1633
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:53,691
(The plump mackerel which are in season go in.)

1634
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,760
(He adds plenty of red chili pepper powder to add spice.)

1635
01:08:58,121 --> 01:09:02,161
(We gathered with permission from the owner.)

1636
01:09:02,491 --> 01:09:05,629
(He puts the mackerel and kimchi stew on high heat.)

1637
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:08,300
(Okay! Now...)

1638
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:12,371
(It's time to cut the ribs.)

1639
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:14,010
Now...

1640
01:09:14,911 --> 01:09:15,981
I need an axe.

1641
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,611
(An axe?)

1642
01:09:19,911 --> 01:09:21,249
(He gets in position...)

1643
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:22,281
Be careful.

1644
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:27,521
(His power explodes.)

1645
01:09:28,121 --> 01:09:31,090
- Is it one rib per person?
- Yes. You can grab it and eat it.

1646
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:35,330
(It catches everyone's attention again.)

1647
01:09:35,331 --> 01:09:37,130
Gosh, this piece is good. You should have this one.

1648
01:09:39,401 --> 01:09:40,700
Seeing as to how I'm doing this,

1649
01:09:40,701 --> 01:09:42,940
I guess I enjoy being at the center of attention.

1650
01:09:42,941 --> 01:09:44,469
(I think I like getting attention.)

1651
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:45,500
Right? Usually...

1652
01:09:46,741 --> 01:09:47,811
This...

1653
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:50,610
After we grill this, you're going to eat it, UIe.

1654
01:09:50,611 --> 01:09:51,781
(He's done cutting the huge rib.)

1655
01:09:52,241 --> 01:09:53,810
(He lines up the ribs.)

1656
01:09:53,811 --> 01:09:54,911
This is insane.

1657
01:09:56,021 --> 01:09:57,080
- Ule.
- Yes?

1658
01:09:57,081 --> 01:09:59,080
- Can you give me the pink salt?
- What do you need?

1659
01:09:59,081 --> 01:10:00,690
- Pink salt.
- Pink salt.

1660
01:10:00,691 --> 01:10:02,760
(Pink salt)

1661
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:05,759
This? He's paying attention to detail.

1662
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,630
(He seasons the meat with some pink salt.)

1663
01:10:10,161 --> 01:10:12,459
I had no idea Ji Hoon would bring this with him.

1664
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:13,530
(He even brought pink salt with him.)

1665
01:10:13,531 --> 01:10:14,531
I had no idea.

1666
01:10:15,571 --> 01:10:17,070
Hey. I'm sorry, but...

1667
01:10:17,071 --> 01:10:18,941
- Can you sprinkle it on top?
- Sure.

1668
01:10:21,811 --> 01:10:23,411
- What is this?
- From top to bottom.

1669
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:25,010
That's right.

1670
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:29,050
(A little)

1671
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:32,849
- You should hold it.
- Okay. I'll hold it.

1672
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:35,850
- It's taking too long. Grab gloves.
- I'll do it.

1673
01:10:36,061 --> 01:10:37,520
(The youngest steps up.)

1674
01:10:37,521 --> 01:10:39,561
- I'll sprinkle it.
- Okay.

1675
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,100
(Goodness, UIe.)

1676
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:44,860
(Empty)

1677
01:10:44,861 --> 01:10:45,930
Here.

1678
01:10:48,071 --> 01:10:49,871
I got kicked out.

1679
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,839
Goodness. You're doing great.

1680
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:55,911
Gong Myoung is good at this.

1681
01:10:57,241 --> 01:10:58,241
(I wanted to do well too.)

1682
01:10:58,242 --> 01:11:00,549
It's okay. You did a great job.

1683
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:02,350
(Disappointed)

1684
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,920
Take a look at the charcoal. Is this enough?

1685
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:07,191
(Exclaiming)

1686
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:09,590
Is this enough charcoal?

1687
01:11:11,121 --> 01:11:13,290
- Look at it.
- You did it, so it must be perfect.

1688
01:11:13,531 --> 01:11:14,789
- Good shot.
- Right? Is it okay?

1689
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:15,831
It's really nice.

1690
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,930
(While Ji Hoon was preparing the meat...)

1691
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,499
(To ensure that the meat Ji Hoon cut will be cooked nicely...)

1692
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,941
Right. We can grill it here.

1693
01:11:26,611 --> 01:11:27,670
That's right.

1694
01:11:28,241 --> 01:11:30,380
This is nice.

1695
01:11:31,281 --> 01:11:34,081
(Proud)

1696
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:37,781
Hee Won did a great job with the charcoal.

1697
01:11:38,951 --> 01:11:40,821
Thank you, Dong Il.

1698
01:11:41,191 --> 01:11:43,620
It's the first time you complimented me in a year and a half.

1699
01:11:43,621 --> 01:11:45,190
(It's the first compliment in a year and a half.)

1700
01:11:45,191 --> 01:11:47,460
(At a loss for words)

1701
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:53,130
(He's crying after receiving a compliment.)

1702
01:11:53,571 --> 01:11:57,340
(What am I gonna do with him?)

1703
01:11:57,701 --> 01:12:00,039
What's the point of bringing this here? You should turn on the light.

1704
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,441
Hee Won, turn on the light.

1705
01:12:02,271 --> 01:12:04,140
Nobody can do this.

1706
01:12:04,581 --> 01:12:05,640
Where is it?

1707
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,080
Where is it located?

1708
01:12:08,081 --> 01:12:09,650
(Where is it?)

1709
01:12:09,651 --> 01:12:12,620
- Hold on. This is...
- What if you can't do it?

1710
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:14,290
(What if you can't do it after acting all arrogant?)

1711
01:12:15,451 --> 01:12:16,490
Let me see. Let go.

1712
01:12:16,491 --> 01:12:19,321
(Let me see.)

1713
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:21,161
That's...

1714
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:23,531
You can never do it.

1715
01:12:23,901 --> 01:12:27,499
I heard the gas coming out.

1716
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,771
(He returns to his normal self after 1 minute.)

1717
01:12:29,441 --> 01:12:32,400
You can tell by how it smells.

1718
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:35,311
I'm a little out of it after lighting the charcoal on fire.

1719
01:12:35,571 --> 01:12:36,710
This is really...

1720
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:38,539
(He's confident after receiving a compliment.)

1721
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,281
I wanted to make the charcoal perfect.

1722
01:12:41,911 --> 01:12:44,280
- Shall we get started?
- Do we just need to grill it now?

1723
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:45,420
Yes, we just need to grill it.

1724
01:12:47,491 --> 01:12:50,589
- The fire is perfect.
- Hee Won did a great job.

1725
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:52,190
- He's really good at this.
- I see.

1726
01:12:52,191 --> 01:12:54,060
Right. I'm good at the small errands.

1727
01:12:54,061 --> 01:12:55,361
Let's put the sweet potatoes...

1728
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:59,060
- Since this takes a bit of time...
- Should we put this on first?

1729
01:12:59,061 --> 01:13:01,230
Yes, this takes a bit of time.

1730
01:13:01,231 --> 01:13:02,231
(He puts the rib meat on the grill.)

1731
01:13:02,232 --> 01:13:03,441
- I'm putting the meat on.
- Okay.

1732
01:13:05,071 --> 01:13:09,241
(He lines them up.)

1733
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,241
Goodness, it's incredible.

1734
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:15,950
Gosh, this is insane.

1735
01:13:15,951 --> 01:13:17,151
(It's filled with fresh, thick ribs.)

1736
01:13:17,451 --> 01:13:21,049
Gosh, the fire is insane. It's hard to make it like this.

1737
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:22,120
Right.

1738
01:13:22,121 --> 01:13:24,090
Usually, the outside burns, and the inside is raw.

1739
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:25,719
This is great.

1740
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,861
- Isn't it perfect?
- It is.

1741
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:29,430
After all these years...

1742
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,731
of doing small errands...

1743
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:35,500
Gosh, this is a perfect time.

1744
01:13:36,901 --> 01:13:40,970
(He gives Hee Won, who worked hard, a piece.)

1745
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:45,410
- How is it?
- It doesn't need any salt.

1746
01:13:45,411 --> 01:13:46,680
I put a lot of salt on it before.

1747
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:49,620
Goodness. It tastes really good.

1748
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:51,021
(Goodness. It tastes really good.)

1749
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:53,521
- Doesn't it have umami?
- It does.

1750
01:13:54,191 --> 01:13:55,889
- Ule.
- Yes?

1751
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,620
(UIe, have a taste while it's good.)

1752
01:13:57,621 --> 01:13:58,621
It's hot.

1753
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:01,830
- Dong Il.
- Yes? Let me try.

1754
01:14:01,831 --> 01:14:04,660
(After taking a big piece in his mouth...)

1755
01:14:04,661 --> 01:14:05,701
(Exclaiming)

1756
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:11,540
(His eyes open wide.)

1757
01:14:11,871 --> 01:14:14,969
(The meat that I cut and grilled...)

1758
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:16,110
(tastes great.)

1759
01:14:16,111 --> 01:14:18,180
Hey, this is insane.

1760
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:20,581
The meat is really chewy.

1761
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,220
- It really is.
- It is.

1762
01:14:24,121 --> 01:14:26,790
- The beef is really chewy.
- It is.

1763
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,821
It's really good.

1764
01:14:32,821 --> 01:14:35,490
Is beef supposed to be this chewy?

1765
01:14:35,491 --> 01:14:36,500
(This happy moment when they eat cooked beef off the grill)

1766
01:14:37,201 --> 01:14:38,201
This is really good.

1767
01:14:38,202 --> 01:14:40,071
- The juices taste incredible.
- I agree.

1768
01:14:40,871 --> 01:14:42,200
The juices explode in your mouth.

1769
01:14:42,201 --> 01:14:43,800
(She can't help but dance.)

1770
01:14:44,571 --> 01:14:46,611
At this rate, we'll finish this meat in no time.

1771
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,810
Let me give you a mission. Flip them over slowly.

1772
01:14:50,811 --> 01:14:52,110
(He leaves the meat to UIe.)

1773
01:14:52,111 --> 01:14:53,210
He gave me a mission.

1774
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:59,050
(Why did Ji Hoon go back into the house?)

1775
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,651
(What is he doing?)

1776
01:15:04,561 --> 01:15:08,861
(He brought something out with him.)

1777
01:15:11,561 --> 01:15:12,731
Gosh, this is...

1778
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:15,271
What is that?

1779
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,500
This is roe.

1780
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,040
- Roe?
- Yes.

1781
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,139
- From what fish?
- Tuna.

1782
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:22,241
- It's tuna roe?
- Yes.

1783
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:24,010
Try it.

1784
01:15:24,741 --> 01:15:28,081
(You have to try things you're curious about.)

1785
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:31,219
It would go great with rice.

1786
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:33,750
- Yes. It'd be really good.
- Freshly-made rice.

1787
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:36,990
(The pine mushroom rice is done.)

1788
01:15:36,991 --> 01:15:38,919
The rice is ready. Should I stir it up?

1789
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:39,930
Yes. Do that.

1790
01:15:40,531 --> 01:15:41,730
I tried it earlier.

1791
01:15:41,731 --> 01:15:42,830
(On the charcoal that Hee Won made...)

1792
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:44,560
Gosh, the fire is nice and strong.

1793
01:15:44,561 --> 01:15:45,830
- It's really nice.
- It is.

1794
01:15:45,831 --> 01:15:47,170
I'll cook the meat.

1795
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,870
You have to eat it when it's hot. Hurry.

1796
01:15:48,871 --> 01:15:50,370
That? Okay.

1797
01:15:50,371 --> 01:15:51,900
- Ule. Have a seat.
- Okay.

1798
01:15:51,901 --> 01:15:52,901
(He places...)

1799
01:15:52,902 --> 01:15:55,040
(the perfectly cooked meat on a plate.)

1800
01:15:55,311 --> 01:15:57,840
(With the mackerel and kimchi stew that Dong Il made...)

1801
01:15:58,111 --> 01:16:01,050
(is a bowl of pine mushroom rice filled with the scent of fall.)

1802
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:04,081
(Plus, they have the ribs that Ji Hoon cut and grilled himself!)

1803
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:08,151
(Today's feast prepared by Ji Hoon and Dong Il)

1804
01:16:08,451 --> 01:16:10,419
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food!

1805
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:13,290
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food!

1806
01:16:17,361 --> 01:16:20,701
(The youngest takes a big bite first.)

1807
01:16:22,231 --> 01:16:23,400
The meat is too good to eat in a wrap.

1808
01:16:23,401 --> 01:16:25,169
I know. The meat is so fresh.

1809
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:27,910
(She wraps it in an aromatic piece of perilla leaf.)

1810
01:16:27,911 --> 01:16:29,271
(Exclaiming)

1811
01:16:30,111 --> 01:16:32,510
(The meat is so fresh.)

1812
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,950
- It's really good.
- It's really good.

1813
01:16:35,951 --> 01:16:37,320
Since the ingredients are good...

1814
01:16:37,321 --> 01:16:40,250
(Fresh ribs meat cut from the ribs directly)

1815
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:43,991
(I should eat the meat with the pine mushrooms.)

1816
01:16:44,161 --> 01:16:45,219
(Peaking)

1817
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:47,290
UIe really knows how to enjoy food.

1818
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:53,970
(She eats the beef and the pine mushrooms in one bite.)

1819
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,370
This is really good.

1820
01:16:56,371 --> 01:16:57,401
(I should try it with some garlic leaf kimchi.)

1821
01:16:57,970 --> 01:17:00,570
I think the beef will taste good with the garlic leaf.

1822
01:17:00,571 --> 01:17:01,611
It does.

1823
01:17:02,771 --> 01:17:04,139
- That's how you should eat it.
- Right.

1824
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,710
(Garlic leaf kimchi goes well with everything.)

1825
01:17:06,911 --> 01:17:08,510
(Exclaiming)

1826
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:10,679
(He feels happy...)

1827
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,850
(seeing him enjoy it.)

1828
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:16,790
If you feel like the beef is getting a bit too greasy,

1829
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:18,320
have a piece of the aged kimchi.

1830
01:17:18,321 --> 01:17:20,860
Goodness, the rice is good too.

1831
01:17:20,861 --> 01:17:22,590
The freshly scooped rice is good.

1832
01:17:23,331 --> 01:17:24,831
The rice is insane.

1833
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:29,500
It's really good.

1834
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:32,339
(She takes a bite of meat...)

1835
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:35,240
(and a sip of the stew.)

1836
01:17:35,241 --> 01:17:36,271
(Exclaiming)

1837
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:39,540
(Her feet bounce around.)

1838
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,680
(Shaking)

1839
01:17:42,411 --> 01:17:43,679
You must bounce your feet...

1840
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:46,020
- when you like something.
- I do.

1841
01:17:46,021 --> 01:17:48,850
- When I'm really happy...
- You're bouncing your feet.

1842
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,220
Have it with some of this. It's really good.

1843
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:54,731
(Aromatic)

1844
01:17:55,561 --> 01:17:58,560
I took a bite of the hot rice, and all I taste is the pine mushroom.

1845
01:17:58,561 --> 01:17:59,701
Right?

1846
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:03,169
The pine mushrooms are alive in the rice.

1847
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:04,201
(The pine mushroom rice is amazing.)

1848
01:18:04,571 --> 01:18:06,370
We're getting better and better at making rice.

1849
01:18:06,371 --> 01:18:08,340
- You're right.
- It's really good.

1850
01:18:09,781 --> 01:18:11,480
That's true, but do you see this?

1851
01:18:11,481 --> 01:18:14,849
Take some of this and put it on the rice.

1852
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:16,281
- Tuna roe.
- Yes.

1853
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:24,621
(The deep flavors in the tuna roe)

1854
01:18:25,991 --> 01:18:26,991
(The aromatic pine mushroom rice...)

1855
01:18:26,992 --> 01:18:30,731
(and the salty roe are perfect together.)

1856
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,531
- It's really good.
- Isn't it?

1857
01:18:37,071 --> 01:18:39,000
This is good.

1858
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:42,411
(I feel suffocated.)

1859
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,840
Right?

1860
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,911
(This won't do.)

1861
01:18:47,951 --> 01:18:49,981
(Rummaging)

1862
01:18:50,781 --> 01:18:53,349
- What part of the beef is this?
- Beef thin skirt.

1863
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:54,390
Beef thin skirt?

1864
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:56,661
(Comfortable)

1865
01:18:57,361 --> 01:18:58,991
- I loosened my belt.
- You loosened your belt?

1866
01:18:59,861 --> 01:19:02,231
(Eat as much as you want.)

1867
01:19:02,691 --> 01:19:05,831
(She loosened her belt and started round 2 of eating.)

1868
01:19:09,941 --> 01:19:11,201
I tried the rice,

1869
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,271
and the taste of pine mushrooms is so strong.

1870
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,639
(He's not zoning out. He's savoring the beef.)

1871
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:18,580
When you think about pine mushrooms...

1872
01:19:18,581 --> 01:19:21,749
(This beef is really good.)

1873
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:22,781
Right?

1874
01:19:22,981 --> 01:19:25,820
You eat it like you'd eat radish kimchi.

1875
01:19:25,821 --> 01:19:31,021
(He eats another piece of beef.)

1876
01:19:31,121 --> 01:19:32,960
You eat it like you'd eat radish kimchi.

1877
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:35,429
We need to do this for another ten years.

1878
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:36,530
(After he finishes all the rice in his bowl...)

1879
01:19:36,531 --> 01:19:38,929
You need to eat this.

1880
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:40,031
(After he finishes all the rice in his bowl...)

1881
01:19:41,771 --> 01:19:46,241
(As usual, Myoung has a second serving.)

1882
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:49,640
Myoung went to get more rice. He always has two bowls.

1883
01:19:49,811 --> 01:19:50,941
Oh, really?

1884
01:19:51,781 --> 01:19:54,781
The freshly scooped rice is good. This one got cold.

1885
01:19:55,911 --> 01:19:58,380
(Eating)

1886
01:19:58,821 --> 01:20:02,720
(I made the right choice.)

1887
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,889
(Meanwhile, Ji Hoon was enjoying his meal...)

1888
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:06,020
It got really big.

1889
01:20:06,021 --> 01:20:07,630
(when he suddenly remembered the ribs.)

1890
01:20:08,231 --> 01:20:11,201
(Is it cooking nicely?)

1891
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:20,669
Goodness. That looks insane.

1892
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:21,970
(Luckily, the ribs are cooking well.)

1893
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,740
The ribs are cooking really well.

1894
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:25,781
The ribs?

1895
01:20:26,347 --> 01:20:28,857
(You can't resist the temptation of the ribs.)

1896
01:20:29,672 --> 01:20:34,382
(You can't resist the temptation of the ribs.)

1897
01:20:34,583 --> 01:20:36,243
(Sizzling)

1898
01:20:36,913 --> 01:20:40,123
The fire played a big role today.

1899
01:20:40,283 --> 01:20:41,981
If the fire wasn't good, it wouldn't have tasted good.

1900
01:20:41,982 --> 01:20:43,381
It wouldn't have cooked well.

1901
01:20:43,382 --> 01:20:45,421
- It would've just burnt.
- Great job!

1902
01:20:45,422 --> 01:20:46,823
(Hee Won's charcoal is the best!)

1903
01:20:47,163 --> 01:20:49,662
It went beyond our expectations. I'm serious.

1904
01:20:49,663 --> 01:20:51,193
(Chic)

1905
01:20:51,363 --> 01:20:53,432
(Big)

1906
01:20:54,363 --> 01:20:56,232
You need to take a bite out of one of these.

1907
01:20:56,873 --> 01:20:58,202
Are you too full for it?

1908
01:20:58,203 --> 01:20:59,832
(Exclaiming)

1909
01:20:59,833 --> 01:21:00,873
This is...

1910
01:21:02,842 --> 01:21:04,671
You should take a bite out of this.

1911
01:21:04,672 --> 01:21:06,312
(Even if we're full, we still need to take a bite out of this.)

1912
01:21:07,312 --> 01:21:09,713
You have to eat it like this. It's ribs, after all.

1913
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:11,352
We should try making a broth too.

1914
01:21:16,083 --> 01:21:17,352
(Ripping)

1915
01:21:18,193 --> 01:21:20,123
(Exclaiming)

1916
01:21:21,062 --> 01:21:22,592
When you see foreign movies...

1917
01:21:23,323 --> 01:21:24,692
set in the middle ages,

1918
01:21:24,693 --> 01:21:26,963
the knights would eat like this.

1919
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,403
I've always wanted to try it.

1920
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:32,771
(He finally gets to rip the meat off the bones.)

1921
01:21:32,772 --> 01:21:33,802
Have some of this too.

1922
01:21:38,873 --> 01:21:41,743
(Looking)

1923
01:21:42,012 --> 01:21:43,083
Try this.

1924
01:21:43,852 --> 01:21:46,953
(She quietly prepares her gloves.)

1925
01:21:48,852 --> 01:21:52,293
(I want to eat ribs right off the bones too.)

1926
01:21:53,392 --> 01:21:54,421
(Dong Il...)

1927
01:21:54,422 --> 01:21:56,833
(Is it good?)

1928
01:21:57,863 --> 01:21:59,431
- Hey, Ji Hoon?
- Yes?

1929
01:21:59,432 --> 01:22:03,672
I feel like I'm playing a harmonica with the rib.

1930
01:22:03,873 --> 01:22:06,572
(She can't bring herself to say something, )

1931
01:22:06,573 --> 01:22:08,772
(so she's just salivating.)

1932
01:22:13,443 --> 01:22:15,811
(He sees her belatedly.)

1933
01:22:15,812 --> 01:22:18,312
Dong Il, do you want to pass the baton onto me?

1934
01:22:18,982 --> 01:22:23,283
She's preparing to dig in right now.

1935
01:22:23,552 --> 01:22:25,492
She's prepared.

1936
01:22:25,493 --> 01:22:26,722
(UIe puts on some gloves and gets ready to dig in.)

1937
01:22:26,963 --> 01:22:28,722
I'm ready to dig in.

1938
01:22:30,262 --> 01:22:32,562
(I should give UIe a rib too.)

1939
01:22:34,102 --> 01:22:36,762
(He chooses a rib that looks delicious...)

1940
01:22:38,232 --> 01:22:39,271
Thank you.

1941
01:22:39,272 --> 01:22:41,402
She's not a picky eater at all.

1942
01:22:41,403 --> 01:22:43,003
It's still quite hot.

1943
01:22:43,472 --> 01:22:45,443
(UIe eats really well.)

1944
01:22:47,482 --> 01:22:48,742
(How does her first rib taste?)

1945
01:22:48,743 --> 01:22:51,253
I'm going crazy because I'm so full, but I can't stop eating.

1946
01:22:52,613 --> 01:22:54,722
(It tastes fantastic.)

1947
01:22:56,352 --> 01:22:57,592
(Laughing)

1948
01:22:58,522 --> 01:23:00,022
This is really good.

1949
01:23:00,793 --> 01:23:04,732
(The final course of the beef ribs start.)

1950
01:23:05,632 --> 01:23:06,761
(Today's highlight...)

1951
01:23:06,762 --> 01:23:09,403
(to create a perfect ending)

1952
01:23:12,873 --> 01:23:14,873
(Delicious)

1953
01:23:19,142 --> 01:23:25,283
(The meat comes off the bones within moments.)

1954
01:23:27,153 --> 01:23:29,783
(Glistening)

1955
01:23:30,753 --> 01:23:33,863
This is the meat from the bones.

1956
01:23:34,123 --> 01:23:36,591
But are you too full to eat it?

1957
01:23:36,592 --> 01:23:38,731
This is the best part though.

1958
01:23:38,732 --> 01:23:41,101
This tastes a bit like beef jerky.

1959
01:23:41,102 --> 01:23:42,302
- Beef jerky?
- Try it.

1960
01:23:43,003 --> 01:23:44,131
I'll try it. Give it to me.

1961
01:23:44,132 --> 01:23:46,403
(He won't let it be over until it's over.)

1962
01:23:46,802 --> 01:23:48,942
- Just have a taste.
- This was on the bone.

1963
01:23:48,943 --> 01:23:50,042
(We can't miss out on this.)

1964
01:23:50,043 --> 01:23:52,471
- This was on the bone.
- It taste just like beef jerky.

1965
01:23:52,472 --> 01:23:53,981
(They're enjoying the beef course to the fullest.)

1966
01:23:53,982 --> 01:23:54,982
It's really amazing.

1967
01:23:55,913 --> 01:23:57,312
This is the best part.

1968
01:23:57,953 --> 01:23:59,812
We're all eating well.

1969
01:24:02,922 --> 01:24:05,452
(Their stomachs are about to explode.)

1970
01:24:05,453 --> 01:24:06,823
I'm knocked out.

1971
01:24:10,693 --> 01:24:13,802
- Goodness. I'm exhausted.
- I'm exhausted.

1972
01:24:16,132 --> 01:24:17,431
My goodness.

1973
01:24:17,432 --> 01:24:20,302
(Even the youngest is knocked out.)

1974
01:24:22,573 --> 01:24:24,812
(Taking a deep breath)

1975
01:24:25,842 --> 01:24:28,612
Thanks to Ji Hoon, I ate so much meat.

1976
01:24:28,613 --> 01:24:30,113
Thanks to Ji Hoon...

1977
01:24:30,382 --> 01:24:33,452
I never ate so much beef even when I was selling it.

1978
01:24:33,453 --> 01:24:34,453
I'm serious.

1979
01:24:34,722 --> 01:24:36,992
My heart feels full today.

1980
01:24:36,993 --> 01:24:39,993
Very much so.

1981
01:24:40,892 --> 01:24:42,493
I'm so full.

1982
01:24:42,892 --> 01:24:44,162
Everyone's exhausted from eating.

1983
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:45,591
(The storm-like dinner is over...)

1984
01:24:45,592 --> 01:24:48,262
There's a cold wind blowing.

1985
01:24:50,381 --> 01:24:53,021
Things are starting to wind down. It's time to rest.

1986
01:24:53,022 --> 01:24:54,352
(The night breeze in the late fall is quite cold.)

1987
01:24:55,192 --> 01:24:56,491
We ate that much.

1988
01:24:56,492 --> 01:24:59,120
(They have a cup of Myoung's coffee...)

1989
01:24:59,121 --> 01:25:03,061
(to warm themselves up in the autumn night.)

1990
01:25:03,062 --> 01:25:04,102
I'm melting.

1991
01:25:04,631 --> 01:25:06,130
(Slurping)

1992
01:25:06,131 --> 01:25:07,870
(Exclaiming)

1993
01:25:07,871 --> 01:25:08,871
Myoung.

1994
01:25:10,072 --> 01:25:12,142
- It's really good.
- You make great coffee.

1995
01:25:12,971 --> 01:25:14,040
(Embarrassed, shy)

1996
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:15,111
It's good.

1997
01:25:15,112 --> 01:25:16,112
(Embarrassed, shy)

1998
01:25:16,341 --> 01:25:19,442
He said he's going to start a cafe after he gets out of the army.

1999
01:25:21,011 --> 01:25:23,281
Then will that be around 2024?

2000
01:25:23,282 --> 01:25:24,352
- What?
- What?

2001
01:25:24,982 --> 01:25:28,090
If I go in now, it'll be 2023.

2002
01:25:28,091 --> 01:25:29,492
Guys are sensitive to this.

2003
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:31,821
(Watch what you say.)

2004
01:25:31,822 --> 01:25:33,420
(Sorry)

2005
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:35,391
Since you can go next year.

2006
01:25:35,392 --> 01:25:37,231
Even if I go next year, I get out in 2023.

2007
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:38,301
Oh, really?

2008
01:25:39,902 --> 01:25:41,870
- You know what's funny?
- What?

2009
01:25:41,871 --> 01:25:43,671
You know how we put sweet potatoes in the fire?

2010
01:25:43,902 --> 01:25:45,442
They're not there anymore.

2011
01:25:45,801 --> 01:25:48,341
(My sweet potatoes?)

2012
01:25:49,471 --> 01:25:54,250
(She wrapped the precious sweet potatoes from her grandma...)

2013
01:25:54,251 --> 01:26:00,282
(and put them in the fire so that they would cook well.)

2014
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:03,551
(They got moved around because of the beef...)

2015
01:26:03,692 --> 01:26:07,232
(and they went missing.)

2016
01:26:08,392 --> 01:26:11,932
(Where did my sweet potatoes go?)

2017
01:26:12,532 --> 01:26:14,170
I wanted to taste them.

2018
01:26:14,171 --> 01:26:16,331
The sweet potatoes looked really good.

2019
01:26:17,471 --> 01:26:19,441
- I'll go.
- Stay seated.

2020
01:26:19,442 --> 01:26:20,871
Guests aren't supposed to move.

2021
01:26:21,711 --> 01:26:23,040
But I've been working the whole time.

2022
01:26:23,041 --> 01:26:24,411
(I'll look for them.)

2023
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:26,381
Goodness, it's really...

2024
01:26:26,642 --> 01:26:28,952
- I know.
- Take a look at this.

2025
01:26:30,621 --> 01:26:34,621
I just touched it, and it's already game over.

2026
01:26:35,692 --> 01:26:38,322
(Curious)

2027
01:26:44,102 --> 01:26:46,202
(Yellow)

2028
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:48,931
(Amazing)

2029
01:26:48,932 --> 01:26:50,201
Here. Have a taste.

2030
01:26:50,202 --> 01:26:53,401
(Dong Il has a bite first.)

2031
01:26:53,402 --> 01:26:54,871
(Exclaiming)

2032
01:26:55,971 --> 01:26:57,711
- It's really sweet.
- How are they?

2033
01:26:58,242 --> 01:26:59,281
It's really sweet?

2034
01:26:59,282 --> 01:27:00,681
- Is it good?
- Totally.

2035
01:27:00,682 --> 01:27:02,651
- Here.
- I already had some.

2036
01:27:02,652 --> 01:27:04,250
- Did you have some?
- It's really sweet.

2037
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:05,420
(UIe's sweet potatoes taste even better because they're sharing.)

2038
01:27:05,421 --> 01:27:07,992
- The harvest was good this year.
- You're right.

2039
01:27:08,721 --> 01:27:09,851
This is really good.

2040
01:27:09,852 --> 01:27:13,220
If we cook it over the grill, it would taste amazing too.

2041
01:27:13,221 --> 01:27:15,161
(She's happy that everyone's enjoying it.)

2042
01:27:15,591 --> 01:27:18,031
See? Even if you think nobody would eat it, everyone has it.

2043
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:19,062
- Right.
- Right.

2044
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:22,072
- Everyone eats it.
- I still have room for it.

2045
01:27:22,501 --> 01:27:25,642
(It's hard to believe that they're still eating.)

2046
01:27:27,711 --> 01:27:29,910
We have to decide who will sleep where.

2047
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:32,041
UIe gave me some information earlier.

2048
01:27:32,442 --> 01:27:34,181
She said she wants to try sleeping in a tent.

2049
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:37,112
I've never slept outside in a tent before.

2050
01:27:37,381 --> 01:27:39,720
- You can sleep in the tent then.
- Okay, I will.

2051
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,550
- Okay, I will.
- Ule will sleep there.

2052
01:27:41,551 --> 01:27:42,620
Thank you.

2053
01:27:42,621 --> 01:27:44,362
- That might be for the better.
- Right.

2054
01:27:44,961 --> 01:27:47,630
- The four of us can sleep inside.
- Right.

2055
01:27:47,631 --> 01:27:48,660
- Right.
- Right.

2056
01:27:48,661 --> 01:27:52,000
Then go inside and decide on where you want to sleep.

2057
01:27:52,001 --> 01:27:54,000
Based on that, the three of us...

2058
01:27:54,001 --> 01:27:55,572
will fight over where to sleep.

2059
01:27:57,541 --> 01:27:59,001
- What do you think?
- That's funny.

2060
01:28:00,072 --> 01:28:01,441
You should decide first.

2061
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:02,641
(He's ready.)

2062
01:28:02,642 --> 01:28:03,670
Okay?

2063
01:28:03,671 --> 01:28:06,441
You should go in and decide on where to sleep.

2064
01:28:06,442 --> 01:28:07,511
You too. UIe...

2065
01:28:07,682 --> 01:28:08,981
(Bed 1, Bed 2)

2066
01:28:08,982 --> 01:28:14,091
(Bed 3)

2067
01:28:14,392 --> 01:28:16,651
- His height...
- Will he be okay?

2068
01:28:16,652 --> 01:28:19,621
He might not fit.

2069
01:28:19,822 --> 01:28:22,431
Have any guys slept on top?

2070
01:28:22,432 --> 01:28:23,492
I can sleep up there.

2071
01:28:24,562 --> 01:28:26,960
(The family can sleep on the 2nd floor.)

2072
01:28:26,961 --> 01:28:30,202
Then if you sleep like this, it won't affect it.

2073
01:28:30,232 --> 01:28:34,572
(Will Ji Hoon, who's tall, be able to sleep there?)

2074
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:37,910
(The tallest guest enters the 2nd floor.)

2075
01:28:37,911 --> 01:28:40,211
(Laughing)

2076
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:42,010
It looks like he's sleeping.

2077
01:28:42,011 --> 01:28:43,281
- Are you okay? Is it okay?
- Is it too small?

2078
01:28:43,282 --> 01:28:44,322
- Is it okay?
- Is it okay?

2079
01:28:45,921 --> 01:28:47,721
(It's okay.)

2080
01:28:48,051 --> 01:28:49,090
Are you okay?

2081
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:50,091
(This is my spot. It's the best.)

2082
01:28:50,092 --> 01:28:52,061
- It's okay.
- Is it really okay?

2083
01:28:52,062 --> 01:28:54,961
Oh, okay. I was planning on sleeping there.

2084
01:28:56,892 --> 01:28:58,500
(Dong Il complains as he wanted to sleep on the 2nd floor.)

2085
01:28:58,501 --> 01:29:01,130
I told him that it would be uncomfortable.

2086
01:29:01,131 --> 01:29:02,171
(This is hilarious.)

2087
01:29:02,602 --> 01:29:05,370
You shouldn't have asked, "You like it?"

2088
01:29:05,371 --> 01:29:06,541
Then what?

2089
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:08,142
"It won't work, right?"

2090
01:29:09,671 --> 01:29:12,581
The way you asked him was...

2091
01:29:12,782 --> 01:29:15,411
"Don't go up there."

2092
01:29:15,911 --> 01:29:17,380
"It won't work, right?"

2093
01:29:17,381 --> 01:29:20,050
(An example of a negative question)

2094
01:29:20,051 --> 01:29:23,352
You should have said, "You can't fit due to your height."

2095
01:29:23,952 --> 01:29:27,562
(The positive man drops his head.)

2096
01:29:27,831 --> 01:29:28,892
Goodness.

2097
01:29:29,392 --> 01:29:31,732
You were supposed to say, "You can't sleep there."

2098
01:29:33,362 --> 01:29:35,001
The view is nice upstairs.

2099
01:29:35,831 --> 01:29:37,741
Only the view is nice there.

2100
01:29:37,742 --> 01:29:39,102
No, it was good. It's okay.

2101
01:29:40,272 --> 01:29:41,341
Is that so?

2102
01:29:42,642 --> 01:29:47,011
All right, then. We'll clean up and get ready for bed.

2103
01:29:48,751 --> 01:29:49,951
Ji Hoon!

2104
01:29:49,952 --> 01:29:51,522
- Yes?
- Put your sneakers on.

2105
01:29:53,121 --> 01:29:55,891
We can see so many stars when we go to a dark spot now.

2106
01:29:55,892 --> 01:29:57,290
- Stars?
- Let's go and watch the stars.

2107
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:58,621
We'll quickly take a look and go to bed.

2108
01:29:59,322 --> 01:30:02,061
(Will you go to watch the stars with me?)

2109
01:30:02,062 --> 01:30:03,161
They all sing that.

2110
01:30:05,102 --> 01:30:08,470
You can see so many stars when you go to a dark spot.

2111
01:30:08,471 --> 01:30:09,531
Right here.

2112
01:30:09,532 --> 01:30:11,201
(The family members linger to watch the night sky...)

2113
01:30:11,202 --> 01:30:13,041
(as they don't want to go to bed yet.)

2114
01:30:14,142 --> 01:30:16,442
- Dong Il, where are the stars?
- Where are they?

2115
01:30:16,711 --> 01:30:17,711
We should go further in.

2116
01:30:17,712 --> 01:30:20,080
- How about now?
- I see them!

2117
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,352
You can see the stars now, right?

2118
01:30:21,551 --> 01:30:23,081
- I see them.
- There really are many.

2119
01:30:24,581 --> 01:30:26,220
(The stars in the night sky shine brighter in the dark.)

2120
01:30:26,221 --> 01:30:29,452
- There are so many of them.
- There are.

2121
01:30:31,562 --> 01:30:33,960
- Right here.
- I see so many.

2122
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:36,590
(The best gift you can get before bed)

2123
01:30:36,591 --> 01:30:37,902
- Let's go back.
- Let's go to sleep.

2124
01:30:38,331 --> 01:30:39,402
Go on.

2125
01:30:40,062 --> 01:30:41,531
(The whole night is like a present for UIe...)

2126
01:30:41,532 --> 01:30:42,830
It's cozy, isn't it?

2127
01:30:42,831 --> 01:30:44,201
(since she's never slept in a tent before.)

2128
01:30:44,202 --> 01:30:46,300
Get inside the comforter.

2129
01:30:46,301 --> 01:30:47,670
And it's spacious.

2130
01:30:47,671 --> 01:30:48,711
It is.

2131
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:51,510
- We'll go. Good night.
- Good night.

2132
01:30:51,511 --> 01:30:53,210
(They check the guest's bed until the last moment.)

2133
01:30:53,211 --> 01:30:55,151
The pad is warm, isn't it?

2134
01:30:55,152 --> 01:30:56,251
It's so warm.

2135
01:30:56,864 --> 01:30:59,322
(I love it.)

2136
01:30:59,682 --> 01:31:00,952
- Good?
- Yes.

2137
01:31:03,192 --> 01:31:05,821
- It feels like home, right?
- Yes, I love it.

2138
01:31:05,822 --> 01:31:07,220
- It's lovely here.
- Good night.

2139
01:31:07,221 --> 01:31:09,090
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

2140
01:31:09,091 --> 01:31:10,862
- You too.
- Good night, Myoung.

2141
01:31:12,131 --> 01:31:14,471
(The front yard is packed with the autumn vibe.)

2142
01:31:14,772 --> 01:31:17,572
(As you walk on the trail under the autumn sunlight, )

2143
01:31:17,871 --> 01:31:20,202
(you bump into a treehouse straight out of a fairy tale.)

2144
01:31:20,471 --> 01:31:22,871
(This is incredible.)

2145
01:31:23,028 --> 01:31:24,956
(How good is Hee Won at stone skipping?)

2146
01:31:24,957 --> 01:31:26,858
(Amazed)

2147
01:31:26,997 --> 01:31:28,926
(Youngest is spurred and tries it.)

2148
01:31:28,927 --> 01:31:31,036
(Awesome)

2149
01:31:31,037 --> 01:31:33,238
(It's a problem after another.)

2150
01:31:33,467 --> 01:31:35,536
(The self-styled stone skipping expert goes.)

2151
01:31:35,537 --> 01:31:37,777
(Oh, boy.)

2152
01:31:37,778 --> 01:31:40,136
(Everything is fun in the front yard.)

2153
01:31:40,137 --> 01:31:42,877
(They try making dinner without Dong Il!)

2154
01:31:43,077 --> 01:31:44,148
Hey, Myoung.

2155
01:31:44,518 --> 01:31:46,076
(Is this for making French fries?)

2156
01:31:46,077 --> 01:31:48,817
(Or this one?)

2157
01:31:48,818 --> 01:31:51,188
(Is this one okay?)

2158
01:31:51,957 --> 01:31:53,617
(It's perfect, isn't it?)

2159
01:31:53,618 --> 01:31:56,027
(How will the novice cook's fries turn out?)

2160
01:31:56,028 --> 01:31:58,426
(How about UIe's shredded potato jeon?)

2161
01:31:58,427 --> 01:32:00,796
(Laughing)

2162
01:32:00,797 --> 01:32:03,067
(The thickest shredded potatoes you've ever seen)

2163
01:32:03,068 --> 01:32:05,137
(She tries flipping it and fails.)

2164
01:32:05,738 --> 01:32:07,636
(A novice cook's novel way of flipping jeon)

2165
01:32:07,637 --> 01:32:10,506
(How will their dinner be...)

2166
01:32:10,507 --> 01:32:13,037
(prepared without Dong Il?)
