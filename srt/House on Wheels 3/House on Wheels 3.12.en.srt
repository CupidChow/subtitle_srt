1
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:29,470
(A winter night in Yeongju with bright moonlight)

2
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:31,096
The weather is so nice.

3
00:00:34,196 --> 00:00:36,465
- I love the atmosphere here.
- Right.

4
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:39,605
(The crocks which are flooded with the moonlight make it even better.)

5
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:41,578
Aren't you cold?

6
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,218
I can't feel cold when I'm with you guys.

7
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:47,917
I'm cold inside even when I'm around people.

8
00:00:47,918 --> 00:00:51,748
(I'm cold inside even when I'm around people.)

9
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,488
The three of us have never been alone...

10
00:00:55,928 --> 00:00:57,857
at night, have we?

11
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,497
That's right.

12
00:00:59,498 --> 00:01:00,627
When we first met,

13
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,627
we were alone in the morning.

14
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,199
Exactly. On the first day.

15
00:01:05,638 --> 00:01:08,497
(They started the day without Dong Il.)

16
00:01:08,498 --> 00:01:10,939
(Laughing)

17
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,579
(You build a fire like a man.)

18
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:16,308
(I feel stupid.)

19
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,409
Flip it.

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,548
(Whatever they did, accidents followed.)

21
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:21,778
(Confused)

22
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,289
(Hide it!)

23
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:29,688
(The guest is worried that the host will be here.)

24
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:33,128
(If Hae In is happy, )

25
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:37,268
(the whole family is happy.)

26
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:40,438
(And Hee Won's surprise)

27
00:01:40,798 --> 00:01:43,239
(A magic fire show)

28
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,578
(I have to take a picture.)

29
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:51,608
(They've made great memories together.)

30
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:57,388
(And sadly, they had to let Hae In go.)

31
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:01,858
(I had so much fun.)

32
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,327
I'm dazed now that he's gone.

33
00:02:05,328 --> 00:02:07,797
- I know, right?
- Right? With Hae In gone.

34
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:08,968
(Feeling empty)

35
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,968
Are you on your way?

36
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:14,699
I'll give him a call.

37
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,539
- Hi, Dong Il.
- It's me. Are you on your way?

38
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:22,747
- I'm almost there.
- Okay.

39
00:02:22,748 --> 00:02:25,209
By the way, did you eat?

40
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:28,789
- I ate a simple meal.
- Okay.

41
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:32,418
I bought some snacks on the way.

42
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,719
Would you like to have those?

43
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,928
Are you sure you don't need anything else?

44
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:38,928
We can eat it tomorrow.

45
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:42,628
(The new guest sounds cool.)

46
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,699
We'll see.

47
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,668
- See you.
- Okay.

48
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:49,868
(Even in the crowd, )

49
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:52,439
(or as you pass by on the street, )

50
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,108
(Ji Chang Wook, today's guest, has great looks that glow.)

51
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,177
(Stop acting up.)

52
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,678
(If you keep acting that way, )

53
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:01,548
(I'm going to fall for you.)

54
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,018
(He embraces girls with his sweetness.)

55
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,888
(The expert romance actor as sweet as chocolate)

56
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,327
(Dong Il played a cameo part...)

57
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:17,229
(in "The K2", which Chang Wook starred in.)

58
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:20,098
(I'm...)

59
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,938
(going to the House on Wheels...)

60
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,539
(because that's what my heart tells me to do.)

61
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:27,409
(Actor Ji Chang Wook is coming to the House on Wheels.)

62
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:29,979
Let's bring out some more hangwa.

63
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:32,418
Take some out.

64
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:35,588
Let's clean it up a bit.

65
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,587
(Putting more firewood for the guest)

66
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:40,618
Okay.

67
00:03:40,918 --> 00:03:44,028
I'm sure he'll feel better once he sees...

68
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:46,029
- hangwa and strawberries.
- Right.

69
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:47,729
That's right. That's perfect.

70
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:50,599
We'll scoop it up when he's here.

71
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:53,198
If he asks,

72
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,468
we can stir-fry ripe kimchi with meat.

73
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,338
- That won't take long.
- Right.

74
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,137
But I would feel bad to watch him eat alone.

75
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:01,138
Right.

76
00:04:02,578 --> 00:04:04,547
Then, should we go somewhere while he eats?

77
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:05,779
(So that he can feel at ease.)

78
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,577
Or we can show him...

79
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:09,418
the magic show when he eats.

80
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:13,319
(Laughing)

81
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,759
The color of the fire is still the same.

82
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,328
I hear it lasts long.

83
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:26,068
(Today's guest comes with both hands full.)

84
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:27,598
(Turning)

85
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:28,699
Are those crocks?

86
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:31,708
Why are there so many crocks?

87
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:36,949
I think he's here.

88
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:40,318
Is that you, Chang Wook?

89
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,478
(My guest is here!)

90
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,788
- He brought a lot of stuff.
- Really?

91
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,887
- Dong Il!
- Hey.

92
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:48,759
- Hello.
- Welcome!

93
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:51,988
(Breathing heavily)

94
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:53,298
- Hello.
- Are you moving out?

95
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:54,858
- Sorry?
- Are you moving out or what?

96
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:55,928
- I got presents.
- I'll...

97
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,568
- I'll carry them.
- Hello.

98
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:59,438
- Give me that.
- It was so heavy.

99
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,037
- I'll get that for you.
- Thank you.

100
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:02,337
- You can give it to me.
- Okay.

101
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:03,869
- Is that so? You didn't have to...
- Let me take it.

102
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:05,931
Have a seat.

103
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:07,731
- Take a breather first.
- Yes.

104
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:09,802
- Take a seat.
- Do you want hot coffee?

105
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:12,142
- Say hello.
- Nice to meet you.

106
00:05:12,143 --> 00:05:13,172
Hello.

107
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:16,812
I heard you 2 almost acted in the same piece 2 years ago.

108
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:20,082
- Do you remember "Han River"?
- Yes.

109
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,481
I heard you were going to be in it,

110
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:23,212
- and I accepted the offer, but...
- It was canceled.

111
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:24,311
- Right.
- It was canceled.

112
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:25,922
We almost did the same movie.

113
00:05:27,052 --> 00:05:28,222
Sadly...

114
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:29,692
(Glad to meet him)

115
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:31,323
It's nice to meet you.

116
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:33,263
- Take your seat.
- Yes.

117
00:05:33,393 --> 00:05:36,263
- Here. It's hot coffee.
- Thank you.

118
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:39,703
- Do you know Myoung?
- Well, I've...

119
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:43,372
- never met him in person.
- Me neither.

120
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:46,703
We used to go to the same hair salon.

121
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,143
And we go to the same gym.

122
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:50,273
- Really?
- Yes.

123
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:52,741
- Oh, right! We met last time.
- Yes.

124
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:55,013
- I saw you working out.
- Yes.

125
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:57,212
You have to say goodbye the moment you meet.

126
00:05:57,213 --> 00:05:58,252
He's going to the army.

127
00:05:58,653 --> 00:06:00,852
(Dong Il...)

128
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,222
When are you going?

129
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:04,723
- I'm going next month.
- I see.

130
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:07,823
(I see.)

131
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:09,263
Which army are you going to?

132
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:13,361
It's just the army. It's in Paju, Gyeonggi Province.

133
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:14,362
- Paju?
- Yes.

134
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:15,601
(I thought we could get to know each other.)

135
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:17,332
These two seem to speak the same language.

136
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:21,041
Of course. I joined the army in 2017.

137
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,342
- In 2017?
- Yes.

138
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:24,042
- It hasn't been that long.
- No.

139
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:27,883
But if you're...

140
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,013
joining the army soon,

141
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:34,421
you must feel really bad.

142
00:06:34,422 --> 00:06:36,453
(Sad)

143
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:39,092
I've come to accept it though.

144
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:41,822
You can never accept that.

145
00:06:41,823 --> 00:06:43,533
No one can.

146
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:45,061
He has a point.

147
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:46,402
(Getting a headache)

148
00:06:46,403 --> 00:06:47,502
- Right?
- You're right.

149
00:06:47,802 --> 00:06:49,431
Before you go there...

150
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:51,073
and the 1st day you're there are 2 different things.

151
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:54,542
Reality is going to hit you really hard on the very first day.

152
00:06:54,742 --> 00:06:55,812
(Sighing)

153
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:59,883
(I'm getting thirsty.)

154
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:03,252
Chang Wook is meaner than he seems. Keep that in mind.

155
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:04,852
He likes to joke around.

156
00:07:05,953 --> 00:07:07,783
It must have been tough getting here. How long did it take?

157
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:10,691
About two and a half hours?

158
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:12,192
- That's all it took?
- Yes.

159
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:14,062
You barely slept, right?

160
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:18,361
We ended the shoot at the same time.

161
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:19,861
(Until this morning)

162
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:21,532
- We filmed it together.
- We filmed it all night.

163
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:22,833
- And I came here.
- Right.

164
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,502
He was worried about me.

165
00:07:26,602 --> 00:07:27,643
But I still had to come.

166
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:31,013
He was grumbling so much when he left.

167
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:34,182
And he is here working so hard. I admire you very much.

168
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:35,611
(Speechless)

169
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:38,152
- Chang Wook.
- I learn a lot from you.

170
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:41,523
(I learn a lot from you.)

171
00:07:41,622 --> 00:07:43,953
But how come your facial expressions...

172
00:07:44,552 --> 00:07:45,552
are so different?

173
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:48,222
- Gosh.
- You seem so at ease here.

174
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,562
Well, I come here to rest.

175
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:55,301
And Hee Won acts like he's the boss when I'm not around.

176
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:57,233
I can't bear to watch that. I had to come.

177
00:07:58,702 --> 00:07:59,972
People call it a three-day-long reign.

178
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:04,013
It was my kingdom for three and a half hours.

179
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:05,913
Just for three and a half hours.

180
00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:09,513
(Oh, Hee Won.)

181
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:14,922
What was that thing you brought? Snacks?

182
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:16,123
- Yes.
- What were they?

183
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:19,663
- Right. I...
- Why did you bring so many?

184
00:08:20,562 --> 00:08:22,123
- What's this?
- I'll tell you.

185
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:24,691
- I...
- What is that?

186
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:25,962
(A mysterious red object)

187
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:27,263
(Wait, that's...)

188
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:28,332
I'll tell you.

189
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:30,571
- It's the hoppang machine!
- Yes.

190
00:08:30,572 --> 00:08:32,201
(The hoppang machine)

191
00:08:32,202 --> 00:08:33,873
Hoppang machine!

192
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:35,742
- Because it's getting cold.
- Gosh.

193
00:08:35,743 --> 00:08:37,143
- That is huge.
- Gosh.

194
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:38,512
Get rid of all the snacks!

195
00:08:38,513 --> 00:08:39,912
(They don't matter anymore.)

196
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:41,311
What's the point?

197
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,752
- If I could just eat that...
- It's hoppang.

198
00:08:42,753 --> 00:08:44,811
(Hoppang is all we need.)

199
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:47,952
- It's a hoppang machine.
- Yes, it's a hoppang machine.

200
00:08:48,883 --> 00:08:49,892
Oh, boy.

201
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:51,321
- I brought it for you.
- You're amazing.

202
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,362
(Chang Wook's amazing gift for the family)

203
00:08:52,363 --> 00:08:55,763
To be frank, I've never used it before.

204
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,033
Then...

205
00:08:57,263 --> 00:08:58,662
We should pour water on the bottom.

206
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,263
- Yes.
- Right. We need to pour water.

207
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:04,172
- This is...
- It needs 1.5L.

208
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:07,571
- I should bring a whole bottle.
- Let's do that.

209
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:08,942
(They'll heat up hoppang right away.)

210
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:12,842
(Squirming)

211
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:18,312
(It seems like he's having problems.)

212
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:22,253
Where should we pour water into?

213
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:25,353
Should I just pour it here?

214
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:27,163
The power is...

215
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:28,191
(How do I turn it on?)

216
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,233
It's here.

217
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:32,503
There must be a manual.

218
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:33,932
There is no manual.

219
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,662
- There's no manual?
- No.

220
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:37,072
Come on. Let me see it.

221
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:40,102
I feel like it'll work.

222
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:41,403
(I don't think we're eating hoppang.)

223
00:09:42,513 --> 00:09:44,311
- Hang on.
- I got it.

224
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:45,312
- In here...
- I see it now.

225
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:48,243
- Open it, and pour it.
- That's right.

226
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:49,983
- We pour the water here.
- Yes.

227
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:52,282
Turn it back on.

228
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,383
(Now they just need to switch it on.)

229
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:56,722
Dong Il, the light went on.

230
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:58,691
- It's working.
- Yes. It's working.

231
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:00,291
Then we turn the power on.

232
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,393
- Oh, my.
- It works now.

233
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:03,162
- There.
- All right.

234
00:10:03,163 --> 00:10:05,863
(They managed to set it up.)

235
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:09,332
I never imagined.

236
00:10:09,873 --> 00:10:12,003
How much should we sell them for?

237
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:15,972
There was a manual, Dong Il.

238
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:18,811
It was here.

239
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:20,513
It tells you how to clean it too.

240
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:23,483
There was a manual. Oh, well.

241
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,883
Yes, that's how you turn it on.

242
00:10:27,682 --> 00:10:28,983
(Smiling)

243
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:31,623
(Laughing)

244
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:34,922
You did it the right way.

245
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,892
Let's put it in our room.

246
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:39,961
- Use it as a humidifier.
- It could work as a humidifier.

247
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:41,431
I told you. It is like a humidifier.

248
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,332
- A humidifier and a heater.
- It's perfect.

249
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:44,971
It's perfect.

250
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:46,671
(Hot)

251
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:49,373
If you want to eat it hot, this is the best way to keep it.

252
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:51,342
In about ten minutes...

253
00:10:51,643 --> 00:10:52,743
- Ten minutes?
- Yes.

254
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:55,441
- All right, then.
- Yes.

255
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:57,312
We had something we really wanted to give you.

256
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,452
Castella rice cake.

257
00:11:00,222 --> 00:11:01,383
That's tasty.

258
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:03,153
How do you know?

259
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:06,562
Of course, I've tried it.

260
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:08,493
Where is it famous?

261
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:10,763
They sell it in Gangnam and everywhere.

262
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:13,962
(Flustered)

263
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:17,072
- They sell it in Seoul?
- Of course.

264
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:18,572
What?

265
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:22,442
They sold it in Gangnam,

266
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:23,773
and we brought it here.

267
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:26,582
(Laughing)

268
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:29,142
We ordered it in advance.

269
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:31,451
- Where did you get it?
- It's famous in Yeongju.

270
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:33,052
- In Yeongju?
- Yes.

271
00:11:41,523 --> 00:11:42,592
Dip it in honey.

272
00:11:43,062 --> 00:11:44,492
- There are rice puffs.
- Try those too.

273
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:46,562
Dip it in honey. Oh, my.

274
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:49,331
Thank you.

275
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:50,373
(The younger one first)

276
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:52,842
If you take care of him, what does that make us?

277
00:11:53,403 --> 00:11:55,912
(A good brother)

278
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:56,942
Try it.

279
00:11:57,472 --> 00:12:00,341
The rice puffs are not too sweet, so I keep eating them.

280
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:01,612
- Exactly.
- The rice puffs.

281
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:03,182
(Chang Wook also tries rice puffs with buckwheat honey.)

282
00:12:04,913 --> 00:12:07,421
- It's really good, isn't it?
- It's very sweet.

283
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:08,653
(It's very sweet.)

284
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:10,292
It's delicious.

285
00:12:10,293 --> 00:12:12,523
(Delicious)

286
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:17,591
(Youngest puts the whole thing in his mouth.)

287
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:21,133
(I'll melt it in my mouth.)

288
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:24,702
How long has it been since you watched the bonfire?

289
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:27,572
Well, it's been...

290
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:29,542
a month?

291
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:30,772
What?

292
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:31,872
(A month?)

293
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:34,482
I often went camping.

294
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:37,883
It was for my personal Youtube channel.

295
00:12:38,613 --> 00:12:40,082
Right. You have some equipment.

296
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:41,653
And the car.

297
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:43,622
- A trailer.
- Yes.

298
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:46,722
- I go camping in my trailer.
- He even has a trailer.

299
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:48,921
Do you have the license for the trailer?

300
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:50,292
Yes, I have the license.

301
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:55,003
(Chang Wook, a free man)

302
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:57,572
Are you good at driving it? It's really hard.

303
00:12:57,972 --> 00:12:59,773
I'm pretty good at it.

304
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:02,942
Then you can drive our house too.

305
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:06,113
- Oh, is it a trailer?
- It's a trailer.

306
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,842
You bet. I can drive that.

307
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:11,452
Oh, you drove it with that car. I can do that.

308
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,253
We found the right guy.

309
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:22,392
(It is their first time to have a guest...)

310
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:23,492
(who goes camping on a trailer.)

311
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:24,763
It's hot.

312
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,202
- It is.
- I like it.

313
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:27,932
It's warm.

314
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,032
(They're dazed, looking at the bonfire.)

315
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:31,171
To get warmed up...

316
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:32,273
(They all think the same thing.)

317
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:36,072
(Glancing)

318
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:43,052
Should we do the surprise? Chang Wook hasn't seen it.

319
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:46,253
- Oh, that.
- Let's show him before bed.

320
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:48,782
(What kind of surprise?)

321
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:49,853
What is it?

322
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:52,722
(Getting up)

323
00:13:53,462 --> 00:13:54,492
(Sneaky)

324
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:56,432
Is this illegal? Why would you block the view?

325
00:13:57,432 --> 00:14:00,863
(The hosts seem suspicious.)

326
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:04,302
(What's going on?)

327
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:07,143
It's cheating if you look. Get ready.

328
00:14:07,342 --> 00:14:08,671
It's cheating if I look?

329
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:10,273
(Laughing)

330
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:12,542
- There.
- There.

331
00:14:12,743 --> 00:14:14,042
- Look natural.
- Okay.

332
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:16,912
Let's go.

333
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:18,252
(Walking slowly)

334
00:14:18,253 --> 00:14:20,752
- Put your hands in your pockets.
- Gosh.

335
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:22,952
(A very unnatural entrance)

336
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:26,523
Go over there. Stand next to him.

337
00:14:26,962 --> 00:14:28,792
Show!

338
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:34,603
(We're back.)

339
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:45,072
(With Dong Il's shout as the last one, )

340
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:48,513
(they throw the magic powder.)

341
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:51,383
What is that?

342
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:55,783
(Change, fire!)

343
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:00,662
(Volunteering to do an encore)

344
00:15:00,663 --> 00:15:01,722
Gosh.

345
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:04,592
- What do you think?
- This was a fire show.

346
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:06,431
- Are you laughing at us?
- A fire show.

347
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:07,603
- No, I'm not.
- Gosh.

348
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:10,572
Our total age is a hundred something.

349
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:12,402
Thank you so much.

350
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:14,103
I wasn't that eager compared to before though.

351
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,441
I'm tired.

352
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:17,972
We're the only ones who can do it in the whole world.

353
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:20,982
In the whole world. Just the three of us.

354
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:23,653
- It turned green and blue.
- You could see it, right?

355
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:25,912
- I should have taken pictures.
- You can take them now.

356
00:15:25,913 --> 00:15:26,922
Take them now.

357
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:29,052
- It must last long.
- If you like it,

358
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:31,493
we can do it ten more times until you leave tomorrow.

359
00:15:32,052 --> 00:15:33,162
Ten more times?

360
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:35,062
(Excuse me?)

361
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:38,461
I'll take out the hoppang, so give me a shout.

362
00:15:38,462 --> 00:15:39,903
Give me a shout for hoppang.

363
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:42,603
(Shutting his eyes tightly)

364
00:15:43,503 --> 00:15:44,873
How many times does he have to do it?

365
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:47,841
Why did I do that earlier?

366
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:50,643
(Why did I do that earlier?)

367
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:53,442
- I'm exhausted.
- Come on.

368
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:56,312
- Give me a shout for hoppang.
- Why did I do that earlier?

369
00:15:57,682 --> 00:15:58,711
Mr. Magician.

370
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:00,023
(Gathering his energy)

371
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:01,921
(Impressed)

372
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:02,951
(Losing energy)

373
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:04,023
I'm so tired.

374
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:05,551
All right.

375
00:16:05,552 --> 00:16:08,222
(Opening the door thanks to the fire magician)

376
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:13,932
(The steam from hoppang)

377
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:15,961
That steam.

378
00:16:15,962 --> 00:16:16,972
(It looks tasty.)

379
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:19,273
How much is it for one?

380
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:21,172
It's 1.2 dollars.

381
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:26,882
(Freshly-steamed hoppang to melt their bodies)

382
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:28,242
It looks beautiful.

383
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:30,153
(Steaming)

384
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:33,451
Look at that.

385
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:34,853
(Packed with red beans)

386
00:16:35,682 --> 00:16:39,393
(A big bite while it's still hot)

387
00:16:40,323 --> 00:16:42,691
(Youngest blows on the hot hoppang.)

388
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:45,462
Back in my day, we couldn't...

389
00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:48,231
- It's hot.
- buy these that easily.

390
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:49,603
So we even ate the stuff on the wrapping paper.

391
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:52,403
I also had to lick the castella powder of the castella cakes.

392
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:58,542
(Thanks to Chang Wook's present, they get warm and feel happy.)

393
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:00,613
This is really nice.

394
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,512
Let's listen to Chang Wook's favorite song and eat it.

395
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:08,751
Well...

396
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:09,922
Let's gaze at the fire before we go to sleep.

397
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:14,322
I listened to this song a lot when I was in the military.

398
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:15,323
In the military?

399
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:17,893
He used to listen to this song in the military. Play it.

400
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:20,962
Turn it up a little.

401
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:23,603
The beat is intense.

402
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:27,572
I love this song.

403
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:29,042
- Really?
- It's "Today"...

404
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,642
- That's right.
- by O.WHEN.

405
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:33,242
- Gosh.
- Turn that off.

406
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:37,751
(It's 4am, I can't fall asleep)

407
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:40,022
- "It's 4am, I can't fall asleep." - Why's that?

408
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:44,293
(Because I have to think back on the moments I can't go back.)

409
00:17:44,623 --> 00:17:46,421
(He's so into it.)

410
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:48,491
Take it easy

411
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:52,262
(Showing off his sweet voice)

412
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:54,302
(Glancing)

413
00:17:54,303 --> 00:17:56,632
(And...)

414
00:17:56,633 --> 00:18:00,543
(There's one person who's deeply into it.)

415
00:18:01,143 --> 00:18:04,573
- All right. Let's go to bed.
- Tonight

416
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:08,142
- Doesn't it feel warm already?
- It does.

417
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:10,712
- Is that so?
- Right? Once you walk in here...

418
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,122
My goodness.

419
00:18:14,123 --> 00:18:15,982
(Chang Wook and Myoung get ready to sleep.)

420
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:18,951
- It's really comfortable up there.
- I know, right?

421
00:18:18,952 --> 00:18:20,692
- This is nice.
- Right. It's nice.

422
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:24,491
I snore, so please bear with me today.

423
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:25,492
All right.

424
00:18:25,493 --> 00:18:27,232
- Let's sleep.
- Should I turn off the lights?

425
00:18:27,462 --> 00:18:28,562
- Turn them off.
- Are we all set?

426
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:30,172
- I'm turning off the lights.
- Okay.

427
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,403
- Okay.
- Okay. Great.

428
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:35,202
Good night.

429
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,042
- Good night.
- Good night.

430
00:18:38,043 --> 00:18:42,182
(The night in Yeongju wears on.)

431
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:46,652
(It is the dawn...)

432
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:50,053
(when the sky turns red.)

433
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:57,432
(The day breaks in the front yard too.)

434
00:18:58,492 --> 00:19:00,633
(Clicking)

435
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:02,761
(Dong Il woke up early as always.)

436
00:19:02,762 --> 00:19:04,903
(I woke up 1st again!)

437
00:19:04,972 --> 00:19:07,702
(It's 6:23am.)

438
00:19:08,472 --> 00:19:10,442
(Safely filmed with permission from the owner)

439
00:19:10,843 --> 00:19:14,043
(Dong Il lights up the front yard as soon as he gets up.)

440
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:17,282
(Snoring)

441
00:19:18,153 --> 00:19:22,653
(Other members are still in a deep sleep.)

442
00:19:24,222 --> 00:19:28,222
(They are still asleep.)

443
00:19:29,123 --> 00:19:32,032
(Then...)

444
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:35,563
(Focusing)

445
00:19:35,663 --> 00:19:39,202
(He plays a song to wake them up.)

446
00:19:40,073 --> 00:19:42,343
(For the members who are sleeping soundly, )

447
00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:43,941
(it's just a lullaby.)

448
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:46,441
(Snoring)

449
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:48,042
(Emotional)

450
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:52,413
(He decided to have fun by himself.)

451
00:19:53,553 --> 00:19:54,751
(He got pretty excited in the early morning.)

452
00:19:54,752 --> 00:19:57,722
(Excited)

453
00:19:58,452 --> 00:20:00,221
(He spends quite a long time.)

454
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:02,492
(Roses bloom)

455
00:20:03,393 --> 00:20:06,502
(He feels bored.)

456
00:20:07,232 --> 00:20:09,403
(Lonely)

457
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:13,403
(Fiddling)

458
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,612
(Crowing sound)

459
00:20:17,613 --> 00:20:19,672
(Satisfied)

460
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:23,752
(He uses the sound of nature instead of an alarm.)

461
00:20:24,282 --> 00:20:25,282
(Flinching)

462
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:28,053
(Crowing sound)

463
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:33,262
(It makes Myoung wriggle.)

464
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:38,492
(He even goes inside the house.)

465
00:20:39,163 --> 00:20:41,132
(Dog barking)

466
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:44,032
(The sound of nature, version 2)

467
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,643
(What's this sound?)

468
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:49,542
(Chang Wook wakes up with a confused look.)

469
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:51,613
(Dazed)

470
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,941
(Myoung wakes up as well.)

471
00:20:54,942 --> 00:20:56,782
(Scratching)

472
00:20:56,913 --> 00:20:59,252
Gosh. Why are there so many dogs in the neighborhood?

473
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:00,681
Tell me about it.

474
00:21:00,682 --> 00:21:01,883
(Playing innocent)

475
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:05,623
(Chuckling)

476
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:08,762
- Are they fighting or something?
- I think so.

477
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:10,562
I think the dogs are fighting.

478
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:11,863
(He starts to act.)

479
00:21:11,992 --> 00:21:15,563
(Was that the sound of dogs fighting?)

480
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:20,202
(Dong Il wakes them up successfully.)

481
00:21:21,303 --> 00:21:22,741
(Grunting)

482
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:23,772
What's wrong?

483
00:21:25,813 --> 00:21:27,482
I feel pain in my chest.

484
00:21:28,313 --> 00:21:29,882
- You feel pain in the chest?
- Yes.

485
00:21:29,883 --> 00:21:31,113
- Really?
- Yes.

486
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:33,921
(Then...)

487
00:21:33,922 --> 00:21:35,921
Nam Jin's "Broken Heart".

488
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:37,522
(Therapeutic song)

489
00:21:38,853 --> 00:21:41,622
(With a perfect song choice, )

490
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:43,362
(the patient gets up right away.)

491
00:21:43,363 --> 00:21:45,563
- Why do you have pain in the chest?
- I don't know.

492
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:52,032
(Between you)

493
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:55,903
(And me)

494
00:22:00,143 --> 00:22:01,143
(Hee Won loves the song choice.)

495
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:03,553
(Dong Il knows him well.)

496
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:07,522
(Waving the wake-up flag)

497
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,292
(Chang Wook approaches them.)

498
00:22:11,293 --> 00:22:13,623
(Falling down)

499
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:18,532
(They all start the morning energetically.)

500
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:20,931
I should cook the rice first.

501
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:23,732
(Dong Il goes into the kitchen in a hurry.)

502
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,402
I'll cook the rice quickly.

503
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:28,103
(I'll cook the rice quickly.)

504
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:32,113
Gosh. Look at those beans. Rice with beans will be delicious.

505
00:22:33,313 --> 00:22:35,312
(Yeongju beans, Yeongju's specialty, )

506
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,482
(are thick and have a soft texture.)

507
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:40,951
Let's soak these in water before we go to sleep.

508
00:22:40,952 --> 00:22:43,053
We can cook rice with these beans for breakfast tomorrow.

509
00:22:43,393 --> 00:22:44,692
- Aren't these pretty?
- Gosh.

510
00:22:45,252 --> 00:22:46,293
These are Yeongju beans.

511
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:51,792
(They soaked the Yeongju beans overnight.)

512
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:53,501
Goodness. They are well soaked.

513
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:55,103
(They are well soaked.)

514
00:22:55,962 --> 00:23:00,472
(Meanwhile, Chang Wook woke up against his will.)

515
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:03,913
(Dazed)

516
00:23:04,742 --> 00:23:06,441
I'm still half awake.

517
00:23:06,442 --> 00:23:09,543
(He makes a confession.)

518
00:23:09,913 --> 00:23:11,681
(In the end, )

519
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,123
(he lies down again.)

520
00:23:14,722 --> 00:23:16,251
(Wriggling)

521
00:23:16,252 --> 00:23:19,853
(While Chang Wook tries to wake up...)

522
00:23:20,262 --> 00:23:26,032
(Adding a generous amount of savory Yeongju beans)

523
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:27,702
This is going to be delicious.

524
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,732
Multigrain rice.

525
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:33,542
- What are you making?
- The rice cooker is on.

526
00:23:33,543 --> 00:23:35,072
- I'll make a simple breakfast.
- Yes.

527
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:37,742
I'll make a simple dish made with gochujang.

528
00:23:37,972 --> 00:23:39,313
- Gochujang stew.
- With gochujang?

529
00:23:39,472 --> 00:23:40,482
I see.

530
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:42,083
It's my wife's recipe.

531
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,682
Since you went camping a lot...

532
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:48,452
- If gochujang is famous here...
- Right.

533
00:23:48,823 --> 00:23:50,521
How about gochujang stew?

534
00:23:50,522 --> 00:23:52,292
- Gochujang stew? That sounds good.
- Gochujang stew.

535
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:53,421
Shall we make gochujang stew then?

536
00:23:53,422 --> 00:23:55,092
- Let's make it spicy.
- Spicy gochujang stew.

537
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:56,633
- Gochujang stew for breakfast.
- Gochujang stew. Okay.

538
00:23:57,633 --> 00:23:59,262
We brought some gochujang from the front yard.

539
00:23:59,532 --> 00:24:02,002
I cooked breakfast with that.

540
00:24:02,663 --> 00:24:05,132
- Gochujang here really is the best.
- Right.

541
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:06,942
- It's a work of art.
- It's really delicious.

542
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:08,073
Right.

543
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:11,271
(Mix the thick soup with rice, )

544
00:24:11,272 --> 00:24:13,282
(and you'll empty a bowl of rice in no time.)

545
00:24:13,883 --> 00:24:15,741
(Spicy and thick gochujang stew...)

546
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:17,982
(which is to Chang Wook's taste.)

547
00:24:18,353 --> 00:24:19,952
- Chang Wook.
- Yes?

548
00:24:20,682 --> 00:24:24,053
I'll make an amazing gochujang stew for you.

549
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:26,352
(He approaches Dong Il quietly.)

550
00:24:26,353 --> 00:24:27,462
What's this?

551
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:31,292
- It's gochujang, isn't it?
- This is gochujang.

552
00:24:31,293 --> 00:24:32,431
(Fresh gochujang from the front yard)

553
00:24:32,432 --> 00:24:34,431
- It's really hard to get.
- I see.

554
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,431
I scooped it up from the crock outside.

555
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:37,803
(Boasting)

556
00:24:38,532 --> 00:24:40,802
It's made with this year's fresh red chilis.

557
00:24:40,803 --> 00:24:41,902
(Adding a generous amount of fresh gochujang)

558
00:24:41,903 --> 00:24:43,413
- Gosh.
- It's made with fresh red chilis.

559
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:46,211
- It looks good.
- Right.

560
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:48,642
- What about this water?
- It's rice water.

561
00:24:48,643 --> 00:24:50,152
I see. You're using rice water.

562
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:52,313
- It's my wife's recipe.
- I see.

563
00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:54,652
Since Chang Wook is here,

564
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:57,353
I should make a delicious breakfast.

565
00:24:57,893 --> 00:24:59,251
- You add doenjang too?
- I add this to gochujang stew.

566
00:24:59,252 --> 00:25:01,323
- You add doenjang in the broth?
- Yes.

567
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:04,663
(It looks delicious.)

568
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:06,392
(Wearing gloves)

569
00:25:06,393 --> 00:25:08,002
(While Dong Il makes the broth for stew...)

570
00:25:09,163 --> 00:25:10,471
(Cutting)

571
00:25:10,472 --> 00:25:11,572
It's rice water.

572
00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:13,102
(Myoung prepares the ingredients.)

573
00:25:13,103 --> 00:25:14,103
Good.

574
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:18,873
(Dong Il cuts the ingredients that Myoung prepared.)

575
00:25:19,212 --> 00:25:20,642
(Cutting and peeling)

576
00:25:20,643 --> 00:25:23,613
Gosh. We have perfect teamwork.

577
00:25:24,282 --> 00:25:27,922
(Harmonious)

578
00:25:28,383 --> 00:25:29,421
Thank you.

579
00:25:29,422 --> 00:25:31,553
(He's the Golden Youngest.)

580
00:25:32,252 --> 00:25:33,421
Potatoes.

581
00:25:33,422 --> 00:25:34,922
(Thanks to Youngest, everything goes smoothly.)

582
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:37,032
- Beef shank.
- Beef shank.

583
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:38,731
Is that it?

584
00:25:38,732 --> 00:25:41,532
Beef shank enhances the flavor.

585
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:44,002
Good. Do we have some beef brisket?

586
00:25:44,202 --> 00:25:45,531
This one is beef brisket.

587
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:47,201
- Beef brisket.
- Beef brisket.

588
00:25:47,202 --> 00:25:48,843
(Adding a generous amount of savory beef brisket)

589
00:25:49,272 --> 00:25:50,741
(Adding red chili powder for spicy flavor)

590
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:52,742
(Myoung waits while holding the lid.)

591
00:25:53,172 --> 00:25:54,441
(The key is to simmer it over a low fire for a long time.)

592
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:56,913
We should simmer it until it gets thicker.

593
00:25:57,712 --> 00:25:59,352
We should fold the comforters.

594
00:25:59,353 --> 00:26:01,422
(Hee Won and Chang Wook are folding the comforters.)

595
00:26:01,853 --> 00:26:03,221
(Chang Wook holds the upper part.)

596
00:26:03,222 --> 00:26:04,893
(Hee Won holds the lower part.)

597
00:26:06,353 --> 00:26:08,162
(Working hard)

598
00:26:08,163 --> 00:26:11,133
(Wriggling)

599
00:26:11,432 --> 00:26:15,063
(He rolls the mat using his whole body.)

600
00:26:15,432 --> 00:26:17,201
(Why would he try that hard?)

601
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:18,702
I can really roll this.

602
00:26:20,272 --> 00:26:24,543
(He managed to arrange all the comforters.)

603
00:26:24,913 --> 00:26:28,043
(A camper can't take a break in the morning.)

604
00:26:28,482 --> 00:26:31,653
(He makes a fire easily.)

605
00:26:32,113 --> 00:26:33,451
(Approaching)

606
00:26:33,452 --> 00:26:35,553
Do you want it spicy?

607
00:26:35,982 --> 00:26:37,052
- Or...
- Please make it spicy.

608
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,452
- Spicy? Okay.
- Right.

609
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:41,792
Since it's morning, I want to have it spicy.

610
00:26:41,793 --> 00:26:42,823
Great.

611
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:44,962
It smells good.

612
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:46,962
- Can I taste it?
- Do you want to?

613
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,133
- I want to try it.
- We need to simmer it.

614
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,333
It tastes bitter.

615
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:51,932
It tastes a bit bitter.

616
00:26:51,932 --> 00:26:52,932
(Curiosity got the better of him, and he takes a bite.)

617
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:54,072
It's spicy.

618
00:26:54,073 --> 00:26:55,103
You must be a good cook, Chang Wook.

619
00:26:55,543 --> 00:26:56,603
- Me?
- Since you go camping often.

620
00:26:57,413 --> 00:26:58,442
You should...

621
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:00,643
make a dish for dinner.

622
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:02,142
- Should I make a dish?
- Right.

623
00:27:02,143 --> 00:27:03,212
What kind of dish do you want me to make?

624
00:27:04,653 --> 00:27:05,681
Can you make a Korean course meal?

625
00:27:05,682 --> 00:27:07,653
(Korean course meal?)

626
00:27:08,823 --> 00:27:10,521
- Something like japchae.
- No.

627
00:27:10,522 --> 00:27:11,852
(Shaking his head)

628
00:27:11,853 --> 00:27:12,853
You can't?

629
00:27:12,854 --> 00:27:15,492
- Chang Wook is going to cook?
- Yes. He's going to make something.

630
00:27:16,123 --> 00:27:17,293
Just make something simple.

631
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:19,731
- Rice cake ramyeon?
- What?

632
00:27:19,732 --> 00:27:21,261
- Rice cake ramyeon.
- Don't you think that's too simple?

633
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:24,472
(He changes his attitude.)

634
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:29,302
(Rice cake ramyeon is off the table.)

635
00:27:29,303 --> 00:27:30,313
What should I cook then?

636
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:32,642
- Just cook something simple.
- Something simple?

637
00:27:32,643 --> 00:27:34,442
(Something simple)

638
00:27:35,343 --> 00:27:36,853
How about soup? Seaweed soup.

639
00:27:37,012 --> 00:27:39,052
That sounds good. Warm seaweed soup would be nice.

640
00:27:39,053 --> 00:27:40,053
(His eyes are glowing.)

641
00:27:40,054 --> 00:27:41,252
- Seaweed soup sounds great.
- Seaweed soup?

642
00:27:41,853 --> 00:27:42,853
I can put beef in it.

643
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,893
(Nodding in approval)

644
00:27:45,153 --> 00:27:46,552
Right. Seaweed soup.

645
00:27:46,553 --> 00:27:48,063
- Seaweed soup.
- That would be good.

646
00:27:49,022 --> 00:27:50,793
The sun is up.

647
00:27:51,863 --> 00:27:53,332
It should. Chang Wook is here.

648
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,862
(The morning sun shines over the crocks in the front yard.)

649
00:27:54,863 --> 00:27:55,932
This is nice.

650
00:27:56,932 --> 00:27:58,671
- The weather is beautiful today.
- Right.

651
00:27:58,672 --> 00:28:00,902
- It was good yesterday as well.
- It's warm.

652
00:28:00,903 --> 00:28:02,302
(The crocks receive the energy of morning too.)

653
00:28:02,303 --> 00:28:04,972
- I love this morning.
- This is nice.

654
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:07,612
- This is amazing.
- It's really great.

655
00:28:07,613 --> 00:28:08,712
(The morning with Chang Wook has begun.)

656
00:28:09,242 --> 00:28:10,451
(The rice is done.)

657
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:11,681
(The rice with Yeongju beans is ready right on time.)

658
00:28:11,682 --> 00:28:14,123
Oh, right. The rice. Stir the rice, Myoung.

659
00:28:14,282 --> 00:28:15,353
Yes.

660
00:28:15,623 --> 00:28:17,451
- Stir it. I added a lot of beans.
- Gosh.

661
00:28:17,452 --> 00:28:18,492
(They all gather in front of the rice cooker.)

662
00:28:18,853 --> 00:28:21,421
(The rice with Yeongju beans is cooked well.)

663
00:28:21,422 --> 00:28:22,422
Rice with beans.

664
00:28:22,423 --> 00:28:24,333
- This is amazing.
- Stir it.

665
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,333
This is crazy.

666
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:27,732
(It looks delicious.)

667
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,271
(While they are impressed by the rice...)

668
00:28:30,272 --> 00:28:31,731
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

669
00:28:31,732 --> 00:28:33,202
(Opening the refrigerator)

670
00:28:33,742 --> 00:28:38,442
(Rummaging)

671
00:28:38,972 --> 00:28:40,043
It's okay.

672
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,481
Let's close the door.

673
00:28:41,482 --> 00:28:43,512
(Scallions and Cheongyang chili?)

674
00:28:43,853 --> 00:28:46,653
(That must be...)

675
00:28:47,022 --> 00:28:49,122
Cheongyang chili.

676
00:28:49,123 --> 00:28:50,593
(This combination is familiar.)

677
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:54,021
When you make a rolled omelet...

678
00:28:54,022 --> 00:28:55,022
(When you make a rolled omelet...)

679
00:28:55,023 --> 00:28:56,063
Yes?

680
00:28:56,293 --> 00:28:59,633
You must chop up the vegetables when you make a rolled omelet.

681
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:01,432
You must...

682
00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:03,833
(As soon as he starts cooking...)

683
00:29:04,432 --> 00:29:07,742
(It looks like a mess.)

684
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:13,242
(But Hee Won's rolled omelet tasted surprisingly delicious.)

685
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:19,413
(He got confident.)

686
00:29:19,752 --> 00:29:21,622
(Hee Won's 2nd attempt to make a rolled omelet.)

687
00:29:21,623 --> 00:29:23,353
I've only heard about it.

688
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:25,721
Are you going to make the giant rolled omelet?

689
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,893
(He tries to make the giant rolled omelet.)

690
00:29:28,663 --> 00:29:32,363
(He chooses the right spot first.)

691
00:29:32,793 --> 00:29:33,833
- Bring them here.
- Yes.

692
00:29:34,303 --> 00:29:35,802
Right. Put them here.

693
00:29:35,803 --> 00:29:37,333
(A big cutting board, a big bowl, and a tray of eggs)

694
00:29:38,303 --> 00:29:39,731
Scallions and Cheongyang chilis...

695
00:29:39,732 --> 00:29:42,241
(He's going to use four Cheongyang chilis and a scallion.)

696
00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:43,303
This would be enough, right?

697
00:29:43,942 --> 00:29:45,642
(Busy)

698
00:29:45,643 --> 00:29:47,343
- Seriously.
- This will do.

699
00:29:47,883 --> 00:29:50,043
- They are overdoing it.
- Dong Il.

700
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:52,451
- Hee Won.
- What?

701
00:29:52,452 --> 00:29:53,481
(Here are your gloves, Chef.)

702
00:29:53,482 --> 00:29:54,553
Wait a bit.

703
00:29:55,123 --> 00:29:57,022
- What else do you need?
- What else?

704
00:29:57,153 --> 00:29:58,793
(Glancing)

705
00:29:59,022 --> 00:30:00,222
These eggs...

706
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:03,461
You can crack and beat them.

707
00:30:03,462 --> 00:30:04,462
- Sure.
- Good.

708
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:08,063
(I'll chop the ingredients. You're in charge of the eggs.)

709
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:10,702
(Last time)

710
00:30:11,573 --> 00:30:13,742
(It was a lonely battle with eggs.)

711
00:30:15,002 --> 00:30:17,272
(Struggling)

712
00:30:17,672 --> 00:30:19,241
(Just chopping up the ingredients took a considerable amount of time.)

713
00:30:19,242 --> 00:30:21,242
(Gosh. This is...)

714
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:24,682
(It was a long battle of his own.)

715
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:29,522
(Today, he shares the work with his sous-chef.)

716
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,252
Dong Il, the rolled omelet will be ready in no time.

717
00:30:32,922 --> 00:30:33,992
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

718
00:30:34,363 --> 00:30:35,562
(Chopping into small pieces)

719
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:36,722
When you make a rolled omelet,

720
00:30:37,563 --> 00:30:41,062
you need to chop the vegetables into tiny pieces.

721
00:30:41,063 --> 00:30:42,132
I see.

722
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:45,073
You need to make them almost invisible. That's the key.

723
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:46,602
That way, you can roll it easily.

724
00:30:46,603 --> 00:30:48,143
(He shares his know-how.)

725
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,941
(Cutting passionately)

726
00:30:50,942 --> 00:30:52,143
(Exhaling deeply)

727
00:30:52,442 --> 00:30:57,383
(Rattling sound)

728
00:30:58,712 --> 00:31:00,211
You should use chopsticks.

729
00:31:00,212 --> 00:31:01,353
(Stern)

730
00:31:01,553 --> 00:31:03,823
(He beats the eggs with a spoon.)

731
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:07,292
(You must have not seen how I did it, Myoung.)

732
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:09,462
(I'm a cook.)

733
00:31:10,222 --> 00:31:11,363
Is that so?

734
00:31:11,462 --> 00:31:13,492
You don't know how to do it, right?

735
00:31:14,863 --> 00:31:17,972
My gosh. Myoung doesn't know how to beat eggs.

736
00:31:18,603 --> 00:31:19,931
You haven't done it before.

737
00:31:19,932 --> 00:31:21,543
(I will show you how it's done.)

738
00:31:21,843 --> 00:31:22,872
You should do it with chopsticks.

739
00:31:22,873 --> 00:31:25,073
(Chuckling)

740
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:28,442
Do you like rolled omelets, Chang Wook?

741
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:30,313
I love it.

742
00:31:30,314 --> 00:31:31,353
- Is that so?
- Yes.

743
00:31:32,413 --> 00:31:33,481
(He switches arms.)

744
00:31:33,482 --> 00:31:34,482
Great.

745
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:37,491
- Great.
- I'll do my best...

746
00:31:37,492 --> 00:31:38,522
to make you a rolled omelet.

747
00:31:38,952 --> 00:31:40,251
I'll finely chop these vegetables.

748
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:41,261
(I'll make the giant rolled omelet for you.)

749
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:42,293
Gosh.

750
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:44,893
Look at him grunting after doing that.

751
00:31:45,532 --> 00:31:46,962
(Grunting)

752
00:31:47,603 --> 00:31:51,932
(The members are all busy in their positions.)

753
00:31:53,472 --> 00:31:55,171
- Should I do something?
- What are you going to do?

754
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:56,403
(I want to do something too.)

755
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,912
(Approaching)

756
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:01,012
(All through the morning, Chang Wook was...)

757
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:04,083
(He showed interest in here and there.)

758
00:32:04,782 --> 00:32:07,682
(I want to do something too.)

759
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:11,092
(Chang Wook cooks cool dishes when he goes camping.)

760
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:13,222
(I poured olive oil.)

761
00:32:13,722 --> 00:32:14,991
(He can cook meat.)

762
00:32:14,992 --> 00:32:16,522
(This is amazing.)

763
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:19,192
(He can cook grilled mackerel.)

764
00:32:19,863 --> 00:32:21,532
(It looks delicious, right?)

765
00:32:22,202 --> 00:32:23,632
(This is salt.)

766
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:25,403
(He seasons his dishes with salt.)

767
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:26,903
(Add salt like this.)

768
00:32:27,343 --> 00:32:28,343
(Salt)

769
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:29,543
(Salt)

770
00:32:29,942 --> 00:32:33,143
(He seasons all his dishes with salt.)

771
00:32:33,343 --> 00:32:38,712
(He cooks nonchalantly.)

772
00:32:39,252 --> 00:32:40,282
(Exclaiming)

773
00:32:40,653 --> 00:32:41,682
This looks delicious.

774
00:32:42,823 --> 00:32:44,893
- Should I do something?
- What do you want to do?

775
00:32:45,452 --> 00:32:47,163
Well, what should I do to help?

776
00:32:47,623 --> 00:32:48,663
- You?
- Yes.

777
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:52,063
Sir-fry this in this pan.

778
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:54,532
It looks delicious.

779
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:56,562
- What?
- It looks delicious.

780
00:32:56,563 --> 00:32:58,201
Wait.

781
00:32:58,202 --> 00:32:59,271
Okay.

782
00:32:59,272 --> 00:33:01,643
(While Dong Il cuts the beef brisket...)

783
00:33:03,403 --> 00:33:06,512
(Making the sizzling sound)

784
00:33:07,182 --> 00:33:11,252
(He practices hard without turning on the gas stove.)

785
00:33:11,712 --> 00:33:14,383
(Dong Il didn't know Chang Wook was this cute.)

786
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:16,622
(He turns on the gas stove first.)

787
00:33:16,623 --> 00:33:17,692
Good.

788
00:33:17,893 --> 00:33:20,792
(Adding a piece of butter)

789
00:33:20,793 --> 00:33:21,862
It's melting.

790
00:33:21,863 --> 00:33:22,893
- Is it melting?
- Yes.

791
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,832
(The savory smell increases appetite.)

792
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,163
- It smells savory.
- Is that so?

793
00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:30,362
(He adds salt which is his specialty.)

794
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:33,672
That was cool. The way you added the salt.

795
00:33:33,673 --> 00:33:34,673
Of course.

796
00:33:36,702 --> 00:33:38,873
I think it's well cooked, Dong Il.

797
00:33:39,873 --> 00:33:42,143
(He tastes it as soon as it's cooked.)

798
00:33:43,742 --> 00:33:44,813
Gosh. This is good.

799
00:33:45,913 --> 00:33:48,152
My goodness. This is so good.

800
00:33:49,523 --> 00:33:52,423
Stir-fried beef brisket with butter.

801
00:33:52,793 --> 00:33:53,893
Gosh. This is so good.

802
00:33:54,193 --> 00:33:55,222
- Really?
- Yes.

803
00:33:55,793 --> 00:33:57,431
(He eats the dropped food too.)

804
00:33:57,432 --> 00:33:58,563
Is it good? How is it?

805
00:33:58,793 --> 00:33:59,861
It's so good.

806
00:33:59,862 --> 00:34:01,862
(It's so good.)

807
00:34:02,802 --> 00:34:04,301
Gosh. It's amazing.

808
00:34:04,302 --> 00:34:05,302
(Chang Wook cooked it well.)

809
00:34:06,202 --> 00:34:07,202
Try this.

810
00:34:07,203 --> 00:34:08,841
(Dong Il thinks of the members when he eats something delicious.)

811
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:11,072
(Goodness. It's beef!)

812
00:34:12,072 --> 00:34:13,172
It's extremely delicious.

813
00:34:13,173 --> 00:34:14,443
(Baby birds)

814
00:34:14,842 --> 00:34:17,253
(Savoring)

815
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:21,382
- Gosh, it's so good. It's savory.
- Right.

816
00:34:22,152 --> 00:34:23,321
It smells so good.

817
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:24,693
- It smells good?
- Yes. It smells so good.

818
00:34:25,253 --> 00:34:26,253
The butter smells so...

819
00:34:26,923 --> 00:34:27,923
It has a sweet smell.

820
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:30,732
(Meanwhile, the members who are making the rolled omelet...)

821
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:31,761
(Groaning)

822
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:33,531
(Meanwhile, the members who are making the rolled omelet...)

823
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:34,532
(Grunting)

824
00:34:35,932 --> 00:34:38,773
(Chopping)

825
00:34:39,432 --> 00:34:40,602
(Switching arms)

826
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:43,443
(This side)

827
00:34:43,773 --> 00:34:46,273
(This time, he uses the other arm.)

828
00:34:46,572 --> 00:34:47,643
Gosh. My arm hurts.

829
00:34:49,342 --> 00:34:51,852
(He feels dizzy after beating the eggs so many times.)

830
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:54,652
(He used the whole tray of eggs.)

831
00:34:56,023 --> 00:34:58,692
Hey. It looks like you guys are making dumpling fillings.

832
00:34:58,693 --> 00:35:00,052
- Yes?
- Dumpling fillings.

833
00:35:00,322 --> 00:35:01,492
This is how you make a rolled omelet.

834
00:35:01,992 --> 00:35:03,892
You need to finely chop the vegetables...

835
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,963
until they are squashed like this.

836
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:09,103
That is why I'm doing this so hard.

837
00:35:09,463 --> 00:35:12,333
(Shaking)

838
00:35:12,873 --> 00:35:15,103
(He uses his last bit of energy.)

839
00:35:15,802 --> 00:35:16,873
Done.

840
00:35:17,072 --> 00:35:19,241
(He finally gets up.)

841
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,242
Bring it closer.

842
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:24,152
(Precious chopped vegetables)

843
00:35:24,512 --> 00:35:26,052
Every piece of it.

844
00:35:27,012 --> 00:35:28,552
Here. All of it.

845
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,083
Done.

846
00:35:30,353 --> 00:35:34,092
(The key of Hee Won's rolled omelet)

847
00:35:34,193 --> 00:35:35,193
(Curry powder)

848
00:35:35,194 --> 00:35:37,222
Whenever you guys are ready. We're done here.

849
00:35:39,492 --> 00:35:41,262
- Goodness.
- Are you done?

850
00:35:41,632 --> 00:35:42,632
Seriously.

851
00:35:43,132 --> 00:35:45,432
- I just need to fry it now.
- Right.

852
00:35:45,902 --> 00:35:47,571
- It won't take long.
- Really?

853
00:35:47,572 --> 00:35:48,572
Yes.

854
00:35:49,673 --> 00:35:52,842
(The highlight of rolled omelet)

855
00:35:53,242 --> 00:35:57,313
(Considering the size of it, they set up the equipment outdoors.)

856
00:35:57,853 --> 00:36:00,852
(The egg mixture that was made with great effort)

857
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:03,182
(Precious)

858
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,591
(Dreaming of a giant rolled omelet...)

859
00:36:05,592 --> 00:36:08,893
(that will fill their mouth)

860
00:36:09,463 --> 00:36:11,932
(A tense moment)

861
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:17,063
(It seems like he's going to fry it.)

862
00:36:17,532 --> 00:36:18,801
(Adding the egg mixture)

863
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,401
(Since it's a giant rolled omelet!)

864
00:36:21,402 --> 00:36:24,242
(Should I add more or not?)

865
00:36:25,173 --> 00:36:26,511
(Adding the egg mixture again)

866
00:36:26,512 --> 00:36:28,542
(Slipping)

867
00:36:28,543 --> 00:36:29,612
It looks perfect.

868
00:36:31,652 --> 00:36:33,412
(Already?)

869
00:36:33,413 --> 00:36:36,152
(Nervous)

870
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,622
(It's a little early to flip it though.)

871
00:36:38,623 --> 00:36:40,652
(Slipping)

872
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:43,162
(Super focused)

873
00:36:43,163 --> 00:36:44,733
(Exclaiming)

874
00:36:45,193 --> 00:36:47,092
(Showing interest)

875
00:36:47,503 --> 00:36:48,503
(A minor mistake)

876
00:36:49,432 --> 00:36:52,402
(The 1st roll is a success!)

877
00:36:53,032 --> 00:36:57,643
(I'm having a good feeling about this.)

878
00:36:58,373 --> 00:37:02,313
(Carefully trying the 2nd flip)

879
00:37:03,943 --> 00:37:05,212
(It slips.)

880
00:37:05,213 --> 00:37:06,882
(It slips again.)

881
00:37:07,452 --> 00:37:10,322
(Hoping it folds over)

882
00:37:10,992 --> 00:37:12,023
(Come on.)

883
00:37:12,193 --> 00:37:14,622
(Confused)

884
00:37:14,623 --> 00:37:17,592
(Changing utensils)

885
00:37:18,592 --> 00:37:22,802
(He feels rushed, but he is hesitant to get started on it.)

886
00:37:23,432 --> 00:37:24,971
(Breaking out in a cold sweat)

887
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:26,772
Why can't I do this right?

888
00:37:26,773 --> 00:37:28,173
(Why can't I do this right?)

889
00:37:28,603 --> 00:37:31,213
(Feeling nervous as well)

890
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:34,212
(Gently pushing in the spatula underneath the egg)

891
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:36,543
(Flip over!)

892
00:37:36,813 --> 00:37:38,052
(I won't!)

893
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,782
Oh, come on.

894
00:37:41,353 --> 00:37:42,423
Please.

895
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,221
(Trying to roll it again)

896
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,893
(Wrinkled)

897
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:48,722
Oh, my goodness.

898
00:37:49,293 --> 00:37:50,862
Oh, no. My gosh.

899
00:37:51,233 --> 00:37:52,362
Oh, my.

900
00:37:53,163 --> 00:37:56,262
(Flappy)

901
00:37:57,032 --> 00:37:59,733
(Oh, no. That's not good.)

902
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,313
(He doesn't know what to do.)

903
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:09,342
I failed!

904
00:38:09,343 --> 00:38:10,952
(Destroying it)

905
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,713
(Laughing)

906
00:38:14,452 --> 00:38:16,181
- Gosh.
- Did you end up scrambling it?

907
00:38:16,182 --> 00:38:17,322
Yes. Gosh.

908
00:38:17,992 --> 00:38:20,292
When he fails with a rolled omelet, he always scrambles the eggs.

909
00:38:20,293 --> 00:38:22,692
(He turns failed rolled omelets into scrambled eggs.)

910
00:38:22,693 --> 00:38:24,023
I failed.

911
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,861
(It was a semi-rolled omelet for an instant.)

912
00:38:26,862 --> 00:38:29,532
Shall we now get ready?

913
00:38:29,762 --> 00:38:32,333
I still have the egg mixture left.

914
00:38:32,873 --> 00:38:34,173
Oh, my goodness.

915
00:38:34,572 --> 00:38:35,773
This won't take long.

916
00:38:37,512 --> 00:38:38,841
Sure. Okay.

917
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:40,773
(He earns a chance to try again.)

918
00:38:41,682 --> 00:38:44,813
(But he forgets to grease the pan.)

919
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:47,012
(Flaring his nostrils)

920
00:38:47,623 --> 00:38:50,023
(Scratching)

921
00:38:50,652 --> 00:38:54,293
(He is being serious.)

922
00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:57,192
(Trying to roll it quickly)

923
00:38:57,193 --> 00:38:59,233
(Slipping)

924
00:38:59,532 --> 00:39:02,262
(Trying not to laugh)

925
00:39:02,463 --> 00:39:03,631
(Flipping)

926
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,702
(Come on.)

927
00:39:05,072 --> 00:39:06,172
(Spilled out)

928
00:39:06,173 --> 00:39:08,273
I forgot to add oil.

929
00:39:09,003 --> 00:39:10,801
I should've added oil.

930
00:39:10,802 --> 00:39:12,412
(I must not laugh.)

931
00:39:12,413 --> 00:39:13,813
Oh, my goodness.

932
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:15,983
(Trying to hold it in)

933
00:39:16,282 --> 00:39:19,083
(Laughing)

934
00:39:19,713 --> 00:39:22,082
(Hee Won made an egg monster.)

935
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:23,123
What have I done?

936
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:26,552
(He can't hold it anymore.)

937
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:28,192
Hey, Myoung!

938
00:39:28,193 --> 00:39:30,623
(Myoung...)

939
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:34,702
(They missed out on this precious moment...)

940
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:36,502
(while trying out the rice.)

941
00:39:36,503 --> 00:39:38,233
- This is so good.
- Give me some.

942
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:42,173
(It looks a bit like the carp bread.)

943
00:39:42,543 --> 00:39:44,442
(Every time you see it, it makes you burst into laughter.)

944
00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:45,512
Hey, Myoung!

945
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:49,813
(Grunting)

946
00:39:50,382 --> 00:39:53,713
(Someone, please stop me.)

947
00:39:54,052 --> 00:39:57,123
(Chang Wook came out to set the table.)

948
00:39:57,592 --> 00:39:59,193
- Wait a minute.
- What's wrong?

949
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:01,261
Is the rolled omelet...

950
00:40:01,262 --> 00:40:02,262
(Putting his head down)

951
00:40:02,793 --> 00:40:05,261
(It's a special rolled omelet that makes everyone laugh.)

952
00:40:05,262 --> 00:40:06,293
Have a seat.

953
00:40:06,393 --> 00:40:08,003
(It even makes Hee Won laugh.)

954
00:40:08,402 --> 00:40:11,272
- Hee Won, let's eat what we have.
- Okay.

955
00:40:11,273 --> 00:40:12,802
I think you can stop now.

956
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,301
- Myoung.
- Yes?

957
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:16,571
Why did you laugh? I thought you were on my side.

958
00:40:16,572 --> 00:40:17,913
No, I didn't mean to.

959
00:40:19,773 --> 00:40:20,773
What?

960
00:40:20,774 --> 00:40:21,841
(The rolled omelet master)

961
00:40:21,842 --> 00:40:23,142
I didn't mean it like that.

962
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:25,252
I saw you laughing your head off.

963
00:40:25,253 --> 00:40:26,253
(You were laughing your head off.)

964
00:40:26,254 --> 00:40:27,282
Come here and have a seat.

965
00:40:27,822 --> 00:40:29,753
We're done.

966
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:32,523
Wait a minute. Sesame seeds!

967
00:40:33,253 --> 00:40:34,893
Wait. We need sesame seeds!

968
00:40:35,693 --> 00:40:37,832
The sesame seeds complete every dish we make.

969
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:39,463
You put sesame seeds on kimchi as well? I see.

970
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:41,702
This will be spicy and nice.

971
00:40:41,902 --> 00:40:42,902
This is amazing.

972
00:40:43,362 --> 00:40:44,401
(It's savory and sweet rice with Yeongju beans.)

973
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:46,173
- It's rice with beans.
- This really is the best.

974
00:40:46,603 --> 00:40:48,002
We have a lot of fried eggs.

975
00:40:48,003 --> 00:40:49,302
(Hee Won and Myoung's giant serving of fried eggs.)

976
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:51,143
We must top all these with sesame seeds.

977
00:40:51,512 --> 00:40:52,842
- It looks delicious.
- Look at the difference it made.

978
00:40:54,012 --> 00:40:56,342
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

979
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,011
(Scrumptious)

980
00:41:00,012 --> 00:41:01,322
That looks really good.

981
00:41:02,353 --> 00:41:04,923
Gosh. That looks insanely good.

982
00:41:05,552 --> 00:41:07,122
(First, he tries the gochujang stew...)

983
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:08,563
(which he looked forward to the most.)

984
00:41:10,992 --> 00:41:14,163
(Myoung takes a big bite.)

985
00:41:14,902 --> 00:41:15,932
(It's hot.)

986
00:41:16,402 --> 00:41:18,232
- The stew is good, right?
- It is.

987
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:19,233
- It's really good, right?
- It is.

988
00:41:21,943 --> 00:41:23,072
(Satisfying)

989
00:41:23,643 --> 00:41:26,072
The more I try it, the more I can taste umami.

990
00:41:26,273 --> 00:41:27,313
The gochujang stew is good.

991
00:41:28,913 --> 00:41:30,952
This is art. It really is.

992
00:41:31,353 --> 00:41:33,313
I can really tell that you have put a lot of effort into it.

993
00:41:33,713 --> 00:41:34,721
It's so good.

994
00:41:34,722 --> 00:41:37,423
(This is the tasty gochujang stew made with effort.)

995
00:41:38,753 --> 00:41:41,322
How is the rice? It's supposed to be really healthy.

996
00:41:42,063 --> 00:41:44,432
- The beans just melt in your mouth.
- They are soft, right?

997
00:41:44,632 --> 00:41:45,632
It's really soft.

998
00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:52,802
(The rice that was made with Yeongju beans is extra savory and soft.)

999
00:41:53,603 --> 00:41:56,502
You can't even tell that there are beans in the rice.

1000
00:41:56,503 --> 00:41:57,971
- They just melt in your mouth.
- That's right.

1001
00:41:57,972 --> 00:41:59,011
They are gone, right?

1002
00:41:59,012 --> 00:42:01,782
- We presoaked it last night.
- Is that why?

1003
00:42:01,913 --> 00:42:04,512
(Pleased)

1004
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:06,912
It's different from when you eat alone...

1005
00:42:06,913 --> 00:42:08,622
- at a campsite, right?
- It really is.

1006
00:42:08,623 --> 00:42:10,352
- This is a homemade meal, right?
- It is.

1007
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:11,392
- It totally is, right?
- Yes.

1008
00:42:11,393 --> 00:42:12,753
(Happy)

1009
00:42:13,722 --> 00:42:15,762
When will we get to try a legitimate rolled omelet?

1010
00:42:16,193 --> 00:42:17,833
Do you think it will happen by the end of our lives?

1011
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:19,833
- It sure will.
- Really?

1012
00:42:20,092 --> 00:42:22,563
But I got better than last time.

1013
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,103
I'm serious.

1014
00:42:24,302 --> 00:42:25,401
(Still having hopes up)

1015
00:42:25,402 --> 00:42:26,572
How are the eggs?

1016
00:42:27,773 --> 00:42:29,242
- It's just eggs, right?
- Right.

1017
00:42:30,202 --> 00:42:32,242
- But I like the vegetables.
- Right?

1018
00:42:32,512 --> 00:42:34,612
I put a lot of effort into the vegetables.

1019
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:41,623
(Although it's not pretty, it's still delicious.)

1020
00:42:43,822 --> 00:42:45,523
- It's good, right?
- It is.

1021
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:49,023
Rolled omelets are so hard to make.

1022
00:42:50,793 --> 00:42:51,862
Also,

1023
00:42:52,463 --> 00:42:54,662
Myoung laughed at me so hard in the middle.

1024
00:42:54,663 --> 00:42:55,702
(Flustered)

1025
00:42:56,063 --> 00:42:58,103
Why? Why did he laugh?

1026
00:42:58,773 --> 00:43:00,232
That hurt my feelings.

1027
00:43:00,233 --> 00:43:01,572
No, please.

1028
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:03,071
That hurt my feelings.

1029
00:43:03,072 --> 00:43:04,772
(It's unfair.)

1030
00:43:04,773 --> 00:43:06,372
- Was it because you were bad at it?
- No, please.

1031
00:43:06,373 --> 00:43:08,313
He didn't say I was bad at it. He just laughed.

1032
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:11,612
It was the kind of laugh that bursts out after you hold it very hard.

1033
00:43:13,682 --> 00:43:14,722
(Trying not to laugh)

1034
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:16,822
(Laughing)

1035
00:43:17,682 --> 00:43:19,753
(Myoung...)

1036
00:43:21,362 --> 00:43:24,193
(The sad-looking rolled omelet...)

1037
00:43:24,963 --> 00:43:28,402
(made Myoung burst into laughter.)

1038
00:43:29,632 --> 00:43:32,333
(It's another happy day at the House!)

1039
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:34,102
Although he didn't say a word,

1040
00:43:34,103 --> 00:43:35,211
(Anxious)

1041
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,542
he really hurt my feelings.

1042
00:43:37,543 --> 00:43:39,743
(Laughing)

1043
00:43:39,982 --> 00:43:41,683
(Teasing Myoung)

1044
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,381
You should try rolling the eggs next time.

1045
00:43:44,382 --> 00:43:45,882
Okay. I'll try it for dinner.

1046
00:43:49,192 --> 00:43:50,223
I'm so full.

1047
00:43:51,223 --> 00:43:54,833
As our guest, please give a review of our meal today.

1048
00:43:55,192 --> 00:43:56,732
How was the rolled omelet?

1049
00:44:00,232 --> 00:44:01,332
(High hopes)

1050
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,632
First, the egg aroma...

1051
00:44:04,072 --> 00:44:05,543
was very savory.

1052
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,972
Also, from the minced vegetables,

1053
00:44:08,973 --> 00:44:10,513
I could tell that he put a lot of effort into it.

1054
00:44:10,813 --> 00:44:13,942
Also, although it didn't look like a rolled omelet,

1055
00:44:14,683 --> 00:44:15,751
when I tasted it,

1056
00:44:15,752 --> 00:44:16,752
(Upset)

1057
00:44:17,353 --> 00:44:21,092
I could clearly tell that it was a rolled omelet.

1058
00:44:21,552 --> 00:44:22,622
It had a pleasant taste.

1059
00:44:22,623 --> 00:44:24,022
How about the gochujang stew?

1060
00:44:24,322 --> 00:44:25,763
The gochujang stew...

1061
00:44:26,522 --> 00:44:27,563
was also...

1062
00:44:28,493 --> 00:44:31,163
spicy and sweet.

1063
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:33,462
It was so good.

1064
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:34,532
(Laughing)

1065
00:44:34,533 --> 00:44:36,373
It was just...

1066
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:38,202
- so good.
- How was the rice?

1067
00:44:38,203 --> 00:44:40,103
For the rice, as you know,

1068
00:44:40,373 --> 00:44:41,672
it was sticky.

1069
00:44:42,272 --> 00:44:44,342
I love sticky rice.

1070
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:46,481
Also, the beans were so soft.

1071
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:47,642
(Stuttering)

1072
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:48,913
They were so savory.

1073
00:44:51,013 --> 00:44:52,552
This is putting me under a bit of pressure.

1074
00:44:53,922 --> 00:44:55,993
I think he meant it was bad overall.

1075
00:44:57,252 --> 00:44:58,922
I really enjoyed it.

1076
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:00,123
I'm sweating.

1077
00:45:01,592 --> 00:45:03,032
- Is it because you are lying?
- No.

1078
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,862
- Telling lies is making you sweat.
- It was really good.

1079
00:45:05,033 --> 00:45:07,732
(I really enjoyed it so much.)

1080
00:45:08,402 --> 00:45:11,902
(Under the warm winter sunshine...)

1081
00:45:13,703 --> 00:45:15,742
What's the longest leave you get in the army?

1082
00:45:15,743 --> 00:45:19,112
- About 5 to 6 days.
- That's pretty long.

1083
00:45:20,143 --> 00:45:21,652
What will you do when you are on leave?

1084
00:45:22,482 --> 00:45:24,522
I'm not sure yet.

1085
00:45:24,982 --> 00:45:27,682
You must manage your time really well during your leave.

1086
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:28,922
Can you share a tip?

1087
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:31,993
What's a good way to manage his time during the leave?

1088
00:45:32,123 --> 00:45:33,462
There are many ways.

1089
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:35,632
When it's necessary, you must resist using it...

1090
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,162
- although you want to go out.
- Save it up?

1091
00:45:37,163 --> 00:45:38,361
- I see. You should save it up.
- Yes.

1092
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:40,163
You shouldn't use it when it's not necessary.

1093
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,801
If you receive some rewards, you will get reward leave.

1094
00:45:42,802 --> 00:45:43,872
So plan it accordingly.

1095
00:45:43,873 --> 00:45:45,873
- He should plan to receive rewards?
- Right.

1096
00:45:46,502 --> 00:45:49,012
If you win the first place at the military training center...

1097
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:51,643
or receive a commendation, you can get a leave.

1098
00:45:52,102 --> 00:45:53,462
I think you'll be good at it.

1099
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,241
I'm not really sure.

1100
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:58,939
I'm sure there will be guys who are much younger than me.

1101
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,911
- Right. He's joining the army late.
- I wonder if I can beat them.

1102
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:04,950
- I also joined the army late.
- How old were you?

1103
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:07,351
I joined the army when I was 30 or 31 years old.

1104
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,550
So I joined around the same age as him.

1105
00:46:09,551 --> 00:46:11,859
But since I'm older, they showed respect.

1106
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,621
Really? Although you joined in the same year?

1107
00:46:13,761 --> 00:46:16,730
But the drill instructors were a bit scary.

1108
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,261
Although...

1109
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,860
they were younger, it felt like they were older than me.

1110
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:24,499
About the age...

1111
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,801
Within that military hierarchy,

1112
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,110
I forgot about my age.

1113
00:46:28,341 --> 00:46:30,670
The people who were higher up in the hierarchy seemed older than you.

1114
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,939
The duration of the service is pretty short these days.

1115
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,681
- It's one and a half years. Right?
- Yes.

1116
00:46:35,781 --> 00:46:36,850
Did you think it was short...

1117
00:46:36,851 --> 00:46:38,281
- when you joined the army?
- No.

1118
00:46:38,451 --> 00:46:40,051
(Honest)

1119
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:42,051
It would seem long...

1120
00:46:42,391 --> 00:46:45,721
if I had to join the army for one and a half years.

1121
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:48,391
Don't feel too frustrated.

1122
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:49,761
Goodness.

1123
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,730
(The sun shines as if it is trying to comfort Myoung.)

1124
00:46:54,931 --> 00:46:57,471
Gosh. The weather is awesome today.

1125
00:46:58,101 --> 00:47:00,600
- It's cool as the wind blows.
- Yes.

1126
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:01,610
Yes.

1127
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:04,939
- The weather is perfect.
- Indeed.

1128
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,241
Isn't it just great? It's superb.

1129
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,979
So there is a hanok village near here.

1130
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,280
- Okay.
- I was thinking...

1131
00:47:12,281 --> 00:47:15,091
we could go there to take a stroll.

1132
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:16,221
I'd love that.

1133
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,689
- Let's go, Dong Il.
- Okay.

1134
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:20,189
(They are going out to take a walk.)

1135
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,730
It's an excellent day to go on a trip.

1136
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,391
I feel great.

1137
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,859
(It's relaxing. I love it.)

1138
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,229
The place we're going is a hanok village,

1139
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:32,571
and I heard it is a beautiful place to visit.

1140
00:47:33,301 --> 00:47:35,770
I hope you would enjoy the cozy and quiet atmosphere.

1141
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,310
Okay.

1142
00:47:37,311 --> 00:47:38,540
(Sounds good.)

1143
00:47:39,141 --> 00:47:42,450
(Driving on a country road that leads to Museom Village)

1144
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:44,380
(From the house to Museom Village)

1145
00:47:45,681 --> 00:47:48,650
(Singing a melody)

1146
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:53,261
I used to like going for a drive by myself.

1147
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,460
You know, many thoughts come to mind especially with music.

1148
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,060
Actually, I still like to drive.

1149
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,670
I really like to drive.

1150
00:48:03,601 --> 00:48:06,140
- So once, I drove a motorcycle...
- Okay.

1151
00:48:06,141 --> 00:48:08,410
- to Byeonsan.
- You went that far?

1152
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:09,770
I went to Byeonsan...

1153
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:11,440
and stayed overnight there.

1154
00:48:11,841 --> 00:48:12,980
And I drove from Byeonsan to Namhae.

1155
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,380
- My gosh.
- Yes.

1156
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,149
(Chang Wook likes to ride a motorcycle...)

1157
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:20,879
(when he wants to go somewhere.)

1158
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,451
I get to run through the wind,

1159
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,391
and I feel like I can go anywhere I want.

1160
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:27,721
I feel great as I feel so free.

1161
00:48:29,161 --> 00:48:32,060
(He drove about 500km in 2 days.)

1162
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:35,971
(He enjoys motor camping as well.)

1163
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,440
(Chang Wook loves to ride a motorcycle and travel.)

1164
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,340
- Gosh.
- Whenever I want to leave...

1165
00:48:42,341 --> 00:48:43,911
(He's amazing.)

1166
00:48:44,241 --> 00:48:45,609
I know it's great when you go,

1167
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:46,710
but isn't it too exhausting on your way back?

1168
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:49,351
So I sent my bike by a carrier before leaving for home.

1169
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:51,249
(Smiling)

1170
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,320
Come on. Seriously?

1171
00:48:52,321 --> 00:48:54,520
(Laughing)

1172
00:48:55,221 --> 00:48:56,749
My gosh...

1173
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:57,920
(Talking about this and that)

1174
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,160
There is a scarecrow. I haven't seen one for a long time.

1175
00:49:01,161 --> 00:49:02,931
The scenery is nice here.

1176
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:04,630
Look how they are reflected in the water.

1177
00:49:05,161 --> 00:49:06,459
- Gosh.
- Wonderful.

1178
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,070
It seems we are almost here.

1179
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:09,371
- Probably...
- We are here?

1180
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,571
Well, we're here.

1181
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,341
Museom Village.

1182
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:19,579
The width of the river is quite big.

1183
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,709
I know. Look how long the bridge is.

1184
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:22,781
Right.

1185
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,951
I will show you guys something really amazing.

1186
00:49:28,821 --> 00:49:30,350
- Oh, what is that?
- Isn't the bridge beautiful?

1187
00:49:30,351 --> 00:49:32,091
- I wanted you...
- What is that?

1188
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:33,991
To have a chance to cross it.

1189
00:49:34,161 --> 00:49:36,490
This is a unique bridge...

1190
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:38,200
(Let's go see. You will see a very unique bridge.)

1191
00:49:38,201 --> 00:49:40,000
in Korea.

1192
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,931
My gosh, what is that? It's interesting.

1193
00:49:43,201 --> 00:49:44,330
Come out and see.

1194
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:46,971
- Isn't it exceptional?
- Gosh.

1195
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:49,809
- Is that the single log bridge?
- Yes, exactly.

1196
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:50,871
(A long and narrow log bridge to Museom Village)

1197
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:53,709
- My gosh. That's amazing.
- It's so interesting.

1198
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:54,810
Yes. It really is.

1199
00:49:55,551 --> 00:49:58,650
(Fine sand is widely spread.)

1200
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:02,950
- The water is so clear.
- Yes, the river is very clear.

1201
00:50:02,951 --> 00:50:04,091
(Above the shining Naeseong River...)

1202
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,189
You know, they say you'll encounter an enemy on a single log bridge.

1203
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:10,860
- So you met all the enemies today.
- Yes.

1204
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:16,670
(The width is just big enough for one person to walk.)

1205
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:22,770
(The bridge has been there at the entrance for 350 years.)

1206
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:25,910
Once you cross over the bridge, you can enter the hanok village.

1207
00:50:25,911 --> 00:50:27,510
(In the old days, the bridge was the only path to the village.)

1208
00:50:27,511 --> 00:50:28,551
Let's go.

1209
00:50:29,281 --> 00:50:31,480
If you're drunk, you are more likely to fall into the water.

1210
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,181
Because it's hard to keep your balance.

1211
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:38,190
My gosh. I don't think it's going to be easy to cross.

1212
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,260
It will be a problem if we encounter someone in the middle.

1213
00:50:42,261 --> 00:50:43,761
(They are crossing the Naeseong River step by step.)

1214
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,601
- Wait. I feel sick.
- What?

1215
00:50:50,531 --> 00:50:54,241
(This is how Hee Won sees.)

1216
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:57,309
I suddenly feel sick because the water under is waving.

1217
00:50:57,310 --> 00:50:58,341
(He feels dizzy because of the waving river.)

1218
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,809
Seriously, it's not easy.

1219
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:00,840
(Tottering)

1220
00:51:00,841 --> 00:51:02,709
- I feel sick.
- Are you okay?

1221
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:03,710
Yes.

1222
00:51:04,351 --> 00:51:06,321
One moment. Wait. Sorry.

1223
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:09,821
Where are you going?

1224
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,419
- Hee Won feels nauseous.
- Hold on.

1225
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,560
(He retreated for a bit due to the motion sickness.)

1226
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,830
If you look down, you will feel sick because of the water.

1227
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,130
I know.

1228
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,160
Hee Won, are you okay? Don't fall into the water.

1229
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:19,960
(Feeling dizzy)

1230
00:51:20,261 --> 00:51:23,270
(Striding)

1231
00:51:24,071 --> 00:51:25,301
Shall I lead the way?

1232
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,971
(Please, take my hand.)

1233
00:51:31,371 --> 00:51:33,280
Don't look down. You'll feel dizzy.

1234
00:51:33,281 --> 00:51:34,411
(Holding his hand tightly)

1235
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:38,181
Yes. You'd better hold his hand.

1236
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,750
Because I feel shaky when I walk.

1237
00:51:41,051 --> 00:51:44,290
What's worse is that the bridge is not straight.

1238
00:51:44,821 --> 00:51:45,960
Slowly, okay?

1239
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,859
(I'm behind you.)

1240
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,091
We are almost there.

1241
00:51:50,591 --> 00:51:51,661
Gosh.

1242
00:51:52,161 --> 00:51:55,530
Come on, Hee Won. What happened to you?

1243
00:51:55,531 --> 00:51:56,900
Seriously, it makes me feel sick.

1244
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:00,439
I know. But you shouldn't feel sick when you cross it.

1245
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,540
(They are close to the sandbank ahead.)

1246
00:52:01,741 --> 00:52:02,769
Yes. We're here.

1247
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:03,970
- You feel okay here, right?
- Yes.

1248
00:52:03,971 --> 00:52:05,310
Gosh, finally.

1249
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:08,209
When the ground is under the bridge, I feel all right.

1250
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:11,050
But earlier, because of the water, I felt nauseous.

1251
00:52:11,051 --> 00:52:12,480
I felt really dizzy.

1252
00:52:15,121 --> 00:52:16,150
Gosh.

1253
00:52:17,621 --> 00:52:19,320
My gosh, this is tough.

1254
00:52:19,321 --> 00:52:20,360
(Narrowly)

1255
00:52:20,621 --> 00:52:22,359
It's getting narrower, Hee Won.

1256
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,430
Come on...

1257
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,931
I don't think you will feel okay here.

1258
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:30,170
- Will you be all right?
- Hold my hand.

1259
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,971
(The 50-year-old man is being cute.)

1260
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,410
Seriously...

1261
00:52:35,411 --> 00:52:36,669
(Holding Chang Wook's hand, )

1262
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:38,580
(Hee Won is crossing the bridge step by step.)

1263
00:52:39,911 --> 00:52:41,709
- Watch your step. It's narrow here.
- Okay.

1264
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,911
(Watch your step. It's narrow here.)

1265
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,979
(Are we there yet?)

1266
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,121
Here we are.

1267
00:52:48,391 --> 00:52:49,919
- We are here.
- Here we are.

1268
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,090
(They have arrived at Museom Village.)

1269
00:52:51,091 --> 00:52:52,690
- My gosh.
- Gosh, that was a long bridge.

1270
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:54,121
Land!

1271
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:57,031
(Everyone has safely crossed over the river.)

1272
00:52:57,261 --> 00:52:58,930
Look. It was really a long bridge.

1273
00:52:58,931 --> 00:53:01,399
- Absolutely.
- It's very long.

1274
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,930
(As they look back, they can see how long the bridge is.)

1275
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,769
I tried to distract myself while crossing it,

1276
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:06,801
but it was a long bridge.

1277
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,169
(They have crossed the long log bridge together.)

1278
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:12,181
- The width of the river is so long.
- Yes.

1279
00:53:12,411 --> 00:53:13,480
Okay. Let's go.

1280
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:15,480
My gosh, look at that.

1281
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,079
It's a beautiful village...

1282
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,220
- This is amazing.
- isn't it?

1283
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:21,250
The village is surrounded by the river.

1284
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:23,289
- This is a remarkable place.
- Right.

1285
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:26,621
(Museom Village with its 400-year long history)

1286
00:53:27,491 --> 00:53:30,390
(The three sides of the village are surrounded...)

1287
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:33,230
(by the slowly flowing Naeseong River.)

1288
00:53:34,161 --> 00:53:36,300
This is a unique village, right?

1289
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:37,330
Totally.

1290
00:53:38,201 --> 00:53:39,240
This is beautiful.

1291
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:46,310
(The island on the land shows its beauty of the four seasons.)

1292
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,050
This is a thatched-roofed house.

1293
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:51,010
- A thatched-roofed house.
- Thatched-roofed house, hanok...

1294
00:53:51,011 --> 00:53:52,080
Yes.

1295
00:53:52,451 --> 00:53:54,249
- Isn't it splendid?
- It is.

1296
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,149
The houses are remarkable.

1297
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,790
(Tile-roofed and thatched-roofed houses are harmoniously located.)

1298
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,160
(It has the quiet...)

1299
00:54:02,161 --> 00:54:07,931
(yet warm and cozy atmosphere.)

1300
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:09,829
(This is a place where you don't feel the flow of time.)

1301
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,770
Look how cute they are.

1302
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:14,439
The houses here are cute and pretty.

1303
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,170
(This is a place where you don't feel the flow of time.)

1304
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,780
It's just so nice to take a walk here.

1305
00:54:19,781 --> 00:54:21,079
I know, right?

1306
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,249
(They feel relaxed just by walking in the village.)

1307
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,951
Seriously, this is brilliant.

1308
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:31,090
Look at the persimmon tree.

1309
00:54:31,091 --> 00:54:33,460
People must have left the persimmons for magpies.

1310
00:54:34,161 --> 00:54:36,129
- For magpies.
- I see.

1311
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:37,761
(Wherever they look, they can feel the friendly atmosphere.)

1312
00:54:37,991 --> 00:54:41,059
Isn't it awesome to see an electric car...

1313
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,200
in a hanok village?

1314
00:54:42,201 --> 00:54:43,669
They are charging their electric car.

1315
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:47,641
What an odd combination. With a traditional house...

1316
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:51,110
- People are actually residing here?
- Yes, they are residents here.

1317
00:54:52,911 --> 00:54:54,340
They should maintain the traditional houses in good condition...

1318
00:54:54,341 --> 00:54:55,681
because it's their home.

1319
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,810
I mean, like this.

1320
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:03,290
Look. They are renewing their roof. The thatched-roofed house.

1321
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,920
- I see. That's how it's done.
- Yes.

1322
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:09,531
At the end of the farming season, when the threshing of rice is over,

1323
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:12,601
they use the plants as a roofing material.

1324
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:15,169
- Have you done it before?
- I have seen it.

1325
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:17,931
I saw people renewing their roof many times when I was little.

1326
00:55:18,701 --> 00:55:20,669
It's my first time to see something like that.

1327
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:22,440
- Renewing the roof?
- Yes.

1328
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:25,540
Re-roofing is important as the house has to be kept warm in the winter...

1329
00:55:25,911 --> 00:55:27,411
and the roof shouldn't leak when it rains.

1330
00:55:27,781 --> 00:55:30,181
- That's really interesting.
- Indeed.

1331
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,681
- Even birds nest there too.
- I see.

1332
00:55:34,121 --> 00:55:36,390
- They burrow into it during winter.
- I see.

1333
00:55:36,391 --> 00:55:38,249
Because it's warmer inside. Right.

1334
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,621
(Warm and cozy)

1335
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:41,559
This is nice.

1336
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,130
(Due to the coziness, it seemed like they went back in time.)

1337
00:55:44,491 --> 00:55:45,960
My gosh. Look at the flowers.

1338
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,201
Come to think of it, there are still flowers here.

1339
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,100
- I know.
- Because it's warmer here.

1340
00:55:51,101 --> 00:55:52,141
Right.

1341
00:55:52,841 --> 00:55:55,809
Are we in the southern part of Korea?

1342
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,670
- We are in Gyeongsang Province.
- Is that why it's warmer here?

1343
00:55:58,341 --> 00:56:00,539
You borrowed that jacket from Myoung.

1344
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,540
But you are not wearing it now because it's hot here.

1345
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:02,979
- I'm hot.
- Me too.

1346
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,380
- So I left my jacket in the car.
- You did?

1347
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,249
I wore a short sleeve shirt inside the hoodie as it was hot.

1348
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,620
- A short sleeve shirt?
- Yes.

1349
00:56:08,621 --> 00:56:09,850
Obviously, how your body...

1350
00:56:09,851 --> 00:56:12,519
keeps the temperature is different depending on the age.

1351
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,960
(They are enjoying the warm weather, which is not common in the winter.)

1352
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,660
Carp bread...

1353
00:56:16,661 --> 00:56:18,499
- It looks delicious.
- Should we buy some?

1354
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,560
- I heard they have good carp bread.
- It looks delicious.

1355
00:56:21,661 --> 00:56:23,300
Shall we have some carp bread?

1356
00:56:23,301 --> 00:56:25,141
(We shouldn't miss it.)

1357
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:31,110
(Carp bread is everyone's favorite snack in the winter.)

1358
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,450
(Golden brown)

1359
00:56:35,451 --> 00:56:37,149
We have red bean and custard cream flavors.

1360
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:38,681
- Red bean flavor, please.
- Okay.

1361
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:42,790
There you are.

1362
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,519
Could I please get the free one in the custard cream flavor?

1363
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,859
- Sure.
- Gosh, look at him.

1364
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,020
- Thank you.
- Try it.

1365
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,590
(Taking a bite from the head)

1366
00:56:50,591 --> 00:56:53,560
(Crunchy)

1367
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,871
Whenever the winter comes, I feel like having carp bread.

1368
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,200
But it's hard to find a carp bread stand.

1369
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:01,440
You know, nowadays there aren't many food stands on the street.

1370
00:57:01,741 --> 00:57:03,140
- Right.
- Right.

1371
00:57:03,141 --> 00:57:04,209
(I love carp bread.)

1372
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:06,681
I feel hungry already.

1373
00:57:07,411 --> 00:57:11,781
(On their way back, Chang Wook who loves to drive will drive.)

1374
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:17,190
(Myoung who is young enough to feel hungry all the time is...)

1375
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,091
(having another piece of carp bread.)

1376
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,130
(It's delicious.)

1377
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,129
- Okay, we're leaving.
- Let's go.

1378
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:31,900
(Smoothly slithering)

1379
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,240
Even this bridge for the cars is a single log bridge.

1380
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:37,440
(Bye, Museom Village.)

1381
00:57:37,971 --> 00:57:40,880
(Eating)

1382
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,450
(Would you like one?)

1383
00:57:45,451 --> 00:57:49,891
Hey. How can you eat it like nothing had happened? Hee Won is...

1384
00:57:50,121 --> 00:57:51,351
feeling dizzy and sick.

1385
00:57:52,221 --> 00:57:54,391
I'm too worried to eat the carp bread.

1386
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:58,830
Dong Il, you enjoyed it very much earlier.

1387
00:57:59,201 --> 00:58:00,261
I'm okay. All right?

1388
00:58:00,931 --> 00:58:02,530
I guess I forgot about it at that moment.

1389
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:04,670
(I guess I forgot about it at that moment.)

1390
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,200
(Reading the room)

1391
00:58:08,201 --> 00:58:09,370
Suddenly, I remember it now.

1392
00:58:09,371 --> 00:58:11,110
Gosh, the carp bread isn't good at all.

1393
00:58:11,511 --> 00:58:13,741
(His mouth is full of carp bread.)

1394
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,480
(How cute he is.)

1395
00:58:21,351 --> 00:58:23,821
(Tapping)

1396
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,919
Look how the awesome driver Chang Wook is tapping...

1397
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,360
with his fingers while driving.

1398
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:32,601
Tapping the steering wheel, he looks so relaxed.

1399
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,399
Yes, that's it.

1400
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,031
(Well, he looks pretty cool.)

1401
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:37,899
(A relaxed driver Chang Wook is...)

1402
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,899
Gosh, he is an excellent driver.

1403
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,769
I agree. I would've felt dizzy if I was driving.

1404
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:44,011
(He shines even when he is driving.)

1405
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:46,109
Give and take, you know?

1406
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:48,241
(Brightly smiling)

1407
00:58:49,411 --> 00:58:52,979
(He just can't stop looking cool.)

1408
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,019
I know.

1409
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,149
(Making a right turn and showing his handsome face)

1410
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:56,420
Myoung...

1411
00:58:58,621 --> 00:59:01,991
(He just can't stop looking handsome while waiting for a green light.)

1412
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,000
(He is so gorgeous that everyone's heart would skip a beat.)

1413
00:59:07,801 --> 00:59:12,371
(They feel great as they are heading back home.)

1414
00:59:14,741 --> 00:59:17,010
(Very serious)

1415
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:18,410
Dong Il, what is for dinner?

1416
00:59:18,411 --> 00:59:22,610
For dinner, I'm thinking of cooking something special.

1417
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,781
What? Something special?

1418
00:59:25,621 --> 00:59:28,281
Myoung is soon off to the military, and Chang Wook is here,

1419
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:30,890
so I want to make something really nice for them.

1420
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:32,790
(Touched)

1421
00:59:33,491 --> 00:59:37,460
Yeongju is actually very famous for Korean beef.

1422
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:40,660
I was thinking, with Korean beef ribs,

1423
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:42,100
(With locally produced Korean beef...)

1424
00:59:42,101 --> 00:59:43,931
I could make galbijjim.

1425
00:59:44,071 --> 00:59:45,970
- Oh, galbijjim?
- Gosh, galbijjim...

1426
00:59:45,971 --> 00:59:48,269
- Yes. But...
- Galbijjim...

1427
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:50,371
(What an excellent menu.)

1428
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,440
I mean, I want to try making it. But...

1429
00:59:55,681 --> 00:59:56,749
I'm worried.

1430
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,109
(He is suddenly worried after saying out the menu.)

1431
00:59:58,110 --> 00:59:59,281
In the pressure cooker...

1432
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,080
Dong Il, you don't need to worry about anything.

1433
01:00:01,821 --> 01:00:04,821
Actually, my mother knows how to make galbijjim nicely.

1434
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:06,919
- I once asked...
- So you know a bit.

1435
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,829
- how she cooks it.
- How does she cook it?

1436
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:12,660
- She said that I'd need radish...
- Right.

1437
01:00:12,661 --> 01:00:14,400
And this and that.

1438
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:17,269
She told me the recipe for it.

1439
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:19,301
Great. Okay.

1440
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:23,440
As Chang Wook likes spicy food, I'll make it really spicy this time.

1441
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:25,039
Spicy galbijjim.

1442
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,480
- That sounds great.
- I'd love that.

1443
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,910
(It is a special dish shared on special days.)

1444
01:00:30,911 --> 01:00:34,181
(Galbijjim)

1445
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,450
(When it's boiled for a long time, )

1446
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:41,560
(the meat gets soft and tender.)

1447
01:00:42,661 --> 01:00:46,160
(Different vegetables are soaked with the sweet and salty sauce.)

1448
01:00:46,161 --> 01:00:50,601
(They go well with the meat.)

1449
01:00:51,301 --> 01:00:56,641
(On top of galbijjim that was made with local Korean beef, )

1450
01:00:57,341 --> 01:00:59,209
(there will be one more special dish.)

1451
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:00,681
(Honestly, I've never made it before.)

1452
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:03,749
(How about seaweed soup?)

1453
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:06,080
(Beef seaweed soup?)

1454
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:12,560
(For the first time in his life, he will cook beef seaweed soup.)

1455
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,220
(The rolled omelet is...)

1456
01:01:14,221 --> 01:01:15,391
(Myoung bursts out laughing.)

1457
01:01:16,031 --> 01:01:17,560
(Hey, Myoung.)

1458
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:21,531
(Hee Won was upset because Myoung laughed hard.)

1459
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,399
(Myoung, you go ahead and make it.)

1460
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,540
(Right now.)

1461
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:31,270
(Myoung will make a rolled omelet that will satisfy Hee Won's grudge.)

1462
01:01:32,011 --> 01:01:35,181
(The dinner table will be as special as a birthday table.)

1463
01:01:35,411 --> 01:01:36,480
Okay, thank you for driving.

1464
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:39,650
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1465
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:41,979
Okay. Let's move. Swiftly.

1466
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,120
- Okay.
- Great.

1467
01:01:43,121 --> 01:01:44,451
Gosh, galbijjim...

1468
01:01:45,221 --> 01:01:48,121
(Shall I begin?)

1469
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,560
- Chang Wook. I'll make a lot.
- Okay.

1470
01:01:52,301 --> 01:01:53,661
- So you enjoy the food.
- Okay.

1471
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:56,630
Because traveling with these members doesn't happen every day.

1472
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:59,141
Probably, it's going to be the first and the last time in our life.

1473
01:02:00,741 --> 01:02:03,641
Hee Won's mother is excellent at making galbijjim.

1474
01:02:05,241 --> 01:02:11,951
(Dong Il is soaking the meat in water to draw out the blood.)

1475
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,721
So what happens if you don't draw out the blood?

1476
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:17,050
The meat will be smelly.

1477
01:02:17,051 --> 01:02:18,721
- It will?
- Yes.

1478
01:02:20,891 --> 01:02:21,960
Hi, Mom.

1479
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:27,701
Mom. Once, you told me how to make galbijjim.

1480
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,330
What are the steps again?

1481
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:33,371
- First, you need to make the broth.
- Okay.

1482
01:02:33,801 --> 01:02:37,370
To make the broth, add sugar, soy sauce...

1483
01:02:37,371 --> 01:02:39,379
a lot of garlic, and ground black pepper.

1484
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,840
Well... Okay.

1485
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,011
- You boil the meat with the broth.
- Okay.

1486
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:47,649
- But not with too much broth.
- Okay.

1487
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:50,249
- Simmer it like it boils down.
- Okay.

1488
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,760
There will be more water coming out from the meat too.

1489
01:02:52,761 --> 01:02:55,260
Really? Okay.

1490
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:59,200
If you don't have the broth, use Japanese soy sauce.

1491
01:02:59,201 --> 01:03:03,499
And for 1 cup of soy sauce, pour 2 cups of water.

1492
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,530
(The recipe is more complicated than he thought.)

1493
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,471
- Then...
- Okay.

1494
01:03:06,641 --> 01:03:09,140
That way, it will be tastier.

1495
01:03:09,141 --> 01:03:10,741
All right.

1496
01:03:11,141 --> 01:03:13,340
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1497
01:03:13,341 --> 01:03:14,380
(He has finally finished the call.)

1498
01:03:14,681 --> 01:03:15,681
Gosh.

1499
01:03:16,281 --> 01:03:18,680
- Dong Il. If there isn't a broth...
- Okay.

1500
01:03:18,681 --> 01:03:20,750
You can use Japanese soy sauce. For one cup of Japanese soy sauce,

1501
01:03:21,781 --> 01:03:23,250
add two cups of water.

1502
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:25,121
I will use this to make the broth.

1503
01:03:25,321 --> 01:03:26,360
For the broth?

1504
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:28,590
We need to use the water that was boiled with meat.

1505
01:03:28,591 --> 01:03:29,630
(He is drawing the blood out of the meat to make the broth.)

1506
01:03:30,031 --> 01:03:32,329
(So we have the broth?)

1507
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:33,829
Okay. And then...

1508
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:35,829
(After the broth is made...)

1509
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:36,900
I forgot.

1510
01:03:37,601 --> 01:03:39,900
(Come on, Hee Won.)

1511
01:03:40,601 --> 01:03:42,840
- Do you want me to ask her again?
- No, I know how to make the broth.

1512
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:44,170
- You do?
- Yes.

1513
01:03:44,911 --> 01:03:46,439
So you make the broth separately?

1514
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,480
- No. This will be the broth.
- No?

1515
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,280
(In order to remove the meat smell, he is adding roots of scallions...)

1516
01:03:52,281 --> 01:03:53,681
- This is to remove the meat smell.
- I see.

1517
01:03:53,721 --> 01:03:54,820
You can smell them, right?

1518
01:03:54,821 --> 01:03:56,121
(and bay leaves.)

1519
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:59,621
(Safely filmed with permission from the owner)

1520
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:03,190
(Starting to make the broth)

1521
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:08,230
(Dong Il, an excellent cook, )

1522
01:04:08,931 --> 01:04:11,701
(is chopping the vegetables.)

1523
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:15,571
(Myoung is rounding up the edges.)

1524
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:19,380
- You know what? Myoung is...
- Okay.

1525
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,640
Rounding up the edges of the vegetables.

1526
01:04:21,641 --> 01:04:22,649
(He is rounding up the edges so that they wouldn't break in the pot.)

1527
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:25,451
It will be smoother and softer when you eat it.

1528
01:04:26,121 --> 01:04:27,250
See how detail-oriented he is.

1529
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:28,650
(Sighing)

1530
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,290
What a shame.

1531
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:32,559
Don't you think so?

1532
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,621
- What do you mean?
- Well,

1533
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,629
because we can't see him.

1534
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:37,229
(Because we can't see him for a while.)

1535
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:39,101
(Feeling sad)

1536
01:04:39,601 --> 01:04:41,900
(Take care. You will be discharged soon.)

1537
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,269
I'm adding five of Cheongyang chili.

1538
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:46,540
If you want it spicier, let me know.

1539
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:51,309
(He is tasting a piece of Cheongyang chili.)

1540
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:52,310
So? Spicy enough?

1541
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,040
- It's not really spicy.
- You want me to add more?

1542
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,480
I think you can add more.

1543
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:58,351
Can you pull out Cheongyang chili then?

1544
01:04:58,451 --> 01:05:00,220
Pull out how much ever you want.

1545
01:05:00,221 --> 01:05:01,821
(You can add as many as you like.)

1546
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,951
How about two more?

1547
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:04,320
(Giggling)

1548
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:06,060
(Is it a lot?)

1549
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:09,991
- Shall I not put them?
- Yes. I like spicy food too.

1550
01:05:12,031 --> 01:05:15,031
(Chopping a lot of Cheongyang chilis as Chang Wook wants)

1551
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,530
Preparing is done.

1552
01:05:16,531 --> 01:05:17,601
- Already?
- Yes.

1553
01:05:19,601 --> 01:05:22,609
(Meanwhile, the broth for galbijjim is boiling up.)

1554
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:24,610
My gosh. The broth smells nice.

1555
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:28,940
(Exclaiming)

1556
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:30,950
- Isn't it awesome?
- It smells like galbitang.

1557
01:05:30,951 --> 01:05:32,209
- It smells like galbitang.
- Yes, you're right.

1558
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:33,850
- That's how it should smell.
- It does smell like that.

1559
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:34,920
Yes. You're right.

1560
01:05:35,721 --> 01:05:37,149
(Hee Won is following where Dong Il goes.)

1561
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:39,460
So when it's boiled up,

1562
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,591
- you put it in the pressure cooker.
- Yes.

1563
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:44,531
Pour the broth until right above the meat.

1564
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:45,999
It has to be simmered like it would boil down.

1565
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,261
(Right above the meat?)

1566
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,371
First, we put the condiments here...

1567
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:51,129
Honey is going in.

1568
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:53,040
(Instead of sugar, he is using the buckwheat honey.)

1569
01:05:53,341 --> 01:05:55,269
- Minced garlic.
- Okay, minced garlic.

1570
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:56,641
She told me to put a lot of it.

1571
01:05:56,741 --> 01:05:59,480
Okay, minced garlic. This is enough.

1572
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:01,280
(And my mom said...)

1573
01:06:01,281 --> 01:06:03,649
- It will do, right?
- Soy sauce.

1574
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:04,950
Give me the soy sauce. It's there.

1575
01:06:04,951 --> 01:06:06,120
(Soy sauce)

1576
01:06:06,121 --> 01:06:08,321
- So? Shall I pour it?
- A little bit. Good.

1577
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,720
- Garlic and...
- Here is the black pepper.

1578
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:12,559
(He is trying to open the lid.)

1579
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,560
What is this?

1580
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,129
How do I open it? I got it.

1581
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:17,491
Is this the one I need to grind it?

1582
01:06:18,161 --> 01:06:19,260
- Turn it like this.
- How?

1583
01:06:19,261 --> 01:06:20,300
(Hee Won managed to open the lid.)

1584
01:06:20,301 --> 01:06:22,600
(He squeezes the bottle like he squeezes water out of clothes.)

1585
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:23,670
No. Not like that.

1586
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Like this.

1587
01:06:26,141 --> 01:06:28,400
(Oh, I see.)

1588
01:06:28,971 --> 01:06:32,940
(Adding ground black pepper which will remove the meat smell)

1589
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:37,850
(Transferring the boiled meat into the pressure cooker)

1590
01:06:37,851 --> 01:06:40,820
- It requires a lot of effort.
- It does.

1591
01:06:40,821 --> 01:06:43,351
(Putting the vegetable chunks)

1592
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:45,859
- Okay, and then...
- We need the broth.

1593
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,221
- Lift it.
- Okay.

1594
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,261
(Adding the broth is an important step that Hee Won's mom emphasized.)

1595
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,230
- Now we need to add the broth.
- Right. We have to put this in.

1596
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:58,000
We have to put enough broth in to cover the meat.

1597
01:06:58,270 --> 01:06:59,939
- Goodness.
- Put in just enough.

1598
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:05,141
(He pours in the broth according to Hee Won's request.)

1599
01:07:05,511 --> 01:07:09,181
(Is that enough?)

1600
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:11,610
(Pouring)

1601
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:13,019
- Is that enough?
- It is.

1602
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,380
(- Is that enough? - It is.)

1603
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:17,850
- It's ready. That's it.
- Okay.

1604
01:07:17,851 --> 01:07:19,221
(He poured in the broth according to Hee Won's request.)

1605
01:07:19,591 --> 01:07:21,160
(The lid to lock them all in appears.)

1606
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:22,161
The lid.

1607
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:28,130
(They just need to boil them, and they're done!)

1608
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:34,241
(Meanwhile, Chang Wook is...)

1609
01:07:34,841 --> 01:07:35,910
Okay, seaweed...

1610
01:07:36,441 --> 01:07:39,210
- Seaweed soup is easy.
- Is it?

1611
01:07:39,481 --> 01:07:41,910
You stir-fry the meat with the soaked seaweed.

1612
01:07:42,111 --> 01:07:44,580
Then you add water. You season it with soup soy sauce.

1613
01:07:45,481 --> 01:07:47,020
Then the seaweed soup is done.

1614
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,119
(Seaweed soup is easy, isn't it?)

1615
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,489
- It's simple.
- What?

1616
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:50,620
- It's simple.
- Right?

1617
01:07:50,891 --> 01:07:54,521
(Laughing)

1618
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:56,459
(Shall I get started?)

1619
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,530
Do we have a smaller pot?

1620
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:00,300
(He soaks the seaweed first.)

1621
01:08:00,301 --> 01:08:01,361
How many grams is this?

1622
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:04,169
It's 20 servings.

1623
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:06,971
(It's 20 servings.)

1624
01:08:07,401 --> 01:08:10,471
(Just adding it without thinking about it)

1625
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,310
This is good.

1626
01:08:12,311 --> 01:08:15,040
(Seaweed soup recipe: 1. Stir-fry the meat.)

1627
01:08:15,441 --> 01:08:16,480
(He adds perilla oil to the pan.)

1628
01:08:16,481 --> 01:08:17,481
Rice?

1629
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:19,520
(He adds one fistful.)

1630
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:20,749
(He adds another fistful.)

1631
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:23,851
(Pouring)

1632
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:25,420
(He puts in the minced garlic with his hand.)

1633
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:26,420
Really?

1634
01:08:26,421 --> 01:08:27,561
(Measuring is a luxury.)

1635
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:32,931
(Why is he so relaxed when it's his first time?)

1636
01:08:33,431 --> 01:08:34,699
Stir-fry the beef.

1637
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,000
(On top of the delicious beef)

1638
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:38,829
Stir-fry the seaweed with it.

1639
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:40,340
(Seaweed soup recipe: 2. Stir-fry the seaweed.)

1640
01:08:40,341 --> 01:08:42,401
(He squeezes out some of the water.)

1641
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:43,909
Stir-fry with the seaweed.

1642
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:46,079
(He throws in the seaweed too.)

1643
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,409
Stir-fry the seaweed too.

1644
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:48,681

(Seaweed soup recipe: 3. Add water.)

1646
01:08:50,281 --> 01:08:52,080
Add water and let it boil.

1647
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,650
Two spoonfuls of soup soy sauce.

1648
01:08:54,651 --> 01:08:56,151
(Pouring)

1649
01:08:56,521 --> 01:08:57,790
Okay. I'm done.

1650
01:08:59,521 --> 01:09:02,021
I think this is my first time making seaweed soup.

1651
01:09:02,191 --> 01:09:03,391
- Really?
- Yes.

1652
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:06,060
But what if it tastes really good?

1653
01:09:06,061 --> 01:09:07,659
(But what if it tastes really good?)

1654
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:10,931
(Laughing)

1655
01:09:11,971 --> 01:09:16,111
(The first seaweed soup I ever made)

1656
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,369
(He's waiting for it to boil.)

1657
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:20,580
I hope it comes out well.

1658
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,419
It's boiling. It looks good.

1659
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:27,650
(The seaweed soup is finally boiling.)

1660
01:09:27,651 --> 01:09:28,651
Hold on.

1661
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,250
It smells pretty good.

1662
01:09:33,391 --> 01:09:35,360
(Slurping)

1663
01:09:35,361 --> 01:09:38,029
(Smacking his lips)

1664
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:42,101
(Something is...)

1665
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:47,970
(He tastes it again.)

1666
01:09:47,971 --> 01:09:49,771
(Thinking)

1667
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:51,270
(Glancing again)

1668
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:52,410
How is it?

1669
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:57,111
Can you taste it and tell me how it is?

1670
01:09:58,481 --> 01:10:02,419
(He grabs a new spoon and gets a spoonful for him.)

1671
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:03,420
It's...

1672
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:04,750
(Sighing)

1673
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,659
I don't know. Something is...

1674
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:10,231
(He gives a spoonful while worrying about it.)

1675
01:10:12,261 --> 01:10:13,960
- Do you know what I mean?
- I do.

1676
01:10:14,261 --> 01:10:17,470
It's not bland,

1677
01:10:17,471 --> 01:10:19,771
but something is missing.

1678
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,270
Should I add some more soy sauce?

1679
01:10:23,271 --> 01:10:24,569
(He is thinking hard.)

1680
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:25,570
Will that make it salty?

1681
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:29,140
Or you can add some shrimp jeotgal.

1682
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:30,311
You add shrimp jeotgal to this?

1683
01:10:31,651 --> 01:10:32,749
(He puts the good tip into action.)

1684
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:33,780
Over there.

1685
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:36,120
It's over here. Nice.

1686
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:39,861
- Too much will make it salty.
- Right.

1687
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:41,920
If it's too salty, I can add more water.

1688
01:10:42,091 --> 01:10:43,159
Right.

1689
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,231
(He's so cool.)

1690
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:47,430
(Will that...)

1691
01:10:47,431 --> 01:10:51,000
(complete the taste?)

1692
01:10:51,401 --> 01:10:52,529
(He adds some seasoned salt.)

1693
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:53,840
If it still tastes bad after this...

1694
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:54,900
(He's filled with confidence.)

1695
01:10:54,901 --> 01:10:57,040
(Laughing)

1696
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:58,970
It's done.

1697
01:10:58,971 --> 01:11:00,079
(How good will the beef seaweed soup be?)

1698
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,080
I had put in every ingredient I have.

1699
01:11:04,181 --> 01:11:05,579
I need to make a rolled omelet.

1700
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:06,651
(Oh, right. The rolled omelet.)

1701
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,819
(He takes out the leftover eggs...)

1702
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:11,419
(that Hee Won used at breakfast.)

1703
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:12,920
(Humming)

1704
01:11:13,221 --> 01:11:17,091
I should add some of the leftover carrots too

1705
01:11:17,861 --> 01:11:20,801
(The leftover carrots that he cut off earlier)

1706
01:11:21,561 --> 01:11:25,301
(Cutting them up into small pieces!)

1707
01:11:25,901 --> 01:11:27,239
(He adds them to the eggs, )

1708
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,771
(so it will look pretty.)

1709
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:33,340
(He adjusts it to low heat.)

1710
01:11:33,341 --> 01:11:34,380
Oh, yes.

1711
01:11:36,011 --> 01:11:37,050
(Sighing)

1712
01:11:37,051 --> 01:11:40,620
(This was too hard for Hee Won.)

1713
01:11:41,181 --> 01:11:44,691
(But he does it is easily as though he's breathing.)

1714
01:11:45,651 --> 01:11:48,119
(He pours in the eggs.)

1715
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,760
(He controls it and adjusts the amount.)

1716
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:53,030
(He moves around the frying pan.)

1717
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,529
(He makes sure it's thin and even.)

1718
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:56,830
(Making sure there are no empty spaces)

1719
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:01,801
(He lets go and waits for a second.)

1720
01:12:02,271 --> 01:12:03,940
(When the middle starts to cook)

1721
01:12:03,941 --> 01:12:06,141
(Careful)

1722
01:12:06,511 --> 01:12:07,579
(He looks like he's familiar with this.)

1723
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,950
(Relaxed and skilled)

1724
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,580
(Folding the eggs was really hard for Hee Won.)

1725
01:12:14,851 --> 01:12:15,851
(He feared folding eggs.)

1726
01:12:15,852 --> 01:12:18,450
(Slipping)

1727
01:12:18,891 --> 01:12:20,989
(The youngest's eggs are neat.)

1728
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:23,091
(Shall I begin rolling it up?)

1729
01:12:23,691 --> 01:12:25,360
(He pushes it with one hand as he holds on with the other.)

1730
01:12:25,361 --> 01:12:27,431
(He flips it over easily.)

1731
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:29,100
(He puts the spatula in deep.)

1732
01:12:29,101 --> 01:12:30,870
(Easy)

1733
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:34,569
(He looks like he's made rolled omelets a lot.)

1734
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:35,601
(Exclaiming)

1735
01:12:36,111 --> 01:12:37,640
(As he tries to lift it up...)

1736
01:12:37,641 --> 01:12:39,310
(He makes a mistake.)

1737
01:12:39,311 --> 01:12:40,340
No!

1738
01:12:40,341 --> 01:12:42,511
(If there's a hole in the rolled omelet, )

1739
01:12:42,981 --> 01:12:46,120
(just fill it with some more eggs.)

1740
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:49,380
(He pushes it together to make it look nice.)

1741
01:12:50,021 --> 01:12:51,449
(Once)

1742
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,820
(Twice)

1743
01:12:53,361 --> 01:12:54,890
(He makes it neat...)

1744
01:12:54,891 --> 01:12:56,391
(until the end.)

1745
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:59,861
(After he makes it look nice, )

1746
01:13:00,301 --> 01:13:04,070
(the rolled omelet is completed.)

1747
01:13:04,901 --> 01:13:08,771
(Their rolled omelets are polar opposites.)

1748
01:13:09,401 --> 01:13:10,570
(Hee Won who's in charge of galbijjim)

1749
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:13,880
(Staring)

1750
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:18,311
(Did I do everything my mom said?)

1751
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,819
- It's been ages since I heard this.
- Right?

1752
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:23,051
(Hissing)

1753
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:24,790
Isn't this good enough?

1754
01:13:25,351 --> 01:13:26,420
I don't know.

1755
01:13:27,061 --> 01:13:28,320
What do you mean, you don't know?

1756
01:13:30,391 --> 01:13:32,289
There were some problems.

1757
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:33,960
There was a problem with communication.

1758
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,500
(All of a sudden?)

1759
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:41,000
She told me to add soy sauce, but I didn't ask how much.

1760
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:44,369
She told me to add sugar, but I didn't ask how much.

1761
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:45,441
I didn't ask how much I need to add.

1762
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:46,810
My goodness.

1763
01:13:46,811 --> 01:13:47,880
(He's giving excuses since it's his mom's recipe.)

1764
01:13:48,811 --> 01:13:49,909
It's time.

1765
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:52,779
(He begins to let it simmer.)

1766
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:53,851
Okay.

1767
01:13:54,521 --> 01:13:57,591
(He smells something delicious from the kitchen.)

1768
01:13:58,191 --> 01:14:01,520
(He follows the delicious smell.)

1769
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:02,891
- Gosh.
- What's wrong?

1770
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:07,301
- This is driving me crazy.
- What's wrong?

1771
01:14:08,231 --> 01:14:09,869
He did a great job!

1772
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,471
(Unlike me!)

1773
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:13,699
The rolled omelet?

1774
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:14,739
(Laughing)

1775
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,801
Hey!

1776
01:14:16,611 --> 01:14:17,710
I know!

1777
01:14:18,011 --> 01:14:19,981
Goodness, the eggs are...

1778
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:21,740
- Hey, Chang Wook.
- Yes?

1779
01:14:21,941 --> 01:14:24,580
Look at Myoung's rolled omelet. Compare it to Hee Won's.

1780
01:14:25,351 --> 01:14:26,579
This is a real rolled omelet.

1781
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:28,780
(He's joking.)

1782
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,819
(Smacking his lips)

1783
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:31,820
My goodness.

1784
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:33,619
Chief Myoung.

1785
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:34,891
(He acknowledges him.)

1786
01:14:35,021 --> 01:14:37,130
- No, don't say that.
- How did you roll it?

1787
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:39,391
- Well.
- This is insane.

1788
01:14:40,231 --> 01:14:42,029
What does that make you?

1789
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:43,829
I know. Why did you do such a good job?

1790
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:45,169
(Envious)

1791
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:46,740
- That's amazing.
- Goodness.

1792
01:14:47,301 --> 01:14:48,739
Why couldn't I make it like that?

1793
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:50,771
(The rolled omelet is very pretty.)

1794
01:14:51,271 --> 01:14:53,840
- Goodness.
- You were boasting about it.

1795
01:14:53,841 --> 01:14:55,510
I see why he laughed at me.

1796
01:14:55,511 --> 01:14:57,150
- No, I didn't laugh at you.
- I admit my loss.

1797
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:59,181
Goodness, the rolled omelet...

1798
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,681
is as handsome as you.

1799
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,449
(He came to look at it again.)

1800
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:07,061
- He did a great job.
- Right?

1801
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:09,190
You're really good at this.

1802
01:15:09,191 --> 01:15:10,191
(Envious)

1803
01:15:10,192 --> 01:15:11,261
How did you do it?

1804
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:14,499
- You put it on low heat?
- Yes.

1805
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,200
(He's interested.)

1806
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:20,641
(He's watching the youngest's cooking show in the 1st row.)

1807
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:25,040
Goodness, the rolled omelet looks perfect.

1808
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,180
(Hee Won is frozen in place.)

1809
01:15:30,181 --> 01:15:31,311
I think I made too many.

1810
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:33,981
The rolled omelets are no joke.

1811
01:15:34,221 --> 01:15:35,420
You did a great job.

1812
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:40,960
Wait.

1813
01:15:41,561 --> 01:15:42,590
What?

1814
01:15:42,591 --> 01:15:44,790
(He's very sensitive.)

1815
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:48,100
(He rolls it for the last time.)

1816
01:15:48,101 --> 01:15:50,431
- Gosh, rolled omelets...
- Isn't he incredible?

1817
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,069
Can be made this easily?

1818
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:55,699
(Rolled omelets can be made this easily?)

1819
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:56,709
Good job.

1820
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:57,740
(Bitter)

1821
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:03,511
(It's okay. I have the beef galbijjim!)

1822
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:05,879
(They waited for a long time for it to be finished.)

1823
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:06,950
I hope it came out well.

1824
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,580
It'll be good.

1825
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,489
Okay. Open it.

1826
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:13,320
(The beef galbijjim made with Hee Won's mother's recipe.)

1827
01:16:13,721 --> 01:16:20,130
(Did it turn out delicious?)

1828
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:27,471
(Watery)

1829
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:33,140
(Why does it look like this?)

1830
01:16:33,141 --> 01:16:35,010
Should we add more and do it again?

1831
01:16:35,011 --> 01:16:37,280
What? It's hot! Why is this so hot?

1832
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,120
There's too much water in it.

1833
01:16:40,851 --> 01:16:41,879
Do we need to boil it longer?

1834
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,591
I know, right? There's too much water.

1835
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:51,931
(We have to put enough broth in to cover the meat.)

1836
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:53,901
- Is that enough?
- It is.

1837
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,029
(It's ready.)

1838
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:56,471
(It's not ready...)

1839
01:16:58,971 --> 01:17:01,169
(This isn't enough. It's too much.)

1840
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:03,870
(This is enough.)

1841
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,449
Putting in enough broth means...

1842
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:11,511
(He realizes it belatedly.)

1843
01:17:13,851 --> 01:17:15,080
- Is it wrong?
- Let's do it again.

1844
01:17:16,351 --> 01:17:17,490
- Goodness.
- Well...

1845
01:17:17,691 --> 01:17:19,090
We must remove some broth. We put in too much.

1846
01:17:19,091 --> 01:17:22,289
Hold on. We have no choice.

1847
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:24,891
Lift it up. This is an emergency.

1848
01:17:26,061 --> 01:17:27,159
It's okay.

1849
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,360
(Hee Won, it's okay!)

1850
01:17:28,361 --> 01:17:29,401
It's okay.

1851
01:17:29,534 --> 01:17:31,162
- We have to do this again.
- Right?

1852
01:17:31,163 --> 01:17:32,873
It's an emergency. We need to...

1853
01:17:33,805 --> 01:17:35,003
This is...

1854
01:17:35,004 --> 01:17:37,174
(He moves the broth into a separate pot.)

1855
01:17:37,905 --> 01:17:39,774
(He can't help but sigh.)

1856
01:17:39,775 --> 01:17:41,074
No, it'll be okay.

1857
01:17:41,704 --> 01:17:43,105
It'll be okay. Don't worry.

1858
01:17:43,945 --> 01:17:44,975
It's okay.

1859
01:17:46,145 --> 01:17:48,213
(Dong Il keeps comforting Hee Won.)

1860
01:17:48,214 --> 01:17:49,315
Right. It's okay.

1861
01:17:49,954 --> 01:17:51,083
It's because there's a lot.

1862
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:52,154
(He adds some more seasoning.)

1863
01:17:52,155 --> 01:17:53,185
It'll be okay.

1864
01:17:53,685 --> 01:17:57,855
(He's sweating.)

1865
01:17:58,055 --> 01:17:59,694
The meat and vegetables are cooked perfectly.

1866
01:17:59,695 --> 01:18:02,264
Yes, they are. This is not a big problem.

1867
01:18:02,265 --> 01:18:03,834
Take this and boil it.

1868
01:18:04,895 --> 01:18:05,934
There we go.

1869
01:18:05,935 --> 01:18:08,003
(Will he be able to revive this?)

1870
01:18:08,004 --> 01:18:09,734
This is how they make it...

1871
01:18:09,735 --> 01:18:11,203
- That's true.
- in restaurants.

1872
01:18:11,204 --> 01:18:13,474
- They use a pressure cooker first.
- Right.

1873
01:18:13,475 --> 01:18:16,044
- Then they do this.
- This is what your mother meant.

1874
01:18:16,345 --> 01:18:18,073
(But Hee Won is still worried.)

1875
01:18:18,074 --> 01:18:19,145
There we go.

1876
01:18:20,544 --> 01:18:22,814
We can do it! I'll fix it.

1877
01:18:22,815 --> 01:18:23,815
(He's worried about Hee Won.)

1878
01:18:24,084 --> 01:18:27,024
(He peeks over this shoulder, )

1879
01:18:27,025 --> 01:18:28,225
(then over that shoulder.)

1880
01:18:30,494 --> 01:18:33,095
(Glancing)

1881
01:18:33,365 --> 01:18:36,464
(He sees the live long-legged octopus that Dong Il prepared.)

1882
01:18:38,034 --> 01:18:39,034
Should we add the octopus?

1883
01:18:39,035 --> 01:18:40,133
(I should help.)

1884
01:18:40,134 --> 01:18:41,504
- It's long-legged octopus.
- Oh, should we add it?

1885
01:18:41,765 --> 01:18:43,534
(Laughing)

1886
01:18:43,935 --> 01:18:46,134
(Laughing)

1887
01:18:47,945 --> 01:18:49,604
- Should we add it now?
- In a little bit.

1888
01:18:49,605 --> 01:18:51,445
- Okay.
- In a little bit.

1889
01:18:53,685 --> 01:18:58,555
(While he puts down his worries for a moment...)

1890
01:18:59,155 --> 01:19:01,354
It looks better now. I'm serious, Hee Won.

1891
01:19:01,355 --> 01:19:02,355
Is it okay?

1892
01:19:03,055 --> 01:19:04,423
The color is...

1893
01:19:04,424 --> 01:19:05,424
(He's a bit more relaxed now.)

1894
01:19:05,425 --> 01:19:07,464
No. Look at it. Taste the soup.

1895
01:19:08,265 --> 01:19:09,424
It's completely different from before.

1896
01:19:10,265 --> 01:19:11,434
It's definitely your mother's recipe.

1897
01:19:11,435 --> 01:19:12,633
(He opens his mouth.)

1898
01:19:12,634 --> 01:19:13,634
(Blowing)

1899
01:19:13,635 --> 01:19:14,663
You can just give it to me. It's fine.

1900
01:19:14,664 --> 01:19:16,004
(He's worried again.)

1901
01:19:16,204 --> 01:19:17,274
It's really good.

1902
01:19:17,275 --> 01:19:19,435
(Did he revive the taste too?)

1903
01:19:19,775 --> 01:19:21,475
- It's good.
- Isn't it?

1904
01:19:22,105 --> 01:19:23,975
It's perfect. I revived it.

1905
01:19:24,275 --> 01:19:26,615
We just need to let it boil down now.

1906
01:19:27,645 --> 01:19:30,154
(The youngest finishes making his rolled omelet.)

1907
01:19:30,155 --> 01:19:32,155
Gosh, the omelet...

1908
01:19:32,584 --> 01:19:34,584
is as handsome as our youngest.

1909
01:19:34,985 --> 01:19:36,823
Let's scoop some rice now.

1910
01:19:36,824 --> 01:19:39,725
- Shall I do that?
- Yes. Then we'll be ready to eat.

1911
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:43,793
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food!

1912
01:19:43,794 --> 01:19:44,935
(Shall we start eating dinner?)

1913
01:19:45,294 --> 01:19:49,704
(The beef galbijjim made with care and difficulties...)

1914
01:19:50,305 --> 01:19:53,974
(and Chang Wook's first seaweed soup that is half beef and half seaweed.)

1915
01:19:53,975 --> 01:19:54,975
This is game over.

1916
01:19:55,405 --> 01:19:58,845
Where did he learn to make rolled omelets like that?

1917
01:19:59,645 --> 01:20:03,515
(The Korean dinner that looks like a birthday meal is complete.)

1918
01:20:03,855 --> 01:20:06,454
(Nervous)

1919
01:20:06,924 --> 01:20:10,324
We made the galbijjim with Hee Won's mother's 40-year-old recipe.

1920
01:20:10,725 --> 01:20:11,794
Korean beef ribs.

1921
01:20:11,994 --> 01:20:16,664
(He takes a big bite.)

1922
01:20:17,195 --> 01:20:21,265
(The youngest also bites into a piece.)

1923
01:20:21,805 --> 01:20:24,935
(How does it taste?)

1924
01:20:25,174 --> 01:20:26,775
- How is it?
- It's good.

1925
01:20:29,145 --> 01:20:31,445
Try the ribs. I'm serious.

1926
01:20:32,874 --> 01:20:33,944
- It's good.
- Try the ribs.

1927
01:20:33,945 --> 01:20:35,583
(The galbijjim is amazing.)

1928
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,753
(Savoring)

1929
01:20:36,754 --> 01:20:37,784
How is it?

1930
01:20:38,155 --> 01:20:39,284
It's good.

1931
01:20:40,525 --> 01:20:42,054
- It's good. Yes.
- Isn't it?

1932
01:20:42,055 --> 01:20:43,055
(Unsure)

1933
01:20:43,924 --> 01:20:45,655
- It's sweet.
- Right.

1934
01:20:45,994 --> 01:20:47,623
It's seasoned perfectly.

1935
01:20:47,624 --> 01:20:50,735
(The beef galbijjim is nice and sweet just like how they like it.)

1936
01:20:51,095 --> 01:20:52,935
(Savoring)

1937
01:20:53,164 --> 01:20:54,564
I was flustered.

1938
01:20:54,565 --> 01:20:56,504
(He's relieved after seeing them enjoy it.)

1939
01:20:58,305 --> 01:20:59,703
How did you manage to save this?

1940
01:20:59,704 --> 01:21:02,173
(But how did you manage to save this?)

1941
01:21:02,174 --> 01:21:04,614
- It's really good.
- It's his mother's recipe.

1942
01:21:04,615 --> 01:21:06,213
(This is all thanks to Hee Won's mother's recipe.)

1943
01:21:06,214 --> 01:21:07,883
We boiled it for so long, so...

1944
01:21:07,884 --> 01:21:12,115
(He can't finish his sentence.)

1945
01:21:12,355 --> 01:21:14,284
So it would be weird if the meat wasn't seasoned.

1946
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:19,595
(He was nervous about his mother's recipe.)

1947
01:21:19,695 --> 01:21:21,493
- It's very good.
- What?

1948
01:21:21,494 --> 01:21:23,464
- It's really good.
- Isn't it?

1949
01:21:25,634 --> 01:21:27,404
(Chef Sung, who had to fix it, is very satisfied.)

1950
01:21:27,405 --> 01:21:28,664
The ribs are really good.

1951
01:21:30,435 --> 01:21:32,775
(Is it my turn now?)

1952
01:21:33,374 --> 01:21:36,714
(How does Chang Wook's first seaweed soup taste?)

1953
01:21:37,645 --> 01:21:40,884
(Grabbing)

1954
01:21:41,845 --> 01:21:46,515
(My seaweed soup)

1955
01:21:48,384 --> 01:21:49,854
(Nodding)

1956
01:21:49,855 --> 01:21:50,855
Try the soup.

1957
01:21:50,856 --> 01:21:51,954
(Is he satisfied? Try the seaweed soup.)

1958
01:21:53,595 --> 01:21:56,224
(Slurping)

1959
01:21:56,225 --> 01:21:57,935
(Slurping)

1960
01:22:01,464 --> 01:22:03,134
(Exclaiming)

1961
01:22:03,905 --> 01:22:04,905
You did a great job.

1962
01:22:04,906 --> 01:22:06,503
(Chef Sung acknowledges him.)

1963
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:07,645
You seasoned it well.

1964
01:22:09,204 --> 01:22:13,414
(He takes another bite.)

1965
01:22:14,185 --> 01:22:15,645
The more you eat it, the better it tastes.

1966
01:22:15,945 --> 01:22:17,154
I can't stop eating it.

1967
01:22:17,155 --> 01:22:18,254
(The more you try the seaweed soup, the better it tastes.)

1968
01:22:18,454 --> 01:22:20,254
Gosh, this seaweed soup is very good.

1969
01:22:21,055 --> 01:22:23,155
- The seaweed soup is really good.
- It is.

1970
01:22:23,494 --> 01:22:24,595
- Is it okay?
- First...

1971
01:22:25,355 --> 01:22:28,794
(I knew it.)

1972
01:22:30,164 --> 01:22:31,865
(Glancing)

1973
01:22:32,134 --> 01:22:33,664
Can I eat the rolled omelet?

1974
01:22:34,235 --> 01:22:36,164
- Yes.
- It's too pretty to eat.

1975
01:22:37,334 --> 01:22:39,604
Don't you agree? I can't bring myself to touch it.

1976
01:22:39,605 --> 01:22:40,645
(Embarrassed)

1977
01:22:41,105 --> 01:22:44,213
(Unlike Hee Won's carp bread, this rolled omelet is pretty.)

1978
01:22:44,214 --> 01:22:47,384
(How does it taste?)

1979
01:22:47,985 --> 01:22:51,055
Honestly, this rolled omelet is too pretty to eat.

1980
01:22:52,055 --> 01:22:54,954
(Laughing at Hee Won)

1981
01:22:55,685 --> 01:22:58,824
Honestly, this rolled omelet is too pretty to eat.

1982
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:02,164
(Laughing at Hee Won)

1983
01:23:03,325 --> 01:23:04,725
- Are you going to eat the omelet?
- What?

1984
01:23:04,726 --> 01:23:05,965
Eat a piece. Try it.

1985
01:23:05,966 --> 01:23:07,864
- You don't know how it will taste.
- No, it'll be good.

1986
01:23:07,865 --> 01:23:09,796
Try it. Try the rolled omelet.

1987
01:23:11,306 --> 01:23:12,364
Try it. How is it?

1988
01:23:12,365 --> 01:23:13,635
(He eats the rolled omelet against his will.)

1989
01:23:13,636 --> 01:23:15,806
You were the one who seasoned it earlier.

1990
01:23:17,575 --> 01:23:19,145
- It's good.
- It's good.

1991
01:23:20,575 --> 01:23:22,846
(He's enjoying it.)

1992
01:23:23,615 --> 01:23:26,284
(He did a great job rolling this.)

1993
01:23:26,285 --> 01:23:27,686
Look at how he's eating the rolled omelet.

1994
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:30,926
(What is it?)

1995
01:23:31,726 --> 01:23:32,784
How do you roll it?

1996
01:23:32,785 --> 01:23:34,025
(How do you roll the rolled omelet?)

1997
01:23:34,325 --> 01:23:36,096
(Laughing)

1998
01:23:36,626 --> 01:23:37,666
How do you roll it?

1999
01:23:38,395 --> 01:23:39,425
Tell him.

2000
01:23:39,426 --> 01:23:42,494
I did the same thing you did,

2001
01:23:42,495 --> 01:23:44,035
but I did it twice.

2002
01:23:44,766 --> 01:23:46,704
I poured the eggs in again.

2003
01:23:46,705 --> 01:23:47,935
(Pour in the eggs again.)

2004
01:23:47,936 --> 01:23:49,235
You pour the eggs in again?

2005
01:23:50,235 --> 01:23:51,244
(He thinks this is funny.)

2006
01:23:51,245 --> 01:23:54,475
After you roll it, push it back.

2007
01:23:54,476 --> 01:23:57,785
Push it back to where you started. Then pour in some more eggs.

2008
01:23:58,285 --> 01:23:59,814
Then wait for a little and roll it again.

2009
01:23:59,815 --> 01:24:00,854
(Make it as thin as possible and add more eggs.)

2010
01:24:00,855 --> 01:24:01,886
That's how you do it.

2011
01:24:02,785 --> 01:24:05,385
(He gets how to do it now.)

2012
01:24:05,386 --> 01:24:06,626
Is that it?

2013
01:24:07,695 --> 01:24:09,955
(Is he going to try again?)

2014
01:24:11,025 --> 01:24:12,524
It has been fun.

2015
01:24:12,525 --> 01:24:14,766
(It's been fun.)

2016
01:24:15,096 --> 01:24:17,365
(Laughing)

2017
01:24:17,705 --> 01:24:21,006
Work hard wherever you are and live a good life.

2018
01:24:21,575 --> 01:24:23,945
(You're so funny.)

2019
01:24:24,546 --> 01:24:25,644
- Okay.
- Right.

2020
01:24:25,645 --> 01:24:29,176
(Dinner is filled with laughter at Hee Won's cute jealousy.)

2021
01:24:29,275 --> 01:24:30,346
I'm so full.

2022
01:24:30,485 --> 01:24:32,186
I think I ate the most today.

2023
01:24:33,016 --> 01:24:34,555
Goodness.

2024
01:24:34,556 --> 01:24:37,885
(They finish their satisfying dinner.)

2025
01:24:37,886 --> 01:24:39,025
Since...

2026
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:43,626
Since Myoung is enlisting into the army soon,

2027
01:24:44,426 --> 01:24:47,836
I feel a bit sad.

2028
01:24:49,436 --> 01:24:50,436
Right?

2029
01:24:50,735 --> 01:24:53,136
Stay healthy during your service.

2030
01:24:54,336 --> 01:24:57,805
(Thinking)

2031
01:24:57,806 --> 01:24:59,805
(Hesitating)

2032
01:24:59,806 --> 01:25:00,915
When I get back,

2033
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:03,274
(When I get back...)

2034
01:25:03,275 --> 01:25:06,284
you have to save this spot for me.

2035
01:25:06,285 --> 01:25:08,654
(Save a spot for me.)

2036
01:25:08,655 --> 01:25:09,716
Okay?

2037
01:25:10,556 --> 01:25:13,555
(Dong Il melts at the youngest's cuteness.)

2038
01:25:13,556 --> 01:25:16,555
(Dong Il melts at the youngest's cuteness.)

2039
01:25:16,556 --> 01:25:17,726
Okay?

2040
01:25:19,726 --> 01:25:21,994
- Okay?
- I was planning on doing that,

2041
01:25:21,995 --> 01:25:24,034
but I decided to go against it after your rolled omelet.

2042
01:25:24,035 --> 01:25:26,305
(I decided to go against it after your rolled omelet.)

2043
01:25:26,306 --> 01:25:28,375
(He's tearing up.)

2044
01:25:28,376 --> 01:25:29,405
Why?

2045
01:25:30,445 --> 01:25:31,774
(He knows how to bear a grudge.)

2046
01:25:31,775 --> 01:25:33,445
It wasn't good form.

2047
01:25:35,216 --> 01:25:41,315
(They laugh at Hee Won's jealousy over the rolled omelet.)

2048
01:25:41,586 --> 01:25:43,416
Why?

2049
01:25:43,686 --> 01:25:46,126
Didn't you think about me while making that rolled omelet?

2050
01:25:47,056 --> 01:25:49,394
Didn't you think you shouldn't roll it well?

2051
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:51,395
- You should've purposely messed up.
- Right.

2052
01:25:51,926 --> 01:25:53,465
Our youngest is still naive,

2053
01:25:53,466 --> 01:25:54,895
- so he doesn't know these things.
- Right.

2054
01:25:55,296 --> 01:25:57,436
Once he finishes his military service...

2055
01:25:57,535 --> 01:25:58,666
- Really?
- Yes.

2056
01:25:58,865 --> 01:26:00,904
He was discharged only two years ago.

2057
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:03,275
He's so relaxed compared to Myoung.

2058
01:26:03,846 --> 01:26:04,875
Of course.

2059
01:26:04,876 --> 01:26:07,046
(The relaxation of someone who completed his service)

2060
01:26:07,976 --> 01:26:13,386
(His relaxed behavior makes the family laugh.)

2061
01:26:13,745 --> 01:26:17,324
You're right. This was a fun trip.

2062
01:26:17,325 --> 01:26:20,796
(This was a fun trip.)

2063
01:26:21,325 --> 01:26:25,365
(House on Wheels' trip started in Yeongdong Wollyu Peak.)

2064
01:26:26,325 --> 01:26:28,864
(They were really awkward around each other...)

2065
01:26:28,865 --> 01:26:32,506
(when they first met.)

2066
01:26:33,235 --> 01:26:34,975
(They started during the refreshing early fall, )

2067
01:26:34,976 --> 01:26:37,345
(until the falling leaves...)

2068
01:26:37,346 --> 01:26:39,945
(turned to snow.)

2069
01:26:40,516 --> 01:26:46,546
(With their precious guests, )

2070
01:26:47,186 --> 01:26:51,685
(they had a fun time...)

2071
01:26:51,686 --> 01:26:56,556
(and created unforgettable memories.)

2072
01:26:57,325 --> 01:26:59,864
(Sometimes, we were like friends.)

2073
01:26:59,865 --> 01:27:02,565
(And at other times, we were like family.)

2074
01:27:02,766 --> 01:27:06,605
(We all became familiar with one another.)

2075
01:27:07,376 --> 01:27:11,575
(For 3 months, we laughed and traveled together.)

2076
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:14,315
(I knew it. I can't do this without you.)

2077
01:27:14,945 --> 01:27:16,915
(The three brothers of House on Wheels...)

2078
01:27:16,916 --> 01:27:20,445
(began to resemble one another.)

2079
01:27:21,056 --> 01:27:23,984
(The youngest who enjoys taking photos...)

2080
01:27:23,985 --> 01:27:26,825
(was the House on Wheels photographer.)

2081
01:27:27,395 --> 01:27:33,995
(He diligently recorded all the special moments together.)

2082
01:27:34,836 --> 01:27:39,166
(Thanks to that, our moments together will remain forever.)

2083
01:27:40,035 --> 01:27:44,275
(We will continue to reminisce them.)

2084
01:27:45,575 --> 01:27:48,476
One, two, three.

2085
01:27:50,346 --> 01:27:53,985
(Will you wait for us?)
