1
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:28,071
(House on Wheels 3 drives for the new front yard.)

2
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:30,378
The weather is amazing.

3
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:33,288
It's perfect to go on a trip.

4
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:38,089
(The air outside has become chilly, )

5
00:00:38,718 --> 00:00:41,228
(but the sunlight is as warm as ever.)

6
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:43,428
This is almost the southern end.

7
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:44,699
Almost.

8
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:48,998
(House on Wheels 3 drove for about 350km.)

9
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:49,999
(Boseong)

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,439
The land is good in the southern region.

11
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:54,339
That's why their food is tasty.

12
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:55,908
They have good soil.

13
00:00:55,909 --> 00:00:56,938
(Excited)

14
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:58,677
I'm determined this time.

15
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:01,678
I'll make you eat two bowls of rice each.

16
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:03,218
(Fresh and green field)

17
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,089
(The largest producer of green tea)

18
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:07,817
(Made by the fertile, golden plains...)

19
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,259
(and the richness of the southern sea, )

20
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:15,289
(there's a plentiful meal in the southern style.)

21
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,899
(There's also time to spare and romance here.)

22
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:21,428
(The gem of the southern coast)

23
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,768
(We came to Boseong, South Jeolla Province.)

24
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:25,467
Look at that.

25
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:26,638
(Impressed)

26
00:01:26,768 --> 00:01:28,369
It's filled with food.

27
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,107
Right, Youngest?

28
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:31,138
(Where?)

29
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:32,948
Look.

30
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:34,277
(Dong Il's point of view)

31
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:35,849
(Radishes, scallions, white rice, and mushrooms)

32
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,417
(The ripe autumn...)

33
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:41,747
(bears its fruit.)

34
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:43,888
(Feeling reassured)

35
00:01:44,658 --> 00:01:46,129
Did you talk to Ha Nee?

36
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:47,629
Yes.

37
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:49,429
I see.

38
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,258
She texted me too.

39
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,259
Okay.

40
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,267
(You too?)

41
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:54,568
I'm the only one who didn't get it.

42
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:55,968
(Fixing his sunglasses)

43
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:57,967
(The imaginary couple's bitter reality)

44
00:01:57,968 --> 00:01:59,268
(Laughing)

45
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,307
(He brought out all of his masculine side.)

46
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:03,938
(Charismatic)

47
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:05,937
(You're the flower.)

48
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:08,378
(He even said a famous saying that was only for Ha Nee.)

49
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,018
(Honey!)

50
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,248
(They say imaginary couples are strangers outside.)

51
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:15,788
I'm the only one who didn't get it.

52
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:17,588
(Feeling somewhat sentimental)

53
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:19,258
Seung Ryong texted me too.

54
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:21,989
- He said he enjoyed it a lot.
- Really?

55
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:23,827
I must have done something wrong.

56
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:25,598
No, you haven't.

57
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,028
Don't say that.

58
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,297
You worked really hard connecting them.

59
00:02:29,298 --> 00:02:35,238
(Which welcome guest will they have today?)

60
00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:40,809
(As they drove on the road with pleasant talks, )

61
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:43,748
(they see the blue sea...)

62
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:46,319
(over the high ridge.)

63
00:02:47,118 --> 00:02:48,487
(Our house is...)

64
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:51,319
(driving across the southern end.)

65
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:53,058
Incredible.

66
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:55,458
(Driving on the coastal road of Boseong)

67
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,398
(It's beautiful.)

68
00:03:00,168 --> 00:03:02,737
We're going to pick her up, right?

69
00:03:02,738 --> 00:03:04,538
- Yes.
- Yes.

70
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:07,309
We're going to the train station.

71
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,779
(Excited)

72
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,249
(Meanwhile, at the appointed place)

73
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:16,177
(Stamping)

74
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:17,779
(The guest that the family members are looking forward to meet...)

75
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:21,319
(awaits them.)

76
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,588
She was very worried.

77
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,957
She really was.

78
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,797
It's that bad? Did she call you too?

79
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:30,828
Yes.

80
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,659
He's just...

81
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:35,427
(Does that mean...)

82
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:39,069
Does that mean she's worried because of me? She never called me.

83
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:41,667
She doesn't have your number.

84
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:42,878
(That can't be.)

85
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,908
She's concerned because of me.

86
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:46,949
(Worried for some reason)

87
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:51,018
(They leave Dong Il's worries behind...)

88
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:55,189
(and head to the train station to greet the guest.)

89
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:59,259
(Entering the friendly alley)

90
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:01,449
Are we almost there?

91
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,478
(Looking around)

92
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,890
The station is at the center of a residential area.

93
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:07,460
(Peeking)

94
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,830
- I think this is it.
- We're here?

95
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,159
- There she is.
- Where? Oh, there she is.

96
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,769
(They spot the guest that arrived first.)

97
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,770
Hang on.

98
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,299
I'm so nervous.

99
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,370
(Today's guest has arrived first.)

100
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:25,869
(Chun Woo Hee is on House on Wheels 3!)

101
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,180
When will they get here?

102
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,610
(In the movie "Thread of Lies" in 2013,)

103
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,348
(she played a daughter that avoided Dong Il.)

104
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:36,349
(Woo Hee)

105
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,989
(Eating)

106
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,959
(And she played a colleague of Youngest who fed him.)

107
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,260
(Pleased)

108
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:47,859
(She's pretty close to Hee Won, whom she's filming a movie with.)

109
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:53,799
(She boldly walks her path, playing daring characters.)

110
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:56,869
(The irreplaceable actress, Chun Woo Hee)

111
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,539
(Let's go on a trip with Woo Hee today!)

112
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,279
(She sees them.)

113
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:08,049
Hello. Wow.

114
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:11,919
I'm actually seeing the house.

115
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,020
Hello!

116
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,890
(Nice to see you.)

117
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,060
- Hello, Dong Il.
- Good to see you.

118
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,899
Long time no see.

119
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,830
Hello, Hee Won.

120
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,528
Hi.

121
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:27,468
- We should have gotten here first.
- Oh, no.

122
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:28,500
We made you wait.

123
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,070
- This place is gorgeous.
- Right?

124
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,678
We picked this place on purpose.

125
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:35,778
It's so pretty. The whole town is...

126
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,710
so cute and tiny.

127
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,979
I'm so happy that I'm appearing on this show.

128
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,218
They all feel that way.

129
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,989
(Glad)

130
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,259
Hee Won told me...

131
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,928
that I could only eat and get a good rest here.

132
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:51,929
He's right.

133
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,798
But I watched the show, and the guests were all working.

134
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,059
Those are basic stuff.

135
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,329
- Those are basic stuff.
- Right.

136
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,999
- We don't force you.
- We have a motto.

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,069
"The guests don't work."

138
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,139
Right.

139
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,840
- It's up to them to work.
- They do it on their own.

140
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,038
Why don't we look around this town?

141
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,738
- Can we go?
- Yes, I hear there's a teahouse.

142
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:09,880
Sounds fun.

143
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:11,750
Were you really worried?

144
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:14,549
- You're so...
- It's going to be so fun!

145
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,789
(They talk a walk around Deungnyang Station.)

146
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,488
I didn't know they had all these.

147
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:22,559
Check this out.

148
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,859
(Everything in this town makes them nostalgic.)

149
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,529
(The older ones take a trip down memory lane.)

150
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:31,429
Look at the inside. They're still operating.

151
00:06:32,299 --> 00:06:33,538
How have you been?

152
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:34,539
(Sweet)

153
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,270
Are you having fun here?

154
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,409
(The younger ones are friendly.)

155
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:41,080
- I couldn't sleep last night.
- Why not?

156
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,249
- Because I was too excited.
- Stop it.

157
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,909
(In a different world)

158
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:48,049
How did you get smaller and cuter?

159
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,589
I was already small.

160
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,650
(Woo Hee gets all the love of Youngest.)

161
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,288
That reminds me of the past.

162
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,789
- Exactly.
- Look at the hair of the model.

163
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,789
- The hair model.
- It's so cute.

164
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:01,098
There's a car behind you.

165
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:02,700
Dong Il, it's "Captain's Giant Cannon".

166
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,728
This is a mobile. It moves.

167
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:05,868
(She naturally became part of the family.)

168
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:07,039
It's adorable.

169
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,038
- Let's go now.
- Go?

170
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,369
- Are we going?
- Yes, we found a great spot.

171
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:15,171
- Isn't it too cramped behind?
- No, it's not. I have short legs.

172
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,270
(Putting on lip balm)

173
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,911
You look pretty.

174
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,709
It's just that I had ssanghwacha earlier.

175
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,781
(Don't make me shy.)

176
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:30,950
It's because I had ssanghwacha.

177
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,790
(They head to the front yard with Woo Hee.)

178
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,390
- First time in this car, right?
- Yes.

179
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:37,360
It's pretty slow.

180
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:40,090
(We'll drive you there slowly and safely.)

181
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:42,360
I mean it. Get a good rest...

182
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,031
and eat a lot of good food before you go.

183
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,030
I think it'll be fun.

184
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:47,031
(Looking forward to it)

185
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:48,070
I'm excited.

186
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,040
(House on Wheels leaves the street of memories behind.)

187
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:56,110
It would have been great with music...

188
00:07:56,111 --> 00:07:59,009
- back at the teahouse.
- The songs of the old times?

189
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,649
Fly me a letter when you go to Naseong.

190
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,580
(Excited)

191
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:06,590
Omitting the middle part.

192
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:07,920
- That's right.
- Bye.

193
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,221
(Confused Woo Hee)

194
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,889
What was the title?

195
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,929
- "If You Go to Naseong".
- I don't think so. Is that it?

196
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,961
- Is that the right title?
- Yes.

197
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:17,529
It is?

198
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,960
- All right.
- Yes!

199
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:20,000
Nice.

200
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,669
(Playful Youngest)

201
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,701
Look at that.

202
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,639
That's right.

203
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,311
(Fly me a letter when you go to Naseong)

204
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,909
(Singing)

205
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,410
Omitting the middle part.

206
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:35,081
(They seem excited.)

207
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:38,149
- It suits the weather perfectly.
- I know, right?

208
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,721
(The song goes perfectly with the weather.)

209
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,720
(The autumn scenery of the country road...)

210
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:46,760
(softens their hearts.)

211
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,231
(As they drive by the golden fields with the old-fashioned music...)

212
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:53,970
It feels like I'm on a trip.

213
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:55,000
(It feels like a family trip.)

214
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,170
It's so fun.

215
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,669
That song also occurred to me earlier.

216
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,340
Momo is a baby.

217
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,379
- Momo is a rainbow - That song is great.

218
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,611
What's "Momo"?

219
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:07,980
- I guess we're going that way.
- Haven't you heard of it?

220
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,009
- No.
- You haven't?

221
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,050
No.

222
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:11,750
Is this the one?

223
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:15,520
("Momo" by Kim Man Jun, released in 1978)

224
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,760
- That's the one.
- Yes.

225
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:20,331
I feel like I should do this.

226
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,789
Yes, the palm clap.

227
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,930
Aren't you tempted?

228
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:26,360
(House on Wheels 3 drives excitedly.)

229
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:27,371
I feel like I should.

230
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:31,140
(Getting excited by time)

231
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,471
Momo is a rainbow.

232
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,510
(He's so cute.)

233
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:40,179
It seems to me like you all lied about your age.

234
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,350
There's no way you know this song.

235
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:43,321
(How do you know this song?)

236
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,289
When I was little, my father would...

237
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,659
always play the guitar and sing for me.

238
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,690
- He was romantic.
- Yes.

239
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:55,889
So I'm familiar with the songs from the 70s and 80s.

240
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,960
My mom used to run a Korean restaurant,

241
00:09:58,961 --> 00:10:01,571
so to try new kinds of foods,

242
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:04,601
my parents traveled a lot.

243
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:08,471
I would often skip school and tag along.

244
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:10,441
- You even skipped school?
- Yes.

245
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,951
Your parents told you to skip school and took you on the trip?

246
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:17,420
- I'm ashamed.
- Why?

247
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,050
I can't...

248
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,491
even play the guitar nor have I sung for my kids.

249
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,659
You used to sing. You even have an album.

250
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,320
- Stop.
- Really?

251
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:27,389
Come on.

252
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,390
(You're embarrassing me.)

253
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:30,259
- Stop.
- Really?

254
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,331
Come on.

255
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:34,899
- Which one?
- It was nothing.

256
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,201
I should look it up. Should I not?

257
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,040
Woo Hee, get some sleep if you're tired.

258
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:42,470
- I am curious, though.
- I know.

259
00:10:42,471 --> 00:10:43,509
(Clearing his throat)

260
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,581
For some reason...

261
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,581
(As they sang and laughed on the road, )

262
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:50,749
(the landscape has become greener.)

263
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,150
We must be almost there.

264
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:55,920
(Her eyes are wide open.)

265
00:10:56,451 --> 00:10:58,991
- Because Woo Hee is joining us, - Yes?

266
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,561
we're going to the top of the mountain.

267
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:04,399
The view will make your jaws drop.

268
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
(I'll show you an incredible view.)

269
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,570
- Really?
- I can't wait.

270
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:09,331
(Holding tightly)

271
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:11,769
This is really nice.

272
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,841
- Right?
- Yes.

273
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,570
(The tall trees welcome them.)

274
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:16,611
This is...

275
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,740
This is amazing.

276
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:22,509
(The greenery and the autumn sunlight...)

277
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,279
(permeate the house.)

278
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,451
I really love it.

279
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:28,889
Being in nature.

280
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,961
(I love the feeling of being in nature.)

281
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,490
- The trees are magnificent.
- Yes.

282
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,830
(How's the jaw-dropping view on top?)

283
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:35,990
The pine trees and cypress trees...

284
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:38,230
are harmonizing so well.

285
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,701
(They drive up the mountain road while enjoying the freshness.)

286
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:42,371
(Glittering sunlight)

287
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:45,070
It's awesome today.

288
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,039
- The weather and temperature.
- You're right about that.

289
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,670
(The sun shining through the autumn leaves is warm.)

290
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,910
- It's nice.
- My goodness.

291
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,080
(It's perfect weather to go on a trip.)

292
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:53,610
This is really amazing.

293
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:56,351
(They are proud and happy.)

294
00:11:57,121 --> 00:11:58,379
(They follow the winding ridge.)

295
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,250
- It's amazing.
- This place is quite high.

296
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,050
We're going to the top of the mountain.

297
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:08,230
(Exclaiming)

298
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:11,129
- We're here.
- Thank you for the ride.

299
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,701
(They finally arrive at the top.)

300
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:17,170
(Safely filmed with the permission from the landowner)

301
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,071
Come out and see.

302
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:20,741
(Exclaiming)

303
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:21,770
What do you think?

304
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:26,649
(He starts to applaud as soon as he gets off the car.)

305
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,451
- Follow me.
- This place is wonderful.

306
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:31,820
(They are amazed by the scenery.)

307
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:33,750
- Look at this view.
- My goodness.

308
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,759
Gosh. This is crazy.

309
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,890
(How's the jaw-dropping view from the top of the mountain?)

310
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,129
(The clear view makes you feel refreshed.)

311
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,930
- This is amazing.
- My goodness.

312
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,110
(Pretty Yedang plains spread out below their feet.)

313
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:57,241
I've never seen so many rice paddies.

314
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,679
(You can see the clean sea of Deungnyang Bay afar.)

315
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,549
We can see the sea from here.

316
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,120
(The calm sea is sparkling.)

317
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:06,550
- This is the class of our house.
- My goodness.

318
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:09,620
So this is Mount Joowol.

319
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:10,789
Mount Joowol?

320
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,159
(You can see the mountains, sea, and plains from Mount Joowol.)

321
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,430
This is amazing.

322
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:17,561
How did you find a place like this?

323
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:20,270
I've tried hard to find this place.

324
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,299
(I have to take a picture here.)

325
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,399
What do you think, Woo Hee?

326
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,871
- This place is amazing.
- I love it.

327
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,269
(Take a picture of me.)

328
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,311
Okay.

329
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:31,311
(Happy)

330
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,350
This is so nice.

331
00:13:33,351 --> 00:13:34,951
(Guys, look here.)

332
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,620
- So beautiful.
- This is so beautiful.

333
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:40,621
Right.

334
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:45,389
You can see the peak of other mountains in every direction.

335
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,390
I know.

336
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,259
It's like a painting over there.

337
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,230
- It's so cool.
- Goodness.

338
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,529
- If you look over there...
- Seriously.

339
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,770
(The ridges and small islands look like a painting.)

340
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,100
I really love it.

341
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:00,509
(It feels like their worries would go away.)

342
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,810
- It's nice to be here, right?
- Yes.

343
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:03,909
This is really... Thank you.

344
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,080
- Don't mention it.
- Thank you for the invitation.

345
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:06,379
- It's...
- I really love it.

346
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,679
This is fantastic, right?

347
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,710
This place has an open view.

348
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:11,851
- Isn't it amazing?
- It really is.

349
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:15,351
(This place is really nice, but...)

350
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,519
(Isn't it too steep to set up our house?)

351
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,060
This is amazing.

352
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,061
- Since we're at an amazing place...
- Dong Il.

353
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,100
We're not setting up our house here, right?

354
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:25,230
- Here?
- Yes.

355
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,070
- It was on our way up here.
- I see. On our way up here.

356
00:14:28,071 --> 00:14:29,971
We should have left it there then.

357
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,770
- That would've been better.
- Hee Won.

358
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:36,539
- But we brought it up here.
- My goodness.

359
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,841
It was hard to bring it up here.

360
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,310
- When there was a flood, - Okay.

361
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:43,279
- a ship went over this mountain.
- I see.

362
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,850
So its name means a ship goes over the mountain.

363
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,580
That's why it's called Mount Joowol.

364
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:47,851
(It is said that a ship went over the mountain during a big flood.)

365
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,549
(Exclaiming)

366
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,821
This place is even higher.

367
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,361
This is so nice. The view is amazing.

368
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:59,830
I wish I could fly.

369
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:00,831
I know.

370
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:04,100
How nice would it be to fly over there?

371
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:05,570
- I know. It'd be fun.
- Right.

372
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,811
(The view makes them want to fly away.)

373
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,371
I guess you have some regrets about that paragliding.

374
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:11,710
- Well...
- You cried that time, right?

375
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:12,810
I was...

376
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:13,850
(He's a crybaby.)

377
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:16,179
- So you've seen it.
- He cried like a baby.

378
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,451
(You happened to see that?)

379
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,691
(Let's see the clip since it's been a while.)

380
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:26,461
(It really feels like I'm flying.)

381
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:31,800
(He was so impressed and became speechless.)

382
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,741
(Hee Won burst into tears.)

383
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,370
(He's lost in thought.)

384
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:43,269
It was really touching.

385
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,310
- I bet so.
- I bet so too.

386
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,481
That's why I said I won't do it again.

387
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:48,950
One time is enough.

388
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:50,249
(It's really impressive, but one time is enough.)

389
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,650
It was so touching. I mean it.

390
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,490
- Shall we go now? Let's go.
- Yes.

391
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:57,789
How about we eat our packed lunch here?

392
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,360
- We have packed lunch?
- You should've told us earlier.

393
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:01,461
I know, right?

394
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,630
Let's see.

395
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,361
Did you pack something to eat?

396
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,499
- Yes. This is...
- What is that?

397
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,700
- This one? He said it's gimbap.
- Gimbap?

398
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:12,040
- It looks delicious.
- Right.

399
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,509
Should I take this out too?

400
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,639
- What do you mean?
- I brought some kimchi.

401
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,811
- Kimchi?
- Yes. Here.

402
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:20,810
Gosh, we should try this.

403
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:22,549
We should use a plate for this.

404
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,719
- We don't have plates, do we?
- Hold on.

405
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,450
We have plates.

406
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,390
Look.

407
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:33,021
- We got it.
- Goodness. Look at this house.

408
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:35,590
I think it's over there.

409
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:37,700
(She looks around the house.)

410
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,930
(This is what it looks like inside the house.)

411
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,199
It must be warm in here.

412
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,940
(She's amazed.)

413
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:47,540
We also have a boiler.

414
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,071
- I know. It's warm.
- Right. We have a boiler here.

415
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,910
So cute.

416
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,351
(This is a house? It's cute.)

417
00:16:54,551 --> 00:16:55,909
(Acting cute)

418
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,021
You're cuter.

419
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,149
(Chuckling)

420
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,219
- Hee Won.
- Dong Il.

421
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,020
Woo Hee brought radish kimchi.

422
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,121
Let's try it.

423
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,189
I hope it's delicious, but I'm not sure.

424
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,031
- I'm not sure.
- It must be good.

425
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,601
You can take care of it, right?

426
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,900
(I got this!)

427
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,469
Let's go. It's so cute.

428
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,841
(They also bring Seung Ryong's table and head to the hill.)

429
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,810
Dong Il, it feels like we're on a picnic.

430
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,810
We need something like this, right?

431
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:27,850
What?

432
00:17:27,851 --> 00:17:29,879
We should bring something like this.

433
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,179
(Of course. It's perfect for a picnic.)

434
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,320
We can put this on the mat...

435
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:34,750
- so that it won't be blown off.
- Right.

436
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:37,290
Gosh, put it here. Why would you put it there?

437
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,361
- You should put it in the center.
- Really?

438
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,031
- Like this?
- Yes.

439
00:17:43,091 --> 00:17:45,101
What kind of gimbap is this? It's unique.

440
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:46,899
This is sea trumpet gimbap.

441
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,199
(Green sea trumpet gimbap)

442
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,831
This gimbap looks so good.

443
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:54,811
This is from Woo Hee's mother. Let's try it.

444
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:56,169
I'm hungry.

445
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,679
(He cuts radish green kimchi into small pieces.)

446
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,740
That's it.

447
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,550
(Gulping)

448
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:02,811
My mouth is watering as I cut this.

449
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:07,350
I told my mom I was going to be on House on Wheels.

450
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:09,320
- My mom...
- Your mother?

451
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,520
- grew them.
- Is that so?

452
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:11,620
Yes.

453
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:13,889
She grew them and made this kimchi.

454
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,030
She told me to bring it.

455
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:17,861
It looks good. I can tell.

456
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:20,629
Let's decorate it like this.

457
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,430
(They can't wait to try sea trumpet gimbap and radish green kimchi.)

458
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,871
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

459
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,740
It looks so good.

460
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,980
(Her mouth is filled with the scent of the sea.)

461
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,550
(Dong Il devours it.)

462
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:38,621
It's good.

463
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:44,521
(Hee Won has a big mouthful of it.)

464
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:48,831
(He wiggles his toes in satisfaction.)

465
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:52,801
(He takes a bite of radish green kimchi.)

466
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:55,500
This kimchi is refreshing and delicious.

467
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,000
- Is it good?
- Yes.

468
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:58,470
This kimchi is...

469
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,771
- I'm glad to hear it.
- This one is so long.

470
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,640
She picked small radishes...

471
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,610
- to make kimchi.
- It's good.

472
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:08,910
This is perfect. I love it.

473
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,979
(Crunching)

474
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,150
This kimchi is the best.

475
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:16,590
It's a good thing I brought this instead of napa cabbage kimchi.

476
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:17,620
Sure thing.

477
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:18,621
(His mouth is full.)

478
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,729
Eat a lot.

479
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,189
(Eat a lot and grow up fast.)

480
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,360
It gives you a refreshing feeling.

481
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:27,801
Gosh, we're having...

482
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,429
sea trumpet gimbap...

483
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,939
on the top of the mountain. This is nice.

484
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,770
- We need to set up the house now.
- Yes.

485
00:19:33,771 --> 00:19:36,111
- Let's go and set up the house.
- We're going to set up the house.

486
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:43,311
(They head to the front yard after having a hearty lunch.)

487
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,179
(Staring)

488
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,251
Those flowers are so pretty, aren't they?

489
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,051
- They really are.
- They are small and cute.

490
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,360
- They are wildflowers, right?
- Yes, they are so pretty.

491
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:53,989
Right? They're not colorful, but they're lovely.

492
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,331
(Wildflowers on the roadside make their hearts flutter.)

493
00:20:01,331 --> 00:20:02,699
(You're pretty like flowers.)

494
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,840
(It makes her cringe.)

495
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:06,541
What's with you?

496
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:12,011
(He jokes around since he's in a good mood.)

497
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:14,781
So today...

498
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:17,980
We're going to set up the house...

499
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,621
and fix a meal. Is that all?

500
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:24,919
That's a lot of work.

501
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,021
Really?

502
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:30,560
(Our youngest must have had a hard time.)

503
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:32,429
Sounds good to me. I don't care whether there's a lot to do or not.

504
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,200
I'm fine either way.

505
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:38,771
- Don't we have another guest today?
- Yes.

506
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,571
He's very shy,

507
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,640
so I thought he wouldn't come.

508
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,580
- But he said...
- You know,

509
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,810
- it would be fun.
- House on Wheels is...

510
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:51,950
(Someone is coming?)

511
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:53,719
(You're here!)

512
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,190
(Coming soon)

513
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:57,959
(Woo Hee has invited her friend.)

514
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,061
(Hello.)

515
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:03,090
(Woo Hee is delighted to see him.)

516
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:04,531
(Wasn't it hard to come all the way here?)

517
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,530
(I took a plane.)

518
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,899
(He seems mild.)

519
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,200
(His voice and way of speaking are unusual.)

520
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,871
(Who's the guest that Woo Hee invited?)

521
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:19,281
(Come quickly!)

522
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:24,051
(While the four of them chat, )

523
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,149
We should go this way.

524
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,920
(the House on Wheels arrives at the front yard.)

525
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:30,919
Gosh, this place is...

526
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,889
(Where?)

527
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,331
- What is this?
- There's the lawn.

528
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:36,660
This place is...

529
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:41,699
This place is beautiful.

530
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,601
This place is well-kept.

531
00:21:44,301 --> 00:21:46,270
It's very tranquil.

532
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,341
(It's a tranquil and secluded place.)

533
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:54,011
(Today's front yard is surrounded by the forest.)

534
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,180
(You can see the woods everywhere from the house.)

535
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,061
(In the front yard that is surrounded by the mountain ranges, )

536
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,261
(there are so many things to do.)

537
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,130
(If you walk a little behind the house, )

538
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:16,470
(there's a cypress forest...)

539
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:21,670
(where you can take a walk in the morning sunlight.)

540
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:25,680
(If you walk a little from the house, )

541
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:32,121
(you can enjoy autumn flowers.)

542
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,460
(If you go a little further, )

543
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:43,460
(you can pick mushrooms in the forest.)

544
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:45,199
(Everything comes true. We live in the garden of Mount Joowol.)

545
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,660
Everything comes true.

546
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:49,729
- We're ready, right?
- Here...

547
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,101
- Okay.
- Let's hang the door first.

548
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,669
(They set up the house as soon as they arrive.)

549
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,810
- Should I unload now?
- Yes.

550
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:58,310
(They set up the house as soon as they arrive.)

551
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:00,111
Is there anything I can do?

552
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:02,810
Let me help you guys.

553
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:04,520
- No, you don't need to work yet.
- There's nothing yet.

554
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:05,919
There's nothing yet?

555
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,250
We need to consider the slope.

556
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:09,219
I see. We need to consider it too.

557
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,189
It's tilted to this side.

558
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,820
- It's tilted, right?
- It's a bit lower here.

559
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:13,889
Okay.

560
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,030
- Pull it like this.
- Yes.

561
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:17,031
Like this?

562
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:19,230
Like this. Pull it a little.

563
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:24,841
(When Myoung moves, )

564
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:29,940
(Woo Hee follows him to look for something to do.)

565
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:32,111
Is there anything I can help with?

566
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,949
This is too stiff.

567
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,011
(He's busy.)

568
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,980
Is there anything I can help with?

569
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,021
- You're bored, right?
- I just want to do something.

570
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:43,220
I want to do something.

571
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,890
- Teach me how I can do that.
- Okay.

572
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,530
- Let's set up the tarp now.
- Okay.

573
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:52,460
(Tarp?)

574
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:55,630
Teach me how to do that.

575
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,270
All right.

576
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,570
(If Woo Hee really wants to help...)

577
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,110
(Hammering lightly)

578
00:24:01,111 --> 00:24:02,740
Here. Come and hammer it, Woo Hee.

579
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:04,939
(I've got something to do.)

580
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,510
- Here.
- Should I hammer it?

581
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,250
Leave about 5cm when you hammer it.

582
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:12,351
(Dong Il lets her help setting up the tarp.)

583
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,821
(She sits without hesitation and starts hammering.)

584
00:24:18,121 --> 00:24:21,561
(Hammering)

585
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:24,330
Where did you learn to hammer like that?

586
00:24:24,331 --> 00:24:26,361
Where did you learn to do that?

587
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:28,230
I've done this a lot.

588
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:31,601
We've never had a guest who hammers so well like you.

589
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,611
(She's the master of hammering.)

590
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:39,480
(Woo Hee is doing a good job.)

591
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:43,149
- That's enough.
- My goodness.

592
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,680
- Okay.
- Woo Hee is good at this.

593
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,751
(They've driven in the pegs in no time.)

594
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,690
Gosh, Hee Won has a lot to learn from her.

595
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,560
(Why me?)

596
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,600
Hey, it's not at a 45° degree. Do it again.

597
00:24:57,601 --> 00:24:58,659
- Should I do it again?
- No!

598
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,660
(Chuckling)

599
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:00,801
Don't talk with him.

600
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:02,400
Next...

601
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,439
(Thanks to Woo Hee, they set up the tarp easily.)

602
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,100
- It's safe, right?
- Yes.

603
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:07,341
(Thanks to Woo Hee, they set up the tarp easily.)

604
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:12,840
(The youngest prepares snacks.)

605
00:25:12,841 --> 00:25:13,879
What are you doing?

606
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
(She suddenly appears.)

607
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:15,980
You want some coffee?

608
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,551
I don't drink coffee. Do you have anything else?

609
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:20,680
What do you want?

610
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:22,390
- Tea?
- Me? Tea.

611
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:23,919
Thank you.

612
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,861
(I'd like some tea.)

613
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:30,130
(He brews tea for Woo Hee.)

614
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,770
Let me help you.

615
00:25:34,771 --> 00:25:37,130
- They're all having iced Americano?
- Yes.

616
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,470
Then I'll have...

617
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,710
- Gosh, yakgwa?
- We have yakgwa.

618
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,040
(Youngest prepared yakgwa as a snack.)

619
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,979
- I'll put them on this plate.
- There are so many cute items.

620
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,011
(They told me plating is important.)

621
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:54,390
(You can do plating too?)

622
00:25:55,021 --> 00:26:00,291
(Youngest's plating)

623
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:02,129
You call this...

624
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,791
- plating?
- I'm not done yet.

625
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:06,600
(Harmonious)

626
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:07,670
What's this?

627
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,830
- It's supposed to look like this.
- What's this?

628
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:11,871
(Giggling)

629
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:13,570
I washed my hands.

630
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,341
(In haste)

631
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,409
- It's okay as long as it's good.
- Sure thing.

632
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:23,180
I have rice cake too. Make room for it.

633
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,879
What's that? That's something new.

634
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,949
- I bought some rice cake.
- Who did?

635
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,091
- I did.
- Really?

636
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:31,190
Gosh, you're a big spender now.

637
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,760
You bought gimbap and everything. You're a big spender.

638
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:36,831
(Youngest bought a lot for Woo Hee.)

639
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,229
(Green tea yakgwa and jeungpyeon)

640
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,700
- Isn't this yakgwa?
- Yakgwa.

641
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,501
- Thank you.
- I hope you like it.

642
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,770
Thank you for the food.

643
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:49,541
(Shall we enjoy teatime in the forest?)

644
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:53,880
(Dong Il tries yakgwa first.)

645
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,179
- Is it good?
- Yakgwa is good.

646
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,281
- Is it good?
- It's very soft.

647
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,281
It's not hard. It's not too sweet.

648
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,990
Try it.

649
00:27:02,591 --> 00:27:05,960
- It's soft inside.
- It's delicious.

650
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,729
(Is it that good?)

651
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,791
It's good.

652
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,659
(I'll try yakgwa too.)

653
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,429
(Spearing)

654
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,470
Dong Il, this is...

655
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:17,031
You called this soft?

656
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:19,640
When you try it...

657
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,170
- It becomes softer in your mouth.
- Really?

658
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,879
It gets softer in your mouth.

659
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Try it.

660
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,379
- You're right.
- Right.

661
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,149
- Isn't it good?
- This is amazing.

662
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,680
It's crispy outside and soft inside.

663
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,949
- Is this called baekseolgi?
- I think it's baramtteok.

664
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,120
- Baramtteok?
- Sultteok?

665
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:36,121
- Sultteok?
- Sultteok.

666
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,620
- Right?
- I guess so.

667
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:39,490
- It's sultteok.
- It's been a while since I had one.

668
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:44,030
(He tries sweet and sour jeungpyeon.)

669
00:27:44,031 --> 00:27:45,031
This is...

670
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,370
- Don't we have honey?
- We have buckwheat honey.

671
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:49,800
- Buckwheat honey.
- That sounds delicious.

672
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:50,801
We need honey for this.

673
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,501
(This buckwheat honey is...)

674
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:59,380
(They bought buckwheat honey at the buckwheat field in Cheongju.)

675
00:27:59,841 --> 00:28:01,281
(Bar rice cake)

676
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,480
(Dried radish tea)

677
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,650
(Yugwa)

678
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,150
(Jjondeugi)

679
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:10,751
(Golden apple)

680
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,920
(Twisted donuts)

681
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,361
(You've eaten 70 dollars worth of honey since yesterday.)

682
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,900
(They'd been eating honey all along.)

683
00:28:21,531 --> 00:28:23,770
Whenever we buy something...

684
00:28:23,771 --> 00:28:25,870
on our trips,

685
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,500
- You keep them?
- we keep them all.

686
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:28,511
That's so nice.

687
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,080
Even the things guests brought for us.

688
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:33,341
We keep everything.

689
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,580
We never throw away anything.

690
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,180
That cutting board too. We've been using it all along.

691
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:47,291
- I made something for you guys.
- That's great.

692
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,091
I made something,

693
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:52,699
but it's somewhat clumsy.

694
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,129
What we care about is its value.

695
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,169
- It seems valueless.
- The value of your effort.

696
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,271
- The value of my effort?
- Exactly.

697
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:02,170
I thought it would be meaningful for me to make something.

698
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,110
- There it is.
- But...

699
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:06,110
(Youngest brings the gift.)

700
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,341
The thing is...

701
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,480
- It's getting colder.
- Right.

702
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:11,621
(Sighing)

703
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,820
So I thought I should make...

704
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:17,889
- I thought it'd be meaningful.
- You're being so careful about it.

705
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,360
Because it's so sloppy.

706
00:29:19,361 --> 00:29:21,830
- That's why.
- She's so careful about it.

707
00:29:21,831 --> 00:29:23,230
- So this is...
- Goodness.

708
00:29:23,591 --> 00:29:25,360
I sewed it myself.

709
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:26,460
- Really?
- Really?

710
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,600
This is an eye warmer.

711
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,570
(She made eye warmers herself.)

712
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:32,239
I made these.

713
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,771
I even chose colors for each of you.

714
00:29:36,311 --> 00:29:38,010
- You can take one each.
- You sewed it?

715
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:40,680
- Yes. It's not that good, but...
- It's okay.

716
00:29:41,851 --> 00:29:44,780
You sewed it? My goodness.

717
00:29:44,781 --> 00:29:46,020
You put your effort into every stitch.

718
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:48,920
I did every stitch, so it's a bit lame.

719
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,760
This is so special.

720
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:53,190
- It's handmade, you know.
- Right.

721
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:54,630
This is the best.

722
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:56,360
So you put it on your eyes?

723
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,660
There are red beans in it.

724
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,800
- Microwave it for a minute, - Microwave it?

725
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:02,801
- then it gets warm.
- It gets hot?

726
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:04,771
- Yes. You can put it on your eyes.
- So I put it on my eyes?

727
00:30:05,341 --> 00:30:08,070
It'll be warm for quite a long time.

728
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:10,841
It's not lame at all. It's the best.

729
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,180
This is the best gift.

730
00:30:12,181 --> 00:30:14,551
- I'm glad to hear that.
- That's right.

731
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,449
I put this on my eyes, and I couldn't see anything.

732
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,420
(I put this on my eyes, and I couldn't see anything.)

733
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,490
I couldn't see anything.

734
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:26,220
- It'll help you sleep well, right?
- My eyes... Right.

735
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,130
- I like this texture.
- Thank you.

736
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,260
(They are enjoying it already.)

737
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:33,801
That's right. It covers my eyes well.

738
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,501
Look.

739
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,300
My eyes are not swollen anymore.

740
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:38,800
- Goodness.
- They're not swollen anymore.

741
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:40,970
- Right.
- Right? They got better.

742
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:43,510
(Look at me too.)

743
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:45,380
- I know, right?
- You look so slim.

744
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,280
I feel much better now.

745
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:49,350
(They are impressed by its immediate effect.)

746
00:30:49,351 --> 00:30:51,250
- You look haggard.
- This is no joke.

747
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:53,380
Let's use them in the morning, okay?

748
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,620
- Let's use them.
- Tomorrow morning.

749
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:58,720
Prepare the tapeline. Let's measure the changes.

750
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,390
Great. Let's check it tomorrow morning.

751
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:05,861
Thank you so much. You even did every stitch of it.

752
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:08,229
- This is so nice.
- That's good to hear.

753
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,301
Great.

754
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,669
I love the wind here.

755
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,899
- I know.
- Right?

756
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,909
- The wind is so gentle.
- I know.

757
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,910
And it's warm.

758
00:31:16,911 --> 00:31:18,940
(The wind is so gentle and warm.)

759
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,281
Gosh. The weather today is really good.

760
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:27,480
(They have precious time in the garden in the forest.)

761
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,520
Let's put rice in the rice cooker and go for a walk.

762
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,860
- That sounds good.
- Shall we?

763
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:32,890
Then...

764
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,460
- Green tea is famous in Boseong.
- Right.

765
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,101
So I'm going to make green tea rice.

766
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:40,030
- It sounds good.
- Do you like dried yellow corvina?

767
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,571
- I love it.
- I prepared it.

768
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,470
(Impressed)

769
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:47,070
We should eat it with green tea rice.

770
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,710
Right. With cold green tea.

771
00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:53,680
(Corvina is dried in the sea breeze...)

772
00:31:54,611 --> 00:31:59,121
(and fermented with barley in a pot for at least one year...)

773
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,561
(to become the precious dish, dried yellow corvina.)

774
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:09,291
(For today's dinner, they will eat the chewy corvina...)

775
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:14,470
(that is paired with rice in green tea.)

776
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:18,239
So I've been debating...

777
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,270
whether I should cook pork that's been green tea fed.

778
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,541
(Green tea-fed pork)

779
00:32:23,011 --> 00:32:24,940
We can cook it anyway we want.

780
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,011
We could grill it.

781
00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:29,210
We could boil it.

782
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:32,251
We could make kimchi jjigae with aged kimchi.

783
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:33,581
(Just hearing it got them excited.)

784
00:32:33,582 --> 00:32:35,290
- Do you like it?
- I love aged kimchi.

785
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,149
Wait a minute.

786
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,620
Are we eating both green tea-fed pork...

787
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:40,060
dried yellow corvina for dinner?

788
00:32:40,061 --> 00:32:42,630
Woo Hee and I were in a movie together.

789
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,300
I played the role of a bad father.

790
00:32:45,301 --> 00:32:47,560
I wanted to apologize how I was at that time...

791
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:50,031
by offering her a very nice meal.

792
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,670
Let's prepare everything.

793
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,140
I'm willing to do it all for Woo Hee.

794
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:57,371
- I get to receive the love at once.
- That's right.

795
00:32:58,111 --> 00:33:00,439
Let me get started with the preparation.

796
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,511
Let's see.

797
00:33:02,551 --> 00:33:03,710
Should I wash the rice?

798
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:05,149
The rice?

799
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,919
- No, for rice...
- I can do simple things.

800
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,989
- Take out the rice cooker.
- I can do them easily.

801
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,190
We must soak the corvina in the rice water.

802
00:33:14,021 --> 00:33:15,190
Why did you take them?

803
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,331
I'm going to wash the rice.

804
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,959
Washing rice is the easiest form of cooking.

805
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,699
(Hee Won volunteers to be a cooking assistant today.)

806
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,301
I can do that much, at least.

807
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,770
Can you tell me why you are using rice water?

808
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:33,139
Rice water will eliminate...

809
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,881
any bad smell of the fish.

810
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,319
- Keep the rice water.
- I will.

811
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,421
Rub it hard and pour it here.

812
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:44,020
Wash it more from there.

813
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,319
(He washed the rice very nicely.)

814
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,659
(Dropping the rice)

815
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,961
You should throw out the rice!

816
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,731
- I didn't drop that many.
- Yes, you did.

817
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:53,961
I didn't.

818
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:55,029
(Talking back)

819
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,030
Look at that.

820
00:33:58,271 --> 00:33:59,370
That's a lot.

821
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,441
(They bicker a lot.)

822
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:04,109
I didn't throw out that much.

823
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,941
(While the older guys bicker...)

824
00:34:09,311 --> 00:34:11,650
(Let me check my face.)

825
00:34:11,651 --> 00:34:12,779
My hair is so messy.

826
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,381
(Let me check my face.)

827
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,520
You look pretty.

828
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,489
(You look pretty even if you don't check your face.)

829
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,390
(Glaring)

830
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,230
(Filming Woo Hee)

831
00:34:22,231 --> 00:34:24,191
Does it follow me where I go?

832
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,659
How does it know that I'm here when it turns?

833
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,731
Oh, my.

834
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,870
(Staring)

835
00:34:30,871 --> 00:34:32,299
Oh, my. You are pretty.

836
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,470
(He's a fool for Woo Hee.)

837
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:36,909
How does it know that I'm here when it turns?

838
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,279
Does it adjust when I pass by like this?

839
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,310
(Woo Hee is very amused by the new item in the house.)

840
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:42,380
It won't follow me.

841
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:46,351
(Moving this way and that way)

842
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:48,851
(Catch me if you can.)

843
00:34:49,191 --> 00:34:53,160
(Running away quickly)

844
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,390
(Turning)

845
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:57,561
It followed me. It's so cool.

846
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,470
(Collecting rice water)

847
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,800
Hee Won usually doesn't wash rice.

848
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,610
He must be doing it for Woo Hee.

849
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,811
He's right. Woo Hee.

850
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,679
- I wanted to do something for you.
- Really?

851
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,780
He never does this.

852
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,980
I'm touched, Hee Won.

853
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:20,421
(To the rice water Hee Won prepared, )

854
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,520
(Dong Il adds the precious sejak green tea.)

855
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:27,191
- I can smell the green tea already.
- This is how you do it.

856
00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:29,290
(The green tea rice will be ready soon after a press of a button.)

857
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:31,089
Let's leave it like this for now, and come back to it later.

858
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,100
(The green tea rice will be ready soon after a press of a button.)

859
00:35:32,101 --> 00:35:33,360
Let's soak it a bit.

860
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:37,231
- Here comes dried yellow corvina.
- Yes.

861
00:35:37,331 --> 00:35:39,239
(Here comes today's main ingredient.)

862
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,941
- It's heavy.
- Give it to me.

863
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,609
Cockles?

864
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,541
(Cockles?)

865
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:48,780
It's cockles!

866
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,650
Boseong is famous for its cockles, right?

867
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:53,881
Yes, it is. I ordered those cockles.

868
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,549
(Boseong's specialty)

869
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,831
(It's caught from the mudflat.)

870
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,160
(It's cockles from Beolgyo.)

871
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:09,299
(Jaw-dropping)

872
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,331
Awesome.

873
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:12,469
This looks so good.

874
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,970
This looks really good. I love cockles.

875
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:17,940
(Pleased)

876
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:19,311
I got them all.

877
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:21,909
(What is in the second box that they opened in excitement?)

878
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:24,280
- Oh, my goodness, Dong Il.
- What is it?

879
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:26,980
- I prepared it for you.
- This is the best.

880
00:36:26,981 --> 00:36:27,981
Look at the dried yellow corvina.

881
00:36:27,982 --> 00:36:30,150
- Look at it.
- This is incredible, Dong Il.

882
00:36:30,151 --> 00:36:32,860
Dried yellow corvina is fermented...

883
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,191
in barley.

884
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,231
(Hopping over to see the dried yellow corvina)

885
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,130
It's fermented in barley.

886
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:39,030
This is legitimate.

887
00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:41,830
I didn't know they have barley.

888
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:44,200
- That's where the name comes from.
- It's almost fermented in barley.

889
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:46,670
It's like barley fed corvina.

890
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:47,770
It's dried.

891
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:50,410
(They're fascinated to see this for the first time!)

892
00:36:50,871 --> 00:36:53,941
Oh, my goodness. I love this.

893
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,650
We wanted it to be extra special for Woo Hee.

894
00:36:57,651 --> 00:37:01,050
I'm being treated really well here. Thank you so much, Dong Il.

895
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:06,521
(He starts trimming the precious corvina.)

896
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,590
Do you eat that?

897
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,659
Shouldn't you hang it up on a ceiling...

898
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,700
and look at it instead of eating it?

899
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Isn't that what it's for?

900
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:16,871
That's for stingy people.

901
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:18,541
You know what I mean?

902
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,171
With the string attached to it, I think that's what it's for.

903
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,980
So do you want to hang it up here?

904
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:26,679
You hang it up, look at it, and eat rice.

905
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,811
- Eat only rice?
- Yes.

906
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,250
(Dong Il is doing great on trimming the corvina.)

907
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:34,049
I really love this.

908
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,950
I love how I get to eat such nice food.

909
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,360
What time is it now? It's 2pm? Okay, then.

910
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,360
Hee Won, do we have a gas stove outside?

911
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:43,359
- The one with high heat.
- Are we already getting ready?

912
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,060
I want to boil pumpkin on that.

913
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:48,600
I thought we were going on a walk. Why did we start making dinner?

914
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,870
- Let's just have dinner.
- It's because...

915
00:37:50,871 --> 00:37:52,699
All you have to do for cockles is to boil them.

916
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,070
(We should hurry and feed Woo Hee some yummy food.)

917
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,510
(Thinking)

918
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,211
I doubt we'll go on a walk today.

919
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,381
(Laughing)

920
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,949
- I will cut this.
- Which one?

921
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,850
You have to trim this anyway, right?

922
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:10,549
I have to trim that. You know what to do, right?

923
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,589
Take out the fin and everything.

924
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,819
I'll remove the fin and everything.

925
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,860
- Okay.
- I'll do this.

926
00:38:15,131 --> 00:38:16,230
I'll cut it like so.

927
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:18,960
(As soon as she grabs the scissors, she cuts it.)

928
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:21,360
- I'll cut off the fins.
- Okay.

929
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:22,731
The sides too.

930
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:26,700
(Cutting boldly with scissors)

931
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,640
I'll cut all of this off.

932
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:34,380
(Fixing his eyes on it)

933
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:36,509
You are so skilled.

934
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,811
- Am I?
- Yes.

935
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:44,449
(Thanks to Woo Hee, the corvina is all nicely trimmed.)

936
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,860
- All done, right?
- Yes.

937
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:48,691
Let's just soak these in here.

938
00:38:49,131 --> 00:38:50,159
Sounds good.

939
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,601
(Soaking them in rice water to get rid of any bed smell)

940
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:58,469
(Pouring out...)

941
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,339
(the fresh cockles)

942
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,409
I really hate having cockles...

943
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,171
that haven't been purged.

944
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:05,480
- Really?
- You can taste the mud.

945
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:06,779
(Removing sediments)

946
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,811
You need to purge these.

947
00:39:08,251 --> 00:39:10,909
- Dong Il, I'm done with everything.
- Come again?

948
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,220
I'm all done.

949
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:15,420
You should also...

950
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:18,021
set up a campfire.

951
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:20,659
Don't delay it. It's better to do something than nothing.

952
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,760
- Okay.
- "It's better to do something."

953
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,029
(After the two of them go around the house)

954
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,060
(Ta-da)

955
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:27,100
We won't be going for a walk at this rate.

956
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:28,570
(After the two of them go around the house, )

957
00:39:29,371 --> 00:39:30,900
Did he want us to bring firewood?

958
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,570
(things get set up one by one in the front yard.)

959
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,300
Good.

960
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:36,410
(Creating a nice atmosphere by stacking up firewood)

961
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,109
All the tools for the campfire are ready.

962
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,880
(All the tools for making campfire are ready!)

963
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:40,940
Dong Il, look out the window.

964
00:39:40,941 --> 00:39:43,081
(Grill, fire extinguisher, burner, firewood, chair for spacing out)

965
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,151
I am done setting up everything.

966
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,949
(Impressed)

967
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,020
(Proud)

968
00:39:49,021 --> 00:39:50,191
That's so cute.

969
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,490
We are ready to do everything we want now.

970
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,331
We have them all ready for us.

971
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,760
(Washing hands in satisfaction after work)

972
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,630
(Using plenty of water)

973
00:40:03,631 --> 00:40:05,470
Don't waste water.

974
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,770
Should I add the water?

975
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:09,340
(Hee Won, in charge of the front yard)

976
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,670
I will add some water.

977
00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:13,140
(Myoung, another person in charge of the front yard)

978
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,081
Where is green tea, Myoung?

979
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:16,650
It was right here.

980
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:19,280
(Laughing)

981
00:40:19,581 --> 00:40:20,581
It's right here.

982
00:40:20,582 --> 00:40:22,589
(Here is the green tea!)

983
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,360
- May I say something?
- What is it?

984
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,561
I think they said something mean about you just now.

985
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,690
Like what?

986
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:33,259
We were talking about this...

987
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,730
and how we clipped it with this.

988
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:36,401
(They were on a different topic.)

989
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:38,840
- Hee Won, why would you...
- Don't try to make us...

990
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:39,940
hate each other.

991
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:41,970
- I know, right?
- That's so immature.

992
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,909
I'm doing fine...

993
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,409
- with Dong Il.
- Right.

994
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,650
Who has Woo Hee been talking to the most...

995
00:40:48,651 --> 00:40:50,480
since she got here?

996
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,120
- You.
- So you know.

997
00:40:52,121 --> 00:40:53,949
We've been only working so hard like slaves.

998
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:57,151
(We've been only working so hard like slaves!)

999
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,561
I'll add the water!

1000
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,220
- Hurry, you punk! Put it in now!
- Okay!

1001
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,061
Those pretentious punks. They are unbelievable.

1002
00:41:06,061 --> 00:41:07,961
- It's funny, Dong Il.
- Is it?

1003
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,400
The three of you have perfect chemistry.

1004
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:13,601
We are like three dumb and dumber guys.

1005
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,239
I put some water in earlier, and it still needs so much.

1006
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,340
It needs the whole tank.

1007
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,340
We're done, right? This and that.

1008
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,050
Cockles. Rice.

1009
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,549
- I think we're done.
- We're done.

1010
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,151
We are done getting ready.

1011
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,449
How long will a walk take?

1012
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,050
(Shall we get going?)

1013
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,291
The weather is great today.

1014
00:41:35,831 --> 00:41:37,760
- So let's go pick mushrooms.
- Sounds good.

1015
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,461
- Mushrooms?
- Yes. Mushrooms.

1016
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,870
- How does that sound?
- Sounds good.

1017
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:43,270
(Picking mushrooms in the mountain in front of the house?)

1018
00:41:43,271 --> 00:41:45,271
- Sounds good.
- Right? Great.

1019
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:47,969
It will be awesome because the weather is perfect today.

1020
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,871
- Let's go pick mushrooms.
- I'm so excited.

1021
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,239
(After spring and summer, the mountain in the autumn...)

1022
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,609
(is full of things to see and eat.)

1023
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:57,151
As I said earlier, with the mushrooms we pick,

1024
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,421
we could cook ramyeon or something for a late-night snack.

1025
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,950
(I'd love that.)

1026
00:42:01,951 --> 00:42:03,320
We can make anything with them.

1027
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,390
So will I be working as a mushroom picker there?

1028
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,490
(Quickly eating the snack)

1029
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,159
While you two are talking?

1030
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,961
(You two will just chat like earlier, right?)

1031
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,700
(I think I should eat more before leaving.)

1032
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,200
- Help yourself, okay?
- So after this snack...

1033
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:22,109
- "Help yourself"?
- Yes, help yourself.

1034
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:25,179
But I'm telling you, there will be a fun part too.

1035
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,179
(What would be the fun part of mushroom picking?)

1036
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,910
We will go and ride a monorail.

1037
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,180
- That sounds fun.
- Yes.

1038
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,420
- That would be exciting.
- For sure.

1039
00:42:35,421 --> 00:42:38,589
- It's so fun to ride a monorail.
- That sounds fun.

1040
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,219
- I'd love that.
- Okay. Let's go pick mushrooms!

1041
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,060
(To look for mushrooms hiding in the deep mountain, )

1042
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,290
(they are going in deeper and deeper on a monorail.)

1043
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:45,401
Gosh, look how steep it is.

1044
00:42:45,961 --> 00:42:47,961
(Passing the steep slope)

1045
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,730
- This is awesome.
- It's so much fun.

1046
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:52,969
(They are on a special journey to look for mushrooms by monorail.)

1047
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,470
It's amazing that we are going up the slope.

1048
00:42:55,271 --> 00:42:56,639
It will be great.

1049
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,180
(That sounds so exciting.)

1050
00:42:59,381 --> 00:43:01,780
(Exclaiming)

1051
00:43:01,981 --> 00:43:03,409
(Are you that happy?)

1052
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,851
What happened to you? You've become so weird.

1053
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,890
(Shouting)

1054
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,620
Okay, Myoung. Let's go pick mushrooms.

1055
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:12,659
Okay.

1056
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,660
(I'm excited about the work.)

1057
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:15,889
- Shall we get going then?
- All right.

1058
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,560
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go.

1059
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:20,731
- Put on your sneakers.
- Okay.

1060
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:23,771
- See you.
- Let's go.

1061
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:28,710
- It's just three minutes away.
- It's so close.

1062
00:43:28,711 --> 00:43:29,941
Yes, it's just about three minutes away.

1063
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:31,811
It will be fun.

1064
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,179
I'm so excited.

1065
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,381
(The monorail for picking mushrooms)

1066
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,179
(Woo Hee, you seem really excited.)

1067
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,981
(She's all smiles.)

1068
00:43:40,381 --> 00:43:43,190
You know what? This monorail is quite fast.

1069
00:43:43,191 --> 00:43:44,750
(Excited)

1070
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:47,020
(It must be fun then.)

1071
00:43:47,021 --> 00:43:48,220
You will be impressed.

1072
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,989
It will make a noise like a sports car.

1073
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,859
(I thought we were going to pick mushrooms. Now I feel nervous.)

1074
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,770
Maybe you'll find it hard to keep your eyes open.

1075
00:43:55,771 --> 00:43:57,929
- Seriously? It's that fast?
- Yes, I'm telling you.

1076
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,000
That's crazy.

1077
00:43:59,001 --> 00:44:01,569
You will feel like you are on a roller coaster.

1078
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,810
- Really?
- I love it.

1079
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:05,581
- Yes.
- I'm so thrilled.

1080
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:07,680
Don't be too scared, Okay?

1081
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,750
- Of the monorail?
- Yes.

1082
00:44:09,751 --> 00:44:11,380
(Monorail...)

1083
00:44:11,381 --> 00:44:12,449
- It's really fast.
- Momo is...

1084
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,080
(Momo is a baby)

1085
00:44:14,081 --> 00:44:15,720
(Laughing)

1086
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,120
(They are trying to calm down by singing "Momo".)

1087
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:20,621
(His voice is like a helium voice.)

1088
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:23,460
(Hands of a clock)

1089
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:25,460
- What was that?
- That was a bad harmony.

1090
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:26,600
(House on Wheels is always full of laughter.)

1091
00:44:26,601 --> 00:44:28,299
- I love it here.
- What is this place?

1092
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,730
It will be so much fun.

1093
00:44:29,731 --> 00:44:31,199
(They are arriving at the monorail spot.)

1094
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,240
Awesome.

1095
00:44:32,601 --> 00:44:34,069
Okay. We're here.

1096
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,941
(They are going to walk up to take the monorail.)

1097
00:44:36,311 --> 00:44:39,210
(Singing in excitement)

1098
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:41,240
- Look at you. You're so excited.
- Yes, I am.

1099
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,580
- You're so excited.
- I'm really excited.

1100
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:45,620
(Taking a sack for the mushrooms)

1101
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:46,651
Let's go.

1102
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,921
This is very nice.

1103
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:51,490
- It's relaxing, right?
- Yes, totally.

1104
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,120
I really like it here. It's like a movie.

1105
00:44:55,121 --> 00:44:56,331
- Dong Il.
- Yes?

1106
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,290
Why didn't they install the rail from this point?

1107
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:00,131
Why do we have to walk up this far?

1108
00:45:01,561 --> 00:45:02,730
They could have installed it from here.

1109
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:05,700
Come on. You should at least walk a bit.

1110
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,400
Hee Won. You really don't like to move an inch, right?

1111
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:09,871
- No. He's like that on set too.
- I can see that.

1112
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:13,009
He doesn't like cold weather, and he doesn't like hot weather.

1113
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,139
He doesn't like anything.

1114
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,881
(Panting)

1115
00:45:16,311 --> 00:45:17,409
Woo Hee, look here.

1116
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,509
(Taking a picture)

1117
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:21,251
(Posing right away)

1118
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:23,889
Gosh, I really didn't expect this.

1119
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,790
Woo Hee played a lot of dark roles,

1120
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:27,920
so I thought maybe she is a bit depressed too.

1121
00:45:27,921 --> 00:45:30,159
- But she is such a cheerful person.
- Yes, she really is.

1122
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,389
If I live like the character I played in the movie,

1123
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:33,960
- I would be too depressed.
- I totally agree.

1124
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:35,200
(Woo Hee is actually a lively person who laughs a lot.)

1125
00:45:35,631 --> 00:45:37,700
Dong Il, what is that?

1126
00:45:37,871 --> 00:45:40,199
These? They are mulberry trees.

1127
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,610
(Look, they are mulberry trees.)

1128
00:45:43,371 --> 00:45:44,440
They are native mulberries.

1129
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,910
I've never seen native mulberries before.

1130
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,711
- Look at this.
- It's my first time seeing it.

1131
00:45:50,211 --> 00:45:51,211
Terrific.

1132
00:45:52,381 --> 00:45:55,021
(Picking a ripe mulberry)

1133
00:45:55,691 --> 00:45:57,250
I think it'll be really bitter.

1134
00:45:57,251 --> 00:45:58,290
(Taking a bite)

1135
00:45:58,291 --> 00:45:59,720
Isn't it bitter?

1136
00:46:01,121 --> 00:46:04,291
(Isn't it bitter? I am curious.)

1137
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:05,659
Isn't it bitter?

1138
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,101
(It looks bitter.)

1139
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,969
(Out of curiosity, she takes a bite too.)

1140
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:10,569
(Alert person 1)

1141
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:11,831
(Surprised)

1142
00:46:12,171 --> 00:46:13,171
(Alert person 2)

1143
00:46:13,172 --> 00:46:14,271
How is it?

1144
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:17,541
How come it's sweet?

1145
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,109
- I thought it would be bitter.
- Try it.

1146
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:22,779
(The native mulberry is unexpectedly sweet.)

1147
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,949
It's like the song, "Let's Go Pick Mulberries".

1148
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,620
Try it.

1149
00:46:25,621 --> 00:46:26,779
Do you want to try just a bit?

1150
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,790
- Actually, this is edible.
- Just a little bit?

1151
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:29,921
(Should I try it?)

1152
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,750
But the seeds are...

1153
00:46:31,751 --> 00:46:33,159
(But the seeds are...)

1154
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,590
- bitter.
- You shouldn't eat the seeds.

1155
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,791
(But the seeds are bitter.)

1156
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,700
(Teasing)

1157
00:46:40,061 --> 00:46:41,130
(A little bitter fun they can have in the autumn)

1158
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,131
- I feel great.
- Me too.

1159
00:46:43,371 --> 00:46:44,371
So great.

1160
00:46:44,372 --> 00:46:45,670
- There's the monorail.
- There it is.

1161
00:46:45,671 --> 00:46:48,870
(Finally, they have arrived.)

1162
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:51,370
- So this is faster than light?
- Yes, that's correct.

1163
00:46:51,371 --> 00:46:52,739
This monorail is so fast that you should keep your eyes closed...

1164
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,640
- because of the wind.
- I see.

1165
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:58,449
Would it be that fast?

1166
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,350
- We're here.
- That's where we're riding it?

1167
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,480
Yes, correct.

1168
00:47:01,481 --> 00:47:04,621
(Entrance to the monorail)

1169
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,359
- Hello.
- Hello.

1170
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,120
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

1171
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:09,489
(The monorail which will take them to the mushroom field)

1172
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:11,489
Which one are we riding?

1173
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,330
- That one.
- This one? I see.

1174
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:14,529
Okay. Hop on, guys.

1175
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,831
- How can I get in?
- This seat?

1176
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:17,501
- No, in the middle...
- Woo Hee, here.

1177
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,440
(That's the driver's seat.)

1178
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:21,540
- That's the driver's seat.
- Oh, no.

1179
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:22,969
- Yes, that's the driver's seat.
- Take this seat.

1180
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,270
Can I sit here?

1181
00:47:24,271 --> 00:47:25,610
- Myoung, you sit here.
- Okay.

1182
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:27,609
- Get in.
- This is exciting.

1183
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,910
Yes, this is it. Great.

1184
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,179
I don't want my hat to be blown off.

1185
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,550
Let me tell you about this monorail.

1186
00:47:35,851 --> 00:47:38,319
This was originally installed to grow forest products.

1187
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,620
And today, you'll be riding it to pick mushrooms.

1188
00:47:40,621 --> 00:47:43,429
- Okay.
- I'll safely take you to the field.

1189
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,791
- Okay.
- Yes, please.

1190
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,699
Here we go.

1191
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,871
(As she hears the engine sound, she holds the bar.)

1192
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,100
(Thrilled)

1193
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:52,840
It will be fun.

1194
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,270
(A little bit nervous)

1195
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:56,470
Here we go.

1196
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,040
(I'm excited.)

1197
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:02,251
(The monorail has departed.)

1198
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:05,421
(He's wearing his sunglasses to protect his eyes from the wind.)

1199
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:08,820
(Are you guys ready?)

1200
00:48:09,421 --> 00:48:14,291
(Finally, it is going out to the world.)

1201
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:16,960
(Woo Hee is the first one to see the outside.)

1202
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:20,401
(Exclaiming)

1203
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:24,470
(I'm so excited. Let's go!)

1204
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,370
(Windproof sunglasses)

1205
00:48:26,371 --> 00:48:27,871
My gosh, this is...

1206
00:48:29,671 --> 00:48:34,109
(The monorail is slowly coming outside.)

1207
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:37,381
(But how come it's so slow?)

1208
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:42,890
(Looking back)

1209
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:46,760
(We left...)

1210
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,490
(a while ago, and how come...)

1211
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:52,600
(Finally, Dong Il has come out to the world.)

1212
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:54,159
My gosh, this is...

1213
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,131
(Crawling)

1214
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,700
Look how fast it is.

1215
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:04,970
(Slow)

1216
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,541
I can't open my eyes!

1217
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:12,250
It's really fast,

1218
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:13,350
- so keep your eyes closed.
- Hello.

1219
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:15,621
(She looks very relaxed.)

1220
00:49:16,151 --> 00:49:17,449
(It's going too fast.)

1221
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,191
(I can't open my eyes.)

1222
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,960
(It is going stable and slow even on an uphill.)

1223
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:24,291
This is too fast.

1224
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,830
(Slow)

1225
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,871
So this is how fast it goes.

1226
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,500
It's going to take ages.

1227
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:35,569
(It's going to take ages.)

1228
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:37,010
It's taking forever?

1229
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,940
Dong Il, I think this is the same speed as walking.

1230
00:49:40,941 --> 00:49:43,310
(Today, they are going to feel nature very slowly.)

1231
00:49:43,311 --> 00:49:44,581
It's taking forever?

1232
00:49:47,381 --> 00:49:50,490
The tree has its name on it.

1233
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:53,990
- This is oriental oak.
- Oriental oak.

1234
00:49:55,061 --> 00:49:56,290
This is fun.

1235
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:58,230
(It's fun to read the names of the trees.)

1236
00:49:58,231 --> 00:50:01,061
- This is a chestnut tree.
- Right. This is a chestnut tree.

1237
00:50:02,401 --> 00:50:03,799
This tree looks peculiar.

1238
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,041
I know, right? I was looking at it too.

1239
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:08,171
Styrax tree.

1240
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,541
The styrax tree looks interesting.

1241
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,541
Look. It's so beautiful here.

1242
00:50:17,211 --> 00:50:18,449
(They are passing by cedars magically spread in the mountain.)

1243
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,521
They are so straight, aren't they?

1244
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,751
How can they grow so straight like this?

1245
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:25,390
They are splendid.

1246
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:30,130
(As they raise their heads to look up at the sky, )

1247
00:50:30,131 --> 00:50:33,501
(the warm sunlight shines through the leaves.)

1248
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,799
My gosh. Look at the trees.

1249
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,069
(The trees are densely standing like a roof over their heads.)

1250
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:40,700
Look how beautiful the trees are.

1251
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,710
(She puts out her hand to touch the leaves.)

1252
00:50:43,711 --> 00:50:44,870
(The smell of a forest)

1253
00:50:44,871 --> 00:50:46,010
It smells great.

1254
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:52,751
We are so close to the ground that I can touch it.

1255
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:56,690
It's good that the monorail is slow. We can see things more clearly.

1256
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:57,790
(Their feet are right above the grass in the mountain.)

1257
00:50:57,791 --> 00:50:59,120
This is wonderful.

1258
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:02,461
(The leaves seem so close that they can touch them.)

1259
00:51:03,191 --> 00:51:04,730
I love that it's going slowly.

1260
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:06,961
I get to see each and every tree and grass.

1261
00:51:08,731 --> 00:51:10,070
This is wonderful.

1262
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,601
We don't normally get to go into the deep mountain like this,

1263
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,410
because we usually walk along the mountain path.

1264
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:21,040
(Peeking out)

1265
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:23,679
Woo Hee. Isn't this great?

1266
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,710
This is so great.

1267
00:51:24,711 --> 00:51:25,779
- I know, right?
- Yes, I just love it.

1268
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,921
- Isn't this great?
- Yes, indeed.

1269
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,319
- I really love it.
- That's great.

1270
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,550
(They are happy to hear that.)

1271
00:51:30,851 --> 00:51:33,121
This is the beauty of slowness.

1272
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:34,659
This is fun.

1273
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,561
(The beauty of slowness)

1274
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,001
There's our house. Right there.

1275
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,569
Yes, that's our house.

1276
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:43,970
(I can see our house from here.)

1277
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:47,871
(Have fun.)

1278
00:51:48,601 --> 00:51:49,670
It's so pretty.

1279
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:51,570
(Our house is so pretty.)

1280
00:51:51,811 --> 00:51:53,839
I think we're almost there.

1281
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,010
(I think we're almost there.)

1282
00:51:55,381 --> 00:51:57,310
(Fully grown shiitake mushrooms)

1283
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,381
I guess we are here.

1284
00:51:58,851 --> 00:52:01,219
- That must be the mushroom field.
- I think so.

1285
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,389
- Look.
- Gosh.

1286
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:03,390
(They have spotted the mushroom field.)

1287
00:52:03,391 --> 00:52:04,489
Okay, mushrooms. Here we go.

1288
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:05,790
(Shall we go and pick shiitake mushrooms?)

1289
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,290
We are here.

1290
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,191
- We're here.
- Let's go.

1291
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,159
- Oh my...
- Here we are.

1292
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,230
(Safely filmed with permission from the owner)

1293
00:52:12,231 --> 00:52:13,961
- This is interesting.
- So they made holes in the trees.

1294
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,929
This is it.

1295
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:18,101
- It's shiitake mushroom, right?
- Look at the shiitake mushrooms.

1296
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:20,239
- I've never seen them on trees.
- Me neither.

1297
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,299
(Precious shiitake mushrooms with the energy of the mountain)

1298
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,970
- Woo Hee, you can start picking.
- Shall I start picking?

1299
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:24,739
- From side to side...
- Shake from side to side and pull.

1300
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,940
- Like this?
- Yes.

1301
00:52:26,941 --> 00:52:28,310
(To root it out, pinch the base and shake it from side to side.)

1302
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,609
This is the first pick.

1303
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,010
(Very precious first pick)

1304
00:52:31,211 --> 00:52:32,780
- This is awesome.
- Here is one.

1305
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:33,881
There's another one?

1306
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,490
- My goodness, that's a big one.
- A big mushroom.

1307
00:52:38,621 --> 00:52:39,690
Okay.

1308
00:52:39,691 --> 00:52:41,291
(Here I go.)

1309
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,989
(Here comes the youngest.)

1310
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,259
(Yes!)

1311
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:46,400
There's a lot here.

1312
00:52:46,401 --> 00:52:47,900
(He hit the jackpot.)

1313
00:52:47,901 --> 00:52:49,299
(Rooting it out so the remainder of the root wouldn't go bad inside)

1314
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,331
(Shaking from side to side)

1315
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,469
(It's not easy to pull out the whole root.)

1316
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:55,601
Oh, no. Shoot.

1317
00:52:56,271 --> 00:52:57,271
(Putting the mushroom into the sack)

1318
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,110
- Why is it so hard to pull it out?
- Pull it hard after shaking.

1319
00:53:01,941 --> 00:53:03,279
- I got it.
- Good. That's how it's done.

1320
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,381
- I got it.
- Yes, you did.

1321
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:07,050
I got the whole root out.

1322
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,589
This is fun. Goodness, I found a huge one.

1323
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,720
Gosh. That one is huge.

1324
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,089
(A huge mushroom)

1325
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,121
You seem so excited.

1326
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,560
I'm having so much fun.

1327
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:17,589
(I'm having so much fun.)

1328
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:18,760
- You are not having fun?
- I am.

1329
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,231
Put it in here.

1330
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,830
Okay, one last one.

1331
00:53:22,831 --> 00:53:24,331
Pull it harder.

1332
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:25,941
Let's see.

1333
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:27,100
This is harder than I thought.

1334
00:53:27,101 --> 00:53:28,239
(Using strength)

1335
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,470
You don't need to get angry at it.

1336
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:32,140
I'm trying to be gentle not to break it, but...

1337
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,380
(Picking the last one)

1338
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:36,251
Dong Il. I think we picked more than enough.

1339
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,980
(I feel hot.)

1340
00:53:38,981 --> 00:53:40,549
- It's pretty.
- Let me see.

1341
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,550
It's cute.

1342
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,750
If we cook ramyeon with them,

1343
00:53:43,751 --> 00:53:45,620
- This is great.
- it will only taste like mushrooms.

1344
00:53:45,621 --> 00:53:46,790
(The hand-picked shiitake mushrooms will be a great ingredient.)

1345
00:53:46,791 --> 00:53:47,921
That'd be great.

1346
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,460
(They have finished picking mushrooms.)

1347
00:53:49,461 --> 00:53:51,131
Gosh, this is so satisfying.

1348
00:53:51,831 --> 00:53:53,060
It was fun.

1349
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:55,061
Yes, I had so much fun.

1350
00:53:55,631 --> 00:53:56,730
Okay, here we go.

1351
00:53:56,731 --> 00:53:58,000
- Okay.
- All right.

1352
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,871
(Happily going down the mountain by monorail)

1353
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,000
Look. This is a steep downhill.

1354
00:54:02,001 --> 00:54:03,171
(On their way back is downhill.)

1355
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:05,410
- Woo Hee.
- Yes?

1356
00:54:05,811 --> 00:54:08,440
(Like a roller coaster)

1357
00:54:08,441 --> 00:54:10,910
(Hooray.)

1358
00:54:11,151 --> 00:54:12,720
Hey guys, it's dangerous.

1359
00:54:12,851 --> 00:54:14,320
It's too fast to do that.

1360
00:54:14,921 --> 00:54:17,489
You guys should be more careful when it's going down so fast like this.

1361
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:18,521
It's dangerous, okay?

1362
00:54:18,621 --> 00:54:21,790
It's too dangerous to put your hands up.

1363
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:23,560
(I want to do that too.)

1364
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:25,859
You can go like this like a real roller coaster.

1365
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,930
(Woo Hee seems energetic and excited all day long.)

1366
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,969
(They laughed a lot on their way back...)

1367
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:34,339
(and received a lot of happy energy.)

1368
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,640
This is excellent.

1369
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:39,009
All right. Let's go back home.

1370
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,009
- We're going back home?
- "We're going back home"?

1371
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,750
- Did you want to go anywhere else?
- No.

1372
00:54:42,751 --> 00:54:44,480
(It's time to go back home.)

1373
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,780
Shall I drive as slowly as the monorail?

1374
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:50,450
There isn't a single cloud in the sky.

1375
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:51,819
- Yes, you're right.
- That's true.

1376
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,890
(In the late afternoon with the warm sunlight)

1377
00:54:53,021 --> 00:54:54,560
(Impressed)

1378
00:54:54,561 --> 00:54:55,961
It's so pretty here too.

1379
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,190
Look at that.

1380
00:54:58,191 --> 00:54:59,461
(What is it?)

1381
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,460
This is beautiful.

1382
00:55:02,461 --> 00:55:03,529
What is that?

1383
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,840
- It's pink muhly grass.
- That's the pink something.

1384
00:55:06,401 --> 00:55:07,969
It's really gorgeous.

1385
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:10,510
(The pink muhly grass is swaying to say hello.)

1386
00:55:10,871 --> 00:55:12,409
I really love it here.

1387
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:15,481
(They stopped briefly to enjoy the view.)

1388
00:55:16,251 --> 00:55:17,910
- They are so pretty.
- What an amazing color.

1389
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,080
- The color is amazing.
- This is beautiful.

1390
00:55:20,081 --> 00:55:21,580
- Look at the color.
- This is pink muhly grass?

1391
00:55:21,581 --> 00:55:23,291
It's really pretty.

1392
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:25,989
- It's like cotton.
- This is an extraordinary color.

1393
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,160
It's like cotton.

1394
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:28,860
Can I touch it?

1395
00:55:28,861 --> 00:55:30,731
(Exclaiming)

1396
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:32,659
(It looks like heat haze in pink.)

1397
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,901
It's so pretty.

1398
00:55:35,001 --> 00:55:36,930
- It's prettier with the sunlight.
- I think so.

1399
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:38,501
It's just lovely.

1400
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,300
This is great.

1401
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:43,210
It looks...

1402
00:55:43,211 --> 00:55:45,771
- so beautiful with the sunlight.
- Yes, with the sunlight...

1403
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:47,609
- Woo Hee. Give me your cellphone.
- Suddenly?

1404
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,040
Turn on the camera. Get in here.

1405
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:51,279
- Here it is.
- No, keep the sack on,

1406
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,510
so that you would look like you're on your honeymoon.

1407
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:54,679
- Is that the theme of the picture?
- There you go.

1408
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,390
Go in that way. There's a path.

1409
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,520
(Let's go into the pink muhly grass together.)

1410
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,561
Okay. Ready?

1411
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:02,660
Should I be standing shyly like this?

1412
00:56:03,331 --> 00:56:05,259
- Be shy, okay?
- You guys look so pretty.

1413
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,530
- I know, right?
- They look so pretty.

1414
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,860
So pretty.

1415
00:56:07,861 --> 00:56:09,600
- Is that right?
- I'm not joking. I really mean it.

1416
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:11,199
- Really?
- Yes, really.

1417
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,800
You guys look so great with all the colors.

1418
00:56:13,901 --> 00:56:16,009
- The colors are so nice.
- You look prettier in there.

1419
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,140
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1420
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:20,239
It looks more beautiful with the sunlight.

1421
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,881
Seriously, you look very pretty.

1422
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:25,211
(Posing)

1423
00:56:25,751 --> 00:56:27,480
- Look at this photo.
- I love it.

1424
00:56:27,481 --> 00:56:29,820
- It's a great photo, isn't it?
- Absolutely.

1425
00:56:30,751 --> 00:56:32,860
- This is a beautiful spot.
- I told you.

1426
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,121
This is so beautiful.

1427
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,830
(Changing angles)

1428
00:56:36,831 --> 00:56:38,191
One, two, three.

1429
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,330
- Like a bird's-eye view, - A bird's-eye view?

1430
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,069
- capture more of the background.
- Like this? Okay.

1431
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,699
- We should crouch a bit.
- Yes, I'm too short to...

1432
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,770
- I'm sorry.
- Crouch a bit.

1433
00:56:45,771 --> 00:56:47,070
- Okay. Good?
- Well...

1434
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:48,840
One, two, three.

1435
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,810
One, two, three.

1436
00:56:50,811 --> 00:56:52,109
(Standing awkwardly)

1437
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,139
One, two, three.

1438
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,310
My knees are hurting.

1439
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:56,350
- That's enough.
- Gosh, my knees hurt.

1440
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:57,351
(Taking photos passionately)

1441
00:56:57,352 --> 00:57:00,651
- This looks a bit surreal.
- I know, right?

1442
00:57:00,981 --> 00:57:02,351
Yes, I agree.

1443
00:57:03,151 --> 00:57:04,790
- Look at you, Hee Won.
- Okay, from this side...

1444
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:07,489
- Look at Hee Won.
- Look here.

1445
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,490
(Hee Won, can you please smile a little bit?)

1446
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,190
Myoung. Give me the camera.

1447
00:57:10,191 --> 00:57:12,390
With this angle,

1448
00:57:12,561 --> 00:57:14,830
it looks very surreal.

1449
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:17,530
- It looks a bit...
- I like this angle.

1450
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:22,770
(A man is walking toward the empty house.)

1451
00:57:22,771 --> 00:57:24,810
(Panting)

1452
00:57:24,811 --> 00:57:27,180
(Panting)

1453
00:57:28,941 --> 00:57:32,820
(Is anybody here?)

1454
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,490
(Peeking in)

1455
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:42,021
(Bobbing his head)

1456
00:57:42,421 --> 00:57:43,530
This is a great house.

1457
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:50,501
(Who is the new guest shyly looking around the house?)

1458
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:53,170
(Woo Hee invited an actor...)

1459
00:57:53,171 --> 00:57:55,839
(who has an attractive smile.)

1460
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,570
(He is Actor Cho Hyun Chul.)

1461
00:57:58,811 --> 00:58:03,280
(Woo Hee and Hyun Chul met in the drama, "Argon".)

1462
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:08,351
(He played the clumsy firefighter in "The Tunnel", )

1463
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:12,490
(a genius hacker in "Master", )

1464
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:17,760
(and showed a perfect performance in the thriller "Coin Locker Girl".)

1465
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:24,970
(He played different roles perfectly in different genres.)

1466
00:58:25,331 --> 00:58:32,541
(Recently, he showed his great acting skills in "D.P.".)

1467
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:37,450
(Cho Hyun Chul, an actor with a thousand faces, is the new guest.)

1468
00:58:39,381 --> 00:58:43,220
(How come there's no one here?)

1469
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:46,520
(Being at the empty house...)

1470
00:58:46,521 --> 00:58:50,691
(makes him feel awkward.)

1471
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:54,930
(What should I do?)

1472
00:58:56,771 --> 00:59:00,070
(He is quietly holding his bag.)

1473
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:04,340
(Rolling his eyes)

1474
00:59:05,311 --> 00:59:09,910
(Right before the awkwardness hits the maximum...)

1475
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,509
(Engine sound)

1476
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:13,921
It's so beautiful here too.

1477
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:16,121
Okay.

1478
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:17,989
I feel like I'm actually home,

1479
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:20,921
whenever I come back after guiding the guests around.

1480
00:59:21,921 --> 00:59:23,090
What? Who is that?

1481
00:59:23,461 --> 00:59:26,530
- What? Hyun Chul is here.
- What?

1482
00:59:26,731 --> 00:59:28,600
- Really?
- I think Hyun Chul is here.

1483
00:59:28,601 --> 00:59:31,601
- He's here.
- I didn't know he already arrived.

1484
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,140
(So that's Hyun Chul?)

1485
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:38,569
(He saw the car coming in from far ahead.)

1486
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:39,740
(Smiling shyly)

1487
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,339
Why is he sitting like that?

1488
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,909
(She starts to laugh as soon as she sees him.)

1489
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:45,050
Hyun Chul.

1490
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,121
How come he is so cute?

1491
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,450
(Waving his hand)

1492
00:59:51,851 --> 00:59:53,860
(Staring)

1493
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:56,160
He looks totally different from the picture.

1494
00:59:57,831 --> 01:00:00,160
- Hyun Chul, you're here.
- Hello.

1495
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,830
You're here.

1496
01:00:02,831 --> 01:00:04,600
Hello.

1497
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,400
(Waving)

1498
01:00:06,401 --> 01:00:08,569
It's good to see you here.

1499
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:09,941
Wasn't it hard to come all the way here?

1500
01:00:10,271 --> 01:00:11,940
- I came here by plane.
- Really?

1501
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,340
- So this is...
- Hello.

1502
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,881
Hello. Nice to meet you.

1503
01:00:16,251 --> 01:00:18,080
- Hello.
- Hello.

1504
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,720
Why is your hand so sweaty?

1505
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:24,450
- I usually sweat a lot.
- Is that right?

1506
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:27,090
- Okay.
- Hello.

1507
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,390
- Hello.
- You're here.

1508
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,831
- Do you know him?
- Yes.

1509
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:31,230
- It's my first time meeting him.
- All right.

1510
01:00:31,231 --> 01:00:33,200
- It is?
- Is that right?

1511
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,600
- Hee Won, how about you?
- Hey, it's been a while.

1512
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:38,770
- I think they both were in...
- We were in "Best Friend".

1513
01:00:38,771 --> 01:00:40,340
- "Best Friend"?
- Yes.

1514
01:00:40,541 --> 01:00:47,780
(Hee Won and Hyun Chul met in the film "Best Friend".)

1515
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:50,580
(Hyun Chul played a role as Hee Won's subordinate's...)

1516
01:00:50,581 --> 01:00:54,851
(subordinate's subordinate.)

1517
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:59,351
(Although they didn't get to meet in the movie, )

1518
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:03,360
(Hee Won played roles in the films of which Hyun Chul wrote the draft.)

1519
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,291
When did you get here?

1520
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:06,831
- Me?
- Yes.

1521
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:08,699
It's been about half an hour.

1522
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,401
Half an hour? Really?

1523
01:01:10,831 --> 01:01:14,070
- Did you buy rice cakes for us?
- Yes.

1524
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:17,070
I bought it from Yeosu Market.

1525
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:22,480
- You stopped by at the market?
- Really? Was there anything else?

1526
01:01:22,481 --> 01:01:24,251
(Wasn't there anything else other than rice cakes?)

1527
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:26,881
Actually, we already ate rice cakes today.

1528
01:01:27,481 --> 01:01:29,850
- I see.
- But it's a different kind, right?

1529
01:01:29,851 --> 01:01:32,220
Can we open it? He bought it for us, so let's see it.

1530
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,521
This is the present he bought, so...

1531
01:01:36,631 --> 01:01:39,429
- Steamed rice cakes with pumpkin?
- How did you know?

1532
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:42,130
- It looks delicious.
- My gosh.

1533
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,799
Gosh, it looks amazing.

1534
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,529
- It's still so warm.
- The rice cakes are still warm.

1535
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:47,371
It'll be really good if we eat it now.

1536
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,199
You brought a really good one.

1537
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,171
(I'm glad everyone likes it.)

1538
01:01:52,371 --> 01:01:53,440
You're the best!

1539
01:01:53,441 --> 01:01:55,279
Since he brought it...

1540
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,909
Come sit here. Come here.

1541
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:57,981
Come here, Hyun Chul.

1542
01:01:58,311 --> 01:02:01,250
You guys should sit down since you're our guests.

1543
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:02,351
Over here...

1544
01:02:02,521 --> 01:02:04,691
- Should I bring some plates?
- Plates?

1545
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,520
- Bring some plates.
- I'll bring some plates.

1546
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:08,160
(Bring some plates.)

1547
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:10,429
- Sit down. Both of you, sit.
- Just stay seated.

1548
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:11,760
- No, it's okay.
- Have a seat.

1549
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,460
I came a bit earlier than him, so I know where things are.

1550
01:02:15,461 --> 01:02:16,699
(Confused)

1551
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,101
What are you going to do there?

1552
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,070
There's nothing to steal.

1553
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:23,010
You bought some delicious rice cakes.

1554
01:02:23,211 --> 01:02:24,540
Have a seat, Hyun Chul.

1555
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:26,109
He can't sit because you're not sitting.

1556
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,110
Is that what it is?

1557
01:02:27,111 --> 01:02:28,740
How did you know to buy this?

1558
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:31,510
I was looking up some famous rice cakes from here.

1559
01:02:31,851 --> 01:02:33,820
What kind of rice cakes are these?

1560
01:02:33,881 --> 01:02:35,120
They're steamed rice cakes with pumpkin.

1561
01:02:35,121 --> 01:02:36,421
- Steamed rice cakes with pumpkin?
- Yes.

1562
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,851
I've never had it before though.

1563
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:42,121
Then let's put this there and only take a bit of it out.

1564
01:02:42,521 --> 01:02:44,660
- Where?
- Let's put this here,

1565
01:02:45,731 --> 01:02:46,800
Give it to me.

1566
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:48,561
Okay. Give it to me.

1567
01:02:49,401 --> 01:02:51,171
Our guests don't need to move.

1568
01:02:52,331 --> 01:02:53,870
(Just relax, Hyun Chul.)

1569
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:57,441
(Laughing)

1570
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:00,680
- They look fluffy and delicious.
- Take out five pieces.

1571
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:03,409
- Here.
- It's hot.

1572
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:05,550
(Just the sight of it makes them happy.)

1573
01:03:06,081 --> 01:03:07,520
- Goodness.
- Take it.

1574
01:03:07,521 --> 01:03:10,520
(Shall we try the steamed rice cakes with pumpkin Hyun Chul brought?)

1575
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:11,690
- Thank you.
- Let's try it.

1576
01:03:11,691 --> 01:03:13,320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1577
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,989
- Enjoy.
- This looks good.

1578
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:18,589
There's a lot of pumpkins inside.

1579
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:20,731
- I know. It's nice and chewy.
- Right.

1580
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:25,570
(The youngest copies his older brother and takes a bite.)

1581
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,240
We had some rice cakes earlier, but why is this so good?

1582
01:03:29,871 --> 01:03:31,441
- Is it good?
- So good.

1583
01:03:33,211 --> 01:03:34,279
It's really soft.

1584
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,280
(Taking a bite)

1585
01:03:35,881 --> 01:03:38,179
(He sees the family's reaction...)

1586
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,820
(and takes a bite.)

1587
01:03:41,021 --> 01:03:45,620
Steamed rice cakes are my favorite, but this is really good.

1588
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:46,989
(The chewy steamed rice cake is filled with pumpkin.)

1589
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,020
This is so good.

1590
01:03:48,021 --> 01:03:49,831
It would've been nice if you got here sooner.

1591
01:03:50,131 --> 01:03:52,060
- We picked mushrooms.
- We picked mushrooms.

1592
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:53,199
You picked mushrooms?

1593
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,830
Yes. We picked mushrooms together.

1594
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,700
- That sounds fun.
- Right?

1595
01:03:56,831 --> 01:03:58,901
(He's so cute.)

1596
01:03:59,371 --> 01:04:01,069
How long did you wait?

1597
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,271
What? Me?

1598
01:04:02,871 --> 01:04:05,171
I waited here for 30 minutes.

1599
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:07,409
Why didn't you call?

1600
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,910
You should've called Woo Hee when you got here.

1601
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:11,610
I thought she might be busy.

1602
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,320
Why would we be busy?

1603
01:04:15,121 --> 01:04:17,291
- We're not here to work.
- Really?

1604
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:20,420
(Hyun Chul's silly charm makes everyone smile.)

1605
01:04:20,421 --> 01:04:21,521
I thought you might be busy.

1606
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,791
You should've called.

1607
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:25,889
- Is your blood type A?
- Pardon?

1608
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:27,100
- Is your blood type A?
- No, it's B.

1609
01:04:27,101 --> 01:04:28,200
You don't seem like it.

1610
01:04:28,901 --> 01:04:31,029
(He's a shy person whose blood type is B.)

1611
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:33,400
- We made a huge mistake today.
- Why?

1612
01:04:33,401 --> 01:04:36,001
We made our guests wait.

1613
01:04:36,271 --> 01:04:37,509
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

1614
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:40,779
I felt excited as I waited for you.

1615
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:41,780
- Really?
- Yes.

1616
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,449
- Hey, Hyun Chul.
- Yes?

1617
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:44,481
Do you like dried yellow corvina?

1618
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,310
Yes.

1619
01:04:46,311 --> 01:04:47,450
We have dried yellow corvina,

1620
01:04:47,921 --> 01:04:50,191
- green tea...
- Pork that ate green tea leaves.

1621
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:52,851
And cockles are our dinner tonight.

1622
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:54,620
That sounds delicious.

1623
01:04:54,621 --> 01:04:57,060
(Excited)

1624
01:04:57,061 --> 01:05:00,199
Stay seated. You guys could sit and talk.

1625
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,560
We set everything up in advance.

1626
01:05:02,561 --> 01:05:05,001
Just stay seated. You went through the trouble of bringing rice cakes.

1627
01:05:06,171 --> 01:05:08,069
- I'll stay here and talk too.
- Get up.

1628
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,101
(Get up.)

1629
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:11,009
(Laughing)

1630
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:12,671
You punk. How dare you sit?

1631
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:14,210
(While the homeowners gather in the kitchen...)

1632
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:15,481
Stay seated.

1633
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:19,351
It's a lot more fun...

1634
01:05:20,251 --> 01:05:21,780
- than I expected.
- Is it?

1635
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:25,390
We took a monorail to go pick mushrooms.

1636
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,061
It was a lot of fun.

1637
01:05:28,521 --> 01:05:30,430
Nothing's better than playing.

1638
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:35,000
- We looked around the mountain.
- Can we just stand here this?

1639
01:05:35,001 --> 01:05:36,671
- Yes. Look around.
- Really?

1640
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,731
I feel like I should do something.

1641
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,470
- Isn't it uncomfortable to sit?
- It is.

1642
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,640
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

1643
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:46,040
- I'm really comfortable right now.
- Just stay still.

1644
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:47,210
- Yes.
- Just chill.

1645
01:05:47,211 --> 01:05:48,779
Even so, we should help out.

1646
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:50,909
Go pick at the grass then.

1647
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:52,581
Pull out some weeds.

1648
01:05:53,521 --> 01:05:56,650
(They leave the guests who are offering to help, )

1649
01:05:56,651 --> 01:05:57,819
Start.

1650
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:58,889
(and they start making the green tea rice.)

1651
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:00,520
- It'll take 27 minutes.
- Okay.

1652
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:03,021
(Next...)

1653
01:06:03,691 --> 01:06:04,759
Okay.

1654
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,859
(The cockles have been cleaned.)

1655
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:06,901
Is it done?

1656
01:06:08,061 --> 01:06:11,070
I heard you have to take it out and steam it.

1657
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:17,311
(Their dinner here in Boseong, South Jeolla Province, )

1658
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:20,010
(will be made with the most famous ingredients of Boseong.)

1659
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:27,581
(Seasoned cockles made with granular arks, )

1660
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,450
(green tea-fed pork...)

1661
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:36,590
(cooked with aged kimchi for green tea-fed pork kimchi stew.)

1662
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:40,359
(Plus, they have savory dried yellow corvina...)

1663
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,831
(aged in barley for a year.)

1664
01:06:43,101 --> 01:06:46,740
(It's a filling spread of food from the southern region!)

1665
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:50,610
(Clattering)

1666
01:06:51,771 --> 01:06:54,610
(He pulls out a steamer.)

1667
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,580
(He adds onions.)

1668
01:06:56,581 --> 01:07:00,280
We have to put this on the bottom so the corvina doesn't stick.

1669
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:03,150
Should we place the heads on this side?

1670
01:07:03,151 --> 01:07:05,421
I think that would look better.

1671
01:07:05,691 --> 01:07:09,561
(He places the dried yellow corvina around in a circle.)

1672
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:12,291
(Exclaiming)

1673
01:07:13,191 --> 01:07:16,430
(They peek inside because they're curious.)

1674
01:07:16,831 --> 01:07:20,300
Gosh, this looks like doribaengbaeng. Doesn't it?

1675
01:07:20,671 --> 01:07:21,940
Let's put this over here.

1676
01:07:21,941 --> 01:07:23,069
(The dried yellow corvina is ready to be steamed.)

1677
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:24,171
Look for the lid.

1678
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:28,541
Next... Where's the pork?

1679
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:30,909
(He takes out the green tea-fed pork.)

1680
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:33,110
- What is it? The thing we brought?
- Green tea-fed pork.

1681
01:07:33,381 --> 01:07:35,250
Oh, my. That looks incredible.

1682
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:36,620
(How does the green tea-fed pork look for her to exclaim?)

1683
01:07:36,621 --> 01:07:37,689
This is insane.

1684
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:38,921
What is that?

1685
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,260
- That's incredible.
- Seriously.

1686
01:07:41,261 --> 01:07:43,689
I heard you guys were coming...

1687
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:44,989
Dong Il, that's really...

1688
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:46,931
- This is...
- Thank you so much.

1689
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:50,030
(The slab of pork fills the entire cutting board.)

1690
01:07:50,031 --> 01:07:52,471
- Look at that.
- They put green tea leaves in here.

1691
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,269
It's very tender.

1692
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:56,609
These are green tea sprouts.

1693
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:58,110
(They gather to look at the pork.)

1694
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,511
That looks incredible.

1695
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,121
(He cuts the green tea-fed pork into large pieces.)

1696
01:08:07,881 --> 01:08:09,381
- Hey, Youngest.
- Yes?

1697
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:11,420
- You know the gas burner?
- Yes?

1698
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:12,590
Use the gas burner...

1699
01:08:12,591 --> 01:08:14,120
Right. Should I boil the cockles?

1700
01:08:14,121 --> 01:08:15,660
Boil it for about ten minutes.

1701
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:20,200
(Safely filmed with permission from the owner)

1702
01:08:22,961 --> 01:08:27,141
(Is there anything for me to do?)

1703
01:08:28,841 --> 01:08:30,609
That's incredible.

1704
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:33,880
The sauce for the cockles is important...

1705
01:08:33,881 --> 01:08:35,011
Should I make the sauce?

1706
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:39,081
- Do you know to make it?
- Yes. Scallions, garlic, soy sauce.

1707
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:40,250
- Scallions, garlic, soy sauce?
- That's right.

1708
01:08:40,251 --> 01:08:41,681
That's all we need.

1709
01:08:42,121 --> 01:08:43,121
And red chili pepper powder.

1710
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:46,420
- That's it. And black pepper.
- Okay. Try making it.

1711
01:08:46,421 --> 01:08:47,421
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

1712
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,060
- I'll just make it.
- Goodness. What?

1713
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,060
- I'll just try it.
- Yes.

1714
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:54,930
You can try new things when you come to places like this.

1715
01:08:54,931 --> 01:08:56,261
Can I get the soy sauce?

1716
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,099
(Did you hear me?)

1717
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,100
What is it?

1718
01:09:01,101 --> 01:09:02,801
(Embarrassed)

1719
01:09:03,711 --> 01:09:05,239
- Yes.
- We have minced garlic.

1720
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,909
(Hyun Chul rolls up his sleeves to help out too.)

1721
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:08,511
Hyun Chul. Are you going to do something?

1722
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:10,649
- Don't roll up your sleeves.
- What's there to do?

1723
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:11,779
Don't do anything.

1724
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,421
- Can you take it out for me?
- Me too.

1725
01:09:14,381 --> 01:09:17,551
(Meanwhile, Woo Hee, who's in charge of the sauce, )

1726
01:09:18,891 --> 01:09:22,660
(cuts the red pepper in half first.)

1727
01:09:24,391 --> 01:09:27,600
(She chops it up well.)

1728
01:09:28,301 --> 01:09:33,230
(She cuts the Cheongyang peppers in the same way.)

1729
01:09:33,841 --> 01:09:36,770
(She puts the Cheongyang peppers in too.)

1730
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:39,610
Since we have a lot of this...

1731
01:09:40,881 --> 01:09:42,040
Put in a lot.

1732
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:43,909
If I add too much, our tongues will sting.

1733
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:44,980
The aged kimchi.

1734
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:48,181
- A lot of scallions will be good.
- Really?

1735
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:49,779
It'll add flavor.

1736
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:50,891
(She makes the sauce skillfully.)

1737
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:54,291
(Meanwhile, our home's main chef, Chef Sung, )

1738
01:09:55,091 --> 01:09:58,331
(adds the green tea-fed pork he cut up into the pot.)

1739
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,859
(He stir-fries it on low heat.)

1740
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:02,900
Gosh, the meat!

1741
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:05,730
It smells incredible.

1742
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:09,641
When you make aged kimchi stew, if you stir-fry it a little...

1743
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,970
Right, the juices stay inside, and it's delicious.

1744
01:10:12,971 --> 01:10:15,979
But... Goodness. Woo Hee,

1745
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:18,480
your mother must've influenced you a lot.

1746
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:21,480
(Embarrassed)

1747
01:10:22,681 --> 01:10:26,291
(Woo Hee's cooking skills...)

1748
01:10:26,921 --> 01:10:29,460
(are another gift from her mother.)

1749
01:10:29,461 --> 01:10:31,831
(Sniffing)

1750
01:10:32,931 --> 01:10:34,199
This is my mom's soy sauce.

1751
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,301
(Woo Hee brought her mom's homemade soy sauce.)

1752
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,670
(My mom's soy sauce is the best!)

1753
01:10:39,671 --> 01:10:40,700
Did you try it?

1754
01:10:41,001 --> 01:10:45,041
(She adds sweetness with plum syrup instead of sugar.)

1755
01:10:45,871 --> 01:10:47,239
Sesame oil.

1756
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,810
(She adds a nutty flavor with sesame oil.)

1757
01:10:50,011 --> 01:10:51,449
- It's almost ready.
- Okay.

1758
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:53,081
(Mixing)

1759
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,920
This looks delicious!

1760
01:10:55,921 --> 01:10:57,891
(The sauce for the cockles is ready.)

1761
01:10:59,591 --> 01:11:02,060
The cockles are opening up.

1762
01:11:03,261 --> 01:11:07,600
(Hyun Chul goes out to check on the cockles.)

1763
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:11,030
(Crouching)

1764
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:15,001
(Struggling)

1765
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:20,541
(He can't stir it because there are too many cockles.)

1766
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:29,480
(Hyun Chul stirs it with dedication, so they cook evenly.)

1767
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,990
There is a lot in here,

1768
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,591
so it's hard to stir.

1769
01:11:35,761 --> 01:11:39,891
(Laughing)

1770
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,001
It's hard to stir.

1771
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:47,501
I hope they become delicious.

1772
01:11:47,871 --> 01:11:48,899
(He does his best while chanting.)

1773
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,610
Become delicious.

1774
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:55,280
(Amused)

1775
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,011
- Was Hyun Chul always that quiet?
- Yes.

1776
01:11:59,211 --> 01:12:00,220
- What?
- Yes.

1777
01:12:00,221 --> 01:12:01,250
- Really?
- Yes.

1778
01:12:01,251 --> 01:12:02,881
What does he think about when he doesn't talk?

1779
01:12:03,921 --> 01:12:05,921
I think he says he doesn't think about anything.

1780
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:08,621
(Laughing)

1781
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:11,131
- He's got a strange charm.
- He does.

1782
01:12:12,831 --> 01:12:15,029
(He's been working on the cockles for 10 minutes...)

1783
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:17,230
(while showing off his charms.)

1784
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,471
(It's hot!)

1785
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:29,511
(He tastes it to see if they're cooked.)

1786
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:35,621
(Then he begins stirring again.)

1787
01:12:36,551 --> 01:12:38,490
- What are you doing out here?
- What?

1788
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,720
Are you doing that because you have nothing to do?

1789
01:12:40,721 --> 01:12:43,120
- I am.
- Right? That's what I thought.

1790
01:12:43,121 --> 01:12:45,390
- They're open.
- Just sit down.

1791
01:12:45,391 --> 01:12:47,700
- I think we can turn it off now.
- What is this?

1792
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,530
They're open now. Once they open, we can turn off the stove.

1793
01:12:51,971 --> 01:12:53,370
- Turn it off when they open?
- Yes.

1794
01:12:53,371 --> 01:12:55,340
Who said that? Some of these aren't open yet.

1795
01:12:55,341 --> 01:12:56,671
- Go ahead and try one.
- Right.

1796
01:12:57,671 --> 01:12:58,769
- Okay.
- Take one from the top.

1797
01:12:58,770 --> 01:12:59,840
(He takes out an open cockle.)

1798
01:12:59,841 --> 01:13:01,110
This is hot.

1799
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,711
This is hot right now.

1800
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:05,051
Should I put it inside?

1801
01:13:05,751 --> 01:13:08,650
(He places the cockle down carefully.)

1802
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:12,149
(Hee Won takes a step back.)

1803
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:13,420
(You try it.)

1804
01:13:13,421 --> 01:13:15,721
- You want me to try it?
- Yes. Try it.

1805
01:13:16,891 --> 01:13:18,990
I had one earlier.

1806
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:20,860
(Taking a bite)

1807
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,260
It's cooked.

1808
01:13:22,261 --> 01:13:23,301
- It's cooked?
- Yes.

1809
01:13:24,431 --> 01:13:26,530
Here it comes. Watch out.

1810
01:13:27,171 --> 01:13:28,840
Be careful!

1811
01:13:28,841 --> 01:13:29,971
(He delivers the cooked cockles to the kitchen.)

1812
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:37,350
(He rinses out the sediments.)

1813
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:40,820
- Did you try one?
- Yes. It's cooked perfectly.

1814
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:44,551
- Here.
- This will be my third. Thank you.

1815
01:13:46,921 --> 01:13:48,621
- Woo Hee, try it.
- Thank you.

1816
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,360
How is it?

1817
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:51,930
It's chewy.

1818
01:13:51,931 --> 01:13:53,030
- Is it?
- It's good.

1819
01:13:53,831 --> 01:13:56,260
(Lastly, he gives one to the youngest.)

1820
01:13:56,261 --> 01:13:58,269
- What do you think, Youngest?
- Yes!

1821
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,501
- Is it really good?
- Yes.

1822
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:03,040
- I'll give this to you, Hyun Chul.
- I'll take out the meat.

1823
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:04,371
- Do you know how to do it?
- I do.

1824
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:10,041
(It's time for Hyun Chul and Hee Won to take out the meat.)

1825
01:14:10,511 --> 01:14:12,310
So we have to open it?

1826
01:14:13,011 --> 01:14:15,081
- Don't we just need to take it out?
- Yes, that's all.

1827
01:14:15,721 --> 01:14:17,489
- For the ones that aren't open, - Yes?

1828
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:18,949
put the spoon in...

1829
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:20,421
- In the back?
- Yes.

1830
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:22,420
(If you twist the back of the shell, it opens easily.)

1831
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:24,631
- You can open it like this.
- I see.

1832
01:14:26,631 --> 01:14:28,559
How do I do it from the back?

1833
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,229
(Watching carefully)

1834
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:33,530
You don't put it in here. You just twist it.

1835
01:14:34,141 --> 01:14:35,471
- You twist the back?
- Yes.

1836
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,881
(Struggling)

1837
01:14:42,841 --> 01:14:46,050
I'm twisting it, but it won't work.

1838
01:14:46,051 --> 01:14:47,621
(The cockle isn't opening easily.)

1839
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,449
(Struggling)

1840
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:54,260
This one is refusing to open.

1841
01:14:54,261 --> 01:14:55,391
(I give up on you.)

1842
01:14:55,961 --> 01:14:58,590
(Meanwhile, his teacher, Hyun Chul, )

1843
01:14:58,591 --> 01:14:59,660
I got it.

1844
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,471
(opens each one up with the touch of his hand.)

1845
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:08,800
Goodness.

1846
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:11,671
I think we're working on 50 servings right now.

1847
01:15:12,471 --> 01:15:14,881
(He adds some Cheongyang peppers...)

1848
01:15:15,141 --> 01:15:17,910
(to the green tea-fed pork kimchi stew.)

1849
01:15:18,511 --> 01:15:21,720
(Once he adds the aged kimchi...)

1850
01:15:21,721 --> 01:15:23,280
(He's done.)

1851
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,590
(The dried yellow corvina is steaming well too.)

1852
01:15:24,591 --> 01:15:25,621
This has to come out nicely.

1853
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:33,560
(The warm autumn sun falls behind the mountain, )

1854
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:38,900
(and the front yard has gotten darker.)

1855
01:15:39,131 --> 01:15:42,040
(But they're not done opening the cockles.)

1856
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:43,200
I can't do this.

1857
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:46,409
(Woo Hee has joined them.)

1858
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:47,410
Gosh, this is...

1859
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:50,711
I think I'm a lost cause.

1860
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:52,051
Stop doing it.

1861
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,381
You can stop.

1862
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:56,780
(Exclaiming)

1863
01:15:58,121 --> 01:16:02,520
(The cockles are too hard for Woo Hee too.)

1864
01:16:03,591 --> 01:16:05,631
Whenever we want to eat something,

1865
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,631
we always struggle.

1866
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,630
But don't you think it's nice to be here?

1867
01:16:10,631 --> 01:16:11,770
Of course.

1868
01:16:11,831 --> 01:16:14,541
Even though all you've done so far is open cockles.

1869
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:18,171
Goodness.

1870
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:21,710
- This is a party.
- This is totally...

1871
01:16:21,711 --> 01:16:22,740
(The kimchi stew is cooking well.)

1872
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,909
(The youngest brings the finishing ingredients.)

1873
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:27,050
We have to add scallions.

1874
01:16:27,051 --> 01:16:29,081
(Pouring it in)

1875
01:16:29,721 --> 01:16:31,251
I'm going to eat three bowls of rice.

1876
01:16:31,721 --> 01:16:32,791
Eat up.

1877
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:36,421
Gosh, Youngest... This is...

1878
01:16:36,891 --> 01:16:38,530
Aren't you excited for this?

1879
01:16:39,431 --> 01:16:42,301
(He opens the steamed dried yellow corvina.)

1880
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,431
- Doesn't it look like it's cooked?
- Yes.

1881
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:47,140
We have to cool this off.

1882
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:48,440
(The dried yellow corvina is nice and soft.)

1883
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,640
(This is the last piece.)

1884
01:16:50,641 --> 01:16:51,711
Done!

1885
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:53,809
We're done!

1886
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:54,910
- Are you?
- Yes.

1887
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:59,349
Gosh, the tofu looks delicious too.

1888
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:00,520
(A delicious dinner made by them)

1889
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:03,280
- Good job, you guys.
- Thank you.

1890
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:08,220
There's no way that this isn't delicious.

1891
01:17:08,221 --> 01:17:09,519
(There's no way this meal isn't delicious.)

1892
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,530
Right?

1893
01:17:15,487 --> 01:17:18,357
- Good job, everyone!
- Good job!

1894
01:17:18,657 --> 01:17:21,995
- Okay. Let's eat.
- Goodness, Dong Il.

1895
01:17:21,996 --> 01:17:24,396
- Eat up!
- Thank you for the food!

1896
01:17:24,397 --> 01:17:26,727
- I'm going to try the meat first.
- Wrap it up in kimchi...

1897
01:17:27,267 --> 01:17:28,696
- I'm going to try the rice first.
- before you eat it.

1898
01:17:28,697 --> 01:17:30,236
I'm going to have the meat with aged kimchi.

1899
01:17:30,237 --> 01:17:32,206
This is green tea rice. Try it.

1900
01:17:33,336 --> 01:17:34,776
(She takes a bite of the rice.)

1901
01:17:34,777 --> 01:17:36,237
- Gosh, this is...
- Can you taste the green tea?

1902
01:17:37,077 --> 01:17:39,176
- This is really good.
- Is it?

1903
01:17:40,517 --> 01:17:41,517
I might have...

1904
01:17:41,518 --> 01:17:42,616
(I might have two bowls of rice today.)

1905
01:17:42,617 --> 01:17:43,846
two bowls of rice today.

1906
01:17:44,886 --> 01:17:47,316
If you have the pork with the aged kimchi,

1907
01:17:47,317 --> 01:17:49,016
it's really good.

1908
01:17:49,017 --> 01:17:53,456
(Wrap the green tea-fed pork with some aged kimchi.)

1909
01:17:53,956 --> 01:17:55,255
(Ripping)

1910
01:17:55,256 --> 01:17:57,197
(He rips off a long strip of aged kimchi.)

1911
01:17:58,996 --> 01:18:03,197
(He puts the pork on top and take a huge bite.)

1912
01:18:03,367 --> 01:18:05,336
(Satisfied)

1913
01:18:05,937 --> 01:18:07,737
If Hee Won says it's good, then it's really good.

1914
01:18:08,806 --> 01:18:09,876
He's a picky eater.

1915
01:18:10,876 --> 01:18:15,517
(It satisfies Hee Won's picky palate.)

1916
01:18:17,187 --> 01:18:19,845
- Can you taste the green tea?
- It's incredibly chewy.

1917
01:18:19,846 --> 01:18:21,617
(The youngest tries to eat a tower of meat.)

1918
01:18:22,317 --> 01:18:23,926
Should I sprinkle this on top?

1919
01:18:25,886 --> 01:18:27,755
This is steamed dried yellow corvina.

1920
01:18:27,756 --> 01:18:29,697
You eat it like this.

1921
01:18:29,827 --> 01:18:32,727
If you have the pork with the aged kimchi,

1922
01:18:33,496 --> 01:18:34,836
it's really good.

1923
01:18:35,067 --> 01:18:37,466
- The aged kimchi is amazing.
- Try it with this, Hyun Chul.

1924
01:18:37,806 --> 01:18:38,866
Isn't it good?

1925
01:18:38,867 --> 01:18:40,466
(Nodding)

1926
01:18:41,876 --> 01:18:43,436
You have to eat it with the meat.

1927
01:18:43,437 --> 01:18:44,607
(Hyun Chul takes a piece of scallion kimchi.)

1928
01:18:46,346 --> 01:18:49,976
(He places it on the grass-fed-pork and takes a big bite.)

1929
01:18:49,977 --> 01:18:51,216
Try it.

1930
01:18:51,287 --> 01:18:55,086
(This time, he tries it with Woo Hee's radish green kimchi.)

1931
01:18:56,117 --> 01:19:00,226
(He's quietly filling both his cheeks with food.)

1932
01:19:00,227 --> 01:19:01,657
I'm a bit shocked.

1933
01:19:02,357 --> 01:19:04,327
- This is really good.
- I know.

1934
01:19:05,496 --> 01:19:06,567
Hyun Chul,

1935
01:19:07,397 --> 01:19:09,767
- you're not a picky eater.
- I'm not.

1936
01:19:09,966 --> 01:19:12,466
- Everything is so good.
- That's really good.

1937
01:19:13,336 --> 01:19:16,077
Did you try this one? Try it.

1938
01:19:16,176 --> 01:19:17,446
(He stops eating...)

1939
01:19:17,447 --> 01:19:18,746
(and stares.)

1940
01:19:19,676 --> 01:19:21,745
I'm curious about the cockles.

1941
01:19:21,746 --> 01:19:22,816
- Try it.
- It's good.

1942
01:19:22,817 --> 01:19:24,715
You can try it as is since it's already seasoned...

1943
01:19:24,716 --> 01:19:27,357
- Right. It is.
- from the ocean. It's good.

1944
01:19:27,987 --> 01:19:31,556
(How does it taste?)

1945
01:19:33,056 --> 01:19:34,255
(Hyun Chul has 1 cockle.)

1946
01:19:34,256 --> 01:19:37,156
(Woo Hee has 1 cockle.)

1947
01:19:37,157 --> 01:19:38,196
This is really good.

1948
01:19:38,197 --> 01:19:39,197
(Nodding)

1949
01:19:39,527 --> 01:19:40,737
This is really good.

1950
01:19:41,367 --> 01:19:43,496
- It's really chewy.
- I know.

1951
01:19:44,437 --> 01:19:47,006
(He adds the sauce.)

1952
01:19:47,706 --> 01:19:48,776
(The youngest...)

1953
01:19:48,777 --> 01:19:49,805
(mixes the cockles and sauce with the green tea rice.)

1954
01:19:49,806 --> 01:19:51,606
Eat a little bit of everything.

1955
01:19:51,607 --> 01:19:53,706
(He takes a big bite.)

1956
01:19:54,077 --> 01:19:55,146
Don't force yourself to eat though.

1957
01:19:55,147 --> 01:19:57,486
(He takes one bite, )

1958
01:19:57,487 --> 01:19:58,585
This is really good.

1959
01:19:58,586 --> 01:19:59,786
(two bites, )

1960
01:19:59,787 --> 01:20:00,787
Is it good?

1961
01:20:01,317 --> 01:20:03,316
(and three bites.)

1962
01:20:03,317 --> 01:20:05,956
(It's so good he can't put down his spoon.)

1963
01:20:06,556 --> 01:20:07,925
Gosh, you're eating so well.

1964
01:20:07,926 --> 01:20:10,326
- Gosh, you made a great sauce.
- This is amazing.

1965
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:11,327
(Perfect teamwork)

1966
01:20:12,067 --> 01:20:13,566
(He is enjoying his meal, )

1967
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:16,197
(but he suddenly gets sad.)

1968
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:18,067
I should try a combination of these.

1969
01:20:18,306 --> 01:20:19,805
He finished his rice already.

1970
01:20:19,806 --> 01:20:21,706
I was debating whether or not I should have another bowl.

1971
01:20:21,907 --> 01:20:23,776
- Rice.
- Can you get me a bowl too?

1972
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:24,806
Shall I?

1973
01:20:25,907 --> 01:20:28,947
(Tonight's dinner is filled with dishes that go well with rice.)

1974
01:20:29,777 --> 01:20:32,345
(He refills his bowl as though it's his first.)

1975
01:20:32,346 --> 01:20:34,556
(Adding a lot)

1976
01:20:34,916 --> 01:20:37,686
(He begins Round 2 right away.)

1977
01:20:37,687 --> 01:20:39,827
(She bursts out into laughter.)

1978
01:20:40,157 --> 01:20:41,857
You're not mad. Are you?

1979
01:20:41,956 --> 01:20:44,366
No. The rice is warm,

1980
01:20:44,367 --> 01:20:46,266
- Right.
- so it's really good.

1981
01:20:46,267 --> 01:20:47,897
(It tastes so good that it makes him angry.)

1982
01:20:48,367 --> 01:20:49,595
(Looking)

1983
01:20:49,596 --> 01:20:52,005
(Hyun Chul thinks for a long time...)

1984
01:20:52,006 --> 01:20:53,606
This is really good.

1985
01:20:53,607 --> 01:20:55,205
I'm going to have another bowl of rice.

1986
01:20:55,206 --> 01:20:56,805
(He made his decision.)

1987
01:20:56,806 --> 01:20:58,045
- Eat some more.
- My gosh.

1988
01:20:58,046 --> 01:20:59,777
He's such a quiet guy, but...

1989
01:21:00,306 --> 01:21:01,516
(He has gained a big bowl of rice.)

1990
01:21:01,517 --> 01:21:02,947
We're almost done with everything.

1991
01:21:04,046 --> 01:21:05,646
If I eat more, that'll be too much.

1992
01:21:05,647 --> 01:21:07,885
(There's 1 more person who's debating.)

1993
01:21:07,886 --> 01:21:11,026
(The last spoonful of rice)

1994
01:21:11,027 --> 01:21:12,686
- Hyun Chul. Here.
- I'll give you some kimchi.

1995
01:21:12,687 --> 01:21:14,125
Eat half a piece more.

1996
01:21:14,126 --> 01:21:15,656
This is a new one, so give me your bowl.

1997
01:21:15,657 --> 01:21:16,897
- Thank you.
- Bring it over.

1998
01:21:17,126 --> 01:21:18,465
Try it with the kimchi.

1999
01:21:18,466 --> 01:21:20,066
Wrap the hot rice with the kimchi.

2000
01:21:20,067 --> 01:21:21,196
- Eat half a piece.
- It's so good.

2001
01:21:21,197 --> 01:21:22,267
It's incredible.

2002
01:21:23,596 --> 01:21:26,736
(Thinking)

2003
01:21:26,737 --> 01:21:29,936
Has there been a female guest who ate two bowls of rice?

2004
01:21:29,937 --> 01:21:31,675
- Of course.
- We've had a ton!

2005
01:21:31,676 --> 01:21:33,407
Really? Should I have some more?

2006
01:21:33,706 --> 01:21:34,875
You should eat.

2007
01:21:34,876 --> 01:21:36,245
(Should I eat it or not?)

2008
01:21:36,246 --> 01:21:39,616
I'm not kidding. I had the kimchi with some hot rice,

2009
01:21:39,617 --> 01:21:41,286
and it tasted even better.

2010
01:21:41,287 --> 01:21:42,756
(They haven't even tried the steamed dried yellow corvina yet.)

2011
01:21:43,216 --> 01:21:46,357
(Since we haven't had the steamed barley corvina yet...)

2012
01:21:48,697 --> 01:21:52,566
Since Dong Il said he will take the meat off the bones for us...

2013
01:21:52,567 --> 01:21:53,665
(She gets up to get a refill.)

2014
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:55,937
(Humming)

2015
01:21:56,767 --> 01:21:57,805
What do you think?

2016
01:21:57,806 --> 01:21:58,866
(Filling)

2017
01:21:58,867 --> 01:22:00,505
(She gets a big bowl of rice.)

2018
01:22:00,506 --> 01:22:02,577
We put down a mat and...

2019
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:05,045
(She can't wait and takes a bite.)

2020
01:22:05,046 --> 01:22:06,146
I'm done.

2021
01:22:06,147 --> 01:22:09,616
I took off all the meat in the bones.

2022
01:22:09,617 --> 01:22:10,787
- Thank you.
- What do you think?

2023
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,729
I took off all the meat in the bones.

2024
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:15,928
- Thank you.
- What do you think?

2025
01:22:15,929 --> 01:22:17,899
(Dong Il took all the meat off the bones of the corvina.)

2026
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:19,629
Thank you!

2027
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:22,798
(Our youngest should have the first bite.)

2028
01:22:22,799 --> 01:22:24,838
It's filled with his love.

2029
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:27,809
The corvina is really good. It's better than I expected.

2030
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:29,109
(His chopsticks keep moving at the savory and chewy flavors.)

2031
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:31,109
This is steamed dried yellow corvina.

2032
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:32,449
- It's really good.
- Like this.

2033
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:33,480
Here.

2034
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:35,480
(Exclaiming)

2035
01:22:36,549 --> 01:22:38,119
(Dong Il, who worked hard, takes a big bite too.)

2036
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,120
We're done.

2037
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:41,159
The dried yellow corvina is nice and chewy.

2038
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,589
- Isn't it good?
- It really is.

2039
01:22:45,389 --> 01:22:46,629
I'm glad I came here.

2040
01:22:46,959 --> 01:22:48,230
You're glad you came here?

2041
01:22:48,829 --> 01:22:51,530
No, I mean I got to relax during the day too.

2042
01:22:51,969 --> 01:22:54,498
- I'm so happy.
- I had a great meal.

2043
01:22:54,499 --> 01:22:55,968
- Thank you for the meal!
- Thank you!

2044
01:22:55,969 --> 01:22:56,998
Let's go.

2045
01:22:56,999 --> 01:22:59,409
(The family gathers around for some tea under the moonlight.)

2046
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:00,610
Hey, Hyun Chul.

2047
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:04,850
Has anyone told you that you have an interesting personality?

2048
01:23:05,879 --> 01:23:07,780
- Me?
- Have you?

2049
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:11,019
Hee Won told me that you're an interesting person.

2050
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,919
He is. He's very unique.

2051
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,990
That's why his acting is really unique too.

2052
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:22,029
When we do read-throughs and stuff,

2053
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:23,360
he seems different from others.

2054
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:24,799
- Really?
- Yes.

2055
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:26,230
How so?

2056
01:23:26,231 --> 01:23:28,240
Do you know how you want to portray a role when you read the script?

2057
01:23:29,639 --> 01:23:32,509
I'm not sure. I just do what I do all the time.

2058
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:36,610
You were in "D.P." and a lot of other dramas and movies,

2059
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:38,950
and they were all different characters.

2060
01:23:40,509 --> 01:23:43,048
(He was newly recognized...)

2061
01:23:43,049 --> 01:23:46,120
(for his role in the recent drama, "D.P.", )

2062
01:23:46,919 --> 01:23:50,820
(but he portrays his character naturally in everything he does.)

2063
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:56,929
(Hyun Chul becomes the character that he plays.)

2064
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:02,869
When it comes to acting...

2065
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:05,209
and the direction I want to go in,

2066
01:24:06,539 --> 01:24:09,138
- Freely?
- I try to talk naturally.

2067
01:24:09,139 --> 01:24:11,850
I try to avoid expressing things in an exaggerated way.

2068
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:15,749
I think that's what I prefer.

2069
01:24:17,049 --> 01:24:19,349
Hyun Chul directs too.

2070
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:21,388
How is it from your perspective?

2071
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:23,189
You act and direct at the same time.

2072
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:24,389
- Which do you prefer?
- Well...

2073
01:24:25,429 --> 01:24:28,060
I think acting...

2074
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,730
(Thinking)

2075
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,529
(Very careful)

2076
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:34,700
- So...
- Can you talk faster?

2077
01:24:35,139 --> 01:24:36,569
Goodness, Dong Il.

2078
01:24:36,570 --> 01:24:38,509
- How's acting?
- How's acting?

2079
01:24:38,969 --> 01:24:42,078
I've thought for a very long time...

2080
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:47,309
that acting is my profession.

2081
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:49,178
As for directing...

2082
01:24:49,179 --> 01:24:51,189
(I tried directing...)

2083
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:54,088
- I had a lot of fun.
- Directing was fun?

2084
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,089
Really?

2085
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:58,529
If you got to hire any of us for your movie,

2086
01:24:58,530 --> 01:25:00,789
- who would you hire?
- Hold on.

2087
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,200
Wait. Let's hear it.

2088
01:25:04,429 --> 01:25:06,499
- Choose me.
- Ha Nee...

2089
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:09,498
Hee Won already appeared...

2090
01:25:09,499 --> 01:25:12,008
in a movie that I wrote the rough draft of. Right?

2091
01:25:12,009 --> 01:25:14,008
- Really?
- He did.

2092
01:25:14,009 --> 01:25:15,179
- Really?
- Yes.

2093
01:25:17,009 --> 01:25:20,279
I thought about it, and...

2094
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,579
When someone acts,

2095
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:25,249
- when they're sad, they cry.
- Right, actors do.

2096
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:28,820
But I think that feels fake.

2097
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,359
- When people are sad...
- They try to hold back their tears.

2098
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,758
- they hold back their tears.
- I don't understand that either.

2099
01:25:32,759 --> 01:25:35,758
- Right. That's what people do.
- That's what people do.

2100
01:25:35,759 --> 01:25:37,828
When we get angry, we try to hold in our anger.

2101
01:25:37,829 --> 01:25:39,668
- We don't scream and shout.
- Right.

2102
01:25:39,669 --> 01:25:43,739
Most of the time, people don't yell when they're angry.

2103
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:45,668
Even when they're terrified,

2104
01:25:45,669 --> 01:25:48,239
they don't shake. They just...

2105
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,240
Right.

2106
01:25:49,241 --> 01:25:51,248
- They freeze.
- Right.

2107
01:25:51,249 --> 01:25:53,579
That's what I want to...

2108
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:56,350
portray in my work.

2109
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,849
It's been a while since I've met a director that I can relate to.

2110
01:26:00,850 --> 01:26:02,218
I really...

2111
01:26:02,219 --> 01:26:03,819
(He fist bumps to show he relates to him.)

2112
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:07,328
What took you so long to come here?

2113
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,860
- As a director.
- Can you see why he won't starve?

2114
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:11,928
I've learned from you today.

2115
01:26:11,929 --> 01:26:14,229
- Right.
- When it comes to working...

2116
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:15,439
(I learned something new today.)

2117
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,240
Dong Il never takes a break.

2118
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:20,070
Hyun Chul is charming.

2119
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,110
I just met him, but he seems very charming.

2120
01:26:25,579 --> 01:26:28,520
(A promenade that is filled with the warm sunlight)

2121
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:30,019
(We've gone on so many trips, )

2122
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:32,119
(but it's the first time we went on a morning walk.)

2123
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,788
(Father. Wake up.)

2124
01:26:33,789 --> 01:26:34,919
(I can't open my eyes.)

2125
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:38,589
(It smells so nice.)

2126
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:41,758
(Inhaling)

2127
01:26:41,759 --> 01:26:44,999
(They walk through a cypress forest filled with phytoncide.)

2128
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:48,270
(They start their morning in a refreshing way.)

2129
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:51,570
(Where are they headed next with light steps?)

2130
01:26:52,539 --> 01:26:55,910
(They go from their house to the beach in moments.)

2131
01:26:56,209 --> 01:26:59,110
(The vast Namhae ocean is right under their noses.)

2132
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,620
(Our front yard is just perfect.)

2133
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:06,219
(They enjoy surf casting here.)

2134
01:27:06,419 --> 01:27:08,519
(I want to fish next to Hee Won!)

2135
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,859
(Me too!)

2136
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,258
(He joins them naturally.)

2137
01:27:13,259 --> 01:27:15,530
(At a loss for words)

2138
01:27:15,959 --> 01:27:17,060
(Wait, this feels like...)

2139
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:18,599
(Surprised)

2140
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,400
- Did he get a bite?
- He caught something!

2141
01:27:20,770 --> 01:27:22,600
(Did he really catch something?)

2142
01:27:22,969 --> 01:27:25,838
(I caught it before it could even digest the worm.)

2143
01:27:25,839 --> 01:27:28,239
(Filled with jealousy)

2144
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:30,780
(A man who was born to fish)

2145
01:27:31,009 --> 01:27:33,809
(This time, it's finally my turn.)

2146
01:27:33,810 --> 01:27:35,379
(Running)

2147
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,949
(I'm sorry, Dong Il.)

2148
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:41,320
(Tangled)

2149
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:43,690
(Hitting)

2150
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:46,788
(I can't do this because of the youngest.)

2151
01:27:46,789 --> 01:27:49,699
(Just go barefoot!)

2152
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:51,699
(He runs barefoot.)

2153
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:53,668
(He quickly goes to the rod.)

2154
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:55,269
(Don't get flustered!)

2155
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,869
(Why won't this reel in?)

2156
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:58,339
(Breaking)

2157
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:01,480
(He caught a net.)

2158
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,079
(My goodness.)

2159
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,780
(They feel like a family as they relax and have fun.)

2160
01:28:07,049 --> 01:28:10,249
(Come visit our home that is filled with happiness.)
