1
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:27,461
(A filling dinner)

2
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:30,092
(I ate like a bulldozer.)

3
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:34,001
(An important announcement)

4
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:36,202
(Tomorrow,)

5
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:40,101
(we must get up at 4am.)

6
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:41,711
(At 4am?)

7
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:43,111
So we're going to bed early tonight.

8
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,611
You can go to bed after this.

9
00:00:45,982 --> 00:00:48,281
Here's what we'll do tomorrow.

10
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,412
(Tomorrow's special plan)

11
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:53,482
We're riding a hot-air balloon tomorrow to see the sunrise.

12
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:56,522
(We're taking a hot-air balloon tomorrow.)

13
00:00:58,062 --> 00:01:00,632
- The sunrise.
- A hot-air balloon.

14
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:07,071
(On a giant balloon,)

15
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,971
(they'll spend time flying in the air.)

16
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:13,141
(Gusting)

17
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:18,042
(The world that's a bit smaller seen from the sky)

18
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:23,182
(Shall we go back to being children on the hot-air balloon?)

19
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:25,721
Normally, they tie a rope to it and bring it up, right?

20
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:27,152
- And they pull you back down.
- I thought it would be that.

21
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:28,191
No.

22
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:30,922
We're actually floating along the air current.

23
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:32,562
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

24
00:01:32,562 --> 00:01:35,191
Like a trip around the world on a hot-air balloon,

25
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:36,762
we'll be up there from 40 to 60 minutes.

26
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:38,661
We might get there faster...

27
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:40,031
or slower.

28
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:42,672
How do we land it?

29
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:45,141
We won't be landing it, so don't worry.

30
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:47,212
(Very worried)

31
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:49,042
But there's never been...

32
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:50,982
a huge accident.

33
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:52,042
(A safe trip with an expert)

34
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:53,581
How long does it take from here?

35
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:56,751
About over an hour by car.

36
00:01:57,422 --> 00:01:59,152
- I think so.
- We should go to bed now.

37
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,822
- We'll clean this up now.
- Okay.

38
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:02,792
I'll just brush my teeth and wash my face.

39
00:02:03,452 --> 00:02:05,021
Go to bed? We need to leave now.

40
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:09,391
- We don't have time to sleep.
- Let's clean up.

41
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:14,202
(After the plentiful dinner,)

42
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:20,072
(they have dessert before bed.)

43
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:22,672
(Chewing)

44
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:28,311
(Dong Il eats glutinous rice cakes from the market.)

45
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:32,422
(What does Ha Nee do when the rest are eating dessert?)

46
00:02:32,422 --> 00:02:35,252
(Rummaging through)

47
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:39,091
(She picks up a mysterious bottle...)

48
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,091
(and smells it.)

49
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:41,262
(Exhaling)

50
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:45,532
(Myoung naturally takes some...)

51
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,132
(and applies it on his face.)

52
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:49,502
- One of these...
- Yes.

53
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:50,672
What's that?

54
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:53,711
It's for bed.

55
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:56,371
I always bring aroma oil around.

56
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,341
(How classy.)

57
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:00,982
I love the luxurious items.

58
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,651
I always apply aroma oil too.

59
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:06,422
(Myoung laughing)

60
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:08,151
I always apply aroma oil too.

61
00:03:08,151 --> 00:03:10,192
(I always apply aroma oil too.)

62
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:12,422
Oh, I'm so sorry.

63
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,491
(The youngest genuinely laughs as he feels comfortable.)

64
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:15,961
- You've lost your mind now.
- I'm sorry.

65
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,202
(The youngest genuinely laughs as he feels comfortable.)

66
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:19,102
(Laughing)

67
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:23,202
That was instinctive. You can't stop him.

68
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,172
Don't scold him for that.

69
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:29,241
(I know.)

70
00:03:29,972 --> 00:03:32,181
I met Myoung for the first time today,

71
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:34,482
and I like him.

72
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,482
I'm not joking. You're really nice.

73
00:03:38,882 --> 00:03:40,021
I love this guy.

74
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:43,621
- I knew you would adore him.
- I love him.

75
00:03:44,722 --> 00:03:48,192
Above all, he's not lazy.

76
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,502
He tries to find work.

77
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:52,632
It's not just me.

78
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,831
Wherever he goes...

79
00:03:55,672 --> 00:04:03,172
(Dong Il only cherished Hee Won.)

80
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:09,581
(And a new guy stepped into his heart.)

81
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:14,752
(The youngest of the family leads by example.)

82
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,861
(You're a quick learner.)

83
00:04:18,222 --> 00:04:22,591
(Now Dong Il loves the youngest.)

84
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:25,762
(Struggling)

85
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:29,532
(He's always next to Dong Il.)

86
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:31,941
(Impressed)

87
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:38,181
(That's how the three became a family.)

88
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:39,941
He's totally different from Hee Won.

89
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:41,912
He's too cold.

90
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,852
Anyway, you're...

91
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:47,951
- the best. What?
- Smile when you compliment him.

92
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:50,491
- Smile when you compliment him.
- What?

93
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:51,761
Smile when you speak.

94
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:53,462
(Laughing)

95
00:04:53,462 --> 00:04:56,061
It's important that I give him a serious compliment.

96
00:04:56,392 --> 00:04:58,761
If I smile and say, "You're really nice"...

97
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,701
- It wouldn't seem sincere.
- "You're really..."

98
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,732
- This seems fake.
- That looks real to me.

99
00:05:04,602 --> 00:05:07,142
(Dong Il and Hee Won have the best chemistry.)

100
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:09,172
(Is that so?)

101
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:11,681
You're incredible.

102
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:17,352
(The best compliment ever)

103
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:20,522
(Thinking)

104
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:24,821
Now that it's the evening...

105
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:31,662
(What about it?)

106
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:35,201
I feel like it's my cup of tea.

107
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:37,201
It's my cup of tea.

108
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:39,042
That's what I realized.

109
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:41,741
You're incredible.

110
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,772
(Myoung, you're incredible.)

111
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:44,941
(Proud)

112
00:05:46,582 --> 00:05:47,811
You timed it perfectly.

113
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,022
- I really like this moment.
- We need to get up at dawn.

114
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:54,621
I like it too.

115
00:05:56,392 --> 00:05:58,662
It's a shame that I have to sleep.

116
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:00,522
But I still have to.

117
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,232
- That's right.
- That's what it feels like.

118
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:04,361
I agree.

119
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,216
- See for yourself.
- Climb up there.

120
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:08,255
Yes, go ahead.

121
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,885
Grab that and climb up.

122
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:13,325
(Amazed)

123
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:14,325
That's...

124
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:17,096
- It looks nice.
- Do you think you can go up?

125
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:19,995
(Risky)

126
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:22,536
- You seem to be struggling.
- It looks risky, right?

127
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:24,135
There's one more step. There.

128
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:26,505
- You never did gymnastics.
- No.

129
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:28,206
- It's really nice.
- There's the pillow.

130
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:29,375
- The pillow is here?
- No, you can...

131
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,046
- lie however you want.
- If you lie this way...

132
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:32,146
You already bumped your head.

133
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:34,346
Will you be all right?

134
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:36,346
(Will you be all right with sleeping in the top bunk?)

135
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:37,586
Really? Okay.

136
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:40,245
- Just hold out for three hours.
- Do you think you can sleep?

137
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:44,255
(3 hours before the hot-air balloon ride)

138
00:06:44,586 --> 00:06:46,726
We have to close the door as it's humid.

139
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:48,026
Let's close the door.

140
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:50,255
Myoung, take this and...

141
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:51,296
(They hurry to go to bed.)

142
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:53,325
put up the mosquito net.

143
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,235
There's one here.

144
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:57,036
(There's a moth.)

145
00:06:57,235 --> 00:06:59,336
(Manly)

146
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,805
(He closes the doors and windows.)

147
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:06,906
What do you think, Youngest? Are you excited to sleep here?

148
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:09,075
You've wanted to sleep here, haven't you?

149
00:07:10,315 --> 00:07:13,115
I could go to sleep right away.

150
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:14,685
(He'll be sound asleep on the first day.)

151
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:16,786
That's nice.

152
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:18,385
(But...)

153
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:21,096
(Looking around)

154
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:24,726
- I'll set the alarm.
- Right. The alarm.

155
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,065
Will you do it? At 3:30am.

156
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:28,935
(Where's Ha Nee?)

157
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:34,406
(Approaching)

158
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:38,206
(What are you doing, Ha Nee?)

159
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:42,315
(Stretching before bed)

160
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:47,516
(Stretching)

161
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:55,896
(Ha Nee works hard to sleep well for a short time.)

162
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:00,266
Look. She's stretching.

163
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:02,595
She's very flexible.

164
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,075
(They met eyes.)

165
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:12,205
(You're amazing, Ha Nee.)

166
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:14,376
- She's something.
- She really is something.

167
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:16,175
(Stretching with Ha Nee)

168
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:18,315
We have to do this.

169
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:19,986
I do this every night.

170
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:23,555
Should I sleep with this tonight?

171
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:25,055
(Rummaging)

172
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:27,996
I take a drop of this before bed.

173
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:29,425
You drink it?

174
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:33,126
(What are you taking?)

175
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:34,335
(Ha Nee ate...)

176
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:35,595
Is there edible aroma oil?

177
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:38,935
There's an aroma oil that you can eat.

178
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:42,876
(He naturally takes the oil.)

179
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:44,646
Put your hand out.

180
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:46,845
- Like this?
- And put it on your neck.

181
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:48,675
(Giving a drop to the ones who aren't familiar with it)

182
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:51,146
Do you even know what you're doing? Is it lavender?

183
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:54,756
(Rubbing)

184
00:08:55,085 --> 00:09:00,386
(They'll get sound sleep, thanks to Ha Nee.)

185
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,555
- Do you want a sleep strip?
- The pillow is too big.

186
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:05,425
I wanted to try it.

187
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:06,425
Strip?

188
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:08,396
You attach it to your mouth...

189
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:11,805
to prevent yourself from breathing with your mouth.

190
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:14,506
This is new.

191
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,335
Like this?

192
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:20,105
- Yes, you put it on your mouth.
- That's it.

193
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:21,815
(Laughing)

194
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:23,246
Does this actually work?

195
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:24,516
(He's cute.)

196
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:25,786
- It feels nice, though.
- Does it?

197
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:27,986
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

198
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:30,215
(They finally go to bed after all the preparations.)

199
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:32,585
- Good night.
- Good night.

200
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,185
- Good night.
- Sleep tight, everyone.

201
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:36,026
(Good night, everyone.)

202
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:40,996
(Going to bed to wake up early in the morning)

203
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:44,435
(Snoring)

204
00:09:45,036 --> 00:09:48,975
(Hee Won starts snoring 5 seconds after lying down.)

205
00:09:48,975 --> 00:09:51,805
(Groaning)

206
00:09:53,945 --> 00:10:00,516
(The whole family falls asleep while listening to nature.)

207
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:08,695
(Will they be able to wake up after 3 hours of sleep?)

208
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:16,866
(Current time is 3:30am.)

209
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:21,506
(Hee Won's hand turning off the alarm)

210
00:10:22,506 --> 00:10:23,835
Are you up?

211
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:25,475
- Are you up?
- Yes.

212
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:26,475
What?

213
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:28,675
- Dong Il, we have to wake up.
- Okay.

214
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:32,416
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

215
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,845
What time is it?

216
00:10:35,855 --> 00:10:38,986
(Is it already time to get up?)

217
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:44,225
(Half asleep)

218
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:48,195
Should we bring some food?

219
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:49,796
(The eldest opens the fridge as soon as he gets up.)

220
00:10:50,036 --> 00:10:51,666
I'll pack some food, Dong Il.

221
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,065
- We have rice cakes.
- Right.

222
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:56,236
(Climbing down with her long legs)

223
00:10:56,506 --> 00:11:00,945
(He opens the door.)

224
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:05,146
(What's this sound?)

225
00:11:05,986 --> 00:11:08,016
Dong Il, the wind is strong. It's chilly.

226
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:09,416
Really?

227
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:17,156
(The unusual sound of the wind)

228
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:19,065
(The strong wind)

229
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:20,195
My goodness.

230
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:24,565
We might not be able to go there.

231
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:26,866
The wind is too strong. Do you think we can ride it?

232
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,475
(Worried)

233
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:30,575
Let's go and see how it goes.

234
00:11:30,575 --> 00:11:35,715
(The family members get ready to set off, feeling nervous.)

235
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:38,945
(She spreads the cloth...)

236
00:11:39,945 --> 00:11:43,116
(and packs the grape rice cake.)

237
00:11:43,455 --> 00:11:48,325
(Ha Nee has packed snacks in no time.)

238
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:50,855
(While the older members are busy, the youngest is...)

239
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:52,266
You're up?

240
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:53,965
I'm done.

241
00:11:54,266 --> 00:12:00,335
(Bed hair)

242
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:05,345
(He's wearing a hat using the window as a mirror.)

243
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:07,345
Should I wear this hat?

244
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:09,315
This one...

245
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:11,516
- or this one?
- That one.

246
00:12:12,246 --> 00:12:14,815
(He made a quick decision with Ha Nee's help.)

247
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:16,656
I need your help too.

248
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:18,955
Number one,

249
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:21,055
number two,

250
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,355
and number three.

251
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:24,595
(Generous Ha Nee brought many hats.)

252
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:27,465
(Thinking)

253
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:29,766
Is it difficult?

254
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:35,575
(I can't choose one.)

255
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:37,006
Should I wear all three at once?

256
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:41,215
Never mind. Let's just go.

257
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:45,715
(She gives up choosing one.)

258
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:48,455
We're packing things up at dawn.

259
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:50,416
It feels like we're doing a midnight flit.

260
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:52,925
It's like we've stolen the lodge money.

261
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:56,195
(Laughing)

262
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:57,455
It feels like we're doing a midnight flit.

263
00:12:57,455 --> 00:13:00,766
I couldn't find a paper bag.

264
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:03,195
- This looks cool.
- It looks cool, right?

265
00:13:04,195 --> 00:13:10,776
(He's driving with puffy eyes.)

266
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:13,546
- I really want to ride it.
- Me too.

267
00:13:14,406 --> 00:13:15,445
I mean it.

268
00:13:15,616 --> 00:13:19,916
(Will they be able to ride it with this wind?)

269
00:13:20,585 --> 00:13:22,016
Leaving at this hour feels like...

270
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:25,725
we're going on a family trip. A family trip.

271
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:27,055
(Taking the cobwebs out of their eyes,)

272
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:28,296
(they're going on a family trip at dawn.)

273
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:30,026
We're driving at dawn.

274
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:31,626
(They're on their way to ride a hot-air balloon with the house.)

275
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:33,565
(Humming)

276
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:36,636
(The House on Wheels is running through the darkness at dawn.)

277
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:39,065
(Buyeo, Yeongdong)

278
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:41,435
(Snoring)

279
00:13:41,435 --> 00:13:43,935
(Chuckling)

280
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:47,075
(While he's fallen asleep due to insufficient sleep last night,)

281
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:50,475
(the sun comes up from a distance.)

282
00:13:51,116 --> 00:13:52,945
(They watch the daybreak in a moving car for the first time.)

283
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:55,156
- Amazing.
- Goodness.

284
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:59,986
(They enjoy the calming moment of dawn as they woke up early.)

285
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:04,296
(After running for a long time while looking out the window,)

286
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:08,366
(they arrived at Buyeo where today's front yard is in.)

287
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:11,036
- This place is so cool.
- This is cool.

288
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:12,935
I really want to ride a hot-air balloon.

289
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,036
- You two haven't done it, right?
- I haven't.

290
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,906
I haven't done it either.

291
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:20,305
(They get excited as they're about to ride a hot-air balloon.)

292
00:14:20,305 --> 00:14:22,646
I'm a bit scared. How high will it go?

293
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:24,075
(Today's front yard, Baekma River Hot-Air Balloon Launch Site)

294
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:25,146
We're almost there.

295
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:26,715
(Exclaiming)

296
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:28,955
We're here.

297
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:32,156
I'll make sure you guys make unforgettable memories.

298
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:36,026
- Luckily, the wind isn't so strong.
- That's right, Dong Il.

299
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:38,166
(Luckily, the wind is calm in Buyeo.)

300
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,565
(They noticed hot-air balloons.)

301
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:45,935
- Is that it?
- My goodness.

302
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:49,475
- Gosh, that's huge.
- It really is, Dong Il.

303
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:50,636
(It's really huge!)

304
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:51,776
It's so big.

305
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:54,815
(They are surprised by the hot-air balloons.)

306
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:55,945
It's really big.

307
00:14:56,575 --> 00:15:01,215
(The balloon shows off its remarkable size.)

308
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:04,156
(You may not realize how big it is at a glance.)

309
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:05,955
Is there someone inside?

310
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:07,526
There's someone inside the balloon.

311
00:15:08,296 --> 00:15:09,455
It's really big.

312
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:10,695
(You look extremely small when you're inside the balloon.)

313
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:14,866
(When you compare it to people...)

314
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:16,835
(Enormous)

315
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:18,736
This is unbelievable, Dong Il.

316
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,376
This is no joke.

317
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:23,605
(It's so big that it turns everything into a miniature.)

318
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:25,046
We're going to ride this.

319
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:29,246
I'm so excited at this early hour.

320
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:30,546
(All excited)

321
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:32,016
I'm so excited.

322
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:33,815
(Her heart is already flying in the air.)

323
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:36,256
(She's so excited.)

324
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:39,055
(The hot-air balloon arrived at dawn for them.)

325
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:42,396
(They set down the huge basket...)

326
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:44,555
(and spread out the huge balloon.)

327
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:46,396
(Spreading)

328
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:49,496
(They're ready to fly the sky.)

329
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:53,335
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Hello.

330
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,675
How long will the flight take in this weather?

331
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:57,776
- About 40 minutes.
- It takes 40 minutes?

332
00:15:57,776 --> 00:15:59,246
(The expected flight time is 40 minutes.)

333
00:15:59,246 --> 00:16:00,276
Thank you.

334
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:03,075
My goodness, we're going to fly like that?

335
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:06,185
(Fire)

336
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,855
(Fierce)

337
00:16:09,455 --> 00:16:10,455
(Blazing)

338
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:12,225
(Startled)

339
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:13,786
Look at that fire. It's amazing.

340
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:15,526
(The brother and sister are poles apart.)

341
00:16:15,956 --> 00:16:17,296
(Fire!)

342
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:19,625
(Injecting a flame into the balloon)

343
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:26,436
(Gradually floating)

344
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:28,135
(Getting on)

345
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:29,276
It's floating.

346
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:31,546
(Now, they lift it manually.)

347
00:16:31,905 --> 00:16:33,276
(They gradually float upward.)

348
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:34,575
Look, they're going up.

349
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:36,246
(The hot-air balloons stand tall.)

350
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,845
Gosh, this is no joke.

351
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:39,585
- It goes up so fast.
- I know.

352
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:41,046
(The basket is about to float.)

353
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:43,486
- You can get on now.
- Already?

354
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:45,855
Step on here.

355
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:46,855
- Like this?
- Right.

356
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:48,226
On both sides.

357
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:51,256
(It goes down because of the weight.)

358
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:52,266
Get on, Dong Il.

359
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:55,496
Gosh, this is no joke.

360
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,105
(Grunting)

361
00:16:58,105 --> 00:16:59,665
(Welcome!)

362
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:01,065
(My goodness.)

363
00:17:01,206 --> 00:17:02,305
Now that we're on it...

364
00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:04,135
(The sound is more realistic when they get on the balloon.)

365
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:06,746
(They all boarded including the youngest.)

366
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:08,216
(Getting in)

367
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:09,615
(Stretching his arm)

368
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:11,645
(Startled)

369
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:13,446
(Startled)

370
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:16,115
(Grabbing)

371
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:20,155
How often do you inject the flame?

372
00:17:21,155 --> 00:17:22,655
We do this many times when we take off,

373
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:24,796
and about once a minute in the sky.

374
00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:26,625
- That's how often we inject it.
- I see.

375
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:30,436
(Intimidated)

376
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:34,436
(I'm scared.)

377
00:17:35,075 --> 00:17:36,105
Come here.

378
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:37,105
(Dong Il takes care of Hee Won.)

379
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:40,575
Gosh, Dong Il. The flame is so hot.

380
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:42,075
(It's hot.)

381
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:43,776
(He's trying to take off the camera.)

382
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:47,085
(Hesitating)

383
00:17:47,746 --> 00:17:48,956
(Like a mom)

384
00:17:48,956 --> 00:17:50,585
- It's hot.
- Thank you.

385
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:55,595
(Ha Nee takes good care of Myoung.)

386
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:57,956
(This time, Myoung is...)

387
00:17:57,956 --> 00:18:00,125
(Covering her with his hands)

388
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,966
Isn't it hot, Ha Nee?

389
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:03,736
Isn't it hot?

390
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:08,436
(The flame has become stronger than before.)

391
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:11,845
(Blazing)

392
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,506
Gosh, the flame has changed.

393
00:18:15,915 --> 00:18:19,286
(Heaving)

394
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:23,385
(Swaying)

395
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:25,885
It's going up.

396
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,486
(It's going up!)

397
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:30,996
(Swaying)

398
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:35,266
(It floated!)

399
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,266
It's going up.

400
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:38,805
(This is amazing!)

401
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:42,206
(Looking down)

402
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:47,506
(The hot-air balloon floated, carrying so many people.)

403
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:50,476
(Holding it)

404
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:54,085
(It flies as soon as he lets go of it.)

405
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,716
(Exclaiming)

406
00:18:58,115 --> 00:18:59,825
Bye!

407
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:02,655
(The basket is floating in the air.)

408
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:05,325
(Floating in the air)

409
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:07,966
- Bye!
- My goodness.

410
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:10,966
Say bye to them. Bye!

411
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:13,305
Bye!

412
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:18,446
(He's riding a balloon without a rope.)

413
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:20,805
See you.

414
00:19:20,805 --> 00:19:22,075
(Excited)

415
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:24,246
(Exclaiming)

416
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,446
It floated so fast.

417
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:27,216
(Surprised)

418
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:30,286
(It gradually floats, pushed by the wind.)

419
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:35,526
(Accelerating)

420
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:39,395
- This is fast.
- We're going 8km this way.

421
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:41,065
It's fast.

422
00:19:41,065 --> 00:19:43,236
- It's faster than I thought.
- The wind is rather strong today.

423
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:44,236
I see.

424
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:46,835
Gosh, this is fast.

425
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:48,405
- It's fast, right?
- Right.

426
00:19:49,176 --> 00:19:51,276
(The yard was within reach,)

427
00:19:51,276 --> 00:19:54,176
(but it has become distant in no time like magic.)

428
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:56,016
(The open sky appears before your eyes.)

429
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:57,345
We're flying in the air.

430
00:19:58,746 --> 00:20:02,585
(The front yard is far away.)

431
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:07,585
(It feels like the time has stopped as they go higher and higher.)

432
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:09,855
- My goodness.
- Gosh, it's so quiet here.

433
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,226
Right. It really is.

434
00:20:12,226 --> 00:20:14,625
It's so quiet up here.

435
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:16,966
It's nice.

436
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,835
(They look down at the scenery calmly.)

437
00:20:20,405 --> 00:20:22,335
- It's very tranquil.
- Right.

438
00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:23,835
(The tranquil view of Buyeo unfolds below the hot-air balloon.)

439
00:20:25,176 --> 00:20:26,746
So beautiful.

440
00:20:26,746 --> 00:20:28,246
(They admire the peaceful morning of Buyeo...)

441
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:31,845
(with their eyes and heart.)

442
00:20:32,385 --> 00:20:35,516
(The scenery suddenly turns into Baekma River.)

443
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:36,615
It looks completely different, right?

444
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:37,815
- Seriously.
- Right?

445
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:43,655
(An amazing experience of enjoying the view of winding Baekma River)

446
00:20:44,095 --> 00:20:45,696
We're flying in the air.

447
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,696
This is unbelievable.

448
00:20:48,696 --> 00:20:50,796
Gosh, this is so nice.

449
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:52,206
(As they fly in the air in silence,)

450
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:55,736
Gosh, I like this silence. It's so quiet.

451
00:20:55,736 --> 00:20:56,736
(it feels like their hearts are purified.)

452
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:59,145
(Since they're floating in the air...)

453
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:00,405
- By the way...
- What?

454
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:04,345
What if we fall on a vinyl greenhouse?

455
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:05,915
Fall...

456
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:07,746
(Fall?)

457
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:08,786
(Grabbing)

458
00:21:08,786 --> 00:21:09,855
Then we'll just fall.

459
00:21:10,256 --> 00:21:11,855
There's nothing we can do.

460
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:14,085
(Worried)

461
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:17,055
(Startled)

462
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:18,595
(What an unfortunate coincidence.)

463
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:19,796
I was startled.

464
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:21,595
(What an unfortunate coincidence.)

465
00:21:22,536 --> 00:21:23,536
Look at the sky.

466
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:25,835
We can open the lid like this.

467
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:28,706
(Opening the lid)

468
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:31,236
- There was a device like this.
- I see.

469
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:33,805
It allows cold air to escape, and the balloon descends.

470
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:35,345
(The balloon slowly descends as the cold air escapes.)

471
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:37,815
It doesn't fall more than 5m. It's very safe.

472
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:38,815
- The hot-air balloon?
- Goodness.

473
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:41,786
- It goes really smoothly.
- Right.

474
00:21:43,155 --> 00:21:45,085
Isn't that so pretty?

475
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:48,996
There was this animation called "Up".

476
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:51,125
- Right.
- It's like the one in the movie.

477
00:21:51,696 --> 00:21:53,095
It's "Up".

478
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:56,036
Gosh, it's so cute.

479
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:58,236
It's "Up".

480
00:21:58,236 --> 00:22:01,405
(They imagine flying with balloons on the House on Wheels.)

481
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:04,276
- It's so cute.
- It's cute.

482
00:22:04,276 --> 00:22:05,276
- Right?
- Yes.

483
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:07,845
This is like a dream.

484
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:08,946
- Right? Yes.
- You mean this place?

485
00:22:08,946 --> 00:22:10,315
(Flying over the front yard like a dream)

486
00:22:10,315 --> 00:22:12,716
- We're flying in the sky like this.
- I know.

487
00:22:13,585 --> 00:22:14,615
(A romantic morning where they fly over the front yard)

488
00:22:14,615 --> 00:22:15,915
This is really amazing.

489
00:22:16,516 --> 00:22:17,555
It really is.

490
00:22:18,055 --> 00:22:21,325
We will raise the altitude to 250m when we get to Mount Buso.

491
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:22,825
- Okay.
- Where? That mountain?

492
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,555
Yes. That's called Busosanseong Fortress.

493
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:25,625
(Will the hot-air balloon be able to fly over the mountain?)

494
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:26,895
That's where Nakhwaam is.

495
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:29,365
(They will fly over this mountain.)

496
00:22:30,236 --> 00:22:31,466
(Rustling)

497
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:32,936
- I see.
- This seems...

498
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:35,776
- What are you doing?
- Do you want some coffee?

499
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,405
- I'd love to have coffee.
- Iced coffee?

500
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:38,476
Thank you.

501
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:40,105
Here's tea for you, Hee Won.

502
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:41,276
- What's this? Is it tea?
- It's tea.

503
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:44,815
- Here's persimmon leaf tea for you.
- Righ, persimmon leaf tea.

504
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:47,686
Captain, have some rice cakes.

505
00:22:48,016 --> 00:22:49,055
- Have a piece of rice cake.
- Thank you.

506
00:22:49,055 --> 00:22:50,115
(Chuckling)

507
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:53,585
You want some too, Dong Il? I'll put it in your pocket, okay?

508
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:54,585
Thank you.

509
00:22:55,226 --> 00:22:59,966
(Thanks to Ha Nee, they have a snack time in the sky.)

510
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:04,796
(They have tea time while enjoying the morning breeze.)

511
00:23:05,766 --> 00:23:07,805
(Drinking the coffee in a gulp)

512
00:23:08,065 --> 00:23:09,436
(Drinking the tea in a gulp)

513
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,176
(The tea tastes amazing as they drink it in the sky.)

514
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:13,305
(Exclaiming)

515
00:23:14,405 --> 00:23:15,776
(Exclaiming)

516
00:23:15,776 --> 00:23:17,415
We're having rice cakes on a hot-air balloon.

517
00:23:18,686 --> 00:23:19,986
I love it.

518
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:23,815
- It feels like we're on a trip.
- Yes, right.

519
00:23:23,815 --> 00:23:25,786
This is how they travel in "Around the World in Eighty Days".

520
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:28,026
(A special snack time in the sky)

521
00:23:28,026 --> 00:23:30,756
- This is nice.
- It's nice.

522
00:23:31,756 --> 00:23:34,665
This is a comfortable and smooth flight.

523
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:36,395
- I know.
- Right.

524
00:23:37,736 --> 00:23:39,236
That must be a trail.

525
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:41,305
This place is called Busosanseong Fortress.

526
00:23:42,276 --> 00:23:44,476
Nakhwaam is here. You know the story of the court ladies, right?

527
00:23:44,575 --> 00:23:47,605
(They can see Nakhwaam beyond Mount Buso.)

528
00:23:47,605 --> 00:23:49,115
- It's a dignified place.
- Right.

529
00:23:49,115 --> 00:23:50,575
(They can see Nakhwaam beyond Mount Buso.)

530
00:23:50,845 --> 00:23:53,716
(He takes a photo, and she's amazed.)

531
00:23:54,615 --> 00:23:57,815
(He takes the last bite.)

532
00:23:58,055 --> 00:23:59,926
Stop eating and enjoy the view.

533
00:23:59,926 --> 00:24:01,125
(Stop eating and look at the mountains.)

534
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:05,226
- I'm seeing everything.
- Eating comes first.

535
00:24:06,496 --> 00:24:09,236
(She turns around.)

536
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:10,766
(Distant scenery below the mountains awaits her.)

537
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:13,605
I can see how fast we are going as I see the trees below.

538
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:15,776
I didn't have anything to compare to check the speed.

539
00:24:15,776 --> 00:24:18,605
- It's faster than expected.
- You're right, Dong Il.

540
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:21,446
- This is really fast.
- I can see it as I look down.

541
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:26,546
(The hot-air balloon gradually goes up.)

542
00:24:27,145 --> 00:24:30,655
It flies over the mountains following the ridge.

543
00:24:30,655 --> 00:24:32,456
(Will the hot-air balloon be able to fly over the mountains?)

544
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:35,026
(Blazing)

545
00:24:35,555 --> 00:24:36,926
Gosh, we're going up.

546
00:24:37,196 --> 00:24:39,665
(It's going up!)

547
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:44,766
(It goes up rapidly as the fire gets stronger.)

548
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:48,605
(Gosh, this is happening.)

549
00:24:48,605 --> 00:24:50,176
(Amazed)

550
00:24:50,676 --> 00:24:54,305
(The balloon flies over the mountains vigorously.)

551
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:57,776
(The balloon is showing up over the mountain.)

552
00:24:57,776 --> 00:24:58,915
It's rising up.

553
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,446
(It's rising up.)

554
00:25:01,115 --> 00:25:02,615
So this is how it goes up.

555
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:08,625
(They are close to being able to see beyond the mountains.)

556
00:25:09,196 --> 00:25:13,296
(The scenery beyond the mountains starts to show.)

557
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:17,895
(The balloon climbs up the mountain.)

558
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:21,236
(The balloon finally shows up.)

559
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:22,835
(The scenery beyond the mountains makes the family members amazed.)

560
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:24,206
- My goodness.
- Is this the whole view of Buyeo?

561
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:25,776
(The scenery beyond the mountains makes the family members amazed.)

562
00:25:26,006 --> 00:25:27,305
(Moving forward)

563
00:25:27,605 --> 00:25:29,976
(The whole view of Buyeo appears!)

564
00:25:29,976 --> 00:25:31,046
(A panoramic view)

565
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:32,145
This is incredible.

566
00:25:33,585 --> 00:25:35,046
(Buyeo is cozy and quaint as there are no high buildings.)

567
00:25:35,046 --> 00:25:36,585
This is so cool.

568
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:37,655
(Buyeo is cozy and quaint as there are no high buildings.)

569
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:40,526
(Ha Nee can't take eyes off the view that has completely changed.)

570
00:25:40,526 --> 00:25:41,526
Goodness.

571
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:45,095
(The view has changed as if they are in a different city.)

572
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:46,966
There's Five-story Stone Pagoda at Jeongnimsa Temple Site.

573
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:49,835
- There it is.
- I see.

574
00:25:49,835 --> 00:25:51,736
(Flying over Five-story Stone Pagoda at Jeongnimsa Temple Site)

575
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:54,036
- I can see it.
- Right.

576
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:56,176
There's the stone pagoda.

577
00:25:56,176 --> 00:25:57,736
(Where is it?)

578
00:25:57,835 --> 00:26:00,345
There it is. I can see it.

579
00:26:00,805 --> 00:26:02,746
Five-story Stone Pagoda at Jeongnimsa Temple Site. Gosh.

580
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:05,746
I can't believe I can see...

581
00:26:05,746 --> 00:26:07,186
Five-story Stone Pagoda at Jeongnimsa Temple Site from here.

582
00:26:07,345 --> 00:26:08,345
I know.

583
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:09,655
(Proud)

584
00:26:10,216 --> 00:26:12,325
Green trees,

585
00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:14,726
the tile roofs,

586
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:17,756
and the view of the city all go well together.

587
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:19,796
(With the Baekma River, they create a harmonious view.)

588
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:23,065
What else? Other famous sites...

589
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:24,696
besides Five-story Stone Pagoda at Jeongnimsa Temple Site.

590
00:26:24,796 --> 00:26:26,865
- What is that?
- That one is...

591
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:27,905
(I see.)

592
00:26:28,135 --> 00:26:29,706
What is Buyeo well-known for?

593
00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:32,446
That must be a bus terminal, right?

594
00:26:32,446 --> 00:26:35,476
- That's a market.
- A market, I see.

595
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:36,915
My goodness.

596
00:26:36,915 --> 00:26:38,946
(Doing Il is also happy to see her all excited.)

597
00:26:39,486 --> 00:26:41,915
- Don't they look like miniatures?
- I know.

598
00:26:41,915 --> 00:26:44,786
- Since we're watching it from here.
- Right, they look so tiny.

599
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:47,125
If we land near the roundabout,

600
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:50,595
we could be able to eat ordered food there.

601
00:26:50,595 --> 00:26:51,926
Don't you think so?

602
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:53,226
- Something like jjajangmyeon.
- Exactly.

603
00:26:53,226 --> 00:26:54,625
(Agreeing)

604
00:26:55,296 --> 00:26:57,696
It's different from seeing a view from an airplane.

605
00:26:57,696 --> 00:26:58,835
- It's totally different, right?
- Right.

606
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:01,036
It's so cute.

607
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:02,805
(He enjoys a cup of coffee against the city view background.)

608
00:27:02,805 --> 00:27:03,835
So this is how it feels.

609
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:04,936
(He enjoys a cup of coffee against the city view background.)

610
00:27:04,936 --> 00:27:05,946
This is amazing.

611
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:07,905
(I'm so happy.)

612
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:11,575
I got to enjoy this luxury with Myoung.

613
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,186
(Dozing off)

614
00:27:17,085 --> 00:27:20,926
(They had come a long way from dawn, rubbing their eyes.)

615
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:24,895
Since it's morning, we can hear birds chirping.

616
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,125
There are cars on their way to work.

617
00:27:28,766 --> 00:27:30,536
How cool.

618
00:27:31,796 --> 00:27:34,305
It doesn't have to be so bright as a sunrise. It's cloudy,

619
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:36,305
- but it's still great.
- Right.

620
00:27:37,276 --> 00:27:38,276
(The youngest has been holding the camera all day.)

621
00:27:38,276 --> 00:27:39,305
It's so nice.

622
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:40,605
(The youngest has been holding the camera all day.)

623
00:27:41,345 --> 00:27:43,016
Gosh, it's beautiful down there.

624
00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:44,145
(The sceneries that he wants to remember for a long time)

625
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:47,746
(Taking a photo of the amicable members)

626
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:49,815
What can you see?

627
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:52,526
(He also takes a photo of Ha Nee who has come a long way for him.)

628
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:58,426
(A precious moment with the family)

629
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:01,696
(The world of miniatures that Ha Nee liked)

630
00:28:02,296 --> 00:28:05,165
(Their unforgettable morning in the sky)

631
00:28:05,706 --> 00:28:06,766
(Pulling the rope)

632
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:09,206
- He's changing something.
- I'm changing the direction.

633
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:10,276
The direction.

634
00:28:11,305 --> 00:28:12,345
(The hot-air balloon rotates as he pulls the rope.)

635
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:15,375
- It's changing.
- Only the direction. It's rotating.

636
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:18,315
(Perfect rotation)

637
00:28:18,315 --> 00:28:19,746
- There's a way to do it.
- I see.

638
00:28:19,885 --> 00:28:20,946
- My goodness.
- So...

639
00:28:21,986 --> 00:28:24,915
The landing zone is over there.

640
00:28:24,915 --> 00:28:26,026
(Rotating in the direction of the landing zone)

641
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:27,956
That circular area?

642
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,196
At the end over there. The lawn in front of the red bridge.

643
00:28:30,595 --> 00:28:32,325
Oh, over there?

644
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:34,466
(Will they be able to land on there?)

645
00:28:34,966 --> 00:28:38,135
It feels like the time flew.

646
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:39,635
I know. Forty minutes were too short.

647
00:28:41,206 --> 00:28:42,976
- It's getting faster.
- Right.

648
00:28:43,736 --> 00:28:44,736
Goodness.

649
00:28:44,736 --> 00:28:46,875
(Without knowing their lingering feelings,)

650
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,476
We're descending so fast.

651
00:28:50,246 --> 00:28:51,645
(the balloon is approaching the ground fast.)

652
00:28:51,645 --> 00:28:52,645
Seriously.

653
00:28:53,946 --> 00:28:55,585
It's as if someone is pulling us...

654
00:28:55,585 --> 00:28:58,016
- from down there.
- Right.

655
00:28:58,986 --> 00:29:00,855
What is that? Look at those birds.

656
00:29:01,885 --> 00:29:04,726
(The birds have been waiting for them as if to console them.)

657
00:29:05,095 --> 00:29:07,165
It's like they're saying, "Here they come again."

658
00:29:07,165 --> 00:29:08,526
(The birds fly away after greeting them.)

659
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:11,266
Goodness, they're so cute.

660
00:29:12,206 --> 00:29:15,536
(Bye, birds.)

661
00:29:16,536 --> 00:29:18,875
- Gosh, the smell of flowers.
- I can smell flowers.

662
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,006
Right.

663
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:23,046
I can still smell the grass since it's morning.

664
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:25,815
(Looking around)

665
00:29:26,486 --> 00:29:28,085
We're about to touch the ground.

666
00:29:29,756 --> 00:29:33,085
- It feels like we're about to land.
- Right, it feels like that.

667
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:34,456
(Hedgehopping)

668
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:36,456
Bend your knees slightly.

669
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:42,496
(Landing lightly)

670
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:46,766
(The ASMR of running through the grass)

671
00:29:47,305 --> 00:29:50,805
(They land as if sailing on the waves of grass.)

672
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,605
This is how it lands.

673
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:57,875
Landing!

674
00:29:57,875 --> 00:30:00,446
(Decelerating over the grass)

675
00:30:01,286 --> 00:30:03,956
Gosh, this is how it lands.

676
00:30:03,956 --> 00:30:05,016
That's right.

677
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:06,055
Hold on a second.

678
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,726
(Adventure)

679
00:30:07,726 --> 00:30:09,155
(They arrived!)

680
00:30:09,456 --> 00:30:11,956
- We're here.
- My goodness.

681
00:30:11,956 --> 00:30:14,365
- Wait. You can't get out yet.
- I see.

682
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:15,696
You have to stay in there for a while.

683
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:16,865
I see. The ceiling?

684
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:19,835
We have to wait until it's folded.

685
00:30:20,135 --> 00:30:21,405
- Otherwise, it will be dragged.
- That's right.

686
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:23,676
(Deflating)

687
00:30:23,676 --> 00:30:25,276
Gosh, it's completely open.

688
00:30:25,276 --> 00:30:27,075
(Deflating)

689
00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:29,776
- It shrinks right away.
- I know.

690
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:33,315
(The balloon deflates in no time.)

691
00:30:33,315 --> 00:30:34,716
This is amazing.

692
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:37,055
- Applaud. We survived.
- Great.

693
00:30:37,615 --> 00:30:40,585
- We made it.
- We made it.

694
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:44,526
- Thanks to you, - It's so...

695
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,565
- I got to enjoy such luxury.
- Isn't it nice?

696
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:50,296
It's nice to ride a hot-air balloon as part of your morning walk.

697
00:30:50,736 --> 00:30:52,335
It's only 7:30am right now.

698
00:30:52,335 --> 00:30:53,605
(After a walk in the sky, they're going back home!)

699
00:30:54,706 --> 00:30:56,905
(They came back to the front yard after a long morning walk.)

700
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:59,546
Our house is still there.

701
00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:01,345
It looks amazing.

702
00:31:01,575 --> 00:31:03,746
(Shaking)

703
00:31:03,746 --> 00:31:06,016
(Exclaiming)

704
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:07,885
Since when did this place become a jungle?

705
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:10,186
Seriously.

706
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:13,756
That green field

707
00:31:14,385 --> 00:31:16,196
Let's build a picturesque house

708
00:31:16,196 --> 00:31:17,196
(A picturesque front yard, Baekma River Hot-Air Balloon Launch Site)

709
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:23,736
(There are no buildings or mountains near the Baekma River.)

710
00:31:24,496 --> 00:31:28,506
(It's the only way you can travel in the sky without any lines.)

711
00:31:29,036 --> 00:31:31,706
(The balloon takes off from the front yard.)

712
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:36,075
(It travels above the front yard or Baekma River at times.)

713
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:40,085
(The scenery below changes every time.)

714
00:31:40,546 --> 00:31:44,915
(It gives you a panoramic view of Buyeo.)

715
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:50,895
(Today's front yard makes a scenery from a fairy tale become a reality.)

716
00:31:51,655 --> 00:31:55,696
(Now, this is Baekma River Hot-Air Balloon Launch Site.)

717
00:31:56,895 --> 00:31:58,536
(They got back home, passing through the jungle.)

718
00:31:58,536 --> 00:31:59,766
It's like a jungle.

719
00:32:00,006 --> 00:32:01,065
Seriously.

720
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:02,706
(Finally experiencing the wildness of the front yard)

721
00:32:02,706 --> 00:32:04,605
Since when did this place become a jungle?

722
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:07,875
- It is still here.
- It is.

723
00:32:08,145 --> 00:32:09,415
Okay.

724
00:32:09,615 --> 00:32:12,115
The sunlight is too good to be true.

725
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,315
- We need to work on the tapa.
- We do.

726
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:18,786
It'll be more convenient to place the deck first.

727
00:32:19,085 --> 00:32:22,055
(Myoung strides into the house.)

728
00:32:23,756 --> 00:32:26,565
(Preparing gloves)

729
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:27,865
Okay.

730
00:32:28,296 --> 00:32:29,436
Our guest should stay inside.

731
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:30,936
Dong Il.

732
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:32,936
- Please go inside.
- Don't make me a stranger.

733
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,165
- Please.
- No, it's fine.

734
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:36,176
You must be tired from the flight.

735
00:32:38,605 --> 00:32:40,805
Should I set everything up for us to drink tea?

736
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:42,915
- Sure. That sounds good.
- Yes.

737
00:32:45,315 --> 00:32:48,746
(Let's have quick tea time.)

738
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:52,256
(Wait, this doesn't seem like it's going to be quick.)

739
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:56,696
(She is carrying three bags.)

740
00:32:57,825 --> 00:33:00,365
I have so many things.

741
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:05,565
Mulberry leaf tea, mulberry leaf tea

742
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:09,105
(Working hard)

743
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:12,305
Hey, brother.

744
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,676
(He can't hear her.)

745
00:33:15,105 --> 00:33:16,145
How cute.

746
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:23,085
(She's suddenly burning an incense stick?)

747
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:32,056
(Setting up the tea with a wholesome mind)

748
00:33:32,696 --> 00:33:35,835
(She starts preparing with self-made background music.)

749
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:41,906
(Things keep coming out from the magical bag.)

750
00:33:42,636 --> 00:33:46,176
(What she prepares in such a mysterious way is...)

751
00:33:46,705 --> 00:33:49,676
(a tea ceremony.)

752
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:57,085
(Ha Nee meditates regularly by holding tea ceremonies.)

753
00:33:58,656 --> 00:34:03,495
(She regularly relaxes with a cup of tea.)

754
00:34:04,696 --> 00:34:07,366
(Ha Nee wants to share the moment with the House on Wheels family.)

755
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:10,236
Let's go inside first.

756
00:34:10,236 --> 00:34:11,696
(Those who are done setting things up in the front yard go inside too.)

757
00:34:12,395 --> 00:34:14,105
It smells great.

758
00:34:14,105 --> 00:34:15,366
Smell it.

759
00:34:16,205 --> 00:34:17,906
Please smell the scent.

760
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:21,576
(Ha Nee is treating us to some nice things.)

761
00:34:22,515 --> 00:34:25,076
Are there flowers here?

762
00:34:25,886 --> 00:34:27,546
- Flowers?
- Flowers?

763
00:34:27,546 --> 00:34:28,546
(Flowers?)

764
00:34:28,685 --> 00:34:30,285
I want to put a flower here.

765
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:31,355
But you are the flower.

766
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:34,955
(You are the flower.)

767
00:34:35,386 --> 00:34:36,395
That's right.

768
00:34:36,395 --> 00:34:37,926
(Oh, my goodness.)

769
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,995
Honey!

770
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,535
- What?
- Is that what husbands say?

771
00:34:43,535 --> 00:34:45,136
What? Do you need me?

772
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:49,306
(Until yesterday,)

773
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:53,006
(the husband was very manly.)

774
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:57,475
(Shy)

775
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:00,915
(Today, he can't even make eye contact with her.)

776
00:35:01,285 --> 00:35:04,315
(Too shy)

777
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:07,656
- My sister-in-law, see you later.
- Okay.

778
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:09,926
(The son subs in for the shy husband.)

779
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:13,765
(Along the calm stream of the Baekma River,)

780
00:35:14,565 --> 00:35:17,196
(the front yard is filled with grass and flowers.)

781
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:21,966
I need just one flower for the tea ceremony.

782
00:35:21,966 --> 00:35:24,236
(The two roam around the front yard.)

783
00:35:24,236 --> 00:35:26,576
- Isn't it so pretty?
- It's so nice with the wind too.

784
00:35:26,576 --> 00:35:28,145
(Autumn flowers can be seen in the backyard.)

785
00:35:29,776 --> 00:35:31,216
This looks so pretty.

786
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:32,245
(She found flowers she likes.)

787
00:35:32,785 --> 00:35:33,986
(Cute and sweet wildflowers)

788
00:35:33,986 --> 00:35:35,645
I love the buds.

789
00:35:36,616 --> 00:35:39,085
(She sits down to take a closer look.)

790
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:41,386
You can't find these in flower shops.

791
00:35:41,386 --> 00:35:44,326
They aren't too fancy, but they feel so precious.

792
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:46,426
What should I do?

793
00:35:46,426 --> 00:35:48,895
(Is there any flower that fell?)

794
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:51,035
(Looking around)

795
00:35:52,136 --> 00:35:53,165
Should I use this?

796
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:55,406
We should use that.

797
00:35:55,406 --> 00:35:56,636
(They decided to take the small flower on the ground.)

798
00:35:57,835 --> 00:35:58,875
So precious.

799
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:04,446
(With the flower that will make the time even more fragrant,)

800
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:08,116
(the tea ceremony is ready.)

801
00:36:09,256 --> 00:36:11,556
Since I'm the person brewing the tea, I'll sit in the center.

802
00:36:11,556 --> 00:36:13,625
You must sit in the center no matter what.

803
00:36:14,026 --> 00:36:16,556
I never imagined I'd be doing this.

804
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,796
Please be easy on me since this won't be too formal.

805
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:23,065
I haven't even seen the informal version.

806
00:36:23,065 --> 00:36:24,366
(Don't be under pressure.)

807
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:26,466
(Feeling better with her husband's support)

808
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:28,535
It's so small and cute.

809
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:30,835
This is the best of small and cute things.

810
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:33,205
- I can see all the care.
- Yes.

811
00:36:33,806 --> 00:36:35,076
This is amazing.

812
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:36,076
(Ha Nee brought all of the teacups she uses regularly.)

813
00:36:36,076 --> 00:36:37,116
This looks great.

814
00:36:37,116 --> 00:36:38,576
(Ha Nee brought all of the teacups she uses regularly.)

815
00:36:39,585 --> 00:36:40,915
Let's do this.

816
00:36:41,486 --> 00:36:43,915
That isn't for that.

817
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:46,426
- It's for the small table.
- Oh, this?

818
00:36:46,426 --> 00:36:48,986
(Confused)

819
00:36:48,986 --> 00:36:51,926
- You must use it for this.
- Is that so?

820
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:53,225
That's how it's used.

821
00:36:53,225 --> 00:36:54,926
(He is cute.)

822
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:56,935
There are some things he doesn't know.

823
00:36:58,165 --> 00:36:59,935
(I'm new to tea ceremonies.)

824
00:36:59,935 --> 00:37:00,935
You can try it with me.

825
00:37:01,665 --> 00:37:05,105
I'm wondering what this is.

826
00:37:05,946 --> 00:37:07,475
(Ringing)

827
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:10,515
I really did think it was a bell.

828
00:37:10,515 --> 00:37:12,216
- Really?
- I'm not kidding.

829
00:37:12,546 --> 00:37:15,285
Also, there is something called a tea buddy.

830
00:37:15,285 --> 00:37:18,085
It's myself. I was born in the Year of the Pig.

831
00:37:18,785 --> 00:37:21,125
- It also has "Lee" on it.
- It really is you.

832
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,125
So, like this.

833
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,826
Sometimes, I just put it there...

834
00:37:23,826 --> 00:37:26,096
and drink tea just with it when I'm alone.

835
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:27,125
(Let's enjoy some tea.)

836
00:37:27,665 --> 00:37:30,035
I would pour hot water over it.

837
00:37:30,035 --> 00:37:31,035
Then, I'd say, "Hot, right?"

838
00:37:32,136 --> 00:37:33,205
(Laughing)

839
00:37:36,835 --> 00:37:38,205
Let's get started.

840
00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:40,375
(Ha Nee's tea ceremony class)

841
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,705
This is it.

842
00:37:41,705 --> 00:37:44,616
(I'm so curious to see how it's done.)

843
00:37:45,616 --> 00:37:49,815
(You must first put the tea leaves in a teapot.)

844
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:56,125
(Then pour hot water over it to wash the tea leaves.)

845
00:37:56,355 --> 00:38:00,495
This is to wash the tea leaves.

846
00:38:00,725 --> 00:38:02,495
So much care goes into this.

847
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:04,935
(The first set of water...)

848
00:38:04,935 --> 00:38:07,205
(is for washing the leaves and heating the cups.)

849
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:09,236
That's nice.

850
00:38:09,236 --> 00:38:12,946
(Pouring it without drinking it)

851
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:15,475
(This takes so much care.)

852
00:38:16,145 --> 00:38:18,346
(Now, the second serving of water is for drinking tea.)

853
00:38:18,346 --> 00:38:19,745
This should taste good.

854
00:38:20,986 --> 00:38:23,815
You must be patient when brewing tea.

855
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:24,886
Right.

856
00:38:25,056 --> 00:38:26,185
Which tea is it?

857
00:38:26,285 --> 00:38:28,285
- It's called sejak green tea.
- Sejak?

858
00:38:28,285 --> 00:38:29,285
These are new leaves.

859
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:32,225
- These are the first leaves...
- It means "new".

860
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:34,366
that sprout in April.

861
00:38:34,366 --> 00:38:35,426
Is it really?

862
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:38,165
They are the first leaves...

863
00:38:38,165 --> 00:38:39,906
that sprout that year.

864
00:38:39,906 --> 00:38:40,935
(Green tea that resembles spring)

865
00:38:42,136 --> 00:38:45,676
(It's sejak green tea with new and delicate leaves.)

866
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:49,576
If you drink the tea, I'll refill your cup when it's empty.

867
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:50,645
- You will keep doing that?
- Yes.

868
00:38:50,915 --> 00:38:52,475
I don't have to save up on it, then?

869
00:38:52,475 --> 00:38:53,815
There is no need to do that.

870
00:38:53,815 --> 00:38:56,156
I brought a lot of tea with me.

871
00:38:59,785 --> 00:39:02,285
- Should I pray before I drink it?
- No.

872
00:39:02,285 --> 00:39:03,326
(Should I pray before I drink it?)

873
00:39:03,995 --> 00:39:06,526
People don't clink the cups, right?

874
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:09,495
We can do that. Who cares?

875
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:11,866
- I just wanted to do it.
- Me too.

876
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,736
Let's clink our teacups.

877
00:39:13,736 --> 00:39:15,466
- Cheers.
- But are we really...

878
00:39:15,806 --> 00:39:18,076
- Cheers.
- doing cheers with this?

879
00:39:18,076 --> 00:39:19,906
(This is so funny.)

880
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,216
(Blowing on it)

881
00:39:23,846 --> 00:39:26,846
(Sipping little at a time since it's hot)

882
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:28,145
(Exclaiming)

883
00:39:29,616 --> 00:39:32,785
(Hee Won also tries a sip of the sejak green tea.)

884
00:39:32,926 --> 00:39:35,056
(Proud and happy)

885
00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:36,725
(Let me try.)

886
00:39:36,725 --> 00:39:39,296
If it's too bitter...

887
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,225
What do you do if you can't hold it because it's too hot?

888
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:43,696
What do you do if you can't hold it because it's too hot?

889
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:45,665
Please cool it a little bit.

890
00:39:45,665 --> 00:39:47,366
(A wise answer to a silly question)

891
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:49,435
- That's why you need the saucer.
- I see.

892
00:39:49,435 --> 00:39:50,875
- You can use it.
- I see.

893
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:54,145
(Sipping again)

894
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,776
(Will it suit his palate?)

895
00:39:57,716 --> 00:39:59,745
- It's very smooth.
- It is, right?

896
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:00,815
Yes.

897
00:40:03,585 --> 00:40:05,486
- It must be green tea.
- It is.

898
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,256
- It's green tea.
- That's exactly it.

899
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:09,995
- It's green tea with new leaves.
- That's right.

900
00:40:10,196 --> 00:40:13,265
It helps with blood circulation...

901
00:40:13,826 --> 00:40:14,826
and warms up your body.

902
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:16,935
(This tea fills up your body with fresh energy.)

903
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:22,466
(Melting away the fatigue)

904
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,406
Let's move on to jaekseol black tea.

905
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:28,676
- Jaekseol black tea?
- Jaekseol black tea.

906
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:30,815
Jakseol tea?

907
00:40:30,815 --> 00:40:33,116
- Jaekseol black tea.
- Jakseol?

908
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:35,046
- Jaekseol black tea.
- Jakseol.

909
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:36,415
(It has a strange name.)

910
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:39,656
It's also known as gobbul tea.

911
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:44,526
When grandchildren have a cold, grandmothers give it to them.

912
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:46,466
"Gobbul" means a cold in pure Korean.

913
00:40:46,466 --> 00:40:48,426
- Yes, that's correct.
- You meant that word gobbul, right?

914
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:50,565
(Tasting a little bit)

915
00:40:50,565 --> 00:40:53,506
This isn't really... Gosh, this jaekseol black tea.

916
00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:56,205
- It's great. You all should try it.
- I'm curious.

917
00:40:56,435 --> 00:40:58,535
- Can I finish it in one go?
- Yes, you can.

918
00:40:58,535 --> 00:41:00,605
(Bottoms up.)

919
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:03,145
- A cup of jaekseol tea, please.
- Of course.

920
00:41:04,415 --> 00:41:06,915
- Look at the color.
- It's the color of jaekseol tea.

921
00:41:07,685 --> 00:41:12,015
(Jaekseol black tea in the yellow pumpkin color)

922
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:15,826
(This time, he doesn't forget to smell it first.)

923
00:41:15,826 --> 00:41:18,056
I think this is more delicate.

924
00:41:19,256 --> 00:41:21,565
- It tastes completely different.
- Yes, right?

925
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:24,665
- It's like black tea, right?
- Yes, black tea.

926
00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:28,765
(Sejak green tea has the most authentic green tea taste.)

927
00:41:29,065 --> 00:41:31,076
Jaekseol black tea is fermented tea.

928
00:41:31,676 --> 00:41:33,006
So it eases your stomach.

929
00:41:33,006 --> 00:41:34,576
(Jaekseol, traditional Korean tea, is made of fermented green tea.)

930
00:41:36,475 --> 00:41:40,716
(It tastes earthy and nutty at first and it finishes with a sweet taste.)

931
00:41:41,116 --> 00:41:43,185
- The taste is quite delicate.
- Yes.

932
00:41:43,185 --> 00:41:44,355
(The scent of delicate jaekseol black tea...)

933
00:41:44,355 --> 00:41:47,785
(goes perfect with the fall season.)

934
00:41:48,685 --> 00:41:50,355
(Earthy and aromatic)

935
00:41:50,355 --> 00:41:53,225
Gosh, it's excellent. I love this tea.

936
00:41:53,495 --> 00:41:54,526
I'm glad.

937
00:41:54,526 --> 00:41:55,796
(Thanks to Ha Nee, I found the tea I love.)

938
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,995
Seriously, I love it so much.

939
00:41:57,995 --> 00:41:59,495
(The tea host is delighted.)

940
00:42:00,506 --> 00:42:02,435
Since when were you interested in tea?

941
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:08,276
I didn't feel well five years ago. My health completely went downhill.

942
00:42:08,475 --> 00:42:10,815
I had never thought that I would feel unwell like that.

943
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,846
I was really shocked and flustered.

944
00:42:14,085 --> 00:42:17,955
I felt so sad that I cried a lot.

945
00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:20,225
Then I got to know about tea.

946
00:42:20,225 --> 00:42:23,596
- It totally improved my health.
- Did anyone recommend it to you?

947
00:42:23,596 --> 00:42:26,326
- Or you found it by yourself?
- By myself.

948
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:27,326
(No wonder she's drawn to tea.)

949
00:42:27,326 --> 00:42:28,895
So do you drink tea alone at home as well?

950
00:42:28,895 --> 00:42:30,395
Yes, I like it.

951
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:34,065
I just love tea so much.

952
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:35,966
(Here's how much she loves tea.)

953
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,875
It's so refreshing. Try it.

954
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:41,676
It tastes like a chestnut-flavored ice cream.

955
00:42:41,676 --> 00:42:43,846
- Yes, I agree.
- A chestnut-flavored ice cream.

956
00:42:43,846 --> 00:42:46,145
(She doesn't even think of stopping until she finishes the whole cup.)

957
00:42:46,145 --> 00:42:48,216
It'd be better if it's frozen a bit.

958
00:42:48,216 --> 00:42:49,585
- Yes, a little bit.
- Gosh.

959
00:42:50,116 --> 00:42:52,156
It'd be better if it's put in the freezer a bit.

960
00:42:52,156 --> 00:42:53,326
Yes, a little bit.

961
00:42:54,386 --> 00:42:57,355
And it's not even too sweet. It's perfect.

962
00:42:57,355 --> 00:42:59,296
- Try it.
- It's delicious.

963
00:42:59,296 --> 00:43:00,565
The natural sweetness from nature.

964
00:43:00,565 --> 00:43:01,565
(I will drink it to the last drop.)

965
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:04,966
(My goodness. It tastes remarkable.)

966
00:43:05,736 --> 00:43:08,705
I think it will also go well with jellies.

967
00:43:08,705 --> 00:43:10,105
No doubt.

968
00:43:10,105 --> 00:43:11,806
Myoung, which jelly would you like?

969
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:12,835
(A quick glance)

970
00:43:12,835 --> 00:43:14,576
Myoung, which jelly would you like?

971
00:43:16,745 --> 00:43:19,645
(Yesterday, Ha Nee brought jellies as a housewarming present.)

972
00:43:20,386 --> 00:43:24,756
(He started to gobble and quickly finished them.)

973
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:26,855
(Kim Hee Won, how could you...)

974
00:43:27,156 --> 00:43:30,096
(Hey, we ate a little to save them for later.)

975
00:43:30,096 --> 00:43:32,026
Myoung, which jelly would you like?

976
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,966
I'll try the walnut jelly, please.

977
00:43:34,966 --> 00:43:37,265
A walnut jelly. Here you go.

978
00:43:37,265 --> 00:43:38,265
Thank you.

979
00:43:38,565 --> 00:43:40,705
I'll go for the black sesame jelly.

980
00:43:40,705 --> 00:43:41,806
(I'll try the black sesame jelly.)

981
00:43:41,806 --> 00:43:43,535
- Gosh, you chose a good one.
- Yes, of course.

982
00:43:43,535 --> 00:43:45,006
(He can't say he wants one,)

983
00:43:45,006 --> 00:43:46,406
(and he's quietly eating only the rice cake.)

984
00:43:46,645 --> 00:43:47,946
(He's so eager to tease Hee Won.)

985
00:43:47,946 --> 00:43:48,946
It's delicious.

986
00:43:49,605 --> 00:43:52,745
Goodness, look at the walnut jelly. Look how much walnut is in it.

987
00:43:52,745 --> 00:43:54,285
(Goodness, look at the walnut jelly.)

988
00:43:55,015 --> 00:43:56,955
Show that to Hee Won. Hee Won, look at that.

989
00:43:56,955 --> 00:44:01,685
Come on, just give one to him. Why are you teasing him so much?

990
00:44:02,156 --> 00:44:05,326
When it comes to food, you shouldn't even tease a puppy, okay?

991
00:44:05,326 --> 00:44:06,625
What's the matter with you?

992
00:44:06,796 --> 00:44:08,265
How old are you to tease him like that?

993
00:44:08,265 --> 00:44:09,995
- Seriously, you're a grown-up.
- My age doesn't matter.

994
00:44:09,995 --> 00:44:11,196
What are you, five?

995
00:44:11,196 --> 00:44:12,796
Okay, you can pick...

996
00:44:12,796 --> 00:44:13,935
(Was I too mean?)

997
00:44:14,205 --> 00:44:15,506
a jelly you want.

998
00:44:15,506 --> 00:44:16,636
(You can pick a jelly you want.)

999
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:19,375
(Thinking a bit)

1000
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,475
I'm okay.

1001
00:44:21,475 --> 00:44:23,616
Come on, he's upset.

1002
00:44:23,616 --> 00:44:25,846
You should've given him before.

1003
00:44:26,386 --> 00:44:28,046
- Who's upset? I'm not upset at all.
- Come on.

1004
00:44:28,386 --> 00:44:30,785
Gosh, he's small-minded.

1005
00:44:33,656 --> 00:44:36,796
Okay, stop. Stop fighting.

1006
00:44:38,026 --> 00:44:40,296
(All right, Ha Nee.)

1007
00:44:41,466 --> 00:44:44,096
Would you like to try holding a hug bowl?

1008
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:47,006
- What's a hug bowl?
- It is...

1009
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,335
You can pick a bowl you like.

1010
00:44:50,335 --> 00:44:53,645
You can try to hold them...

1011
00:44:53,645 --> 00:44:55,006
and pick the one that you think will embrace you.

1012
00:44:55,006 --> 00:44:56,245
That's why it's named a hug bowl.

1013
00:44:56,245 --> 00:44:58,375
(A hug bowl with tea should be held with both hands.)

1014
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,116
I like this texture.

1015
00:45:02,386 --> 00:45:04,785
So you feel the warmth when the tea is inside.

1016
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:05,855
Yes, that's right.

1017
00:45:05,855 --> 00:45:06,926
(Holding it with both hands)

1018
00:45:06,926 --> 00:45:07,955
Like this.

1019
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:11,455
I like the shape. The shape I can feel with my hands.

1020
00:45:11,955 --> 00:45:14,765
(Hee Won picks one carefully.)

1021
00:45:15,065 --> 00:45:18,495
(Rubbing)

1022
00:45:18,835 --> 00:45:21,435
(I pick you.)

1023
00:45:21,435 --> 00:45:23,276
It feels like soil.

1024
00:45:23,276 --> 00:45:24,776
Yes, I hear you.

1025
00:45:24,776 --> 00:45:26,605
(Wait. Somehow it looks like...)

1026
00:45:26,605 --> 00:45:29,506
I'd like to have beef soup in this bowl.

1027
00:45:29,506 --> 00:45:31,346
(It's perfect for beef soup.)

1028
00:45:32,645 --> 00:45:33,685
Or mushroom soup.

1029
00:45:33,685 --> 00:45:35,446
It will taste better in this bowl, right?

1030
00:45:35,446 --> 00:45:36,656
Aren't I right?

1031
00:45:36,656 --> 00:45:37,955
You can drink it from the bowl.

1032
00:45:37,955 --> 00:45:38,986
(Slurping)

1033
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,455
The bowl is so pretty, and...

1034
00:45:40,455 --> 00:45:42,285
- Yes, I feel you.
- Yes.

1035
00:45:42,685 --> 00:45:43,895
So what do we do with it again?

1036
00:45:43,895 --> 00:45:45,796
I'll make a magnolia flower tea.

1037
00:45:45,796 --> 00:45:47,366
This is what I often do when I want to space out.

1038
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:49,995
- With a flower.
- Yes, the flower blooms in tea.

1039
00:45:50,366 --> 00:45:54,006
You know, magnolias bloom in May in Korea.

1040
00:45:54,506 --> 00:45:57,676
(They'll enjoy the flower tea in a hug bowl.)

1041
00:45:57,676 --> 00:45:59,776
It helps when you feel depressed...

1042
00:45:59,776 --> 00:46:01,906
- Then I should drink it every day.
- or when you feel blue.

1043
00:46:02,306 --> 00:46:04,815
Like some people who drink alcohol every day.

1044
00:46:04,815 --> 00:46:06,046
Then I need to drink it every day.

1045
00:46:07,245 --> 00:46:08,546
- It doesn't need to be boiled more?
- Okay, it's going in.

1046
00:46:08,886 --> 00:46:11,285
- I like what you said now.
- Yes.

1047
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:13,986
- You can leave it for a while.
- It starts to bloom.

1048
00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:16,596
(As the magnolia blooms...)

1049
00:46:16,596 --> 00:46:19,926
When white magnolias bloom

1050
00:46:19,926 --> 00:46:22,895
(The tea is beautifully brewed in the yellow color.)

1051
00:46:23,966 --> 00:46:27,506
(The flower and tea look different in different bowls.)

1052
00:46:31,076 --> 00:46:32,676
- It's smooth.
- It is...

1053
00:46:32,676 --> 00:46:34,576
(The deep scent of magnolia and the smooth taste)

1054
00:46:34,576 --> 00:46:38,475
You can look at the flower while you turn the bowl like this.

1055
00:46:38,475 --> 00:46:39,515
All right.

1056
00:46:39,515 --> 00:46:41,745
- It's perfect for alone time.
- Exactly.

1057
00:46:42,616 --> 00:46:44,756
I'm looking at the flower and...

1058
00:46:44,756 --> 00:46:46,826
(As he looks at the magnolia in full bloom,)

1059
00:46:46,826 --> 00:46:48,386
- I really like it.
- The flower's in full bloom...

1060
00:46:48,386 --> 00:46:49,685
like my wife.

1061
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:51,196
What does it remind you of?

1062
00:46:51,196 --> 00:46:52,326
What does it remind you of?

1063
00:46:52,326 --> 00:46:53,966
(There he goes again. He's teasing him again.)

1064
00:46:54,165 --> 00:46:56,696
As I look at it in full bloom, it reminds me of my wife too.

1065
00:46:56,696 --> 00:46:58,366
(I can see my wife who is beautiful like a flower.)

1066
00:46:58,466 --> 00:47:00,236
It reminds me of my wife too.

1067
00:47:02,136 --> 00:47:04,276
- Gosh, my wife is already here.
- Is that right?

1068
00:47:04,276 --> 00:47:05,605
(Here come the lovebirds again.)

1069
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,006
(Come on, you silly)

1070
00:47:07,006 --> 00:47:08,006
Seriously.

1071
00:47:10,776 --> 00:47:12,676
(Looking around)

1072
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:14,986
Now that the sun is behind the cloud...

1073
00:47:15,446 --> 00:47:16,716
- It's cooler.
- It's much better.

1074
00:47:16,716 --> 00:47:18,616
- I think it's perfect.
- Yes.

1075
00:47:20,886 --> 00:47:22,526
Gosh, the wind.

1076
00:47:22,526 --> 00:47:24,556
(The wind is blowing.)

1077
00:47:25,395 --> 00:47:26,395
It's so cool.

1078
00:47:26,395 --> 00:47:27,696
(The open field in the backyard)

1079
00:47:27,696 --> 00:47:29,596
I love that it's breezy.

1080
00:47:30,636 --> 00:47:32,366
(The autumn wind is blowing from the Baekma River.)

1081
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:34,366
I feel great. It's perfect now.

1082
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,176
On this green grass...

1083
00:47:37,176 --> 00:47:39,006
(House on Wheels on the meadow)

1084
00:47:39,205 --> 00:47:42,745
After drinking a cup of tea, I feel relaxed.

1085
00:47:42,745 --> 00:47:44,116
And the breeze is a bonus.

1086
00:47:44,116 --> 00:47:46,886
(I love the breeze.)

1087
00:47:46,886 --> 00:47:48,785
When you look at the leaves on the trees shaking,

1088
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:50,815
it seems like there are birds sitting on the tree.

1089
00:47:52,216 --> 00:47:54,486
It seems like the birds are flapping their wings.

1090
00:47:54,486 --> 00:47:55,725
(The shaking leaves...)

1091
00:47:55,725 --> 00:47:57,725
We don't need to meditate when we're here.

1092
00:47:57,725 --> 00:47:59,125
(make the moment seem like a piece of poetry.)

1093
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:01,125
It's so relaxing.

1094
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:02,426
(I feel drunk with the wind and the tea.)

1095
00:48:02,926 --> 00:48:05,395
(This is really nice.)

1096
00:48:06,236 --> 00:48:08,535
(The relaxing afternoon with Ha Nee in autumn)

1097
00:48:08,535 --> 00:48:10,576
Shall we get started?

1098
00:48:11,406 --> 00:48:14,475
When I had this food, I was in awe.

1099
00:48:15,245 --> 00:48:16,546
It's nurungji baeksuk.

1100
00:48:16,546 --> 00:48:18,915
(Nurungji baeksuk)

1101
00:48:18,915 --> 00:48:21,085
We've made baeksuk before,

1102
00:48:21,085 --> 00:48:23,046
but we haven't made nurungji baeksuk yet.

1103
00:48:23,046 --> 00:48:25,556
- Right.
- It tastes superb.

1104
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:27,585
With glutinous rice,

1105
00:48:27,585 --> 00:48:28,585
(Mouth-watering)

1106
00:48:28,955 --> 00:48:30,955
we'll make nurungji.

1107
00:48:30,955 --> 00:48:32,225
(A special healthy dish for Ha Nee and the new youngest Myoung)

1108
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:35,725
(Today's menu is nurungji baeksuk.)

1109
00:48:35,725 --> 00:48:37,935
- I brought Korean native chickens.
- Goodness.

1110
00:48:37,935 --> 00:48:39,565
- Two of them, right?
- Yes.

1111
00:48:39,765 --> 00:48:42,335
- How much was it per chicken?
- You don't need to pay me.

1112
00:48:42,535 --> 00:48:44,076
When you boil the chickens,

1113
00:48:44,076 --> 00:48:46,105
- you can put the red ginseng.
- Those are red ginseng?

1114
00:48:46,105 --> 00:48:47,846
- With these medicinal herbs.
- Okay.

1115
00:48:47,846 --> 00:48:49,306
They are angelica leaves, Scutellaria roots,

1116
00:48:49,645 --> 00:48:51,915
peony roots, astragalus, and white atractylis.

1117
00:48:51,915 --> 00:48:53,145
(Marvelous ingredients)

1118
00:48:53,645 --> 00:48:56,015
(The key to nurungji baeksuk is...)

1119
00:48:56,546 --> 00:48:59,486
(the golden and savory nurungji.)

1120
00:49:00,256 --> 00:49:05,225
(The dish is complete when nurungji is put on top of baeksuk.)

1121
00:49:05,725 --> 00:49:08,366
I need to call and ask how I should make it.

1122
00:49:10,796 --> 00:49:11,895
This call is very important.

1123
00:49:12,096 --> 00:49:13,605
- Hello?
- Hello, Dong Il.

1124
00:49:13,605 --> 00:49:15,835
- Yes, it's me.
- How are you?

1125
00:49:15,835 --> 00:49:18,176
I actually need to ask about your business secret.

1126
00:49:18,776 --> 00:49:20,105
Okay, fire away.

1127
00:49:20,105 --> 00:49:24,276
Can you tell me your mother's secret recipe?

1128
00:49:24,276 --> 00:49:26,145
It's been about 40 years since she started to make the dish, right?

1129
00:49:26,145 --> 00:49:27,946
- Gosh.
- Yes, it's been over 40 years.

1130
00:49:27,946 --> 00:49:31,056
I'd like to know her secret recipe that's been kept for 40 years.

1131
00:49:31,056 --> 00:49:32,056
Okay.

1132
00:49:32,056 --> 00:49:35,056
I'm thinking of cooking nurungji baeksuk.

1133
00:49:35,756 --> 00:49:38,495
- Actually, I'm out for exercise.
- Okay.

1134
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:42,296
We're on the first trip for House on Wheels 3.

1135
00:49:42,296 --> 00:49:43,565
(I have important guests here.)

1136
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:45,296
- Okay.
- I'm planning to make it today.

1137
00:49:45,296 --> 00:49:47,265
- Is that right?
- It wouldn't be as tasty as hers.

1138
00:49:47,765 --> 00:49:49,806
I think I can make the baeksuk,

1139
00:49:49,806 --> 00:49:52,006
but the nurungji has to be put on top of it, right?

1140
00:49:52,006 --> 00:49:53,176
Yes, on top.

1141
00:49:53,176 --> 00:49:55,576
I have no idea how I should do that.

1142
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:56,915
Should I make the nurungji separately?

1143
00:49:56,915 --> 00:49:57,975
(Laughing)

1144
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:00,446
Maybe it'd be better if my mother tells you.

1145
00:50:00,446 --> 00:50:02,116
I shouldn't be the one to tell you.

1146
00:50:02,116 --> 00:50:04,415
No, just the steps. How could I ever make it like she does?

1147
00:50:04,986 --> 00:50:07,026
We use a pressure cooker,

1148
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:10,955
and we cook them together in the same pot.

1149
00:50:10,955 --> 00:50:12,526
So all I need to do is to flip it?

1150
00:50:12,526 --> 00:50:14,395
Exactly. When it's all cooked,

1151
00:50:14,395 --> 00:50:17,136
you flip it to put the nurungji on top.

1152
00:50:17,335 --> 00:50:20,065
When the nurungji is sticky enough, I should flip it upside down?

1153
00:50:20,065 --> 00:50:21,406
Yes, that's how you do it.

1154
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:22,906
(Okay, noted.)

1155
00:50:22,906 --> 00:50:23,935
Yes, that's how it's done.

1156
00:50:23,935 --> 00:50:26,506
All right. I'll buy you a drink next time we meet.

1157
00:50:26,745 --> 00:50:28,676
- Okay, Dong Il.
- Thank you.

1158
00:50:28,676 --> 00:50:30,745
- Okay, take care.
- Okay.

1159
00:50:30,745 --> 00:50:31,875
(He learned the 40-year-old know-how to treat Myoung and Ha Nee.)

1160
00:50:32,415 --> 00:50:35,515
His mother has cooked this dish for over 40 years.

1161
00:50:35,915 --> 00:50:38,756
Her restaurant is really famous in Incheon.

1162
00:50:39,285 --> 00:50:40,326
Dong Il.

1163
00:50:40,326 --> 00:50:43,355
Based on your phone call,

1164
00:50:43,355 --> 00:50:47,165
he said it'd be better if his mom could explain.

1165
00:50:47,165 --> 00:50:48,665
- Yes, because it's a secret recipe.
- Yes.

1166
00:50:48,665 --> 00:50:50,296
Because she has her pride in it.

1167
00:50:50,296 --> 00:50:51,765
(She must have her pride in the 40-year-old secret recipe.)

1168
00:50:52,236 --> 00:50:54,866
But from what I heard, the secret know-how...

1169
00:50:54,866 --> 00:50:56,535
is to flip them together.

1170
00:50:56,875 --> 00:50:57,906
That's everything we learned.

1171
00:50:57,906 --> 00:50:59,535
(Is flipping together really the 40-year-old secret recipe?)

1172
00:50:59,535 --> 00:51:00,605
That's actually...

1173
00:51:01,276 --> 00:51:03,475
I think it's a bit far...

1174
00:51:04,116 --> 00:51:05,576
from the 40-year-old secret recipe.

1175
00:51:06,785 --> 00:51:07,915
(The pride on the 40-year-old recipe was hurt.)

1176
00:51:07,915 --> 00:51:11,515
I don't think you should say it's a 40-year-old secret recipe.

1177
00:51:11,515 --> 00:51:12,616
(Is that right?)

1178
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:13,756
- Seriously.
- My gosh.

1179
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:16,386
Flipping nurungji and baeksuk together can be...

1180
00:51:16,756 --> 00:51:19,796
a two-month-old secret recipe.

1181
00:51:20,765 --> 00:51:21,926
(It's so easy.)

1182
00:51:21,926 --> 00:51:24,995
But I was confused with the steps.

1183
00:51:24,995 --> 00:51:26,466
- I was confused with that.
- Okay.

1184
00:51:26,966 --> 00:51:28,665
As for me, I learned it right away after hearing it.

1185
00:51:28,665 --> 00:51:29,966
(Giggling)

1186
00:51:29,966 --> 00:51:33,176
Put nurungji and baeksuk, and then flip them together.

1187
00:51:33,846 --> 00:51:35,546
- And it's nurungji baeksuk.
- It's nurungji baeksuk.

1188
00:51:35,546 --> 00:51:37,915
(Nurungji baeksuk)

1189
00:51:37,915 --> 00:51:39,716
The dish we're having today...

1190
00:51:39,716 --> 00:51:42,386
will be made with the 40-year-old secret recipe.

1191
00:51:43,185 --> 00:51:44,616
- We're going to cook it.
- What is the know-how?

1192
00:51:44,616 --> 00:51:45,785
To flip them together.

1193
00:51:45,785 --> 00:51:47,156
(What is the know-how? To flip them together.)

1194
00:51:47,156 --> 00:51:50,026
- To flip them together.
- It'll be a healthy meal.

1195
00:51:50,995 --> 00:51:52,256
Do you want me to soak the glutinous rice now?

1196
00:51:52,796 --> 00:51:54,096
Gosh, look at him.

1197
00:51:54,096 --> 00:51:55,526
(How come you know exactly what to do?)

1198
00:51:55,526 --> 00:51:57,535
- You're incredible.
- Thank you.

1199
00:51:57,565 --> 00:52:01,105
(The youngest is incredible.)

1200
00:52:01,506 --> 00:52:04,506
(You're doing good, Myoung.)

1201
00:52:05,076 --> 00:52:07,475
Now that we know the secret recipe kept for 40 years,

1202
00:52:07,475 --> 00:52:09,306
- Exactly.
- shall we start?

1203
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:10,676
(How will the nurungji baeksuk made with the secret recipe taste?)

1204
00:52:10,915 --> 00:52:13,986
I'll lightly rinse it and soak it.

1205
00:52:13,986 --> 00:52:15,546
(I'll lightly rinse the glutinous rice and soak it.)

1206
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:20,625
(After Ha Nee nicely rinses the glutinous rice,)

1207
00:52:21,256 --> 00:52:23,026
- It needs to be soaked.
- Over there?

1208
00:52:23,026 --> 00:52:26,426
(Myoung leaves the bowl in a safe spot.)

1209
00:52:26,756 --> 00:52:30,535
(Soaking the glutinous rice first as it should be soaked for a while.)

1210
00:52:30,995 --> 00:52:32,966
(The youngest is taking out the Korean native chickens.)

1211
00:52:32,966 --> 00:52:34,136
All right.

1212
00:52:35,605 --> 00:52:38,375
- Gosh, are these the chickens?
- Yes.

1213
00:52:39,306 --> 00:52:40,306
I'll do it.

1214
00:52:40,306 --> 00:52:41,346
(A chicken foot is sticking out.)

1215
00:52:41,346 --> 00:52:42,806
(Scared)

1216
00:52:42,806 --> 00:52:43,846
- A foot is sticking out.
- Yes.

1217
00:52:44,315 --> 00:52:45,346
- I'll pull them out.
- My goodness.

1218
00:52:45,346 --> 00:52:48,815
(Myoung, I am scared.)

1219
00:52:50,116 --> 00:52:51,185
(Pushing it back)

1220
00:52:51,185 --> 00:52:53,955
(He pushes it back in so that Ha Nee won't see it.)

1221
00:52:55,386 --> 00:52:57,296
(Chef Sung checks the chickens first.)

1222
00:52:57,296 --> 00:52:58,355
(Exclaiming)

1223
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:01,165
(Exclaiming)

1224
00:53:01,165 --> 00:53:03,065
I think only you can prepare the chickens, Dong Il.

1225
00:53:03,065 --> 00:53:04,665
- Yes.
- Gosh.

1226
00:53:05,736 --> 00:53:07,605
He brought them for us.

1227
00:53:07,605 --> 00:53:08,705
(A huge native chicken specially asked by Dong Il)

1228
00:53:08,705 --> 00:53:09,765
He did.

1229
00:53:10,475 --> 00:53:11,506
He brought them for us.

1230
00:53:11,506 --> 00:53:13,975
- It's really big.
- Of course it should be big.

1231
00:53:14,205 --> 00:53:17,145
I'll remove the skin for baeksuk, all right?

1232
00:53:17,145 --> 00:53:19,216
- Okay.
- I'll remove the skin.

1233
00:53:20,486 --> 00:53:23,116
It's going to be more tender when it's skinned off.

1234
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,315
(Removing the skin to make the chicken softer)

1235
00:53:25,216 --> 00:53:28,026
(Showing a high-level technique when important guests are here)

1236
00:53:28,026 --> 00:53:30,056
(Pulling the skin off)

1237
00:53:30,426 --> 00:53:33,696
(Pushing the leg out)

1238
00:53:36,096 --> 00:53:37,296
(Staring)

1239
00:53:37,296 --> 00:53:39,296
How can you be so good at that?

1240
00:53:39,495 --> 00:53:41,335
Come on, I'm just removing the skin.

1241
00:53:41,335 --> 00:53:42,466
Still.

1242
00:53:44,136 --> 00:53:45,705
Gosh, you're amazing.

1243
00:53:45,705 --> 00:53:48,506
(As Ha Nee continues to be amazed...)

1244
00:53:48,806 --> 00:53:50,776
(Chopping)

1245
00:53:50,776 --> 00:53:55,046
(Dong Il speeds up.)

1246
00:53:55,446 --> 00:53:57,515
Goodness, you're breaking the bones too.

1247
00:53:57,515 --> 00:53:59,486
(Breaking)

1248
00:54:00,185 --> 00:54:01,256
Dong Il.

1249
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:02,986
The joints need to be cut.

1250
00:54:02,986 --> 00:54:04,225
(She can't get her eyes off.)

1251
00:54:04,926 --> 00:54:08,565
(Come on, it's nothing to be surprised about.)

1252
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:12,366
(Today, Dong Il works harder to prepare the chicken.)

1253
00:54:12,366 --> 00:54:13,435
My gosh.

1254
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:18,475
(Carefully taking the drumsticks)

1255
00:54:18,636 --> 00:54:21,105
The two drumsticks are for you...

1256
00:54:21,806 --> 00:54:22,875
and Ha Nee.

1257
00:54:23,576 --> 00:54:26,576
(Yes, I like drumsticks.)

1258
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:29,346
The wings and the body are prepared too.

1259
00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:30,685
(Preparing the chicken with Dong Il's efforts is complete.)

1260
00:54:31,616 --> 00:54:33,785
Dong Il, are you going to use the pot?

1261
00:54:34,326 --> 00:54:35,926
No, not that.

1262
00:54:36,225 --> 00:54:38,596
- I'm using the pressure cooker.
- Okay.

1263
00:54:39,096 --> 00:54:41,125
It's our first time using a pressure cooker here.

1264
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:42,196
(The big pressure cooker appears for the first time on the show.)

1265
00:54:42,426 --> 00:54:45,765
- I think the secret...
- Okay.

1266
00:54:45,765 --> 00:54:47,366
has to do with making the nurungji thick.

1267
00:54:47,765 --> 00:54:50,736
- Thick nurungji?
- Yes, instead of making it thin.

1268
00:54:50,736 --> 00:54:53,846
It's obvious that you're the chef, Dong Il.

1269
00:54:53,846 --> 00:54:55,846
(Putting the glutinous rice on the bottom)

1270
00:54:56,475 --> 00:55:00,415
It's the real red ginseng extract my friend brought.

1271
00:55:00,886 --> 00:55:03,386
Are you putting all of them? Three of them?

1272
00:55:03,915 --> 00:55:05,285
Yes, we want to make it taste like herbal medicine.

1273
00:55:05,285 --> 00:55:07,685
Gosh, look at the color.

1274
00:55:07,685 --> 00:55:08,725
(The color alone makes it look healthy.)

1275
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:09,826
Myoung, can you open it?

1276
00:55:10,326 --> 00:55:12,026
It smells amazing.

1277
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,225
Put a lot of them.

1278
00:55:13,995 --> 00:55:15,026
(Various medicinal herbs known to be healthy ingredients)

1279
00:55:15,026 --> 00:55:16,065
Good. It's enough.

1280
00:55:16,065 --> 00:55:17,335
- Is it enough?
- Yes.

1281
00:55:17,335 --> 00:55:18,636
We need to put the ginseng too.

1282
00:55:18,966 --> 00:55:20,665
It'd be better to add the whole thing, right?

1283
00:55:20,665 --> 00:55:22,236
- It's the good stuff.
- Yes, the good stuff.

1284
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,306
(The whole ginseng roots go in after the other good ingredients.)

1285
00:55:24,076 --> 00:55:25,475
(Is that it?)

1286
00:55:25,475 --> 00:55:27,806
I won't put onions in here.

1287
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:30,415
I don't know what it is, but it seems like deer antler.

1288
00:55:30,415 --> 00:55:31,616
(I think it's deer antler.)

1289
00:55:31,776 --> 00:55:33,346
I found these as well.

1290
00:55:33,346 --> 00:55:34,446
What are those?

1291
00:55:34,716 --> 00:55:37,415
The special ingredients for baeksuk? Open it.

1292
00:55:37,815 --> 00:55:38,855
Here are the scissors.

1293
00:55:38,855 --> 00:55:40,756
(Here are the scissors.)

1294
00:55:40,756 --> 00:55:42,855
(Ripping)

1295
00:55:43,285 --> 00:55:44,395
You can just rip it?

1296
00:55:44,395 --> 00:55:45,756
(Embarrassed)

1297
00:55:46,656 --> 00:55:49,395
(He's trying hard today.)

1298
00:55:50,065 --> 00:55:51,136
Should I wash them?

1299
00:55:51,395 --> 00:55:52,665
Yes, wash them a little bit.

1300
00:55:52,665 --> 00:55:54,435
(As Myoung is next to Dong Il,)

1301
00:55:55,535 --> 00:55:58,776
(Hee Won sets up the gas stove.)

1302
00:55:59,006 --> 00:56:01,375
(Safely filmed with permission from the local government)

1303
00:56:02,846 --> 00:56:05,446
(Setting up the windshield)

1304
00:56:05,815 --> 00:56:07,846
Dong Il, I finished setting up everything including the windshield.

1305
00:56:07,846 --> 00:56:08,915
You did?

1306
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:12,015
He did the most important part.

1307
00:56:12,015 --> 00:56:14,426
- Hee Won's doing a good job.
- Okay.

1308
00:56:14,725 --> 00:56:15,725
Yes.

1309
00:56:15,725 --> 00:56:16,826
(Feeling proud)

1310
00:56:17,796 --> 00:56:18,955
(In the meantime, nurungji baeksuk is...)

1311
00:56:18,955 --> 00:56:20,225
My goodness.

1312
00:56:20,225 --> 00:56:21,696
I put three packs of red ginseng here.

1313
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:25,935
Let's put everything in it.

1314
00:56:25,935 --> 00:56:28,506
(The big pot is filled with all the healthy ingredients.)

1315
00:56:28,906 --> 00:56:30,535
- Tell me when to stop.
- Put more.

1316
00:56:30,535 --> 00:56:32,406
(The most important part is adjusting the amount of water.)

1317
00:56:32,776 --> 00:56:35,506
(Nurungji can only be made with just enough amount of water.)

1318
00:56:35,506 --> 00:56:36,745
- Okay, stop.
- Okay.

1319
00:56:37,046 --> 00:56:38,745
(Pouring the water only up to the half of chicken)

1320
00:56:38,745 --> 00:56:39,745
Good.

1321
00:56:40,546 --> 00:56:41,616
There you go.

1322
00:56:41,785 --> 00:56:44,886
It's impossible for it to taste bad.

1323
00:56:44,886 --> 00:56:47,756
- With the ingredients and efforts.
- Everything's poured in.

1324
00:56:49,085 --> 00:56:50,756
(I want to eat it soon.)

1325
00:56:50,756 --> 00:56:52,625
- I'll eat it like this.
- I put everything in it.

1326
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:56,765
(Nurungji baeksuk prepared with love is fully ready to be cooked.)

1327
00:56:57,366 --> 00:56:58,995
- Now the most important part.
- What is it?

1328
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:00,705
I need to call him again for another tip.

1329
00:57:00,935 --> 00:57:04,276
I should ask how long I need to boil it on high heat and medium heat.

1330
00:57:04,776 --> 00:57:05,806
I have to ask him that.

1331
00:57:06,435 --> 00:57:08,846
Can you also ask if we need the windshield or not?

1332
00:57:09,776 --> 00:57:11,176
(You're being cute.)

1333
00:57:11,176 --> 00:57:12,176
Seriously...

1334
00:57:17,785 --> 00:57:18,855
What?

1335
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:22,426
I should be able to ask him that since it's important.

1336
00:57:22,926 --> 00:57:23,995
And he's not answering.

1337
00:57:25,395 --> 00:57:27,696
(Nervous)

1338
00:57:27,696 --> 00:57:31,366
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

1339
00:57:32,296 --> 00:57:36,306
This is a critical moment. He should answer the phone.

1340
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:39,335
(Quietly pressing the call button again)

1341
00:57:39,335 --> 00:57:42,906
(Checking the others' reactions)

1342
00:57:42,906 --> 00:57:46,546
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

1343
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,685
(Off)

1344
00:57:48,116 --> 00:57:51,386
(He isn't answering?)

1345
00:57:51,855 --> 00:57:54,326
I think we should look up for how long we need to boil it.

1346
00:57:54,326 --> 00:57:55,556
- Should I look it up?
- Yes, please do.

1347
00:57:57,395 --> 00:57:59,656
The 40-year-old secret recipe can be found on the internet, you know.

1348
00:58:03,765 --> 00:58:04,765
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

1349
00:58:04,765 --> 00:58:05,835
(Adjusting the heat is the key to making nurungji.)

1350
00:58:05,835 --> 00:58:08,065
(Feeling anxious)

1351
00:58:08,406 --> 00:58:10,065
- I found it.
- Let me see.

1352
00:58:10,065 --> 00:58:13,176
It says 10 minutes on high heat, 10 minutes on medium heat,

1353
00:58:13,176 --> 00:58:14,176
and 10 minutes on low heat.

1354
00:58:14,176 --> 00:58:16,406
Is that right? Do we know the temperature of the high heat?

1355
00:58:16,745 --> 00:58:18,015
I have no idea about that.

1356
00:58:18,015 --> 00:58:21,285
(Hee Won is being serious and Myoung is sad that he can't answer.)

1357
00:58:21,946 --> 00:58:25,785
(I want to cook it with the secret know-how.)

1358
00:58:25,785 --> 00:58:27,225
What does it say? For how long should we boil it?

1359
00:58:27,225 --> 00:58:29,725
It says 30 minutes in total.

1360
00:58:29,725 --> 00:58:31,596
Okay, let's try that then.

1361
00:58:31,596 --> 00:58:32,826
(Okay, let's try that then.)

1362
00:58:35,725 --> 00:58:36,826
- On high heat...
- Do you trust me?

1363
00:58:36,966 --> 00:58:39,866
- Yes, of course.
- It's the long-kept secret recipe.

1364
00:58:40,565 --> 00:58:42,306
We don't need to know about the temperature.

1365
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:45,205
We just need to flip it well later.

1366
00:58:45,205 --> 00:58:46,605
(Flipping it is the secret know-how.)

1367
00:58:46,605 --> 00:58:49,176
- The temperature's not important.
- Of course not.

1368
00:58:49,906 --> 00:58:52,645
(Low heat, middle heat, high heat)

1369
00:58:52,645 --> 00:58:56,046
(Starting to boil for 10 minutes on high heat)

1370
00:58:56,386 --> 00:58:58,556
Myoung, set up a timer for 10 minutes.

1371
00:58:58,556 --> 00:59:00,355
(Boiling on high heat for 10 minutes)

1372
00:59:00,986 --> 00:59:04,296
(We already started cooking it, but...)

1373
00:59:05,895 --> 00:59:07,196
I hope it turns out well.

1374
00:59:07,196 --> 00:59:08,926
(Will they be able to adjust the heat?)

1375
00:59:09,395 --> 00:59:10,526
(Keeping an eye on it)

1376
00:59:10,526 --> 00:59:11,535
I hope it turns out well.

1377
00:59:13,765 --> 00:59:15,406
Why isn't he answering the phone?

1378
00:59:15,406 --> 00:59:17,406
(I want to make it delicious for them.)

1379
00:59:17,806 --> 00:59:20,806
(I want to eat it quickly.)

1380
00:59:21,105 --> 00:59:23,076
(Getting up)

1381
00:59:23,076 --> 00:59:24,576
(Getting up again)

1382
00:59:24,815 --> 00:59:26,216
We don't know how it works.

1383
00:59:26,216 --> 00:59:27,716
(Feeling anxious as he's afraid it might fail)

1384
00:59:28,346 --> 00:59:29,386
Goodness, it's hot.

1385
00:59:29,616 --> 00:59:31,585
(Smelling)

1386
00:59:32,085 --> 00:59:34,926
(Also worried and anxious)

1387
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:38,495
(Sighing)

1388
00:59:39,656 --> 00:59:42,565
I've never been worried to this extent to cook something.

1389
00:59:43,565 --> 00:59:45,065
I should've just cooked regular samgyetang.

1390
00:59:45,065 --> 00:59:46,165
(Yes, you should have.)

1391
00:59:47,565 --> 00:59:49,866
The pressure regulator should move as the pressure builds inside.

1392
00:59:51,105 --> 00:59:55,375
(It usually moves like this, but theirs is quiet.)

1393
00:59:55,676 --> 00:59:59,076
After it starts to move, we should boil it on low heat.

1394
00:59:59,076 --> 01:00:00,245
(Maybe we should boil it for 15 minutes on low heat.)

1395
01:00:01,185 --> 01:00:02,785
I'll make a call one last time.

1396
01:00:02,785 --> 01:00:03,846
(He can't let go.)

1397
01:00:04,256 --> 01:00:06,455
(Go ahead.)

1398
01:00:07,116 --> 01:00:10,926
(I need to make sure about the heat.)

1399
01:00:15,725 --> 01:00:18,596
Maybe he's not answering because you keep asking about the know-how.

1400
01:00:18,596 --> 01:00:20,265
(A reasonable doubt)

1401
01:00:20,935 --> 01:00:22,636
Because you keep asking about their secret.

1402
01:00:23,065 --> 01:00:24,605
You should've asked saying,

1403
01:00:24,605 --> 01:00:26,806
"I'll keep it to myself."

1404
01:00:27,406 --> 01:00:28,446
Gosh.

1405
01:00:28,605 --> 01:00:29,906
You asked him too openly.

1406
01:00:29,906 --> 01:00:31,046
(Come on.)

1407
01:00:31,046 --> 01:00:32,046
Hello?

1408
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:33,815
(The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.)

1409
01:00:33,815 --> 01:00:37,656
(Dong Il said hello in vain.)

1410
01:00:37,656 --> 01:00:39,085
Please leave a message after the beep.

1411
01:00:39,415 --> 01:00:41,085
Just hang up.

1412
01:00:41,886 --> 01:00:42,886
(They laugh in silence, so he doesn't get hurt.)

1413
01:00:42,886 --> 01:00:45,796
- I think they're avoiding you.
- Dong Il...

1414
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:48,665
Your relationships with everyone in the country will end.

1415
01:00:48,665 --> 01:00:50,426
What should we do about this?

1416
01:00:51,165 --> 01:00:53,966
(I wanted to make good food using the 40-year-old secret recipe.)

1417
01:00:53,966 --> 01:00:55,535
You should've mentioned that...

1418
01:00:55,535 --> 01:00:57,935
you'd keep the recipe to yourself.

1419
01:01:00,176 --> 01:01:01,546
It's been ten minutes.

1420
01:01:01,546 --> 01:01:02,745
- It's been ten minutes?
- Yes.

1421
01:01:02,745 --> 01:01:04,415
(The 10-minute alarm for high heat rings.)

1422
01:01:05,145 --> 01:01:06,676
Has it already been ten minutes?

1423
01:01:07,245 --> 01:01:09,446
- Gosh. Hey, but...
- Will this work?

1424
01:01:09,585 --> 01:01:10,645
I'm a bit nervous.

1425
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:13,815
Do you think it's already ready?

1426
01:01:13,815 --> 01:01:14,886
(It's not moving, and they can't see inside.)

1427
01:01:15,225 --> 01:01:17,285
Let's keep it on high heat for an additional five minutes.

1428
01:01:17,285 --> 01:01:18,326
Another five minutes?

1429
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,296
- Let's do another five minutes.
- Then...

1430
01:01:20,596 --> 01:01:22,395
We'll put it on middle heat for 15 minutes.

1431
01:01:24,636 --> 01:01:26,665
Hey, Siri. Set an alarm for five minutes.

1432
01:01:27,835 --> 01:01:29,935
(What did...)

1433
01:01:29,935 --> 01:01:32,105
(you just do?)

1434
01:01:32,306 --> 01:01:33,935
- What was that? What?
- Things like that.

1435
01:01:34,645 --> 01:01:36,776
He set the alarm by saying something.

1436
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:38,616
- Do you know how to do it?
- What?

1437
01:01:38,616 --> 01:01:39,815
Be honest.

1438
01:01:40,346 --> 01:01:41,415
(He avoids eye contact.)

1439
01:01:41,415 --> 01:01:42,986
- I honestly don't.
- Right.

1440
01:01:42,986 --> 01:01:44,015
I know what Siri is,

1441
01:01:44,015 --> 01:01:45,716
but I didn't know you could set an alarm with it.

1442
01:01:45,915 --> 01:01:48,256
Right. We can't keep up with these things.

1443
01:01:48,256 --> 01:01:49,556
(How cute.)

1444
01:01:51,455 --> 01:01:55,296
Can you call Cereal and ask her...

1445
01:01:55,725 --> 01:01:58,866
how long we have to cook baeksuk for?

1446
01:02:00,065 --> 01:02:04,205
(Will Cereal know the secret recipe?)

1447
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:05,375
Hey, Siri.

1448
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,006
How long do you have to cook baeksuk for?

1449
01:02:10,176 --> 01:02:13,515
Hey, Siri? How long do you have to cook baeksuk for?

1450
01:02:14,446 --> 01:02:16,285
She's avoiding telling us the 40-year-old secret recipe.

1451
01:02:16,285 --> 01:02:19,285
She's avoiding telling us the recipe too.

1452
01:02:19,285 --> 01:02:20,285
(Is she avoiding us too?)

1453
01:02:20,515 --> 01:02:23,026
Hey, Siri. How long do you have to cook baeksuk for?

1454
01:02:23,026 --> 01:02:25,355
Siri is avoiding answering the question too.

1455
01:02:26,256 --> 01:02:28,725
Right. She's avoiding it too.

1456
01:02:28,725 --> 01:02:30,366
(He laughs silently out of dejection.)

1457
01:02:32,596 --> 01:02:33,935
Hey, Siri. Answer me.

1458
01:02:35,406 --> 01:02:38,475
(The youngest is the only one who doesn't avoid it and asks.)

1459
01:02:39,276 --> 01:02:40,875
How long do you have to cook baeksuk for?

1460
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:42,406
(He asks for the fourth time.)

1461
01:02:42,406 --> 01:02:43,846
What an interesting question.

1462
01:02:43,846 --> 01:02:45,176
What's interesting about it?

1463
01:02:45,176 --> 01:02:47,375
- Forget it. That Cereal.
- Hold on.

1464
01:02:48,315 --> 01:02:49,616
Hey, Siri. Forget it.

1465
01:02:50,015 --> 01:02:52,415
Is there anything else I can help you with?

1466
01:02:53,656 --> 01:02:55,585
She talks back about everything.

1467
01:02:55,585 --> 01:02:58,556
That can be really annoying sometimes.

1468
01:02:59,895 --> 01:03:01,165
(The alarm for the additional 5 minutes on high heat rings.)

1469
01:03:01,165 --> 01:03:02,265
It's been five minutes,

1470
01:03:04,026 --> 01:03:06,136
(Running)

1471
01:03:06,136 --> 01:03:08,366
I get scared every time that alarm goes off.

1472
01:03:08,935 --> 01:03:09,966
My goodness.

1473
01:03:09,966 --> 01:03:14,446
(Low heat, middle heat, high heat)

1474
01:03:14,446 --> 01:03:19,076
(He adjusts the heat more meticulously than ever.)

1475
01:03:19,975 --> 01:03:20,986
Done.

1476
01:03:21,315 --> 01:03:23,645
- Set an alarm for 15 minutes.
- Okay.

1477
01:03:23,645 --> 01:03:24,815
Youngest. Fifteen minutes.

1478
01:03:24,815 --> 01:03:26,216
(Youngest, set an alarm for 15 minutes on middle heat.)

1479
01:03:27,415 --> 01:03:32,256
(He can't take his eyes off it as he sits because he's worried.)

1480
01:03:32,556 --> 01:03:36,026
If a pressure cooker sealed tightly,

1481
01:03:36,026 --> 01:03:37,696
is it supposed to be leaking like that?

1482
01:03:37,895 --> 01:03:38,935
- Good question.
- Right.

1483
01:03:39,035 --> 01:03:42,466
Pressure cookers are supposed to be sealed tight.

1484
01:03:42,466 --> 01:03:44,576
(There's water dripping from the lock by the handle.)

1485
01:03:45,276 --> 01:03:50,276
(What's wrong with this?)

1486
01:03:53,915 --> 01:03:54,946
Wait.

1487
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:59,616
(He touches the pressure cooker.)

1488
01:04:00,156 --> 01:04:03,185
(What's he doing?)

1489
01:04:04,296 --> 01:04:06,056
It's been open all this time.

1490
01:04:06,056 --> 01:04:09,395
Wow. We're in trouble. What should we do?

1491
01:04:10,165 --> 01:04:11,435
Where's the lid?

1492
01:04:11,435 --> 01:04:12,736
- Is it under there?
- Yes, it is.

1493
01:04:12,736 --> 01:04:13,765
- The lid.
- Okay.

1494
01:04:13,765 --> 01:04:15,605
(When he was closing the lid for the pressure cooker,)

1495
01:04:15,605 --> 01:04:16,866
Is it ready? Should I put it on the stove?

1496
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:19,475
(he forgot to lock the pressure cooker.)

1497
01:04:19,636 --> 01:04:20,676
Put it over there.

1498
01:04:21,346 --> 01:04:23,676
(They began cooking it when it was open.)

1499
01:04:23,676 --> 01:04:27,276
(There was no pressure building up inside the pot.)

1500
01:04:28,815 --> 01:04:32,455
(What...)

1501
01:04:32,455 --> 01:04:36,256
(have we been doing?)

1502
01:04:36,685 --> 01:04:38,995
See? Nothing's leaking now...

1503
01:04:38,995 --> 01:04:40,296
since it's not open.

1504
01:04:40,426 --> 01:04:42,466
No pressure was building up inside.

1505
01:04:42,466 --> 01:04:44,125
It's because it's my first time using a pressure cooker, you punk.

1506
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:46,096
Dong Il, you've been cooking it while it was open,

1507
01:04:46,535 --> 01:04:48,065
so no pressure was building up.

1508
01:04:48,065 --> 01:04:49,736
It's my first time using a pressure cooker.

1509
01:04:49,736 --> 01:04:50,765
(The pressure cooker flustered the great Chef Sung.)

1510
01:04:52,776 --> 01:04:54,446
- Should I put it back on high heat?
- What?

1511
01:04:54,446 --> 01:04:55,506
Should I turn up the heat?

1512
01:04:55,846 --> 01:04:58,915
I think we should wait until the pressure cooker makes noise.

1513
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,745
After that happens,

1514
01:05:00,745 --> 01:05:04,355
let's put it on high heat for five minutes and finish up.

1515
01:05:04,616 --> 01:05:06,156
- It'll be a clean finish.
- Okay.

1516
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:09,455
- I'm anxious.
- What?

1517
01:05:09,455 --> 01:05:10,486
I'm anxious.

1518
01:05:10,486 --> 01:05:11,526
(While the pressure is building up properly...)

1519
01:05:14,096 --> 01:05:15,665
Myoung, aren't you tired? Are you okay?

1520
01:05:15,665 --> 01:05:18,065
I'm fine. What are you doing now?

1521
01:05:18,065 --> 01:05:19,866
I want to season these.

1522
01:05:20,466 --> 01:05:21,966
(Is Ha Nee cutting up some vegetables?)

1523
01:05:21,966 --> 01:05:23,736
We can't take it.

1524
01:05:24,776 --> 01:05:29,906
(While the owner was busy making the nurungji baeksuk,)

1525
01:05:29,975 --> 01:05:31,616
- Did you try it?
- Yes, Dong Il.

1526
01:05:31,975 --> 01:05:35,546
Should I season some chamnamul... I mean, siler root greens.

1527
01:05:35,986 --> 01:05:37,015
If you know how.

1528
01:05:38,256 --> 01:05:39,915
- Seasoning it is easy.
- Just add some red chili powder...

1529
01:05:39,915 --> 01:05:41,285
and some sesame oil,

1530
01:05:41,285 --> 01:05:42,756
- and cut it up.
- Right.

1531
01:05:43,185 --> 01:05:44,895
I think chamnamul...

1532
01:05:44,895 --> 01:05:47,196
will taste good with the food if we season it.

1533
01:05:47,556 --> 01:05:50,526
I have a feeling that it's going to be.

1534
01:05:50,966 --> 01:05:54,605
I have a fitting as soon as I get back to Seoul.

1535
01:05:55,966 --> 01:05:58,636
(Humming)

1536
01:05:58,636 --> 01:06:01,006
(The clothes don't fit)

1537
01:06:01,105 --> 01:06:02,605
"Ha Nee, the clothes don't fit!"

1538
01:06:02,605 --> 01:06:04,006
It doesn't fit.

1539
01:06:04,515 --> 01:06:07,375
My stylist already lectured me the other day.

1540
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:08,846
"Ha Nee. What is this?"

1541
01:06:08,846 --> 01:06:09,915
"What?"

1542
01:06:09,915 --> 01:06:10,946
"This outfit..."

1543
01:06:11,585 --> 01:06:12,785
"It didn't fit like this."

1544
01:06:13,216 --> 01:06:14,725
"What happened?"

1545
01:06:15,386 --> 01:06:17,285
"Something happened? I wonder what happened."

1546
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:19,156
"Ha Nee..."

1547
01:06:20,196 --> 01:06:23,466
"I trust that you'll do something before the press conference."

1548
01:06:24,636 --> 01:06:25,696
"Don't trust me."

1549
01:06:25,696 --> 01:06:27,466
(Don't trust me.)

1550
01:06:27,466 --> 01:06:28,906
"I'm joining House on Wheels."

1551
01:06:29,366 --> 01:06:30,406
"Ha Nee..."

1552
01:06:30,406 --> 01:06:32,605
(What will do about her?)

1553
01:06:32,806 --> 01:06:35,705
But I didn't even think, and I ate a lot yesterday.

1554
01:06:37,645 --> 01:06:41,685
(This is so good.)

1555
01:06:42,386 --> 01:06:48,256
(The wraps got sucked in like a black hole.)

1556
01:06:48,355 --> 01:06:50,355
I'm not kidding. I ate so much.

1557
01:06:50,355 --> 01:06:51,596
(I'm worried because I'm eating so much.)

1558
01:06:51,756 --> 01:06:54,296
I'm saying this, but...

1559
01:06:55,326 --> 01:06:56,665
This is quite a lot.

1560
01:06:56,665 --> 01:07:00,236
(She finishes cutting it up quickly while they chatted.)

1561
01:07:01,205 --> 01:07:04,776
(She looks at the sauces.)

1562
01:07:05,736 --> 01:07:07,205
Myoung, should we...

1563
01:07:07,605 --> 01:07:10,645
use the jeotgal from yesterday instead of fish sauce?

1564
01:07:11,475 --> 01:07:12,915
- Into this?
- Yes.

1565
01:07:12,915 --> 01:07:13,946
Sounds good.

1566
01:07:14,685 --> 01:07:16,386
(Exclaiming)

1567
01:07:16,685 --> 01:07:18,355
(She sniffs the cave shrimp jeotgal first.)

1568
01:07:18,355 --> 01:07:19,455
(Exclaiming)

1569
01:07:20,915 --> 01:07:23,955
(She adds umami with the shrimp jeotgal.)

1570
01:07:24,285 --> 01:07:26,096
(She adds some soy sauce.)

1571
01:07:26,455 --> 01:07:27,525
Vinegar.

1572
01:07:28,525 --> 01:07:29,726
Red chili powder.

1573
01:07:30,695 --> 01:07:32,566
Sesame oil is the best.

1574
01:07:33,035 --> 01:07:36,835
(She seasons it in 1 minute thanks to her incredible cooking skills.)

1575
01:07:37,535 --> 01:07:39,535
The sesame oil smells incredible.

1576
01:07:39,535 --> 01:07:41,075
(She mixes them together carefully and finishes up.)

1577
01:07:43,445 --> 01:07:50,085
(Ha Nee tastes it before she plates it.)

1578
01:07:50,646 --> 01:07:52,955
(Myoung, have a taste.)

1579
01:07:52,955 --> 01:07:54,825
Doesn't it need to be a little saltier?

1580
01:07:54,825 --> 01:07:56,726
(Worried)

1581
01:07:56,726 --> 01:07:57,756
It's good as is too.

1582
01:07:58,056 --> 01:07:59,125
Open this.

1583
01:08:01,466 --> 01:08:04,995
(She adds some more shrimp jeotgal.)

1584
01:08:04,995 --> 01:08:06,096
That's enough.

1585
01:08:06,796 --> 01:08:07,936
Youngest.

1586
01:08:07,936 --> 01:08:11,405
(She mixes them together...)

1587
01:08:12,436 --> 01:08:16,575
(and tastes it again.)

1588
01:08:16,575 --> 01:08:17,676
It's a bit too salty now.

1589
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:23,686
(Chewing)

1590
01:08:28,186 --> 01:08:31,726
(They taste it again.)

1591
01:08:31,726 --> 01:08:33,495
- It's too salty now. Right?
- It's still good.

1592
01:08:34,356 --> 01:08:35,566
It's too salty.

1593
01:08:35,896 --> 01:08:38,096
(She adds half an onion to fix it.)

1594
01:08:38,096 --> 01:08:39,436
It'll be okay once you add that.

1595
01:08:41,936 --> 01:08:43,136
I put in too much shrimp jeotgal.

1596
01:08:43,136 --> 01:08:44,875
(Gosh, I put in too much shrimp jeotgal.)

1597
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:47,006
I added too much shrimp jeotgal.

1598
01:08:47,976 --> 01:08:50,375
- It's okay.
- It's okay?

1599
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:51,846
It's not salty at all.

1600
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:54,075
Anyone would tell you that it's salty, Myoung.

1601
01:08:54,075 --> 01:08:57,415
(She's very objective.)

1602
01:08:58,585 --> 01:09:02,226
(She tastes it again with hopes that it got better.)

1603
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:03,856
It's still salty.

1604
01:09:03,856 --> 01:09:04,955
(It's still salty.)

1605
01:09:05,856 --> 01:09:09,466
(She starts with adding the other half of the onion.)

1606
01:09:09,466 --> 01:09:10,495
I'm not going to measure it.

1607
01:09:10,495 --> 01:09:12,195
(She still won't measure it.)

1608
01:09:12,195 --> 01:09:13,396
I'm just going to use my senses.

1609
01:09:13,665 --> 01:09:15,165
- Yes.
- Yes.

1610
01:09:15,705 --> 01:09:19,006
(She's in an unending loop of tasting and adding.)

1611
01:09:19,636 --> 01:09:23,976
(She's practically having a meal while standing there.)

1612
01:09:29,016 --> 01:09:32,256
Only half of it will be left by the time it reaches the table.

1613
01:09:32,356 --> 01:09:33,785
Because you guys are eating it all.

1614
01:09:34,285 --> 01:09:36,655
Only half of it will end up at the table.

1615
01:09:36,655 --> 01:09:38,825
(Meanwhile,)

1616
01:09:38,825 --> 01:09:42,296
(he can't hear anything.)

1617
01:09:42,726 --> 01:09:45,035
(Inside, she's busy eating,)

1618
01:09:45,035 --> 01:09:47,966
(and outside, he's busy worrying.)

1619
01:09:47,966 --> 01:09:49,205
(Eating)

1620
01:09:49,205 --> 01:09:50,466
(Worrying)

1621
01:09:50,466 --> 01:09:51,936
(Eating, worrying)

1622
01:09:52,405 --> 01:09:55,676
(House on Wheels 3 is a complete mess.)

1623
01:09:56,176 --> 01:09:58,176
(Mixing)

1624
01:09:58,346 --> 01:10:00,216
I should stop mixing it.

1625
01:10:01,285 --> 01:10:03,046
It can end up burning within moments.

1626
01:10:03,046 --> 01:10:05,285
(Nodding)

1627
01:10:06,615 --> 01:10:08,285
You keep...

1628
01:10:08,686 --> 01:10:09,726
I'm not satisfied.

1629
01:10:10,825 --> 01:10:11,896
I'm so annoyed.

1630
01:10:12,726 --> 01:10:13,756
I'll add a bit of plum syrup.

1631
01:10:16,396 --> 01:10:18,596
If you keep on adding things to it,

1632
01:10:19,096 --> 01:10:20,835
will it be okay?

1633
01:10:21,535 --> 01:10:24,405
(She tastes it again.)

1634
01:10:26,436 --> 01:10:27,506
This is a lot better.

1635
01:10:28,575 --> 01:10:30,006
(He's really worried.)

1636
01:10:30,006 --> 01:10:31,075
Try it.

1637
01:10:32,146 --> 01:10:36,285
(He tastes the chamnamul that has been altered 17 times.)

1638
01:10:36,745 --> 01:10:38,955
(Nodding)

1639
01:10:38,955 --> 01:10:40,056
What do you think? Is it okay?

1640
01:10:43,485 --> 01:10:44,825
(They nod to signal the end of adding sauces.)

1641
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:45,856
Now we just need to have dinner.

1642
01:10:48,966 --> 01:10:52,566
(Eating)

1643
01:10:52,566 --> 01:10:53,995
(On eggshells)

1644
01:10:53,995 --> 01:10:56,006
(Eating again)

1645
01:10:56,106 --> 01:10:59,506
There's a lot of umami in it because of that shrimp jeotgal.

1646
01:11:00,936 --> 01:11:02,106
It's salty, but it still tastes good.

1647
01:11:02,506 --> 01:11:03,846
It's not that salty.

1648
01:11:03,846 --> 01:11:05,816
(If it's not salty, have some more.)

1649
01:11:05,816 --> 01:11:06,816
It's a bit...

1650
01:11:08,445 --> 01:11:11,556
(Looking around)

1651
01:11:11,556 --> 01:11:13,655
(Grabbing)

1652
01:11:16,186 --> 01:11:20,226
(He said it wasn't salty, but he turns around and gulps down water.)

1653
01:11:20,226 --> 01:11:23,296
(She eats some more.)

1654
01:11:26,096 --> 01:11:28,506
- It's all soggy now.
- I know.

1655
01:11:31,735 --> 01:11:33,936
When we plate it, let's just take what's on top.

1656
01:11:34,205 --> 01:11:36,945
The ones on the bottom have more sauce on them.

1657
01:11:37,606 --> 01:11:38,646
Let's add some sesame seeds.

1658
01:11:39,346 --> 01:11:40,346
Add some sesame seeds.

1659
01:11:40,346 --> 01:11:42,386
(She finishes with some sesame seeds.)

1660
01:11:43,186 --> 01:11:46,615
(Ha Nee put a lot of care into making...)

1661
01:11:47,085 --> 01:11:48,426
(the seasoned chamnamul that was finished after 19 tastings.)

1662
01:11:48,426 --> 01:11:51,756
(She didn't blanch it.)

1663
01:11:52,756 --> 01:11:54,766
- Right?
- When this overflows...

1664
01:11:54,766 --> 01:11:55,766
(The youngest member brings out the side dish.)

1665
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:59,636
If you start setting the table already, what are we supposed to do?

1666
01:11:59,636 --> 01:12:01,905
You don't have to bring it out yet.

1667
01:12:03,405 --> 01:12:05,106
We have to try this.

1668
01:12:05,106 --> 01:12:07,306
No, you have to eat it with the baeksuk.

1669
01:12:07,306 --> 01:12:09,405
I wanted to have a taste.

1670
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:11,205
I shouldn't try it?

1671
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,775
It's a bit salty.

1672
01:12:14,846 --> 01:12:18,615
(Ha Nee is nervous.)

1673
01:12:18,955 --> 01:12:21,155
It's been 15 minutes!

1674
01:12:21,155 --> 01:12:23,756
- That surprised me!
- I jump every time that rings.

1675
01:12:24,726 --> 01:12:26,356
I think it's going to taste delicious.

1676
01:12:26,495 --> 01:12:29,766
- I think it's going to be good.
- It's hard not to be good.

1677
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,695
(Low heat, middle heat, high heat)

1678
01:12:31,695 --> 01:12:35,835
(The final adjustment. He puts it on high heat for 5 minutes.)

1679
01:12:35,835 --> 01:12:38,106
- Five minutes!
- I set it already.

1680
01:12:41,205 --> 01:12:42,745
You can smell it right here.

1681
01:12:42,745 --> 01:12:44,546
- You can smell it, right?
- Yes.

1682
01:12:44,705 --> 01:12:45,816
You can smell it?

1683
01:12:46,176 --> 01:12:49,146
(They sniff around, looking for the smell of the baeksuk.)

1684
01:12:49,146 --> 01:12:50,915
Hold on.

1685
01:12:51,655 --> 01:12:53,856
Don't pressure cookers make noise?

1686
01:12:54,655 --> 01:12:55,726
(Doggy Myoung is a baeksuk detection dog.)

1687
01:12:55,726 --> 01:12:58,556
But this hasn't made any noise.

1688
01:12:59,695 --> 01:13:03,226
(Why am I the only one who can't smell it?)

1689
01:13:03,226 --> 01:13:06,535
Hold on. Don't pressure cookers make noise?

1690
01:13:06,535 --> 01:13:08,405
- Yes. It makes noise.
- Right.

1691
01:13:08,405 --> 01:13:11,335
But this hasn't made any noise.

1692
01:13:12,936 --> 01:13:16,646
(You're right.)

1693
01:13:17,075 --> 01:13:19,346
(He's worried.)

1694
01:13:19,445 --> 01:13:21,646
It's making noise! There it goes!

1695
01:13:21,646 --> 01:13:24,445
- Right!
- There it goes!

1696
01:13:24,445 --> 01:13:27,285
It's like watching a steam train.

1697
01:13:27,285 --> 01:13:28,426
(He finally laughs.)

1698
01:13:28,886 --> 01:13:31,995
(The tab is moving energetically.)

1699
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:34,796
(They all begin to watch it.)

1700
01:13:34,796 --> 01:13:35,926
It's a miraculous sound of hope.

1701
01:13:37,025 --> 01:13:38,235
(Toot!)

1702
01:13:38,235 --> 01:13:39,936
(Toot, toot!)

1703
01:13:41,396 --> 01:13:43,165
I'm so happy to hear this sound.

1704
01:13:46,235 --> 01:13:50,506
(He calms himself down with the smell of the baeksuk.)

1705
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:52,146
Don't you think it's going to be really good?

1706
01:13:52,146 --> 01:13:54,316
- I think it's going to be amazing.
- Right.

1707
01:13:54,316 --> 01:13:56,945
What's encouraging is that it doesn't smell burnt.

1708
01:13:56,945 --> 01:13:59,216
- It doesn't smell burnt.
- Right.

1709
01:13:59,216 --> 01:14:00,886
But it could just be uncooked rice.

1710
01:14:04,155 --> 01:14:06,325
(The fierce sound of the pressure cooker...)

1711
01:14:06,325 --> 01:14:09,665
(begins to slow down.)

1712
01:14:09,896 --> 01:14:13,396
(It'll be done cooking after they let it simmer for a bit.)

1713
01:14:14,495 --> 01:14:15,766
Gosh...

1714
01:14:16,735 --> 01:14:19,106
I'm as nervous as I was during my college entrance exams.

1715
01:14:20,705 --> 01:14:23,346
I was really nervous for about 30 to 40 minutes.

1716
01:14:24,146 --> 01:14:25,146
I was.

1717
01:14:26,846 --> 01:14:28,016
Finally.

1718
01:14:28,016 --> 01:14:30,846
(Finally)

1719
01:14:33,115 --> 01:14:34,516
The sound of our fate.

1720
01:14:34,516 --> 01:14:37,186
(The moment of destiny)

1721
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:41,226
(He's very serious.)

1722
01:14:42,066 --> 01:14:44,466
You can't leave it there. We need to take it all out.

1723
01:14:45,096 --> 01:14:48,535
(It's time to check the 40-year-old secret recipe.)

1724
01:14:49,165 --> 01:14:52,506
(He was anxious while it cooked...)

1725
01:14:53,136 --> 01:14:56,346
(because he wanted to ensure they would eat good food.)

1726
01:14:57,046 --> 01:14:59,816
(What will be the result?)

1727
01:15:00,016 --> 01:15:02,985
Contestant number 46. Sung Dong Il.

1728
01:15:03,745 --> 01:15:05,716
Today is the day he faces...

1729
01:15:06,056 --> 01:15:08,455
the weight of 40 years.

1730
01:15:09,356 --> 01:15:13,596
(The moment of truth behind the 40-year-old recipe.)

1731
01:15:14,356 --> 01:15:16,266
Everyone. You have waited for a long time.

1732
01:15:16,966 --> 01:15:20,796
This is a first on House on Wheels Season 3.

1733
01:15:21,136 --> 01:15:25,075
- He must flip the red switch first.
- Right.

1734
01:15:25,535 --> 01:15:29,106
(He is nervous as he reaches out his hand.)

1735
01:15:29,346 --> 01:15:31,306
If he doesn't do it right... Goodness.

1736
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:38,256
(Flipping)

1737
01:15:38,816 --> 01:15:42,525
(What is this unexpected situation?)

1738
01:15:43,726 --> 01:15:46,625
Nothing is supposed to come out.

1739
01:15:47,525 --> 01:15:48,796
This is a sign of success!

1740
01:15:49,495 --> 01:15:52,195
There are many athletes who get eliminated...

1741
01:15:52,195 --> 01:15:54,735
because something comes out when they flip the switch.

1742
01:15:54,735 --> 01:15:56,936
I see. Goodness.

1743
01:15:57,535 --> 01:15:59,606
He has successfully completed the first step.

1744
01:15:59,606 --> 01:16:01,676
- Was he successful?
- I see.

1745
01:16:01,676 --> 01:16:03,846
Every single step is very...

1746
01:16:03,846 --> 01:16:05,346
(Nervous)

1747
01:16:05,346 --> 01:16:06,945
The black button in the middle...

1748
01:16:06,945 --> 01:16:07,945
(Spewing out)

1749
01:16:07,945 --> 01:16:10,745
- What just happened?
- There was a small mistake...

1750
01:16:10,745 --> 01:16:12,985
- There was a small mistake?
- Yes, but it was minor.

1751
01:16:13,256 --> 01:16:14,585
(This is hilarious.)

1752
01:16:14,585 --> 01:16:15,726
He made a mistake.

1753
01:16:16,356 --> 01:16:18,756
- None of that matters later.
- I see.

1754
01:16:18,756 --> 01:16:20,926
What's most important is the flip.

1755
01:16:20,926 --> 01:16:22,566
- The flip.
- Yes.

1756
01:16:23,325 --> 01:16:26,266
(This is the key to the 40-year-old recipe.)

1757
01:16:27,195 --> 01:16:29,066
(Nurungji baeksuk)

1758
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,035
- The flip.
- Yes.

1759
01:16:31,365 --> 01:16:33,275
He must flip it in one try. He only gets one chance.

1760
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,476
Even if he messes everything up, if he successfully does this...

1761
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:37,275
- Will he take the gold medal?
- Yes.

1762
01:16:37,275 --> 01:16:38,375
- Can he take the gold medal?
- Yes.

1763
01:16:38,615 --> 01:16:41,046
There's one very important step left.

1764
01:16:41,415 --> 01:16:43,245
Shouldn't the judges open it themselves?

1765
01:16:43,245 --> 01:16:44,945
What? Me?

1766
01:16:45,386 --> 01:16:47,756
All of a sudden? Why would you want me to do that?

1767
01:16:47,756 --> 01:16:48,955
(He gets flustered after teasing him.)

1768
01:16:48,955 --> 01:16:50,525
- It could pop.
- Gosh. Okay.

1769
01:16:50,525 --> 01:16:52,556
- Okay.
- Don't worry. It won't pop.

1770
01:16:52,556 --> 01:16:54,226
Okay. This...

1771
01:16:54,226 --> 01:16:55,396
(The two of them work together in the important moment.)

1772
01:16:56,726 --> 01:16:57,766
Turn it.

1773
01:16:57,766 --> 01:16:59,566
(Is the meal...)

1774
01:16:59,566 --> 01:17:00,566
Right.

1775
01:17:00,566 --> 01:17:03,806
(fully cooked inside the pot?)

1776
01:17:04,205 --> 01:17:06,335
One, two, three.

1777
01:17:06,335 --> 01:17:07,976
(Their palms are sweating in this moment of truth.)

1778
01:17:08,846 --> 01:17:11,875
(How will the nurungji baeksuk look?)

1779
01:17:12,676 --> 01:17:14,346
Nice. Goodness.

1780
01:17:15,285 --> 01:17:18,415
(The baeksuk with a rich broth appears.)

1781
01:17:18,415 --> 01:17:19,455
(Exclaiming)

1782
01:17:20,085 --> 01:17:22,356
It looks incredible. This is...

1783
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:25,056
- This is like a tonic.
- It really is.

1784
01:17:25,756 --> 01:17:27,426
I think it's perfect. I think the nurungji is ready.

1785
01:17:27,426 --> 01:17:28,926
- I'm serious. I think it's ready.
- The broth...

1786
01:17:28,926 --> 01:17:31,325
Since we made it in a pressure cooker,

1787
01:17:31,325 --> 01:17:33,896
the broth is incredibly rich.

1788
01:17:34,296 --> 01:17:36,136
There's a reason why moms use pressure cookers.

1789
01:17:36,136 --> 01:17:38,006
There's a reason for it.

1790
01:17:38,006 --> 01:17:39,205
(The broth is filled with the nutrients from medicinal herbs.)

1791
01:17:39,476 --> 01:17:40,735
- I'm going to do it.
- Okay!

1792
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,875
I'm going to try flipping it.

1793
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:43,046
- Over there.
- Okay.

1794
01:17:43,945 --> 01:17:45,316
Forty years of experience.

1795
01:17:45,316 --> 01:17:46,346
(The flip that came from 40 years of experience)

1796
01:17:46,346 --> 01:17:47,346
How will you do it?

1797
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:48,985
Must you cover it?

1798
01:17:50,146 --> 01:17:53,915
(Dong Il grabs the plate for the flip.)

1799
01:17:55,356 --> 01:17:56,485
First...

1800
01:17:56,485 --> 01:17:57,756
- Goodness.
- It must be heavy.

1801
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:59,396
- I should hold the table.
- Okay.

1802
01:18:00,356 --> 01:18:01,796
- Put on some gloves.
- Over there.

1803
01:18:01,796 --> 01:18:04,096
On the count of three, we're going to flip it together.

1804
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,096
Me?

1805
01:18:05,835 --> 01:18:06,865
Put on some gloves.

1806
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:08,966
(He's flustered because he must keep sharing in his fate.)

1807
01:18:08,966 --> 01:18:10,566
Dong Il, I don't think I should do it.

1808
01:18:11,006 --> 01:18:12,205
Would it be okay for me to do this?

1809
01:18:12,436 --> 01:18:13,535
- Really?
- Yes.

1810
01:18:13,535 --> 01:18:14,575
(Serious, even more serious)

1811
01:18:14,575 --> 01:18:15,575
Youngest, move out of the way.

1812
01:18:16,075 --> 01:18:18,415
- How should we flip it?
- Hold it like this. With this.

1813
01:18:18,415 --> 01:18:19,646
- I got it.
- Okay.

1814
01:18:19,646 --> 01:18:21,646
As long as this doesn't come off, the broth won't leak.

1815
01:18:21,646 --> 01:18:24,016
- Make sure to hold it tightly.
- Okay. I got it.

1816
01:18:24,016 --> 01:18:26,155
- Do you have it?
- Yes. Hold on!

1817
01:18:26,155 --> 01:18:27,216
(Hold on!)

1818
01:18:27,756 --> 01:18:30,155
(He rehearses because he's overly nervous.)

1819
01:18:30,155 --> 01:18:31,485
A rehearsal.

1820
01:18:32,426 --> 01:18:33,455
Pick it up.

1821
01:18:34,325 --> 01:18:35,896
- Isn't it heavy?
- Yes.

1822
01:18:36,495 --> 01:18:38,936
Okay. You guys have one chance to flip it.

1823
01:18:38,936 --> 01:18:40,695
(It's time to really flip it.)

1824
01:18:40,865 --> 01:18:42,566
- Right. We got this.
- It won't spill.

1825
01:18:42,566 --> 01:18:43,566
(Ha Nee is nervous.)

1826
01:18:43,835 --> 01:18:45,375
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1827
01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:48,905
(They flip it together on the count of three.)

1828
01:18:52,476 --> 01:18:53,516
We did it.

1829
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:54,915
(We have perfect teamwork.)

1830
01:18:54,915 --> 01:18:58,085
- We got it!
- The first step was a success!

1831
01:18:59,386 --> 01:19:04,226
(They're happy even if it's just the 1st step.)

1832
01:19:04,226 --> 01:19:05,856
- Okay.
- We didn't spill a single drop!

1833
01:19:05,856 --> 01:19:06,856
Not at all!

1834
01:19:06,856 --> 01:19:08,995
- We didn't spill a single drop!
- Okay. Let's open it.

1835
01:19:09,566 --> 01:19:11,365
- We can be sure this was a success.
- Okay. One.

1836
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:15,365
Lift it and hit the bottom in case the nurungji is stuck.

1837
01:19:15,365 --> 01:19:16,705
I knew it.

1838
01:19:16,705 --> 01:19:17,936
(Calm)

1839
01:19:18,066 --> 01:19:20,835
- Okay, now...
- We can be sure this was a success.

1840
01:19:20,835 --> 01:19:23,046
This is the last step to win.

1841
01:19:23,205 --> 01:19:26,316
(Will the nurungji look pretty...)

1842
01:19:27,046 --> 01:19:30,245
(once they remove the pot?)

1843
01:19:30,846 --> 01:19:34,686
(The final blow that will determine everything)

1844
01:19:35,256 --> 01:19:36,256
One.

1845
01:19:36,256 --> 01:19:38,655
(What will...)

1846
01:19:38,655 --> 01:19:39,655
Two.

1847
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:42,325
(the nurungji...)

1848
01:19:42,325 --> 01:19:43,325
Three.

1849
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:45,966
(look like?)

1850
01:19:46,465 --> 01:19:47,465
One.

1851
01:19:47,465 --> 01:19:49,936
(What will...)

1852
01:19:49,936 --> 01:19:50,936
Two.

1853
01:19:50,936 --> 01:19:53,675
(the nurungji...)

1854
01:19:53,675 --> 01:19:54,705
- Three.
- Three.

1855
01:19:54,705 --> 01:19:56,345
(look like?)

1856
01:19:56,675 --> 01:19:58,076
- This is the last step to win.
- One, two,

1857
01:19:58,076 --> 01:19:59,085
- three.
- Three.

1858
01:20:03,186 --> 01:20:05,326
(Did it come off?)

1859
01:20:06,356 --> 01:20:08,455
(It's stuck to the bottom.)

1860
01:20:09,226 --> 01:20:10,856
Cover it back up!

1861
01:20:10,856 --> 01:20:11,965
Wait. Pick it up.

1862
01:20:12,095 --> 01:20:13,896
None of the rice came off.

1863
01:20:15,335 --> 01:20:16,335
(This isn't good.)

1864
01:20:16,335 --> 01:20:17,965
- Should we scrape it off?
- Bring a ladle.

1865
01:20:17,965 --> 01:20:20,465
- Okay.
- None of the rice came off.

1866
01:20:20,665 --> 01:20:22,406
- Gosh.
- Dong Il, what is this?

1867
01:20:22,406 --> 01:20:24,436
No, wait. Put it down.

1868
01:20:24,436 --> 01:20:25,606
- Okay. Flip it.
- What are we doing?

1869
01:20:25,606 --> 01:20:26,845
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1870
01:20:28,175 --> 01:20:30,915
(He hits it desperately.)

1871
01:20:34,316 --> 01:20:35,986
(Did it work?)

1872
01:20:35,986 --> 01:20:37,656
- You got it! It came off! Perfect!
- It came off!

1873
01:20:37,656 --> 01:20:39,955
(The bottom came right off!)

1874
01:20:39,955 --> 01:20:41,955
We got it! Look.

1875
01:20:41,955 --> 01:20:43,396
(The nurungji baeksuk they were waiting for is ready!)

1876
01:20:43,396 --> 01:20:45,226
(Giggling)

1877
01:20:45,665 --> 01:20:47,595
It came out perfectly.

1878
01:20:48,425 --> 01:20:49,465
We got it.

1879
01:20:50,366 --> 01:20:53,165
- Gosh, it's so funny.
- What is it?

1880
01:20:53,165 --> 01:20:54,705
(He retouches it carefully.)

1881
01:20:54,705 --> 01:20:56,335
(The look of the dish is important in House on Wheels.)

1882
01:20:57,135 --> 01:20:58,745
Don't be surprised when you eat it.

1883
01:20:58,745 --> 01:20:59,946
- Right.
- Okay.

1884
01:20:59,946 --> 01:21:01,005
It looks really good.

1885
01:21:01,646 --> 01:21:03,016
- Okay.
- Nice.

1886
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:05,045
- This is fantastic.
- It's the best.

1887
01:21:05,345 --> 01:21:08,486
- It looks really good.
- It looks incredible.

1888
01:21:08,755 --> 01:21:12,625
Honestly, we don't know how it's supposed to look.

1889
01:21:12,625 --> 01:21:13,726
Right.

1890
01:21:13,726 --> 01:21:14,826
(He's worried...)

1891
01:21:14,826 --> 01:21:17,056
(about how it looks.)

1892
01:21:17,425 --> 01:21:20,965
(Anxious)

1893
01:21:20,965 --> 01:21:23,035
- Okay.
- Okay.

1894
01:21:23,035 --> 01:21:24,165
(Chef Sung was really nervous for the first time.)

1895
01:21:24,165 --> 01:21:26,106
Okay. The guest should eat first.

1896
01:21:26,106 --> 01:21:27,205
It's a clean spoon,

1897
01:21:27,205 --> 01:21:28,976
- so scoop some up. Try the nurungi.
- Okay.

1898
01:21:28,976 --> 01:21:30,635
- Want me to do it for you?
- Yes, please.

1899
01:21:31,135 --> 01:21:33,076
Okay. First...

1900
01:21:33,076 --> 01:21:36,616
- This is nurungji.
- Goodness.

1901
01:21:37,816 --> 01:21:40,085
Here. Try some. Seriously.

1902
01:21:40,085 --> 01:21:41,385
(The glutinous rice nurungji that Chef Sung put special care into)

1903
01:21:41,385 --> 01:21:43,656
- Scoop it up.
- Youngest, try it.

1904
01:21:44,986 --> 01:21:47,556
Hee Won, have some nurungji. Try it.

1905
01:21:48,226 --> 01:21:49,826
- Try it.
- I...

1906
01:21:49,826 --> 01:21:52,266
(How does the nurungji baeksuk made with the 40-year-old recipe taste?)

1907
01:21:53,165 --> 01:21:55,026
(Taking a bite)

1908
01:21:55,026 --> 01:21:56,665
- It's expensive.
- Try some.

1909
01:21:56,665 --> 01:22:00,205
(Taking a bite)

1910
01:22:00,635 --> 01:22:04,505
(I hope it tastes good.)

1911
01:22:05,806 --> 01:22:06,845
Hey, Youngest.

1912
01:22:06,845 --> 01:22:08,505
(After taking a bite,)

1913
01:22:08,505 --> 01:22:09,545
(she exclaims.)

1914
01:22:09,545 --> 01:22:11,446
- Eat up.
- Have a bite.

1915
01:22:11,446 --> 01:22:13,146
- Dong Il.
- Try some.

1916
01:22:13,146 --> 01:22:14,215
It's really good.

1917
01:22:15,316 --> 01:22:16,455
- Is it?
- Yes.

1918
01:22:16,455 --> 01:22:17,955
(Is it good?)

1919
01:22:18,215 --> 01:22:20,726
Hee Won. Here. Try some.

1920
01:22:20,726 --> 01:22:22,856
- It's really good. Right?
- I...

1921
01:22:23,226 --> 01:22:24,295
Seriously.

1922
01:22:24,295 --> 01:22:25,826
(It's hot.)

1923
01:22:26,995 --> 01:22:29,696
I don't have to try it to know it tastes good.

1924
01:22:30,366 --> 01:22:33,406
(Chef Sung finally takes a bite.)

1925
01:22:33,665 --> 01:22:35,005
- It's good.
- It is.

1926
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:36,576
It tastes like porridge.

1927
01:22:38,845 --> 01:22:41,505
(Hee Won, who has a child-like palate, takes a bite too.)

1928
01:22:42,045 --> 01:22:43,646
(Exclaiming)

1929
01:22:43,646 --> 01:22:44,915
(It's good.)

1930
01:22:44,915 --> 01:22:47,215
The glutinous rice is so chewy.

1931
01:22:47,215 --> 01:22:48,316
Right?

1932
01:22:48,316 --> 01:22:49,686
It's no joke.

1933
01:22:49,686 --> 01:22:51,415
(How is it so sticky?)

1934
01:22:51,856 --> 01:22:53,955
(Chewing)

1935
01:22:54,326 --> 01:22:55,425
This is so good.

1936
01:22:55,425 --> 01:22:56,455
(The air is filled with the sound of them chewing.)

1937
01:22:58,295 --> 01:22:59,465
It's like an herbal tonic.

1938
01:22:59,726 --> 01:23:01,566
- Doesn't it taste like that?
- It does.

1939
01:23:02,736 --> 01:23:04,835
(Proud)

1940
01:23:04,835 --> 01:23:06,566
- Glutinous rice? Here.
- Okay.

1941
01:23:06,736 --> 01:23:08,705
This is real red ginseng extract.

1942
01:23:09,035 --> 01:23:11,276
Let's put all of this in since it's good for you.

1943
01:23:12,035 --> 01:23:16,915
(He put a lot of care into it for 40 minutes.)

1944
01:23:17,545 --> 01:23:20,316
It's impossible for it to taste bad.

1945
01:23:20,316 --> 01:23:22,316
The care you put into it and the ingredients you used...

1946
01:23:22,316 --> 01:23:24,385
You can taste the medicinal herbs. The taste of licorice.

1947
01:23:24,385 --> 01:23:27,486
(Healthy nurungji baeksuk)

1948
01:23:30,226 --> 01:23:33,595
(She knits her brows since it's so good.)

1949
01:23:33,896 --> 01:23:35,295
Youngest. Have the drumstick.

1950
01:23:36,866 --> 01:23:38,266
- You can have it.
- Thank you.

1951
01:23:38,266 --> 01:23:39,335
Eat up.

1952
01:23:41,205 --> 01:23:44,076
- Ha Nee, have the drumstick.
- Thank you.

1953
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:45,776
Eat the leg.

1954
01:23:46,306 --> 01:23:47,375
Hee Won.

1955
01:23:47,705 --> 01:23:49,745
Yes. Is it chicken breast?

1956
01:23:49,745 --> 01:23:51,175
- Yes.
- I like it.

1957
01:23:52,745 --> 01:23:55,915
(Chicken breast lover)

1958
01:23:56,116 --> 01:23:57,156
(He eats a piece.)

1959
01:23:58,085 --> 01:23:59,085
(He eats another piece.)

1960
01:24:01,686 --> 01:24:05,056
(He's completely entranced by the baeksuk.)

1961
01:24:08,425 --> 01:24:09,436
(Exclaiming)

1962
01:24:09,696 --> 01:24:12,766
- The meat tastes good.
- It's no joke.

1963
01:24:12,766 --> 01:24:14,965
(The chicken is filled with healthy flavors.)

1964
01:24:15,366 --> 01:24:16,476
(He takes a spoonful of rice.)

1965
01:24:16,476 --> 01:24:18,675
- The food is optimistic.
- It is.

1966
01:24:18,675 --> 01:24:23,816
(Then he gets some of the seasoned chamnamul.)

1967
01:24:23,946 --> 01:24:26,885
(Nervous)

1968
01:24:27,085 --> 01:24:28,215
I'm not satisfied.

1969
01:24:28,616 --> 01:24:29,986
Anyone would tell you that it's salty.

1970
01:24:29,986 --> 01:24:31,785
(This is the seasoned chamnamul that Ha Nee made. Beware, it's salty.)

1971
01:24:32,518 --> 01:24:36,217
(He's the first to try Ha Nee's seasoned chamnamul.)

1972
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:39,087
(Worried)

1973
01:24:43,058 --> 01:24:44,597
- Dong Il.
- Dip it in the salt.

1974
01:24:44,597 --> 01:24:46,427
The seasoned chamnamul is good too.

1975
01:24:46,967 --> 01:24:48,068
Is it okay?

1976
01:24:48,068 --> 01:24:49,198
(Does it taste okay?)

1977
01:24:50,238 --> 01:24:51,268
Yes.

1978
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:53,408
(Exclaiming)

1979
01:24:53,537 --> 01:24:54,738
- It's good.
- It's really good.

1980
01:24:54,738 --> 01:24:56,078
It's really good.

1981
01:24:57,078 --> 01:24:58,478
- Doesn't it go well together?
- It does.

1982
01:24:58,478 --> 01:24:59,778
The seasoned chamnamul is good.

1983
01:25:00,847 --> 01:25:02,677
This is really good.

1984
01:25:03,518 --> 01:25:04,717
It's the best.

1985
01:25:04,717 --> 01:25:08,847
(The seasoned chamnamul satisfies the family's palates.)

1986
01:25:09,217 --> 01:25:12,058
- This is...
- It goes great together.

1987
01:25:12,058 --> 01:25:13,957
- It does.
- It really does.

1988
01:25:16,627 --> 01:25:18,828
(When the bland chicken baeksuk...)

1989
01:25:18,828 --> 01:25:21,328
(and the salty seasoned chamnamul meet...)

1990
01:25:22,127 --> 01:25:24,297
The chicken and chamnamul go great together.

1991
01:25:24,297 --> 01:25:25,368
I know.

1992
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:28,037
(It wasn't intentional,)

1993
01:25:28,037 --> 01:25:31,837
(but the two dishes complement each other perfectly!)

1994
01:25:31,978 --> 01:25:35,377
- This is incredibly good.
- Goodness.

1995
01:25:35,377 --> 01:25:36,818
Right? The chamnamul is good.

1996
01:25:37,278 --> 01:25:38,278
It is.

1997
01:25:38,818 --> 01:25:41,217
(She's happy to see everyone enjoy it.)

1998
01:25:41,387 --> 01:25:42,417
- I knew it.
- Right?

1999
01:25:42,417 --> 01:25:43,587
(I knew Ha Nee could do it.)

2000
01:25:43,858 --> 01:25:47,488
All of this goes perfectly together. The doenjang and the chamnamul...

2001
01:25:48,957 --> 01:25:50,427
- Was this a success?
- Of course.

2002
01:25:50,427 --> 01:25:52,528
What's my score? How would you score me as a judge?

2003
01:25:53,068 --> 01:25:55,768
I think that you deserve a 9.7.

2004
01:25:56,037 --> 01:25:57,238
- Really?
- Of course.

2005
01:25:57,238 --> 01:25:58,268
- It's that good?
- Yes.

2006
01:25:58,698 --> 01:26:01,408
It's one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had.

2007
01:26:04,608 --> 01:26:07,608
(This is rewarding.)

2008
01:26:07,608 --> 01:26:09,478
I think he didn't answer on purpose.

2009
01:26:09,478 --> 01:26:10,778
He wanted me to do it on my own.

2010
01:26:10,778 --> 01:26:11,847
Right.

2011
01:26:11,847 --> 01:26:14,118
(Let's say he trusted Chef Sung and didn't answer on purpose.)

2012
01:26:14,118 --> 01:26:16,018
- We have to think positively.
- Right.

2013
01:26:16,018 --> 01:26:18,787
(It's really good.)

2014
01:26:19,688 --> 01:26:20,927
I ate so well.

2015
01:26:20,927 --> 01:26:23,497
I feel like I've become healthier after that meal.

2016
01:26:23,497 --> 01:26:24,828
- Thank you so much for the food.
- Thank you so much.

2017
01:26:24,828 --> 01:26:25,967
It was really...

2018
01:26:25,967 --> 01:26:27,328
- It was the best.
- It was good.

2019
01:26:28,297 --> 01:26:29,667
The breeze is so nice.

2020
01:26:29,667 --> 01:26:31,037
- I agree.
- It's really nice.

2021
01:26:32,738 --> 01:26:34,007
- The breeze is so nice.
- It is.

2022
01:26:34,467 --> 01:26:37,207
Aside from when it's really hot in the middle of the day,

2023
01:26:37,207 --> 01:26:39,808
- It's cool. It's nice.
- it's the perfect autumn weather.

2024
01:26:40,078 --> 01:26:41,377
How refreshing.

2025
01:26:41,377 --> 01:26:42,747
(The fall wind makes them happy.)

2026
01:26:42,747 --> 01:26:43,747
It is.

2027
01:26:44,717 --> 01:26:47,547
(Grinding)

2028
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:52,427
(The youngest member is making coffee.)

2029
01:26:53,188 --> 01:26:57,158
(And Hee Won is taking out an LP?)

2030
01:26:58,028 --> 01:27:01,028
(Does he want to listen to music?)

2031
01:27:01,068 --> 01:27:02,568
(Pressing)

2032
01:27:02,568 --> 01:27:03,667
Do you want to listen to music?

2033
01:27:04,097 --> 01:27:06,637
Yes, but I don't think this is charged.

2034
01:27:06,637 --> 01:27:07,637
I see.

2035
01:27:10,207 --> 01:27:11,938
It should start spinning when I do this,

2036
01:27:11,938 --> 01:27:12,948
but it won't.

2037
01:27:13,847 --> 01:27:15,847
- This is...
- I got it.

2038
01:27:15,847 --> 01:27:16,847
(He resolves it.)

2039
01:27:16,847 --> 01:27:18,377
- Is this the battery?
- Yes.

2040
01:27:18,377 --> 01:27:20,148
Right. This worked earlier.

2041
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:22,988
- You...
- How do I do it?

2042
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:24,158
(Hee Won is still unfamiliar with the house,)

2043
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:28,457
(and the youngest member has gotten used to it.)

2044
01:27:29,297 --> 01:27:31,797
(Packing)

2045
01:27:33,528 --> 01:27:36,167
Don't take your things out until it's time to leave.

2046
01:27:36,667 --> 01:27:38,337
(She checks out with a big bag of things.)

2047
01:27:38,337 --> 01:27:40,738
Oh, really? Okay. I won't.

2048
01:27:41,037 --> 01:27:43,637
(She got in trouble for taking out her things.)

2049
01:27:43,637 --> 01:27:44,808
No, I just... Goodness.

2050
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:48,177
- She's ready to leave already.
- That's not true.

2051
01:27:48,177 --> 01:27:50,148
- That's how everyone is!
- I'm not!

2052
01:27:50,148 --> 01:27:51,247
What's the point of feeding them well?

2053
01:27:51,247 --> 01:27:52,618
All they want to do is leave.

2054
01:27:52,618 --> 01:27:54,118
Don't say that.

2055
01:27:55,118 --> 01:27:58,417
(He plays some music so that Ha Nee doesn't leave.)

2056
01:28:02,257 --> 01:28:03,997
Myoung, congratulations on joining the family.

2057
01:28:03,997 --> 01:28:05,028
Thank you.

2058
01:28:05,028 --> 01:28:07,398
(Myoung, congratulations on joining the family.)

2059
01:28:09,097 --> 01:28:13,438
(How nice.)

2060
01:28:13,808 --> 01:28:17,007
("You in My Arms" by Yoo Jae Ha)

2061
01:28:21,078 --> 01:28:26,688
(Ha Nee quietly sings along.)

2062
01:28:27,287 --> 01:28:29,757
(He raises his arms automatically.)

2063
01:28:29,757 --> 01:28:31,417
(Ignoring)

2064
01:28:31,717 --> 01:28:34,188
(Hee Won, let's do it together!)

2065
01:28:34,787 --> 01:28:36,658
Are you going to make us look stupid?

2066
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:39,497
- It's childish.
- Still, try it.

2067
01:28:41,167 --> 01:28:42,467
(They laugh, thanks to Hee Won who doesn't like childish things.)

2068
01:28:42,467 --> 01:28:45,097
It's so childish. That's enough.

2069
01:28:46,837 --> 01:28:50,007
(Gosh, he's silly.)

2070
01:28:51,177 --> 01:28:52,948
Have you had this, honey?

2071
01:28:52,948 --> 01:28:53,948
Goodness.

2072
01:28:53,948 --> 01:28:55,007
(Thank you, darling.)

2073
01:28:55,278 --> 01:28:57,478
Snap out of it!

2074
01:28:57,478 --> 01:29:00,118
You're doing it every time he speaks.

2075
01:29:00,118 --> 01:29:02,047
The relationship setup is a mess.

2076
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:03,658
(Laughing)

2077
01:29:03,658 --> 01:29:05,927
Your brother has got a temper, honey.

2078
01:29:05,927 --> 01:29:09,558
(The role-play doesn't seem to end.)

2079
01:29:09,558 --> 01:29:11,398
We should put...

2080
01:29:11,398 --> 01:29:13,167
a refrigerator in his room.

2081
01:29:13,167 --> 01:29:15,728
We should buy him a boiler. He's pretty old now.

2082
01:29:16,738 --> 01:29:20,337
(Soothing their regrets of not wanting to leave)

2083
01:29:20,337 --> 01:29:22,467
In 1, 2.

2084
01:29:22,467 --> 01:29:23,938
(The family members enjoy their time left.)

2085
01:29:23,938 --> 01:29:26,177
- Okay.
- Good.

2086
01:29:26,177 --> 01:29:30,078
(They make amusing memories again.)

2087
01:29:30,078 --> 01:29:32,448
(Their second destination on House on Wheels 3)

2088
01:29:33,018 --> 01:29:34,847
(This place is amazing!)

2089
01:29:35,547 --> 01:29:37,257
(The endless field...)

2090
01:29:37,257 --> 01:29:38,957
(of buckwheat right in front of them)

2091
01:29:39,427 --> 01:29:41,988
(Who's the guest that Dong Il rushes to greet?)

2092
01:29:42,058 --> 01:29:43,828
(It's a guest as warm as autumn sunlight.)

2093
01:29:44,358 --> 01:29:46,627
(Dong Il's mother figure, Kim Young Ok)

2094
01:29:46,627 --> 01:29:51,097
(Dong Il is especially dedicated today.)

2095
01:29:51,097 --> 01:29:52,467
(Stop doing your best,)

2096
01:29:52,467 --> 01:29:53,537
(and just give it to me already.)

2097
01:29:53,868 --> 01:29:56,738
(Taken aback)

2098
01:29:57,938 --> 01:29:59,547
(I'm starving.)

2099
01:29:59,547 --> 01:30:01,177
(He's in for it today.)

2100
01:30:01,177 --> 01:30:03,478
(Working hard)

2101
01:30:03,478 --> 01:30:06,188
(The big brother seems small when his mother is here.)

2102
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:08,087
(Mom, here's a blanket.)

2103
01:30:08,347 --> 01:30:10,217
(It's scorching out. Why would I need a blanket?)

2104
01:30:10,217 --> 01:30:11,587
(Oh...)

2105
01:30:11,757 --> 01:30:14,058
(Dong Il keeps making them laugh today.)

2106
01:30:14,387 --> 01:30:15,427
(It seems...)

2107
01:30:15,427 --> 01:30:17,728
(that you've also got a temper, Mom.)

2108
01:30:18,427 --> 01:30:19,497
(How will Dong Il's day...)

2109
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:21,368
(go with his mom?)

2110
01:30:21,427 --> 01:30:22,938
(Small, fun things they run into)

2111
01:30:22,938 --> 01:30:24,768
(This one is completely open.)

2112
01:30:24,768 --> 01:30:26,467
(Just like a little child,)

2113
01:30:26,467 --> 01:30:28,738
(Young Ok is happy as ever.)

2114
01:30:28,738 --> 01:30:31,278
(Mom, you'll be too sad to leave this place.)

2115
01:30:31,278 --> 01:30:33,207
(Blissful time in the front yard)

2116
01:30:33,207 --> 01:30:36,018
(Come to House on Wheels where warm laughter is.)
