1
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:29,168
(A night in late autumn is colder and has a better view of the stars.)

2
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:35,079
(After the first night in Hongcheon Ginkgo Forest...)

3
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:42,851
(It's early dawn that's still surrounded by darkness.)

4
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:47,217
(Everyone is sound asleep.)

5
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:51,128
(UIe is also sound asleep in the tent.)

6
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:53,697
(Clattering)

7
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:55,128
(Thumping)

8
00:00:56,228 --> 00:01:02,668
(Dong Il is up early at dawn?)

9
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:07,338
(He carefully prepares the fire pit.)

10
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:10,278
(Clicking)

11
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:14,178
(Suddenly waking up)

12
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:19,017
(What is this sound?)

13
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:22,788
(Dong Il wearing a hoodie)

14
00:01:22,987 --> 00:01:25,388
(Who is that?)

15
00:01:26,457 --> 00:01:30,068
(She wears her glasses to see properly.)

16
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:34,698
(Where did he go?)

17
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:39,778
(She stretches now that she's up.)

18
00:01:41,107 --> 00:01:44,808
(She cleans up her bed first.)

19
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:46,247
UIe!

20
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:49,087
Wasn't it cold? Did you sleep well?

21
00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:50,117
(Good morning.)

22
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:52,186
- Wasn't it cold?
- It was so warm.

23
00:01:52,187 --> 00:01:55,057
- Really?
- My back is so warm.

24
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:56,058
(It's a relief, then.)

25
00:01:56,928 --> 00:01:59,028
UIe, have a seat. It's warm.

26
00:02:01,398 --> 00:02:04,728
(He sits UIe in front of the warm fire as she's a guest.)

27
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:09,668
(Is he back in the house?)

28
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:14,707
(Sneaking)

29
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:23,117
(Taking something out of the refrigerator)

30
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:28,087
(He also takes cooking utensils outside.)

31
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:31,658
I want to feed Ji Hoon breakfast before he leaves.

32
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:38,728
(Ji Hoon has to leave early for another shoot.)

33
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:42,337
(Ji Hoon has to leave at 7am.)

34
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:46,978
(Dong Il got up early in the morning to give breakfast to Ji Hoon.)

35
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:50,748
When you put chicken breast into a beef soup,

36
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:54,918
it'll be like warm gomtang.

37
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:57,016
(He cooks breakfast for Ji Hoon.)

38
00:02:57,017 --> 00:02:58,087
It'll be hot soup.

39
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:02,627
Come here and take a seat.

40
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:04,526
(It's time to get warmed up by the morning bonfire.)

41
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:05,927
It's nice in the morning, isn't it?

42
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,397
- You wanted to try this, right?
- Yes.

43
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:13,068
I'm doing everything I wanted to do here.

44
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:17,408
This is nice.

45
00:03:19,237 --> 00:03:20,877
(The early morning air you can only feel before sunrise)

46
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:22,008
I love it.

47
00:03:22,508 --> 00:03:24,776
- It's not even that cold.
- You're right.

48
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:27,577
- Is it because of the fire?
- This is the good part.

49
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:31,318
Picture yourself here at this hour...

50
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:33,857
with someone you love.

51
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:38,288
I haven't been able to go on a trip with my wife that often.

52
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:41,326
I try to take her now,

53
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:42,826
but it's not so easy.

54
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:47,236
When you have time, going on a trip with your father...

55
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:52,236
will be the greatest gift he can ever imagine.

56
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:53,837
- Just you and your father.
- I should try that.

57
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:56,077
When my daughters grow up...

58
00:03:56,948 --> 00:03:59,077
and ask, "Are you free for three days?"

59
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:00,676
"Let's go on a trip together."

60
00:04:00,677 --> 00:04:03,587
Then I would cut down on sleep to do that.

61
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:07,788
- I should ask him.
- Yes.

62
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:12,457
When would a father ever get to go on a trip...

63
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:14,758
with his grown-up daughter?

64
00:04:15,998 --> 00:04:17,968
Do you spend a lot of time with your father?

65
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:19,437
Do you drink with him?

66
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:20,966
- So...
- Do you often talk?

67
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:23,107
- Actually, we're not that...
- You don't talk much.

68
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:24,766
I wasn't the friendliest daughter.

69
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,336
My older sister was, though.

70
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:28,377
I stayed in Seoul by myself when I was a trainee.

71
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:31,206
When my dad asked, I used to indifferently say, "I'm doing well."

72
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:32,747
I'm still pretty curt.

73
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:36,347
But I got used to keeping everything to myself after I debuted.

74
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:40,417
And my father was a public figure.

75
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:42,086
So he used to...

76
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:44,156
- pat me on the back saying, - Your father?

77
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:47,026
"I know how you feel," and it felt different from my mom.

78
00:04:47,027 --> 00:04:48,227
That must be different.

79
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:52,067
(Her dad comforted her...)

80
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:54,138
(when she just stepped out into the real world.)

81
00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:57,007
(The father and daughter are much closer now that they understand.)

82
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:59,638
I wouldn't be able to completely understand...

83
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:02,547
how much he struggled...

84
00:05:02,548 --> 00:05:04,447
as the head of the household,

85
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:08,017
but I sometimes feel that he's gone through a lot.

86
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:10,688
Just a little sense of it.

87
00:05:11,388 --> 00:05:13,216
(You finally understand your parents...)

88
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:15,017
(after time.)

89
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:19,628
(And an hour later)

90
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:25,298
Mom.

91
00:05:26,138 --> 00:05:27,267
Did you sleep well?

92
00:05:28,698 --> 00:05:30,706
(UIe called her parents during break time.)

93
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:32,267
Yes, I'm having fun, Dad.

94
00:05:33,638 --> 00:05:36,378
Dad, Dong Il recommended...

95
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:39,248
that I go on a trip with you.

96
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:43,617
He said that it'd be a great gift as a daughter...

97
00:05:43,618 --> 00:05:45,818
to ask you to go on a trip.

98
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:48,456
Really? Okay.

99
00:05:48,457 --> 00:05:50,688
I'll come by to have a barbecue with you.

100
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:53,928
Okay. I love you.

101
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:55,897
Bye.

102
00:05:56,667 --> 00:06:00,897
(Her heart warms up in the morning just because of one short call.)

103
00:06:04,124 --> 00:06:08,663
(Ji Hoon who set the alarm also wakes up.)

104
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:12,133
(He wakes up half-asleep...)

105
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:13,249
(and bumps his head on the ceiling.)

106
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:16,104
(Ouch.)

107
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:19,944
(No one saw that, right?)

108
00:06:21,273 --> 00:06:22,443
(He forgets about the pain...)

109
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:25,083
(and climbs down with his long legs.)

110
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:29,884
(Ji Hoon gets ready to leave.)

111
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:33,723
Oh, Rain.

112
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,023
You still look like Rain when you just woke up.

113
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:37,494
(The world star always looks good.)

114
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:39,223
You look great, Ji Hoon.

115
00:06:39,393 --> 00:06:40,893
- Good morning, Ji Hoon.
- Take a seat.

116
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:44,333
(He finishes up his cooking as Ji Hoon is awake.)

117
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:48,833
(Seasoning it with the 8-year-old shrimp jeotgal)

118
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:53,643
(Tasting the soup)

119
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:55,044
(Amazed)

120
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:56,113
- It's so...
- Is it good?

121
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:58,184
Ji Hoon. You won't regret it.

122
00:06:59,513 --> 00:07:00,913
I highly recommend this.

123
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:03,722
(Well-boiled chicken breast)

124
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,884
This is chicken breast.

125
00:07:06,823 --> 00:07:08,194
And hot soup.

126
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:10,892
I wouldn't let you go without a meal.

127
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:12,323
(Beef bone broth to warm up his stomach)

128
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:16,934
I tried this at home, and it was insanely good.

129
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:20,174
It must be so filling in the morning.

130
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:21,903
Try the soup first.

131
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:25,504
- It looks...
- Yes?

132
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:28,614
like samgyetang with ginseng.

133
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:32,283
Consider it morning soup. It's hot.

134
00:07:34,984 --> 00:07:38,584
(He tries the soup first.)

135
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:42,454
Just the soup is good. A hot bowl of soup.

136
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:47,893
(He tries the moist chicken breast as well.)

137
00:07:50,163 --> 00:07:51,203
Right?

138
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,873
Then the soup makes it chicken gomtang.

139
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:54,104
(You're eating well.)

140
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:59,413
(While Ji Hoon fills his stomach with chicken gomtang, )

141
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:03,744
(the youngest wakes up.)

142
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,484
(He didn't already leave, did he?)

143
00:08:06,984 --> 00:08:09,384
(He hurriedly gets up.)

144
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:15,354
(Why is he missing a sock?)

145
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:19,124
(Where's my sock?)

146
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:23,763
(He goes through his comforter.)

147
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:28,974
(He can't find it anywhere.)

148
00:08:30,204 --> 00:08:32,974
(Where on earth are you?)

149
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,443
(Is it in my pocket?)

150
00:08:40,183 --> 00:08:43,683
(He spots his sock on the 1st floor.)

151
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:47,324
(We assume that he threw it while he was asleep.)

152
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:50,494
(Myoung is free.)

153
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:51,594
- Good morning.
- Did you sleep well?

154
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:52,662
(Bowing)

155
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:54,263
Good morning.

156
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:55,963
- Did you sleep well, Youngest?
- Yes.

157
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:58,633
Good. You came outside to see Ji Hoon off.

158
00:08:58,634 --> 00:08:59,672
He has to go now.

159
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,533
Thank you for the food. Bye.

160
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,204
- See you at the filming site.
- See you.

161
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,543
See you later.

162
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:07,113
We won't go out too far. The gate is way too far.

163
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,012
Don't worry about that. The gate is right here.

164
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:10,613
That's right. We can't go that far.

165
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:11,883
(I should say goodbye to Hee Won.)

166
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,484
Don't worry about Hee Won.

167
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:15,052
(I'll tell him you left.)

168
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:16,053
Go ahead.

169
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:17,782
- Bye.
- Bye, Ji Hoon.

170
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:19,253
- Bye.
- See you.

171
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:21,594
- Goodbye.
- You're leaving at 7:05am.

172
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:23,464
Come again.

173
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:25,693
- Bring the other side of the ribs.
- Okay.

174
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:27,032
I'll come again.

175
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,834
(Go back safely.)

176
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:32,432
He has to work right away when he gets there.

177
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:33,474
(Worried about Ji Hoon)

178
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:36,673
It's a commercial deal. He has to go.

179
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:40,143
I wish I could leave at this hour for a commercial.

180
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:41,613
(You don't mean that.)

181
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,643
Have a seat.

182
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,182
He's so heartless. He really left.

183
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:47,812
(Can the rest of the family members enjoy the morning?)

184
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:49,724
UIe, play some music.

185
00:09:50,153 --> 00:09:51,223
Whatever you want to listen to.

186
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,783
(Enthusiastically choosing a song)

187
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:57,324
(What's the morning song chosen by UIe?)

188
00:09:57,923 --> 00:09:59,993
I'm into this song these days. I listen to it every morning.

189
00:09:59,994 --> 00:10:01,033
Really?

190
00:10:01,094 --> 00:10:02,533
When I want to start the day on a lively note.

191
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:07,933
("Traffic Light" by Lee Mu Jin)

192
00:10:09,204 --> 00:10:11,004
You've got a good rhythm.

193
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:13,273
(Getting excited)

194
00:10:13,943 --> 00:10:17,543
(Let me in too.)

195
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,084
(He can't hide his excitement.)

196
00:10:20,513 --> 00:10:22,653
(An exciting morning in the ginkgo tree forest)

197
00:10:23,384 --> 00:10:24,384
(Youngest also bounces.)

198
00:10:24,385 --> 00:10:26,023
You've also got a good rhythm.

199
00:10:26,254 --> 00:10:28,293
(Shy)

200
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:31,923
(As they listen to music while grooving to the rhythm, )

201
00:10:33,063 --> 00:10:35,892
(today's sun rises beyond the colorful mountain.)

202
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:38,033
The sun is coming up. It's getting brighter.

203
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:39,263
You wanted to see it, didn't you?

204
00:10:39,364 --> 00:10:40,833
I've always wanted to see the sun come up.

205
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:43,773
(The sunlight gently shines their front yard.)

206
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,642
I always wake up around this time,

207
00:10:47,643 --> 00:10:48,873
and this is my favorite part of the day.

208
00:10:48,874 --> 00:10:50,042
(The early morning scenery is amazing at our house.)

209
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:51,084
It's my favorite part of the day.

210
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,183
(But it's still midnight for someone.)

211
00:10:57,153 --> 00:10:59,224
(Startled)

212
00:11:00,454 --> 00:11:02,053
(Blinking)

213
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,193
(He senses something is off.)

214
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:09,634
Myoung.

215
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,433
(Slowly realizing the situation)

216
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:15,974
Our grandpa is awake.

217
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:21,374
Good morning, Hee Won.

218
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:22,873
Good morning.

219
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:25,084
(Did you sleep well?)

220
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,854
(Half-asleep)

221
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:28,384
- Did Ji Hoon leave?
- Yes.

222
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,552
Already?

223
00:11:29,553 --> 00:11:30,652
I fed him...

224
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:34,454
gomtang and chicken breast for breakfast.

225
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:37,193
I didn't even say goodbye to him.

226
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:39,662
You should have woken me up.

227
00:11:39,663 --> 00:11:40,763
(They're all awake, including Hee Won.)

228
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,593
(Now that everyone is up...)

229
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:44,403
Excuse me.

230
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:48,032
(Grabbing a pear)

231
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:49,204
Should I peel this one?

232
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:54,074
(They feel awkward to be alone.)

233
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:56,073
(So you want a pear.)

234
00:11:56,074 --> 00:11:58,283
(Smiling)

235
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:00,553
(Bumping)

236
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,513
(She's a little clumsy.)

237
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,183
Goodness.

238
00:12:06,923 --> 00:12:08,523
I don't think I should use this knife.

239
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:10,824
It's too big.

240
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,432
(It looks too big to be a fruit knife.)

241
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,763
- Fruit in the morning is good.
- I'm not good at peeling fruit.

242
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:21,574
(Though she's poor, she does her best.)

243
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,973
Youngest's...

244
00:12:23,974 --> 00:12:25,344
beautiful coffee.

245
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:27,613
(The members gather by the fire.)

246
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,443
You should have woken me up when Ji Hoon left.

247
00:12:30,943 --> 00:12:32,213
We never wake each other up.

248
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:33,483
(See you in Seoul, Hee Won.)

249
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:34,783
Still, he was leaving.

250
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:36,214
Give him a call later.

251
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:38,053
Let's drink coffee.

252
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:40,754
- Goodness.
- This is...

253
00:12:41,224 --> 00:12:42,292
It's opening my eyes.

254
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:44,263
(The coffee is opening my eyes.)

255
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,693
(And a bite of the pear peeled by UIe)

256
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:52,364
After we eat this, let's wake ourselves up.

257
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,402
Let's go to a mineral spring.

258
00:12:54,403 --> 00:12:55,833
(Amazed)

259
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:58,203
Youngest, why don't we go to a mineral spring?

260
00:12:58,204 --> 00:12:59,504
(I'd love to.)

261
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:03,344
(Behind our backyard...)

262
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:08,013
(is the magnificent foot of the autumn mountain.)

263
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:11,984
(The mineral spring designated as a natural heritage)

264
00:13:14,224 --> 00:13:17,893
(Where fascinating bubbles come up)

265
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,994
When you cook rice with carbonated water, it's rich in iron.

266
00:13:22,864 --> 00:13:24,533
I hear the rice will be so nice and sticky.

267
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:26,303
(Amazed)

268
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:30,302
I'll make you some nutritious rice.

269
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:31,803
(Rice made of mineral water straight from the mountain)

270
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:34,874
(Looking forward to its taste)

271
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:36,883
Let's get going.

272
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:39,344
It takes about three minutes to the spring by car.

273
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:41,954
We need the container.

274
00:13:43,354 --> 00:13:45,254
- Here we go.
- Okay.

275
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,324
Will it turn green if we cook rice using carbonated water?

276
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:52,663
(Her heart palpitating)

277
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:55,163
It feels totally different with the sunlight.

278
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:56,604
It's nice.

279
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:00,273
It's so nice.

280
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:03,442
- Isn't this road beautiful?
- It sure is.

281
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,542
It's a gorgeous path.

282
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,672
We'll have a refreshing cup of mineral water.

283
00:14:06,673 --> 00:14:08,213
Right. It's beautiful.

284
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,013
(It's already a work of art on the way to the mineral spring.)

285
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,043
It's my first time going to a mineral spring at this hour.

286
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:16,214
Same here.

287
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:18,153
Definitely Hee Won's first.

288
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:20,324
- In my life?
- Yes.

289
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:22,893
I used to go to mineral spring every day when I was a kid.

290
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:25,094
- In the mountain in your town?
- Yes.

291
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:27,334
Why are you reacting so...

292
00:14:27,594 --> 00:14:29,633
I used to go there every day.

293
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:30,634
(Hee Won went to a mineral spring every morning?)

294
00:14:31,263 --> 00:14:34,172
When I grew up, it turned out not to be a mineral spring.

295
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,303
(A twist)

296
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:38,773
- You weren't supposed to have it?
- No, I'm serious.

297
00:14:39,374 --> 00:14:41,413
I was raised 20 years, drinking that water.

298
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:45,213
(Listening to Hee Won's heartbreaking past...)

299
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:47,182
We found out about it like 20 years later.

300
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:50,384
(They drive on the colorful path of autumn...)

301
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:55,224
(and arrive at the end of Mount Odae where the mineral spring is.)

302
00:14:56,464 --> 00:14:59,792
Here we are. The mineral spring.

303
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:01,293
Thank you.

304
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:03,963
(Sambong Mineral Water)

305
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:04,964
Listen to those birds.

306
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:06,933
(Sambong Mineral Water)

307
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,074
Now it smells like a mountain.

308
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:11,773
The smell...

309
00:15:15,443 --> 00:15:18,442
(No one has come by this early in the morning.)

310
00:15:18,443 --> 00:15:20,013
I love it so much.

311
00:15:21,884 --> 00:15:24,223
It's so nice in the morning.

312
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,954
(The members take their time to walk up.)

313
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:29,893
(Feeling the rays of sunlight that just reached the trees)

314
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:31,963
I feel great.

315
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:35,594
(They feel the autumn vibe that's different from the front yard.)

316
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:38,134
I used to bring water from the mineral spring every day...

317
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,134
and cook rice with it.

318
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:42,734
My mom loved that.

319
00:15:43,004 --> 00:15:44,673
- Your mom?
- Yes.

320
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:47,812
We thought the mineral water was good for our health.

321
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,374
- Right.
- We fought over it.

322
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:50,913
We even lined up.

323
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:53,854
(Really?)

324
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:56,523
(It reminds me of the past.)

325
00:15:57,454 --> 00:16:00,022
Isn't mineral water usually...

326
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:02,094
What do you call it?

327
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:04,224
The rock with holes.

328
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:05,624
Granite.

329
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:09,294
The water flows on it and absorbs minerals.

330
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:12,162
And it's filtered.

331
00:16:12,163 --> 00:16:14,074
That makes mineral water.

332
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:17,043
You sound like a salesman selling mineral water.

333
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:19,403
(Laughing)

334
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:24,313
This is practically hiking.

335
00:16:24,314 --> 00:16:26,483
It's a walk if you go slowly.

336
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,283
It's nice to get some workouts.

337
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:31,353
- Right.
- Right.

338
00:16:31,354 --> 00:16:32,853
We're having a healthy morning.

339
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:34,793
(Inhaling the morning mountain air that makes you feel healthy)

340
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:38,423
We look like we're living diligent lives.

341
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:39,524
That's right.

342
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:41,364
(They slowly walk deeper into the mountain.)

343
00:16:43,193 --> 00:16:44,603
It's gorgeous.

344
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:45,803
The forest is nice here.

345
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:46,874
(The autumn foliage gets redder.)

346
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:49,702
Those trees are pretty.

347
00:16:49,703 --> 00:16:51,073
(Impressed)

348
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:52,104
It's incredible.

349
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:58,384
(Walking by the clear stream...)

350
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,983
(you can only see deep in the mountain)

351
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:07,054
- Wait. Is this it?
- What?

352
00:17:07,153 --> 00:17:08,324
I think that's the one.

353
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:11,294
- I see it. Sambong Mineral Water.
- There it is.

354
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:14,033
It's a natural heritage.

355
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,034
(Natural Heritage Number 530)

356
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:17,933
Stomach disorders?

357
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:19,764
- Do you have a stomach disorder?
- Yes.

358
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:22,502
A little. When I'm stressed.

359
00:17:22,503 --> 00:17:24,774
(Going to drink healthy water)

360
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,003
This is it.

361
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,073
(Awesome)

362
00:17:27,074 --> 00:17:29,142
I guess we're supposed to open the lid.

363
00:17:29,143 --> 00:17:30,413
(Fascinated)

364
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,913
(Welcome to Sambong Mineral Water.)

365
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,384
(Where the energy of Mount Odae flows)

366
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:42,024
(One of the top 3 mineral springs in the country)

367
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:46,524
(Mineral water comes out of these three holes.)

368
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:51,963
(Shall we stop by and quench our thirst?)

369
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:56,304
Take a bowl each.

370
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:58,773
- Don't drink too much.
- Okay.

371
00:17:58,774 --> 00:18:00,642
We can't waste water.

372
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:01,913
This is...

373
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:06,114
Look how red it is because of iron content.

374
00:18:07,114 --> 00:18:08,114
Is that true?

375
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:09,784
(I've never seen anything like it.)

376
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:13,152
- It's slightly brown.
- Right.

377
00:18:13,153 --> 00:18:14,223
(The water high in iron made the ground turn red.)

378
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,353
Should I try the strongest one first?

379
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:17,923
- Is that the strongest?
- Yes.

380
00:18:20,794 --> 00:18:22,134
- Gosh.
- We shouldn't waste it.

381
00:18:22,764 --> 00:18:25,304
- Look at those bubbles.
- That's right.

382
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:27,033
- Okay.
- This is amazing.

383
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:28,634
So this has the strongest flavor?

384
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:32,073
(He smells it first.)

385
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:34,314
It says that it has the strongest flavor.

386
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,683
(They are curious.)

387
00:18:38,443 --> 00:18:41,483
(Slurping)

388
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:45,123
- It tastes like Sprite.
- Really?

389
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,183
- Try it.
- Here.

390
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,054
It's scary.

391
00:18:50,893 --> 00:18:52,962
- That's enough.
- Get ready before you drink it.

392
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:54,034
Try it.

393
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:58,433
(Do I need to get ready for this?)

394
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,833
I'm scared.

395
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:02,034
(I'm scared.)

396
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:06,814
- Look. There are bubbles in it.
- That's right.

397
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,142
(Carbonic acid is running down my throat.)

398
00:19:12,143 --> 00:19:13,182
I'm scared.

399
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:15,683
(That's what mineral water tastes like.)

400
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:20,594
(The strong flavor of carbonic acid makes your body twist.)

401
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,922
- Gosh. It's so strong.
- Isn't this amazing?

402
00:19:22,923 --> 00:19:24,722
Right. It's really interesting.

403
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:26,422
- It is, right?
- Yes.

404
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:30,304
(It has strong carbonation and a unique smell.)

405
00:19:31,064 --> 00:19:34,534
(How will Hee Won like it?)

406
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:35,972
Let's see.

407
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:38,344
(He drinks it right away.)

408
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:40,003
(Tasting)

409
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:43,074
(He looks calm.)

410
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,913
(Is it okay with him?)

411
00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:49,553
(He drinks it all at once.)

412
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:50,624
How do you like it?

413
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,854
It really tastes different.

414
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:56,824
(Gulping)

415
00:19:57,493 --> 00:19:58,524
It's scary.

416
00:19:59,393 --> 00:20:01,392
(He has been drinking mineral water for 20 years.)

417
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:02,433
But...

418
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:04,502
(It tastes good to me.)

419
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,874
They say it has a strong taste.

420
00:20:08,403 --> 00:20:10,743
Don't we have to fill this up?

421
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,073
- Did we scoop it twice?
- Yes.

422
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:15,114
Three. Another scoop, and we're done.

423
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:17,883
We're not done yet. We need to fill this up.

424
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:18,912
But we...

425
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:19,913
(Greedy)

426
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:21,014
- No.
- Five.

427
00:20:21,284 --> 00:20:23,483
Make it enough to cook rice.

428
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:25,883
- No.
- Six.

429
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:27,593
Don't you think 5 scoops would be enough?

430
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:28,653
How about six scoops?

431
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:30,922
- We need a lot more then.
- Did we scoop it twice?

432
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:31,992
Yes.

433
00:20:31,993 --> 00:20:33,693
(The mineral water expert's greed is endless.)

434
00:20:34,493 --> 00:20:36,094
- Okay.
- Stop it.

435
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:39,033
Okay. One more bucket?

436
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:41,304
- Hey!
- All right.

437
00:20:42,203 --> 00:20:44,473
(They call it a day after being scolded by Dong Il.)

438
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,402
Are we going to cook rice with this?

439
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:47,873
(What will rice made with the mineral water...)

440
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:49,443
(that fascinated Hee Won taste like?)

441
00:20:49,774 --> 00:20:52,642
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

442
00:20:52,643 --> 00:20:56,453
(The members got back home with the mineral water.)

443
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:58,452
You must be hungry after hiking.

444
00:20:58,453 --> 00:21:00,223
(For the members who must be hungry, )

445
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:03,393
(Dong Il cooks rice first.)

446
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:05,722
(Black rice)

447
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,892
(Black beans)

448
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:09,232
What are those? Chestnuts?

449
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:11,863
Right, chestnuts. I'm making multigrain rice.

450
00:21:11,864 --> 00:21:13,063
- Ule.
- Yes?

451
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,902
I heard you're interested in healthy food.

452
00:21:14,903 --> 00:21:16,973
(Fascinated)

453
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:20,913
I heard UIe got interested in healthy food lately.

454
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:23,843
- I love spicy food, Dong Il.
- Yes.

455
00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:25,883
I was into this spicy sauce,

456
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,353
and I ate every food with that sauce.

457
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,083
But it made my stomach upset,

458
00:21:31,084 --> 00:21:33,853
and every food tasted the same with the sauce.

459
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:35,222
- Pork belly was spicy, - Right.

460
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:36,354
and everything else was spicy too.

461
00:21:37,723 --> 00:21:39,863
I was on a cooking show,

462
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:40,932
(She learned this lately.)

463
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:44,264
I learned that every ingredient has its own taste.

464
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:47,673
(I need to make her a healthy meal.)

465
00:21:48,903 --> 00:21:51,002
I'll make multigrain rice today.

466
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:52,303
(Today's lunch will be healthy multigrain rice.)

467
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:55,313
We're doing everything for UIe today.

468
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,314
Right.

469
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,844
(It looks good.)

470
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:03,014
(Meanwhile, UIe opens the mineral water container.)

471
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:05,723
(Hissing)

472
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:08,993
I opened it, and it made a sound.

473
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,593
What sound?

474
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:11,663
(Did it make a sound?)

475
00:22:12,893 --> 00:22:14,333
- Gosh. It really does.
- Right.

476
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,502
Gas leaks from the container.

477
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,134
- Awesome.
- Gosh. I didn't expect that.

478
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,773
Let's pour the water.

479
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,874
(He adds carbonated mineral water.)

480
00:22:25,473 --> 00:22:26,642
I can't wait to try this.

481
00:22:26,643 --> 00:22:28,973
(I can't wait to try this.)

482
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:31,043
(What will it taste like?)

483
00:22:31,044 --> 00:22:32,114
Good.

484
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,983
(What will go well with the rice made of mineral water?)

485
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:37,523
And with the multigrain rice,

486
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:38,584
(Soybean residue)

487
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:40,753
I'll make soybean residue stew.

488
00:22:42,354 --> 00:22:43,662
- Great.
- It'll be ready soon.

489
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:44,794
(That sounds delicious.)

490
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,764
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

491
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:48,463
While I cook,

492
00:22:48,764 --> 00:22:50,192
- you...
- Yes.

493
00:22:50,193 --> 00:22:53,564
and UIe... There's a restaurant nearby.

494
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:56,403
There will be 12 kinds of seasoned greens.

495
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:59,242
- So ask them to give us plenty.
- Okay.

496
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:00,412
- Got it.
- Okay.

497
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:01,473
(There are seasoned greens as well?)

498
00:23:02,243 --> 00:23:03,912
(Today's healthy meal for UIe...)

499
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:05,643
(with nutritious rice made of mineral water)

500
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:10,854
(Soybean residue is savory and good for health.)

501
00:23:11,284 --> 00:23:14,093
(Spicy soybean residue stew...)

502
00:23:14,094 --> 00:23:18,364
(made with a generous amount of soybean residue)

503
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:23,193
(It will be served with seasoned greens...)

504
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:26,534
(that will make you feel refreshed.)

505
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,703
I thought UIe would like them.

506
00:23:29,104 --> 00:23:31,643
Make sure you memorize the names and explain them to us.

507
00:23:32,003 --> 00:23:33,573
- We'll be back.
- Let's go.

508
00:23:33,574 --> 00:23:35,773
Make it quick. We'll be ready soon.

509
00:23:35,774 --> 00:23:36,813
Let's go.

510
00:23:36,814 --> 00:23:38,114
(Hee Won and UIe go out to buy seasoned greens.)

511
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,412
- Myoung.
- Yes?

512
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:43,284
Let's make an amazing soybean residue stew that'll surprise them.

513
00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:47,923
We'll add soybean residue and the beef we had yesterday.

514
00:23:49,324 --> 00:23:50,462
It'll taste good.

515
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:52,423
(They're going to add the leftover beef to soybean residue stew.)

516
00:23:53,124 --> 00:23:57,263
Ji Hoon is generous indeed, right?

517
00:23:57,264 --> 00:23:59,763
How did he think of this?

518
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:00,903
(I know, right?)

519
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:08,113
(Thanks to Ji Hoon, they are having beef today as well.)

520
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,614
Let's stir-fry it with perilla oil.

521
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:15,483
(Add minced garlic to savory perilla oil.)

522
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:17,683
Here.

523
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:21,293
(Adding chopped beef)

524
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:22,423
Stir-fry it.

525
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:26,992
(He stir-fries the beef.)

526
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:29,393
- This smells so good.
- Perilla oil and garlic smell good.

527
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:32,134
This beef is really...

528
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:36,902
- What?
- They are so big.

529
00:24:36,903 --> 00:24:37,903
Right.

530
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,543
I'm sure you've never had soybean residue stew like this.

531
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:41,844
(There's a generous amount of beef in big chunks.)

532
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:44,212
(That's right.)

533
00:24:44,213 --> 00:24:48,152
Myoung, of all the dishes we've had until today,

534
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,453
what would you make for your parents?

535
00:24:52,753 --> 00:24:55,623
I think I've told you this before.

536
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:59,324
I want to make nurungji baeksuk for my parents someday.

537
00:24:59,794 --> 00:25:01,232
I'd like to do that.

538
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,203
That's a secret recipe...

539
00:25:05,334 --> 00:25:07,833
(He learned the secret recipe that has been passed down for 40 years.)

540
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:10,003
(For 40 years?)

541
00:25:10,203 --> 00:25:12,304
(What did I say about the secret?)

542
00:25:12,673 --> 00:25:15,114
(You flip everything over together.)

543
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,814
(Expectant)

544
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,514
(The time has come.)

545
00:25:21,014 --> 00:25:22,213
(Putting on the lid)

546
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,084
Put on your gloves.

547
00:25:24,253 --> 00:25:27,253
(We will flip it over together at the same time.)

548
00:25:27,453 --> 00:25:29,193
(Is he going to show the secret of this recipe?)

549
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,192
(They are nervous, )

550
00:25:32,193 --> 00:25:35,064
(and they flip it over quickly.)

551
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,933
(Ta-da!)

552
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,903
(High-five to celebrate their success)

553
00:25:40,064 --> 00:25:42,273
(You guys are amazing.)

554
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,703
That's a secret recipe...

555
00:25:44,074 --> 00:25:45,402
- that has been passed down...
- That's right.

556
00:25:45,403 --> 00:25:46,743
for 40 years.

557
00:25:47,443 --> 00:25:48,713
What was that secret again?

558
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,814
- You flip everything over together.
- That's right.

559
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,642
(That's our Myoung.)

560
00:25:53,643 --> 00:25:54,913
I remember it.

561
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,584
(He cuts and adds ripe kimchi.)

562
00:25:59,884 --> 00:26:01,323
When you're on leave from the military,

563
00:26:01,324 --> 00:26:02,624
will you come to see me?

564
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:04,623
Can I go?

565
00:26:04,624 --> 00:26:06,423
That's why I'm asking you this. You shouldn't come see me.

566
00:26:07,794 --> 00:26:08,833
I'm busy.

567
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,232
(He pretends he doesn't like it although he loves it.)

568
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:13,764
Which of my dishes would you crave when you're on leave?

569
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,173
What do you want me to get you?

570
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,203
- What do you want?
- I'd love to have nurungji baeksuk.

571
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:23,543
(He's happy to see the youngest acting cute.)

572
00:26:23,544 --> 00:26:24,913
Gosh. I'm in trouble.

573
00:26:25,044 --> 00:26:27,453
(He will be Dong Il's fan forever.)

574
00:26:28,114 --> 00:26:31,752
(The beef and ripe kimchi are cooked well.)

575
00:26:31,753 --> 00:26:34,594
Add Cheongyang chili peppers since we love spicy foods.

576
00:26:35,223 --> 00:26:36,393
Gosh. This looks tasty.

577
00:26:37,324 --> 00:26:38,863
(The soybean residue stew is going well.)

578
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,364
Isn't this amazing?

579
00:26:43,193 --> 00:26:45,264
- We're here.
- So this is the place.

580
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:49,933
So this is the place.

581
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:52,103
(They arrive at the restaurant that Dong Il told them about.)

582
00:26:52,104 --> 00:26:54,113
Wait. Let's get off first.

583
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:55,213
Thank you.

584
00:26:56,044 --> 00:26:58,143
I'm hungry. Aren't you hungry?

585
00:26:58,614 --> 00:27:00,614
(I'm hungry too.)

586
00:27:01,814 --> 00:27:03,553
Hello.

587
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:04,624
(They enter the restaurant carefully.)

588
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,123
- Hello.
- Hello.

589
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,693
- Welcome.
- Hello.

590
00:27:07,923 --> 00:27:09,523
We're here to buy some seasoned greens.

591
00:27:09,524 --> 00:27:11,392
Have a seat. I'll go get them.

592
00:27:11,393 --> 00:27:12,423
Okay.

593
00:27:15,794 --> 00:27:20,774
(While she's preparing the seasoned greens, )

594
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,073
(they look around the restaurant.)

595
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,604
I think this place is very famous.

596
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:27,774
(One side of the restaurant is filled with precious ingredients...)

597
00:27:28,344 --> 00:27:31,913
(that were grown in the mountains of Gangwon Province.)

598
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:36,584
(He finds it interesting.)

599
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,124
(They are ready.)

600
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,094
You're done already?

601
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:44,593
(Amazed)

602
00:27:44,594 --> 00:27:45,594
This is awesome.

603
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:50,634
(Dong Il asked her earlier for the assorted seasoned greens.)

604
00:27:51,304 --> 00:27:54,973
(They are greens that the owner picked from the mountains.)

605
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:57,402
(Chamnamul, ragwort, forest poppy, chwinamul, gooseberry shoots, )

606
00:27:57,403 --> 00:27:58,442
There are 12 kinds of greens.

607
00:27:58,443 --> 00:27:59,773
(erysimum, dogtooth violet, fatsia shoots, Korean thistle...)

608
00:27:59,774 --> 00:28:01,344
This is amazing.

609
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:06,913
(They are healthy side dishes that go well with soybean residue stew.)

610
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,922
Gosh. It smells nice.

611
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:12,452
(It smells very savory.)

612
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:14,953
Can you tell us the names?

613
00:28:16,054 --> 00:28:17,594
This is dogtooth violet.

614
00:28:18,077 --> 00:28:19,163
So this is dogtooth violet.

615
00:28:20,794 --> 00:28:22,492
You can find it in highland areas.

616
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,764
It has violet flowers and is called dogtooth violet.

617
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:27,342
You may become dizzy if you eat it raw,

618
00:28:27,343 --> 00:28:28,704
so you need to remove its poison before you eat.

619
00:28:29,103 --> 00:28:30,944
Or you could have diarrhea or feel dizzy.

620
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:32,913
This is erysimum.

621
00:28:32,914 --> 00:28:34,214
- This one is erysimum.
- That's right.

622
00:28:35,744 --> 00:28:36,884
- Erysimum?
- Yes.

623
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,553
Gooseberry shoots, chwinamul,

624
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:41,853
forest poppy,

625
00:28:43,283 --> 00:28:44,323
chamnamul,

626
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:46,023
goatsbeard,

627
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:47,924
crown daisy,

628
00:28:48,724 --> 00:28:50,322
and Korean thistle. These are fatsia shoots.

629
00:28:50,323 --> 00:28:52,194
(She keeps telling them the names of the greens.)

630
00:28:52,694 --> 00:28:53,763
Wait a second, ma'am.

631
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:56,404
- And ragwort.
- Ragwort.

632
00:28:57,033 --> 00:28:58,072
- This is acanthopanax.
- Oh, I see.

633
00:28:58,073 --> 00:28:59,934
- Is this acanthopanax?
- Acanthopanax shoots.

634
00:29:00,803 --> 00:29:02,903
- Dogtooth violet, erysimum...
- Chwinamul.

635
00:29:02,904 --> 00:29:04,273
- Chwinamul?
- Yes, chwinamul.

636
00:29:04,373 --> 00:29:06,714
- Ragwort, chamnamul, chwinamul.
- Right.

637
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:09,313
Dogtooth violet, erysimum, gooseberry shoots.

638
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,883
Thank you, ma'am.

639
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:12,613
(After the owner's lecture on greens is over...)

640
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:14,283
I've memorized them all.

641
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,523
Okay, Hee Won. Try it.

642
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:19,654
I'll do it one by one. Eolreri.

643
00:29:21,123 --> 00:29:22,863
- It's dogtooth violet.
- Dogtooth violet.

644
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:26,494
Okay. I'll do it over. This is really...

645
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:28,762
Eolreri.

646
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:29,763
(He's wrong again.)

647
00:29:30,263 --> 00:29:31,733
- Isn't that right?
- Dogtooth violet.

648
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:32,803
Dogtooth violet.

649
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:34,802
Dogtooth violet.

650
00:29:34,803 --> 00:29:35,803
(He tries again.)

651
00:29:35,803 --> 00:29:36,803
Erysimum!

652
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:40,043
(What's next?)

653
00:29:41,744 --> 00:29:43,914
(He became silent so soon.)

654
00:29:44,313 --> 00:29:46,184
(You said you memorized them all.)

655
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,822
Hey, you should memorize them too. You're not testing me.

656
00:29:48,823 --> 00:29:50,153
- Erysimum... I wrote them down.
- Right.

657
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:52,253
- You are... I know.
- I wrote down the answers.

658
00:29:52,254 --> 00:29:54,163
You should memorize it without watching it.

659
00:29:54,164 --> 00:29:56,063
- You need to do it too.
- I can't memorize them.

660
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,434
(All right.)

661
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:02,533
- Dogtooth violet, erysimum, - Dogtooth violet.

662
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:04,404
gooseberry shoots...

663
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,833
Gooseberry shoots and erysimum.

664
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:08,542
- Dogtooth violet, - Dogtooth violet,

665
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:10,403
- erysimum, gooseberry shoots, - erysimum, gooseberry shoots,

666
00:30:10,404 --> 00:30:12,073
- chwinamul, forest poppy...
- chwinamul, forest poppy...

667
00:30:12,873 --> 00:30:13,944
Korean thistle.

668
00:30:14,144 --> 00:30:15,184
- Fatsia shoots.
- Fatsia shoots.

669
00:30:15,444 --> 00:30:17,684
Let's go. Great.

670
00:30:18,414 --> 00:30:19,713
(High-five to celebrate their success)

671
00:30:19,714 --> 00:30:22,454
Thank you, ma'am. I don't need to save this, right?

672
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:23,823
Save it.

673
00:30:25,553 --> 00:30:26,924
Of course, you should save it. What are you talking about?

674
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:31,533
(Hee Won and UIe head back to the house.)

675
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:33,633
(Meanwhile, in the house...)

676
00:30:33,634 --> 00:30:37,133
Gosh. Look at that. It's simmering.

677
00:30:37,134 --> 00:30:38,433
(Delicious soybean residue stew is simmering.)

678
00:30:38,434 --> 00:30:40,033
Gosh. Is this time to add soybean residue?

679
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:45,013
(He adds a generous amount of soybean residue.)

680
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:46,813
(He adds it again.)

681
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:49,444
(And again.)

682
00:30:51,214 --> 00:30:52,383
I added a lot of soybean residue on purpose.

683
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:53,853
(I added a lot of soybean residue on purpose.)

684
00:30:54,654 --> 00:30:55,953
(The pot is filled with soybean residue.)

685
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,023
It looks so good.

686
00:30:58,593 --> 00:31:01,623
(Gulping)

687
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:04,532
We need to boil it a little longer.

688
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:06,894
(Now, they need to simmer it.)

689
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:08,734
Let me taste it first. Try it.

690
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:13,273
(Youngest tastes it too.)

691
00:31:15,704 --> 00:31:17,473
- Gosh. It's already good.
- Is it good already?

692
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:18,543
- Yes.
- Right?

693
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:20,713
(There's some soybean residue stew left in the bowl.)

694
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:21,714
(There's some left.)

695
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,083
(He eats it all.)

696
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:26,213
Gosh. Myoung, you love it.

697
00:31:26,214 --> 00:31:27,454
(Is it that good?)

698
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:31,223
It tastes savory because there are beans in it.

699
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:32,224
(Soybean residue stew is almost ready.)

700
00:31:32,654 --> 00:31:34,022
We're back.

701
00:31:34,023 --> 00:31:36,363
Great. You guys are right on time.

702
00:31:36,863 --> 00:31:37,863
Here, Dong Il. These are 12 kinds of greens.

703
00:31:37,864 --> 00:31:39,363
(Look at this, Dong Il.)

704
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:41,833
- You know all the names, right?
- Sure thing.

705
00:31:42,363 --> 00:31:44,934
It's a piece of cake, Dong Il.

706
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,403
I can tell the names right away.

707
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:48,773
(He seems very confident.)

708
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:51,312
- I'm going to ask you.
- I can do it with my eyes closed.

709
00:31:51,313 --> 00:31:52,743
Okay. I'll ask you about them all.

710
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,843
(Hee Won looks confident.)

711
00:31:55,144 --> 00:31:56,214
- Do you want to eat now?
- Goodness. What is this?

712
00:31:57,484 --> 00:32:00,984
How did you know I love soybean residue stew? You made a lot of it.

713
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:02,254
Yes, I made a lot.

714
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:04,623
(While Hee Won is distracted by soybean residue stew, )

715
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,052
We can serve it like this.

716
00:32:06,053 --> 00:32:09,894
(UIe is...)

717
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:12,292
(Let me see.)

718
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:14,134
Dogtooth violet, erysimum...

719
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:15,862
(She's memorizing the names of greens quietly.)

720
00:32:15,863 --> 00:32:18,134
Dogtooth violet, erysimum...

721
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,303
(Mumbling)

722
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:24,313
(Glancing)

723
00:32:24,714 --> 00:32:26,413
UIe got really nervous now.

724
00:32:26,414 --> 00:32:28,244
She's trying to memorize all the names.

725
00:32:29,244 --> 00:32:31,983
(I should not forget them.)

726
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:34,454
Don't be nervous. I'm cooking slowly on purpose.

727
00:32:34,783 --> 00:32:36,984
We're going to forget it. You should ask us quickly.

728
00:32:37,494 --> 00:32:40,023
(Teasing)

729
00:32:41,164 --> 00:32:44,894
Okay. Come here, UIe.

730
00:32:45,994 --> 00:32:46,994
What was it?

731
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:48,062
(He calls UIe to a corner.)

732
00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:50,062
- Dogtooth violet, erysimum, - Dogtooth violet, erysimum,

733
00:32:50,063 --> 00:32:51,233
- gooseberry shoots, - gooseberry shoots,

734
00:32:51,234 --> 00:32:53,302
- chwinamul, forest poppy, ragwort, - chwinamul, forest poppy, ragwort,

735
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:54,803
- chamnamul...
- chamnamul...

736
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,443
(Glancing)

737
00:32:56,444 --> 00:32:57,974
- Hey.
- Goatsbeard, and...

738
00:32:58,573 --> 00:33:00,513
Hee Won, you said you knew them all.

739
00:33:00,714 --> 00:33:02,112
This is crown daisy.

740
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,913
(He pretends he did not hear it.)

741
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:05,384
- Korean thistle and fatsia shoots.
- Korean thistle.

742
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,714
Okay, great.

743
00:33:06,754 --> 00:33:08,323
(That's good enough.)

744
00:33:09,384 --> 00:33:12,623
Dong Il. I didn't have to memorize them because I already knew them.

745
00:33:13,094 --> 00:33:16,023
I wanted to give UIe some time to memorize them.

746
00:33:16,293 --> 00:33:18,492
(She's still memorizing them.)

747
00:33:18,493 --> 00:33:20,493
(This is not a pause.)

748
00:33:20,864 --> 00:33:24,034
(They are cute.)

749
00:33:25,373 --> 00:33:26,432
It's simmering.

750
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:27,973
(Meanwhile, soybean residue stew is cooked well.)

751
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,404
- Shall I scoop rice?
- Right. It's time to scoop rice.

752
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:33,642
All right. I made multigrain rice for UIe.

753
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:35,843
Let's see how well it's cooked.

754
00:33:35,844 --> 00:33:39,284
(She comes in right away since the rice is ready.)

755
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:42,054
(Expectant)

756
00:33:44,353 --> 00:33:46,423
- Look at the color.
- Goodness.

757
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,424
See?

758
00:33:47,623 --> 00:33:48,623
(The nourishing rice made of mineral water is ready too.)

759
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:50,464
- Are those red beans?
- There are red beans in it.

760
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:54,094
Every dish we have here is healthy.

761
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:56,963
(It looks good.)

762
00:33:56,964 --> 00:33:57,973
- Look at this.
- It looks so good.

763
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,073
This is awesome.

764
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:01,074
(Drawn by the savory smell of rice, they are standing by the window.)

765
00:34:02,203 --> 00:34:03,272
Try this.

766
00:34:03,273 --> 00:34:04,313
(Try this nutritious rice.)

767
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,583
- Goodness.
- Try it. It's so delicious.

768
00:34:08,944 --> 00:34:10,742
(Savoring)

769
00:34:10,743 --> 00:34:12,182
You'll live longer if you eat this.

770
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,254
(The two by the window have a bite too.)

771
00:34:14,723 --> 00:34:15,753
It's really savory.

772
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,154
- It's so savory, right?
- It is.

773
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:19,623
You're getting better at cooking rice.

774
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:22,893
I know. This is good.

775
00:34:23,764 --> 00:34:24,764
Hee Won. Take this.

776
00:34:25,393 --> 00:34:26,993
Take it.

777
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:29,464
(Careful)

778
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:32,574
Enjoy the meal, Hee Won.

779
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:34,443
I forgot about this.

780
00:34:34,444 --> 00:34:35,804
(When everyone is done setting the table together, )

781
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:38,312
(it's time to enjoy the meal.)

782
00:34:38,313 --> 00:34:39,643
Please pass me the bowls.

783
00:34:39,873 --> 00:34:43,214
You made a lot of soybean residue stew as you knew I love it.

784
00:34:43,444 --> 00:34:44,812
Yes, I really made a lot.

785
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:45,813
(A generous amount of soybean residue stew)

786
00:34:46,554 --> 00:34:48,553
I cooked it with the mineral water.

787
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:49,784
You even put jujube in it, right?

788
00:34:51,054 --> 00:34:53,353
UIe, this is the healthy meal that you wanted to have.

789
00:34:53,694 --> 00:34:54,723
Gosh. It smells so good.

790
00:34:55,824 --> 00:34:59,134
(In nature...)

791
00:34:59,993 --> 00:35:03,403
(that surrounds their front yard, )

792
00:35:03,404 --> 00:35:07,504
(they got fresh ingredients...)

793
00:35:08,243 --> 00:35:09,403
(and made today's healthy meal for UIe.)

794
00:35:09,404 --> 00:35:11,772
Everything we have today is healthy food.

795
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:13,372
(Today's healthy meal for UIe)

796
00:35:13,373 --> 00:35:14,513
UIe can try it first.

797
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:16,514
(Excited)

798
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:18,653
My goodness.

799
00:35:18,654 --> 00:35:19,753
This has to be delicious.

800
00:35:19,754 --> 00:35:20,784
- Try it.
- Thank you.

801
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:22,722
- Hee Won. My brother.
- Yes.

802
00:35:22,723 --> 00:35:24,123
Gosh. I really...

803
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,623
You know I...

804
00:35:26,953 --> 00:35:28,392
- What do you call this?
- Try it.

805
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:29,722
- It's soybean residue.
- Right, soybean residue.

806
00:35:29,723 --> 00:35:30,893
I really...

807
00:35:32,293 --> 00:35:34,234
I forgot as I was trying to memorize the names of the greens.

808
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,033
(Gosh, Hee Won.)

809
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,932
I'm talking to you on purpose so you would forget it.

810
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:40,973
I couldn't remember soybean residue as I tried to remember the greens.

811
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:43,243
Thank you for the food.

812
00:35:45,313 --> 00:35:48,043
(She tries the soybean residue stew first.)

813
00:35:48,543 --> 00:35:50,643
(Frowning)

814
00:35:51,054 --> 00:35:52,054
What do you think?

815
00:35:52,953 --> 00:35:54,623
It's spicy and good, right? I made it like this...

816
00:35:55,884 --> 00:35:58,123
- It's spicy.
- since you like spicy food.

817
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,254
- Gosh. This is so tasty.
- This is good.

818
00:36:03,324 --> 00:36:06,634
(Hee Won tries the soybean residue stew too.)

819
00:36:07,703 --> 00:36:09,533
Soybean residue is amazing.

820
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,203
(Soybean residue is amazing.)

821
00:36:12,933 --> 00:36:14,602
(The youngest has a big bite.)

822
00:36:14,603 --> 00:36:15,674
How is it?

823
00:36:16,304 --> 00:36:17,673
(This is good.)

824
00:36:17,674 --> 00:36:20,472
I added beef instead of pork in this.

825
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:22,083
(I added beef instead of pork in the soybean residue stew.)

826
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,014
Right. I can see that beef is in it.

827
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:27,824
(Savoring)

828
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:34,663
(It's fun to find beef in soybean residue stew.)

829
00:36:34,764 --> 00:36:37,763
Dong Il. This soybean residue stew is amazing.

830
00:36:37,764 --> 00:36:38,792
(The stew with a lot of soybean residue and beef...)

831
00:36:38,793 --> 00:36:40,293
(fills their stomach.)

832
00:36:41,163 --> 00:36:45,074
(UIe tries the nutritious rice with soybean residue.)

833
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:49,772
This is the healthy food that you wanted, right?

834
00:36:49,773 --> 00:36:51,273
- They are so good.
- Aren't they?

835
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:53,812
It's so good. I mean it.

836
00:36:53,813 --> 00:36:54,884
(Of course.)

837
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:57,543
(UIe loves Dong Il's food.)

838
00:36:57,913 --> 00:37:00,783
(She gathers every grain in her bowl...)

839
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:03,424
(and eats.)

840
00:37:05,094 --> 00:37:06,554
(Chewing)

841
00:37:06,853 --> 00:37:09,694
(She keeps eating.)

842
00:37:10,293 --> 00:37:11,933
(Glancing)

843
00:37:12,493 --> 00:37:14,433
UIe, you really know how to eat.

844
00:37:15,304 --> 00:37:16,703
(Chuckling)

845
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:19,773
(They forget about memorizing the names of the greens.)

846
00:37:20,804 --> 00:37:22,743
(Wait.)

847
00:37:23,973 --> 00:37:25,173
This rice is so savory and good.

848
00:37:25,174 --> 00:37:27,743
Why don't we try the seasoned greens one at a time?

849
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:30,413
As we name them?

850
00:37:31,054 --> 00:37:32,813
(Oh, right. The greens.)

851
00:37:32,913 --> 00:37:34,254
Hee Won. I think I'm done for.

852
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:39,654
(They forgot about the greens as they enjoyed the meal.)

853
00:37:40,094 --> 00:37:41,122
Let's try the seasoned greens now.

854
00:37:41,123 --> 00:37:42,694
(Let's try them before we forget all of them.)

855
00:37:43,324 --> 00:37:44,662
(Getting up)

856
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:45,734
Dong Il, just a second.

857
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:48,504
There's a direction to this.

858
00:37:49,663 --> 00:37:50,963
(UIe is cute.)

859
00:37:50,964 --> 00:37:52,004
- It's ready.
- Okay.

860
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:54,642
- I'll go.
- All right.

861
00:37:54,643 --> 00:37:57,003
- Name them one at a time.
- This is dogtooth violet.

862
00:37:57,004 --> 00:37:59,273
- Let's try the dogtooth violet.
- That's right.

863
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:02,643
(Dogtooth violet)

864
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:05,182
- Dogtooth violet.
- It grows at high places.

865
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,952
When you eat it raw,

866
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:08,824
it might be poisonous,

867
00:38:09,384 --> 00:38:10,953
so you need to remove the poison before you eat it.

868
00:38:11,353 --> 00:38:12,953
(I see.)

869
00:38:13,254 --> 00:38:15,122
(Dogtooth violets grow on high ground...)

870
00:38:15,123 --> 00:38:16,893
(and is good for your stomach.)

871
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:20,392
(It's a bit poisonous, so you must eat it after removing the poison.)

872
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:21,534
Try the dogtooth violet.

873
00:38:22,703 --> 00:38:26,034
(He tries the dogtooth violet first.)

874
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:27,803
(Exclaiming)

875
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:28,844
It's really good.

876
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:30,703
It's really good.

877
00:38:31,674 --> 00:38:32,674
Let's try the next one.

878
00:38:32,675 --> 00:38:35,114
(What's the one next to it?)

879
00:38:35,543 --> 00:38:38,154
This is erysimum.

880
00:38:39,114 --> 00:38:40,513
- It's erysimum?
- Yes.

881
00:38:40,514 --> 00:38:41,582
Isn't the poker used for fires...

882
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:42,654
- called that too?
- It is.

883
00:38:42,984 --> 00:38:44,123
- Let's try it.
- Erysimum.

884
00:38:44,353 --> 00:38:45,353
Try it.

885
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:48,623
It's a bit tough.

886
00:38:48,964 --> 00:38:51,364
- You eat it for the texture.
- Right. This is erysimum.

887
00:38:53,594 --> 00:38:54,904
(Erysimum is good too.)

888
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,864
What is this?

889
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:00,904
That one? Dogtooth violet, erysimum...

890
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,372
(Help me.)

891
00:39:04,373 --> 00:39:05,944
Forest poppy, chwinamul...

892
00:39:07,444 --> 00:39:10,543
- Ragwort! This one is ragwort.
- Yes.

893
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:13,583
(He's proud.)

894
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,953
(Laughing)

895
00:39:16,183 --> 00:39:19,123
- This one is ragwort.
- Ragwort. It looks good too.

896
00:39:20,054 --> 00:39:21,963
(He tries the ragwort too.)

897
00:39:21,964 --> 00:39:23,293
The ragwort is really tender.

898
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:27,763
(It is.)

899
00:39:27,764 --> 00:39:28,833
What's the next one?

900
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,702
- This one is Korean thistle.
- That's right.

901
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:33,904
(Korean thistle)

902
00:39:34,844 --> 00:39:37,073
(He starts singing upon seeing his favorite, Korean thistle.)

903
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,142
- It's my favorite.
- Korean thistle rice.

904
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:39,243
(He starts singing upon seeing his favorite, Korean thistle.)

905
00:39:39,514 --> 00:39:41,743
- These are gooseberry shoots.
- That's right.

906
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,053
This is chwinamul.

907
00:39:45,054 --> 00:39:46,514
- This is chwinamul?
- Yes, it is.

908
00:39:47,924 --> 00:39:51,424
These are fatsia shoots.

909
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:54,153
(She's done introducing the 12 different vegetables.)

910
00:39:54,154 --> 00:39:56,292
(That's right. Good job.)

911
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:59,094
All of the vegetables were made really well.

912
00:40:00,433 --> 00:40:01,463
- Right?
- Yes.

913
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:02,464
(You're right.)

914
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,932
- They're all slightly different.
- They are.

915
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:05,933
(Interesting)

916
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:10,373
(The various mountain vegetables that grow in Gangwon Province)

917
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:12,713
I want to mix them with rice.

918
00:40:12,714 --> 00:40:13,873
(I want to mix the vegetables with rice.)

919
00:40:14,473 --> 00:40:15,483
I want to mix them with rice.

920
00:40:15,484 --> 00:40:16,883
(His interest is peaked.)

921
00:40:16,884 --> 00:40:18,083
Then let's mix it.

922
00:40:19,953 --> 00:40:21,583
(Sounds good.)

923
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:26,293
(The youngest goes into action.)

924
00:40:27,254 --> 00:40:29,824
(He comes out after grabbing a bowl to mix it in.)

925
00:40:30,364 --> 00:40:31,764
- Something like this?
- Good.

926
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:34,904
(That's perfect.)

927
00:40:36,163 --> 00:40:39,004
Everything we're eating is healthy.

928
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,042
(She adds plenty of gochujang.)

929
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:43,873
- Should we add more sesame oil?
- Let's do that.

930
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,242
A little more. Okay.

931
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:47,273
(She adds a bit of savory sesame oil.)

932
00:40:49,043 --> 00:40:50,243
She's really good at mixing it.

933
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:52,054
UIe is good.

934
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:55,154
(I want to eat it.)

935
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:58,094
(Me too.)

936
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,852
Should we name the vegetables after they've been mixed?

937
00:41:00,853 --> 00:41:02,563
(Hee Won.)

938
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:07,904
(Let's taste it.)

939
00:41:09,703 --> 00:41:11,534
- It's good!
- Is it?

940
00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:18,043
(They have vegetable bibimbap to cleanse their palate.)

941
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:19,513
- Is it okay?
- It's good.

942
00:41:19,514 --> 00:41:20,543
It's good.

943
00:41:23,543 --> 00:41:25,754
(UIe mixed it up really well.)

944
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:33,824
(The vegetable bibimbap is the perfect end to their meal.)

945
00:41:34,663 --> 00:41:36,523
Gosh, that was a great meal.

946
00:41:37,464 --> 00:41:38,533
Totally.

947
00:41:38,534 --> 00:41:39,793
(Nodding)

948
00:41:40,694 --> 00:41:41,763
I'm so full.

949
00:41:41,764 --> 00:41:43,063
(They're full from the healthy meal.)

950
00:41:43,764 --> 00:41:46,773
(You can feel the chilly late fall air in the front yard.)

951
00:41:47,603 --> 00:41:50,444
(After they have their healthy lunch, )

952
00:41:51,273 --> 00:41:52,613
I turned on the boiler for the floor.

953
00:41:52,614 --> 00:41:55,543
(they go inside to get some rest.)

954
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:57,783
It's nice and warm.

955
00:41:57,784 --> 00:42:00,554
- This is amazing.
- It's nice and warm.

956
00:42:01,554 --> 00:42:04,993
Should we stay inside and have some hot tea?

957
00:42:05,353 --> 00:42:07,293
- What kind of tea?
- What about some warm honey tea?

958
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:08,793
- Honey tea sounds good.
- Honey tea?

959
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,992
- Honey tea sounds good.
- Ule, let's have some honey tea.

960
00:42:10,993 --> 00:42:13,093
- Just stay seated.
- Put it in the mug...

961
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,634
Just stay seated. How many times must I tell you guests don't move?

962
00:42:18,373 --> 00:42:20,803
- Buckwheat honey tea is perfect.
- Buckwheat honey tea.

963
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,703
Goodness. Buckwheat honey tea.

964
00:42:24,103 --> 00:42:26,313
(Myoung begins preparing the tea.)

965
00:42:27,243 --> 00:42:29,813
Honestly, we wouldn't be able to do anything without Myoung.

966
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:31,554
I wouldn't come here.

967
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:34,213
Should I make it strong?

968
00:42:34,214 --> 00:42:35,622
Make it nice and thick.

969
00:42:35,623 --> 00:42:37,753
(He puts in a lot of buckwheat honey just the way they like it.)

970
00:42:37,754 --> 00:42:39,453
Dong Il. Doesn't it feel...

971
00:42:40,754 --> 00:42:43,593
a bit melancholic...

972
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,333
- but peaceful? Right?
- It really does.

973
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,503
I think I'm experiencing the fall like this...

974
00:42:49,504 --> 00:42:52,503
for the first time. I've never sat around like this before.

975
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:54,174
- Right.
- To be honest.

976
00:42:54,534 --> 00:42:57,202
In a place where the leaves are on the ground.

977
00:42:57,203 --> 00:42:58,242
(They look at their front yard covered in leaves.)

978
00:42:58,243 --> 00:42:59,912
I've never been surrounded by...

979
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:02,114
trees and leaves like this before.

980
00:43:03,444 --> 00:43:06,683
(The fall vibes come rushing into their hearts.)

981
00:43:08,054 --> 00:43:12,194
(And in the middle of it all is House on Wheels.)

982
00:43:13,893 --> 00:43:16,622
(The chilly weather of late fall...)

983
00:43:16,623 --> 00:43:17,693
Thank you.

984
00:43:17,694 --> 00:43:19,793
(goes perfectly with the buckwheat honey tea.)

985
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,433
The honey tea tastes amazing.

986
00:43:26,034 --> 00:43:27,273
Yes. It's really good.

987
00:43:29,203 --> 00:43:31,574
(I'm glad.)

988
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:34,174
(He eats so well.)

989
00:43:35,444 --> 00:43:36,514
For dinner,

990
00:43:37,913 --> 00:43:38,953
I'll make you guys...

991
00:43:39,413 --> 00:43:40,784
some gamjatang.

992
00:43:41,214 --> 00:43:43,022
(Gamjatang?)

993
00:43:43,023 --> 00:43:44,383
- Are we having gamjatang tonight?
- Gamjatang.

994
00:43:44,384 --> 00:43:46,193
I heard that the gamja in gamjatang...

995
00:43:46,194 --> 00:43:48,292
isn't referring to the potatoes in the dish.

996
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:51,093
- It's what's inside the bones.
- The bits inside the bones...

997
00:43:51,094 --> 00:43:52,533
are called gamja too.

998
00:43:52,534 --> 00:43:54,493
Do you know how to make the soup?

999
00:43:55,264 --> 00:43:58,003
Yes, of course. I just need to make it.

1000
00:43:58,004 --> 00:43:59,503
You need to season it well.

1001
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:01,804
The seasoning is simple.

1002
00:44:02,004 --> 00:44:03,272
- It is?
- Yes.

1003
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,214
But there's a unique taste...

1004
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:08,443
You have to capture the flavors...

1005
00:44:08,444 --> 00:44:09,643
by doing something.

1006
00:44:09,743 --> 00:44:13,213
I was watching some TV show, and they said that...

1007
00:44:13,214 --> 00:44:15,284
most people use instant seasoning for it.

1008
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,753
That's why they say it's hard to make the soup...

1009
00:44:18,754 --> 00:44:20,353
- for the gamjatang.
- So...

1010
00:44:21,723 --> 00:44:22,723
Just eat it.

1011
00:44:24,023 --> 00:44:26,234
(Laughing)

1012
00:44:26,534 --> 00:44:29,264
Of course. I learned a lot about cooking too.

1013
00:44:30,304 --> 00:44:31,364
What did you learn?

1014
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:33,703
First of all, you use sesame seeds to make it look good.

1015
00:44:34,904 --> 00:44:36,873
If you messed it up, add butter.

1016
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:39,843
(House on Wheel's official recipe)

1017
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,543
(Use sesame seeds for the visual and butter if you mess up.)

1018
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:44,912
Then since we're on the topic,

1019
00:44:44,913 --> 00:44:47,183
why don't we try Hee Won's cooking for dinner tonight?

1020
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:50,284
- I can't make gamjatang.
- Then you can make something else.

1021
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,023
- Then let's do this.
- I can make potato jeon.

1022
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,992
- What?
- My favorite food to eat with beer.

1023
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:56,563
- What is it?
- French fries.

1024
00:44:57,893 --> 00:44:59,933
- French fries?
- Isn't that okay?

1025
00:45:00,134 --> 00:45:01,832
Don't I just need to fry it in some oil?

1026
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,963
But you still need...

1027
00:45:03,964 --> 00:45:05,272
to season it.

1028
00:45:05,273 --> 00:45:07,203
You can't just fry it up. It needs to be salty.

1029
00:45:08,743 --> 00:45:10,273
(He seems very flustered.)

1030
00:45:10,643 --> 00:45:11,674
Then let's do this.

1031
00:45:11,773 --> 00:45:14,413
Let's make French fries and sweet potato fries. What do you think?

1032
00:45:14,743 --> 00:45:16,743
- That sounds good.
- I like both.

1033
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:18,613
- I don't think it'll be hard.
- Wow.

1034
00:45:18,614 --> 00:45:21,554
I'll be sure to make it delicious.

1035
00:45:22,654 --> 00:45:24,924
Gosh, Hee Won is going to do something big tonight.

1036
00:45:26,194 --> 00:45:27,223
Sounds good.

1037
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:28,993
You can do it.

1038
00:45:30,493 --> 00:45:32,662
- You said you'd make potato jeon.
- I did.

1039
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,633
I'll make potato jeon, and he'll make gamjatang.

1040
00:45:34,634 --> 00:45:35,863
(He drags UIe in too.)

1041
00:45:35,864 --> 00:45:38,233
Did you say that you would julienne the potatoes?

1042
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:40,703
- Yes.
- So julienned potato jeon.

1043
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:43,903
Now that we're talking about it,

1044
00:45:43,904 --> 00:45:46,613
I got the feeling that we'll be really busy.

1045
00:45:46,614 --> 00:45:47,944
We came to rest though.

1046
00:45:50,643 --> 00:45:53,983
Should we go to the valley to digest?

1047
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,654
Or should we talk along the trail?

1048
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:57,623
Is the valley far?

1049
00:45:58,353 --> 00:46:00,453
- It's right by here.
- Back there.

1050
00:46:00,793 --> 00:46:03,793
- Okay.
- Let's go to both places then.

1051
00:46:04,424 --> 00:46:06,733
- Let's do that. Let's go.
- Okay!

1052
00:46:06,734 --> 00:46:08,263
It's so hard to get up after sitting in a warm place...

1053
00:46:08,264 --> 00:46:10,332
- after we had lunch.
- You're right.

1054
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:12,472
I didn't want to get up which is why I kept making you talk.

1055
00:46:12,473 --> 00:46:16,504
(There's a valley beyond the ginkgo tree forest.)

1056
00:46:17,504 --> 00:46:20,674
(And there's a beautiful trail in the front yard.)

1057
00:46:21,714 --> 00:46:26,183
(Shall we take a leisurely fall walk?)

1058
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,924
It feels really nice to step on the fallen leaves.

1059
00:46:30,953 --> 00:46:33,053
- It feels dry now.
- There's no need to clean it up.

1060
00:46:33,054 --> 00:46:34,593
- It rained a little yesterday.
- Right.

1061
00:46:34,594 --> 00:46:37,324
You can hear the leaves crunching. You couldn't hear it yesterday.

1062
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:40,332
The leaves are so nice.

1063
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:41,333
(They are enjoying the fall.)

1064
00:46:41,334 --> 00:46:43,004
I didn't realize leaves were so pillowy.

1065
00:46:43,964 --> 00:46:45,633
(They walk to the valley...)

1066
00:46:45,634 --> 00:46:47,734
(while feeling the leaves under their feet.)

1067
00:46:48,203 --> 00:46:49,472
Goodness. Look at this.

1068
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,813
(Excited)

1069
00:46:52,273 --> 00:46:54,074
When would you get to kick leaves like this?

1070
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:59,483
The water is really clear.

1071
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:01,582
- It's really clean!
- The leaves...

1072
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:05,952
(After they pass the trail of leaves...)

1073
00:47:05,953 --> 00:47:09,162
It's only 100m away from our house.

1074
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:10,223
(Hidden beneath the ginkgo tree forest...)

1075
00:47:11,293 --> 00:47:14,764
(is a fall valley covered in leaves.)

1076
00:47:15,804 --> 00:47:17,903
(Another scenery of the fall)

1077
00:47:17,904 --> 00:47:19,904
The water is really clear.

1078
00:47:21,944 --> 00:47:23,043
I want to touch the water.

1079
00:47:23,444 --> 00:47:24,543
The valley...

1080
00:47:25,043 --> 00:47:26,614
I think it'll be really clean.

1081
00:47:27,674 --> 00:47:29,113
The water is really clear.

1082
00:47:29,114 --> 00:47:30,784
(UIe takes big steps toward the water.)

1083
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,114
Be careful.

1084
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:33,713
How refreshing.

1085
00:47:33,714 --> 00:47:35,754
(UIe dips her hand in the water first.)

1086
00:47:36,424 --> 00:47:38,293
It's really refreshing.

1087
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:43,594
(Myoung is capturing the fall valley as a photo.)

1088
00:47:44,824 --> 00:47:47,364
(Meanwhile, Hee Won is just looking at the ground.)

1089
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:50,933
When you come to place like this, you have to do this.

1090
00:47:51,364 --> 00:47:53,004
You have to skip rocks.

1091
00:47:54,134 --> 00:47:55,174
Are you good at skipping rocks?

1092
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:58,074
We always skipped rocks.

1093
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:00,312
I'm good at skipping rocks.

1094
00:48:00,313 --> 00:48:01,984
(They're all bragging about skipping rocks.)

1095
00:48:02,243 --> 00:48:05,014
- I'll show you.
- You guys are no match for me.

1096
00:48:06,754 --> 00:48:11,122
The stone has to lightly brush past the surface of the water.

1097
00:48:11,123 --> 00:48:14,654
You should make it stand when it hits the surface, okay?

1098
00:48:15,023 --> 00:48:17,792
So it can bounce and bounce like this.

1099
00:48:17,793 --> 00:48:19,432
(Listening carefully)

1100
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:21,194
- All right?
- Okay, then.

1101
00:48:21,393 --> 00:48:23,464
Myoung, how many times do you think I will make it?

1102
00:48:23,964 --> 00:48:25,473
I think 5 times. No, 7 times.

1103
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:28,134
- Okay, here we go.
- For him, the minimum is ten times.

1104
00:48:29,504 --> 00:48:32,043
- I think the width is too short.
- Oh, come on.

1105
00:48:32,813 --> 00:48:33,943
(Sputtering sound)

1106
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:36,613
- This is how it will go.
- Then, I'll say 20 times.

1107
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:38,813
I'm telling you. It won't twang. It will sound like a drum roll.

1108
00:48:40,413 --> 00:48:41,413
All right, then.

1109
00:48:41,414 --> 00:48:42,623
(How good is he?)

1110
00:48:43,223 --> 00:48:45,424
(Expecting)

1111
00:48:47,453 --> 00:48:51,663
(Throwing)

1112
00:48:55,603 --> 00:48:58,163
(It definitely twanged.)

1113
00:48:59,734 --> 00:49:00,904
(Well, he isn't good.)

1114
00:49:02,603 --> 00:49:03,674
- Did you see it?
- Yes, I did.

1115
00:49:05,973 --> 00:49:07,173
It was like the stone was alive.

1116
00:49:07,174 --> 00:49:09,844
It bounced and jumped very far.

1117
00:49:10,413 --> 00:49:12,554
(Yes, of course.)

1118
00:49:13,714 --> 00:49:16,583
(After figuring out how good Dong Il is...)

1119
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:19,053
How come it's so hard to find a flat stone?

1120
00:49:19,054 --> 00:49:20,694
Gosh, this is a nice one.

1121
00:49:21,123 --> 00:49:22,324
Yes, this is nice.

1122
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,194
Harder!

1123
00:49:26,234 --> 00:49:27,733
Here he comes. Okay, Hee Won.

1124
00:49:27,734 --> 00:49:29,103
(Striding)

1125
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:31,102
It's my turn.

1126
00:49:31,103 --> 00:49:32,173
(How good is Hee Won?)

1127
00:49:32,174 --> 00:49:34,433
- Here I go.
- Lower your body more.

1128
00:49:35,103 --> 00:49:36,674
Lower. Yes, like that.

1129
00:49:37,344 --> 00:49:38,743
- Throw it hard, okay?
- Here I go.

1130
00:49:52,453 --> 00:49:55,464
(Exclaiming)

1131
00:49:55,563 --> 00:49:57,123
(Exclaiming)

1132
00:49:58,393 --> 00:50:01,492
I'm sorry. Compared to yours, it didn't skip much.

1133
00:50:01,493 --> 00:50:02,863
(Teasing)

1134
00:50:02,864 --> 00:50:04,133
Your stone skipped 24 times,

1135
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:06,602
but I think I just made it ten times.

1136
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:07,973
My goodness, that was amazing.

1137
00:50:08,404 --> 00:50:09,543
Gosh.

1138
00:50:11,473 --> 00:50:12,912
Okay, let's go.

1139
00:50:12,913 --> 00:50:14,614
(Feeling bitter)

1140
00:50:15,384 --> 00:50:17,383
This is the satisfaction you feel when you teach someone.

1141
00:50:17,384 --> 00:50:18,953
- I guess so.
- Okay?

1142
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:23,324
(I found a nice one.)

1143
00:50:24,924 --> 00:50:26,853
Of course, he has to try it too.

1144
00:50:27,493 --> 00:50:28,722
- Seriously...
- I'll show you how it's done.

1145
00:50:28,723 --> 00:50:29,764
Okay, go.

1146
00:50:31,264 --> 00:50:32,863
(How good is Myoung?)

1147
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:33,864
Go.

1148
00:50:35,203 --> 00:50:37,663
(Let's see.)

1149
00:50:39,174 --> 00:50:42,103
(Throwing)

1150
00:50:42,444 --> 00:50:44,304
(Striking)

1151
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:56,554
(Amazing!)

1152
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,694
(Is this real?)

1153
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,863
Did you see how it split at the end?

1154
00:51:02,864 --> 00:51:05,263
- I did.
- It went to that far, and then...

1155
00:51:05,264 --> 00:51:06,964
(He is speechless.)

1156
00:51:08,134 --> 00:51:11,803
(Replay)

1157
00:51:11,804 --> 00:51:12,804
(Hitting)

1158
00:51:15,074 --> 00:51:18,913
(Very satisfied)

1159
00:51:19,473 --> 00:51:22,183
See? I taught him well.

1160
00:51:24,183 --> 00:51:26,182
- Did you see that, Ule?
- Gosh, he is the master.

1161
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,553
- Yes, but...
- This is called a good lesson.

1162
00:51:27,554 --> 00:51:29,852
This shows how important a good lesson is.

1163
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,824
- Yes, I agree.
- Just relax and let go of it.

1164
00:51:34,393 --> 00:51:36,694
(The students can't wait to see how good their teacher is.)

1165
00:51:37,464 --> 00:51:38,833
Just aim it, and then...

1166
00:51:42,964 --> 00:51:44,004
Just aim it, and then...

1167
00:51:44,364 --> 00:51:45,373
(Smacking)

1168
00:51:46,933 --> 00:51:47,933
(Smacking)

1169
00:51:47,934 --> 00:51:49,904
(Shattered)

1170
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:53,642
(Laughing quietly)

1171
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:54,643
Did you see it?

1172
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:57,513
(Trying to hold back his laughter)

1173
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:58,984
(But he failed.)

1174
00:52:00,853 --> 00:52:03,054
How many pieces did it break into? Did you see it?

1175
00:52:03,324 --> 00:52:04,983
What's important is that it was broken into pieces.

1176
00:52:04,984 --> 00:52:06,253
- In how many pieces?
- Three.

1177
00:52:06,254 --> 00:52:08,893
- So it was about how to break it?
- That's right.

1178
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:12,734
Let's go.

1179
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:15,733
- I feel embarrassed.
- He is awesome.

1180
00:52:15,734 --> 00:52:16,763
(Ashamed)

1181
00:52:16,764 --> 00:52:20,602
He didn't throw it to the water because he's an ultimate master.

1182
00:52:20,603 --> 00:52:21,833
(Because he's an ultimate master.)

1183
00:52:22,103 --> 00:52:24,972
He is too skilled to throw it to the water, right?

1184
00:52:24,973 --> 00:52:26,573
- It touched the water, - Of course.

1185
00:52:26,574 --> 00:52:28,313
but you guys just couldn't see it.

1186
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:32,453
(Skipping stones has hurt Dong Il's ego.)

1187
00:52:33,284 --> 00:52:34,713
We're going this way for a walk...

1188
00:52:34,714 --> 00:52:36,253
- Yes, that's right.
- to the treehouse.

1189
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:38,154
(They are taking the walking trail to go to the treehouse.)

1190
00:52:38,824 --> 00:52:41,292
Dong Il, I think you should be an educator.

1191
00:52:41,293 --> 00:52:42,763
- I think I already am.
- You are?

1192
00:52:42,764 --> 00:52:43,764
- Yes.
- Gosh.

1193
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:47,562
- My gosh, Myoung was awesome.
- Yes, indeed.

1194
00:52:47,563 --> 00:52:49,563
It's really important from whom you learn.

1195
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:52,503
- His stone skipping was amazing.
- Absolutely.

1196
00:52:52,504 --> 00:52:54,472
- I haven't seen anything like that.
- Me neither.

1197
00:52:54,473 --> 00:52:55,804
- He did really well.
- Totally.

1198
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:59,242
Kitchen police, driver soldier...

1199
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:00,813
Can't there be something like a stone skipping soldier?

1200
00:53:01,773 --> 00:53:04,182
I think you'd be perfect for it if there were a position like that.

1201
00:53:04,183 --> 00:53:05,452
- I really think so.
- That's your duty.

1202
00:53:05,453 --> 00:53:06,783
(They tease one another again.)

1203
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:07,853
Our amazing Myoung...

1204
00:53:08,984 --> 00:53:10,884
- I feel great.
- Me too.

1205
00:53:11,223 --> 00:53:12,753
With this weather and the colors...

1206
00:53:12,754 --> 00:53:14,923
(They are entering the walking trail.)

1207
00:53:14,924 --> 00:53:17,364
- This is beautiful.
- Oh my, it's marvelous.

1208
00:53:17,563 --> 00:53:19,363
- I really like this trail.
- Okay.

1209
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:22,662
- Look at all the autumn leaves.
- Right.

1210
00:53:22,663 --> 00:53:24,263
- They are so red.
- Indeed.

1211
00:53:24,264 --> 00:53:25,503
The way to the treehouse is great.

1212
00:53:25,504 --> 00:53:27,673
Isn't it really pretty here? The colors are remarkable.

1213
00:53:27,674 --> 00:53:29,143
- Look at all the colors.
- It's so beautiful here.

1214
00:53:29,304 --> 00:53:31,143
- The autumn colors are brilliant.
- This path is so cool.

1215
00:53:31,603 --> 00:53:34,074
It's more beautiful with the sunlight.

1216
00:53:35,884 --> 00:53:39,554
(The trees have vivid colors like paints.)

1217
00:53:40,353 --> 00:53:42,222
Isn't it so wonderful here?

1218
00:53:42,223 --> 00:53:44,083
- It's beautiful.
- Look here.

1219
00:53:44,353 --> 00:53:46,453
- So beautiful.
- I love this vibe.

1220
00:53:48,154 --> 00:53:52,093
(They are enjoying the autumn vibes to the fullest.)

1221
00:53:52,094 --> 00:53:54,194
The autumn foliage is really amazing.

1222
00:53:55,563 --> 00:53:57,103
Look, there is the treehouse.

1223
00:53:57,304 --> 00:53:59,103
Yes, there it is.

1224
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:03,303
(While they are walking along the trail, they have spotted...)

1225
00:54:03,304 --> 00:54:04,404
I didn't expect this.

1226
00:54:05,174 --> 00:54:09,784
(a treehouse.)

1227
00:54:12,254 --> 00:54:15,884
(It was built by keeping the original shape of the tree.)

1228
00:54:16,784 --> 00:54:20,123
(This cabin is called a treehouse.)

1229
00:54:20,853 --> 00:54:22,763
- This pine tree is amazing.
- It's built so nicely.

1230
00:54:22,764 --> 00:54:24,562
- How did they build this?
- This pine tree is so huge.

1231
00:54:24,563 --> 00:54:26,463
This pine tree is really big.

1232
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:28,662
- There's a pillar in the middle.
- Right.

1233
00:54:28,663 --> 00:54:30,702
(Running)

1234
00:54:30,703 --> 00:54:31,963
- Can I go inside?
- Go ahead.

1235
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:35,674
(Safely filmed with permission from the owner)

1236
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,103
I'm so excited.

1237
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:42,182
Look, Dong Il. I think that's the electricity cable.

1238
00:54:42,183 --> 00:54:43,643
- Yes, I think so.
- Right?

1239
00:54:44,243 --> 00:54:45,953
I think the water runs too.

1240
00:54:47,853 --> 00:54:49,153
There is also a mosquito net.

1241
00:54:49,154 --> 00:54:50,553
(Entering the treehouse on the pine tree)

1242
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:52,554
Gosh, this is crazy.

1243
00:54:52,754 --> 00:54:53,923
There is also a mosquito net.

1244
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:56,292
(How would the inside look like?)

1245
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,493
(Goodness.)

1246
00:54:59,793 --> 00:55:00,932
What? This is it?

1247
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:03,333
- I think there's more space.
- Is it just for sitting?

1248
00:55:03,663 --> 00:55:06,333
No. There are stairs here.

1249
00:55:06,674 --> 00:55:07,803
- Wow.
- What?

1250
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,103
(As she turned her head, she found the stairs.)

1251
00:55:10,844 --> 00:55:13,543
- My gosh, this tree is...
- Isn't it terrific?

1252
00:55:14,413 --> 00:55:17,013
(Passing through the house, )

1253
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:19,353
(the tree stretches out toward the sky.)

1254
00:55:20,014 --> 00:55:23,953
(It looks like a treehouse in a fairy tale.)

1255
00:55:27,353 --> 00:55:29,424
- This is astounding.
- Absolutely.

1256
00:55:30,964 --> 00:55:32,333
There are stairs here.

1257
00:55:32,864 --> 00:55:34,763
- What?
- Inside here...

1258
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:37,034
(Going up)

1259
00:55:38,304 --> 00:55:40,773
- I see stairs and...
- What is up there?

1260
00:55:40,973 --> 00:55:42,373
- There is a small...
- Is it an attic?

1261
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:44,473
I see a small heater.

1262
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,812
(The staircase leads up to the attic in the treehouse.)

1263
00:55:50,813 --> 00:55:54,313
Gosh. It is perfect for couples, isn't it?

1264
00:55:55,054 --> 00:55:57,924
- For couples?
- That's right.

1265
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:02,892
(The space on the second floor seems romantic.)

1266
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:05,324
- Come on up.
- This is so impressive.

1267
00:56:05,634 --> 00:56:09,063
If I could, I would love to spend a night here.

1268
00:56:09,364 --> 00:56:11,062
- You would?
- It's really romantic.

1269
00:56:11,063 --> 00:56:12,273
Well, that's true.

1270
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:14,174
- Goodness.
- Did you hear that?

1271
00:56:15,504 --> 00:56:16,673
- Goodness.
- Did you hear that?

1272
00:56:16,674 --> 00:56:18,042
You know what? I don't think I would.

1273
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:19,344
(Giving up quickly)

1274
00:56:19,514 --> 00:56:21,513
- Whenever the tree moves...
- Right.

1275
00:56:21,514 --> 00:56:22,743
- You heard the sound?
- My goodness.

1276
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:24,913
- Is it because of the wind?
- Yes, because of the wind.

1277
00:56:25,813 --> 00:56:26,952
Oh my.

1278
00:56:26,953 --> 00:56:28,412
- Did you feel it?
- You felt it too, right?

1279
00:56:28,413 --> 00:56:29,484
- It moves.
- Yes.

1280
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,523
Why don't we go down now? It's dangerous.

1281
00:56:33,493 --> 00:56:35,823
(Myoung comes down the stairs first.)

1282
00:56:35,824 --> 00:56:36,892
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

1283
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,623
- How about we stay here?
- What?

1284
00:56:39,134 --> 00:56:40,433
UIe, go down quickly.

1285
00:56:42,764 --> 00:56:44,404
This house is pretty though.

1286
00:56:44,864 --> 00:56:47,332
Kids would love a treehouse like this.

1287
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:49,343
- Totally.
- They would be so excited.

1288
00:56:49,344 --> 00:56:50,472
- Right?
- Absolutely.

1289
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:52,142
- Isn't this road amazing?
- Yes, it is.

1290
00:56:52,143 --> 00:56:53,674
I really like this walk.

1291
00:56:54,174 --> 00:56:59,313
(The way back lies through the stretched ginkgo trees.)

1292
00:56:59,714 --> 00:57:02,654
- The leaves are all fallen.
- When I look at this path,

1293
00:57:03,723 --> 00:57:05,323
I feel like the path is...

1294
00:57:05,324 --> 00:57:07,622
showing me how to live like a compass.

1295
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:09,964
As if I could just calmly go straight.

1296
00:57:10,793 --> 00:57:13,062
I would love to have a compass like that.

1297
00:57:13,063 --> 00:57:14,662
- It's a compass for life.
- A compass for life...

1298
00:57:14,663 --> 00:57:17,864
That's right. Who is the compass of your life?

1299
00:57:18,973 --> 00:57:20,633
- My dad. I'll say my father.
- Your father?

1300
00:57:20,634 --> 00:57:21,903
(I'll say my father.)

1301
00:57:21,904 --> 00:57:23,873
UIe, you would also say your father is your compass?

1302
00:57:24,473 --> 00:57:26,143
- I'll say my parents.
- Of course.

1303
00:57:27,273 --> 00:57:28,373
What about you, Hee Won?

1304
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:30,143
Of course, it's you.

1305
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,812
- I'll say it's you as well.
- Me too.

1306
00:57:33,813 --> 00:57:34,813
Gosh, you guys...

1307
00:57:34,814 --> 00:57:37,424
- I'm burned with responsibility.
- You guys have a long way to go.

1308
00:57:38,424 --> 00:57:40,353
You should have noticed why he asked you that question.

1309
00:57:40,853 --> 00:57:43,093
- Gosh, when he asked me first, - You were rash.

1310
00:57:43,094 --> 00:57:45,523
- I should've noticed it.
- Yes, you should have.

1311
00:57:46,493 --> 00:57:47,563
You get it now?

1312
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:51,034
Guys, look back. Look back on the way you walked.

1313
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:57,004
Once in a while, you have to look back.

1314
00:57:59,473 --> 00:58:01,444
By looking at how far you have come,

1315
00:58:02,114 --> 00:58:04,643
you can realize how farther you can go forward.

1316
00:58:04,944 --> 00:58:07,682
It is important to look back...

1317
00:58:07,683 --> 00:58:09,754
because you can see how far you have come.

1318
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:14,623
(The autumn scenery in the afternoon makes them feel sentimental.)

1319
00:58:16,194 --> 00:58:17,463
Have you also thought like this?

1320
00:58:17,464 --> 00:58:20,062
"Why didn't I look around while walking along this beautiful path?"

1321
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:21,662
- Of course I have.
- Instead of just walking,

1322
00:58:21,663 --> 00:58:24,133
- I should've looked around more.
- I should've enjoyed more.

1323
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:25,733
Gosh, seriously...

1324
00:58:25,734 --> 00:58:29,973
With this one path, we can talk about life.

1325
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:34,614
It's like a piece of wordless advice from nature. A wordless lesson.

1326
00:58:35,313 --> 00:58:38,183
- Seriously...
- Life is difficult.

1327
00:58:45,453 --> 00:58:46,792
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1328
00:58:46,793 --> 00:58:51,324
(After the meaningful stroll, they are heading somewhere.)

1329
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,264
(Passing by the vast field, )

1330
00:58:58,734 --> 00:59:00,432
That must be it.

1331
00:59:00,433 --> 00:59:01,804
(where are they going?)

1332
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:04,074
I want to have bellflower roots.

1333
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,412
- Bellflower roots?
- Why don't we go and dig them up?

1334
00:59:06,413 --> 00:59:08,214
- That must be fun.
- Have you ever dug them up before?

1335
00:59:09,143 --> 00:59:12,313
As you already know, I have never done a lot of things.

1336
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,613
It's too bitter for me.

1337
00:59:14,614 --> 00:59:16,723
- Well, I'd love to try it.
- But we have honey here.

1338
00:59:16,924 --> 00:59:17,984
It's good for your bronchial tubes though.

1339
00:59:19,154 --> 00:59:21,392
Gosh. This village seems so nice.

1340
00:59:21,393 --> 00:59:22,522
(They are on their way to dig up bellflower roots.)

1341
00:59:22,523 --> 00:59:23,523
Dong Il, don't you think so?

1342
00:59:27,793 --> 00:59:33,333
(They have arrived.)

1343
00:59:34,933 --> 00:59:36,202
(Enjoying the relaxing vibe)

1344
00:59:36,203 --> 00:59:38,973
The houses seem so quiet and peaceful.

1345
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:43,682
You know what? This is a field of bellflower roots.

1346
00:59:43,683 --> 00:59:46,412
This is how the stem of bellflower root looks.

1347
00:59:46,413 --> 00:59:47,514
- Really?
- This is how it looks?

1348
00:59:47,554 --> 00:59:48,613
Yes, they are bellflower stems.

1349
00:59:48,614 --> 00:59:49,622
(They have arrived at the field of bellflower roots.)

1350
00:59:49,623 --> 00:59:51,083
My gosh.

1351
00:59:51,683 --> 00:59:53,723
- Don't they look like weeds?
- Yes, they do.

1352
00:59:53,893 --> 00:59:54,993
They are bellflower stems.

1353
00:59:56,223 --> 00:59:57,264
Bellflower stems.

1354
00:59:57,424 --> 01:00:00,293
- The roots are in the ground?
- Yes, that's right.

1355
01:00:00,634 --> 01:00:02,033
Are they white?

1356
01:00:02,034 --> 01:00:04,533
Who would think that this is a field of bellflower roots?

1357
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,633
- I don't think I would know.
- It's your first time, right?

1358
01:00:06,634 --> 01:00:07,734
(They are walking along the bellflower field in the autumn.)

1359
01:00:09,143 --> 01:00:10,742
- Hello.
- Hello.

1360
01:00:10,743 --> 01:00:11,803
Hello.

1361
01:00:11,804 --> 01:00:13,114
- Are you the owner?
- Hello.

1362
01:00:13,313 --> 01:00:14,344
- Hello.
- Hello.

1363
01:00:16,384 --> 01:00:19,353
Are they all bellflower roots?

1364
01:00:19,554 --> 01:00:21,054
Yes, they are.

1365
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:22,553
- All of them?
- My gosh.

1366
01:00:22,554 --> 01:00:24,553
Yes, they are all bellflower roots.

1367
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:29,663
(The vast field of bellflower roots unfolds in front of their eyes.)

1368
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:32,562
(When you pull it hard after clearing away the soil...)

1369
01:00:32,563 --> 01:00:34,893
(so that the rootlets aren't damaged, )

1370
01:00:36,134 --> 01:00:38,202
- That's so big.
- Yes.

1371
01:00:38,203 --> 01:00:40,804
(you can dig up a big bellflower root.)

1372
01:00:41,674 --> 01:00:46,014
I guess homi isn't good enough to dig it up. But with a garden fork...

1373
01:00:46,344 --> 01:00:49,713
He is using a garden fork.

1374
01:00:49,714 --> 01:00:51,384
(To dig up a bellflower root, a garden fork should be used.)

1375
01:00:52,514 --> 01:00:53,953
- After sticking it in, - Okay.

1376
01:00:54,614 --> 01:00:57,754
push it down, and lift the soil around.

1377
01:00:57,884 --> 01:00:59,892
(This is where the roots are.)

1378
01:00:59,893 --> 01:01:01,222
So that you don't break it.

1379
01:01:01,223 --> 01:01:03,123
(Lifting the soil around)

1380
01:01:03,364 --> 01:01:05,723
Goodness, I can see it. Sir.

1381
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:07,162
- Now with a homi...
- I got it.

1382
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,194
(Grown in the ground)

1383
01:01:08,663 --> 01:01:12,263
(Freshly dug bellflower roots)

1384
01:01:12,264 --> 01:01:13,304
There are more roots.

1385
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,404
(Exclaiming)

1386
01:01:16,743 --> 01:01:18,304
Look how big they are.

1387
01:01:19,344 --> 01:01:23,143
(The bellflower roots dug up from one spot have grown...)

1388
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:24,713
(in clean nature of Hongcheon...)

1389
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:27,984
(on the skirt of Mount Odae.)

1390
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:32,254
(After the full bloom of purple bellflowers, )

1391
01:01:32,953 --> 01:01:39,364
(the roots, which are a precious ingredient, can be dug up.)

1392
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:41,693
(Staring)

1393
01:01:41,694 --> 01:01:43,804
Look. They are hugging each other.

1394
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:45,234
I see.

1395
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:49,142
How did you dig up such unique ones?

1396
01:01:49,143 --> 01:01:51,674
They are hugging each other. As if a mom is hugging her child.

1397
01:01:52,143 --> 01:01:54,042
Is this a good size to make fermented drinks?

1398
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,082
It has to be grown for at least three years...

1399
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:58,384
to make it medicinal liquor.

1400
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:00,682
Does your father like fermented drinks?

1401
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:01,952
Yes, he loves to drink.

1402
01:02:01,953 --> 01:02:03,022
Why don't you call and ask him now?

1403
01:02:03,023 --> 01:02:05,723
Ask him if he would like it or not.

1404
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:07,992
- My dad?
- As a present...

1405
01:02:07,993 --> 01:02:09,022
(Dong Il wants to give a present to UIe's father.)

1406
01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:10,424
Tell him that these are good bellflower roots.

1407
01:02:11,563 --> 01:02:13,633
(She's calling her father.)

1408
01:02:13,634 --> 01:02:14,693
Ask your father...

1409
01:02:14,694 --> 01:02:16,504
- if he wants them.
- Dad.

1410
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,163
(My daughter.)

1411
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:20,904
- My daughter.
- Dad,

1412
01:02:21,703 --> 01:02:23,444
have you ever tried alcohol fermented with bellflower roots?

1413
01:02:24,304 --> 01:02:25,743
- Bellflower root alcohol?
- Yes.

1414
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:26,973
No, I haven't.

1415
01:02:27,473 --> 01:02:28,673
Okay, do you want to try it?

1416
01:02:28,674 --> 01:02:30,214
(Do you want to try bellflower root alcohol?)

1417
01:02:30,884 --> 01:02:31,943
Of course I want.

1418
01:02:31,944 --> 01:02:33,453
(I thought so.)

1419
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:35,614
It's pretty expensive though.

1420
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,324
Okay, bye.

1421
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:40,022
(Everyone is surprised by his clear answer.)

1422
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:41,093
Let me talk to him.

1423
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:44,393
Dad, I'm here with Dong Il.

1424
01:02:44,824 --> 01:02:46,333
Oh, really?

1425
01:02:46,694 --> 01:02:47,734
Hello.

1426
01:02:47,933 --> 01:02:51,432
- Hello. Goodness.
- Hello. Goodness.

1427
01:02:51,433 --> 01:02:54,173
Is my daughter behaving herself?

1428
01:02:54,174 --> 01:02:56,102
Of course. You have a wonderful daughter.

1429
01:02:56,103 --> 01:02:57,174
- Come on.
- I envy you.

1430
01:02:58,373 --> 01:02:59,613
Thank you for being nice to her.

1431
01:02:59,614 --> 01:03:02,713
She is so proud of you, and she talked about you a lot.

1432
01:03:02,714 --> 01:03:05,713
I taught her to do that. I told her to talk about me in a good way.

1433
01:03:05,714 --> 01:03:07,813
Okay, Dad. Bye.

1434
01:03:07,913 --> 01:03:10,182
- All right.
- I'll bring some roots for you.

1435
01:03:10,183 --> 01:03:11,423
(I'll bring some bellflower roots for you.)

1436
01:03:11,424 --> 01:03:13,053
- Okay.
- Bye.

1437
01:03:13,054 --> 01:03:14,094
Bye.

1438
01:03:15,054 --> 01:03:16,363
Your father seems very cool.

1439
01:03:16,364 --> 01:03:17,823
- My dad?
- He is a cute dad.

1440
01:03:17,824 --> 01:03:20,163
- Right.
- My dad wants to try it.

1441
01:03:22,563 --> 01:03:24,464
Can we buy some bellflower roots?

1442
01:03:25,504 --> 01:03:26,602
Here they are.

1443
01:03:26,603 --> 01:03:28,633
(Here are some bellflower roots.)

1444
01:03:28,634 --> 01:03:29,702
Well...

1445
01:03:29,703 --> 01:03:32,242
(They are buying some roots for dinner.)

1446
01:03:32,243 --> 01:03:34,312
- Thank you.
- I picked good ones.

1447
01:03:34,313 --> 01:03:36,783
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1448
01:03:36,784 --> 01:03:37,913
(And some more for UIe's father)

1449
01:03:38,484 --> 01:03:39,852
I think this will be enough.

1450
01:03:39,853 --> 01:03:40,952
(Some dried radish greens for gamjatang as well)

1451
01:03:40,953 --> 01:03:42,353
Just the half is fine.

1452
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,153
They don't need to be peeled because they are soft enough.

1453
01:03:46,154 --> 01:03:47,754
- They are?
- Yes. You can use it as it is.

1454
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:50,864
My gosh.

1455
01:03:51,364 --> 01:03:52,563
We have a lot of potatoes too.

1456
01:03:52,893 --> 01:03:54,162
Please take the good ones.

1457
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,933
(They also have potatoes which will be the main ingredient for dinner.)

1458
01:03:56,464 --> 01:03:57,833
My goodness, they are so big.

1459
01:03:59,574 --> 01:04:00,733
(Picking big and good ones)

1460
01:04:00,734 --> 01:04:02,203
We need big ones.

1461
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:04,773
Put the big ones in here.

1462
01:04:05,103 --> 01:04:06,713
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the ingredients.

1463
01:04:06,714 --> 01:04:10,042
- Thank you very much.
- I hope you like them.

1464
01:04:10,043 --> 01:04:11,843
- Take care.
- Thank you.

1465
01:04:11,844 --> 01:04:14,352
- Take care.
- Bye.

1466
01:04:14,353 --> 01:04:15,413
Bye.

1467
01:04:15,754 --> 01:04:22,424
(She sings on her way back to the house.)

1468
01:04:22,623 --> 01:04:25,793
(I feel great.)

1469
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:29,463
The more I see this path, the more beautiful it is.

1470
01:04:29,464 --> 01:04:30,504
(He's been saying the same thing over and over.)

1471
01:04:35,703 --> 01:04:37,602
Done? Did you get everything?

1472
01:04:37,603 --> 01:04:39,143
(They are back home with their hands full of healthy ingredients.)

1473
01:04:39,973 --> 01:04:41,972
I'll cook the rice first.

1474
01:04:41,973 --> 01:04:43,543
Okay. You do that, and...

1475
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:47,714
- I'll clean the potatoes.
- Shall we prep the potatoes then?

1476
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:50,582
After cleaning the potatoes, we can cut them.

1477
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:51,654
(What are they going to cook for dinner with potatoes?)

1478
01:04:52,023 --> 01:04:53,824
(Help yourself.)

1479
01:04:56,163 --> 01:04:58,623
Is there a war or something?

1480
01:04:58,793 --> 01:05:03,163
(The table is full of potato dishes.)

1481
01:05:03,364 --> 01:05:06,134
(Today, they are going to have potatoes grown in Gangwon Province.)

1482
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:10,473
(Crunchy and crispy julienned potato jeon)

1483
01:05:10,904 --> 01:05:15,574
(Freshly deep-fried French fries)

1484
01:05:16,043 --> 01:05:20,953
(Spicy gamjatang)

1485
01:05:21,413 --> 01:05:25,424
(The dinner table will be filled with delicious potato dishes.)

1486
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:29,054
(Besides, gamjatang reminds us of this person.)

1487
01:05:30,194 --> 01:05:32,663
(Drunk Hee Won)

1488
01:05:33,194 --> 01:05:35,332
(Hey. Stop drinking, would you?)

1489
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:38,464
(In reality, he can't drink alcohol at all.)

1490
01:05:38,563 --> 01:05:41,304
(It's the best hangover cure for me. You know that?)

1491
01:05:42,234 --> 01:05:46,344
(How would Hee Won, who cannot drink, enjoy gamjatang today?)

1492
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:50,283
- We should wash the potatoes first.
- Right.

1493
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:53,254
After cleaning the potatoes, cut them, and then...

1494
01:05:53,614 --> 01:05:56,013
Clean the potatoes, cut them...

1495
01:05:56,014 --> 01:05:57,583
and then, I have to soak them in water.

1496
01:05:58,723 --> 01:06:01,992
- Shall I clean all of them?
- Yes, wash them first.

1497
01:06:01,993 --> 01:06:02,993
All right.

1498
01:06:03,223 --> 01:06:06,493
(Pouring)

1499
01:06:06,663 --> 01:06:08,993
(The basket is full of potatoes for the dinner.)

1500
01:06:09,264 --> 01:06:11,864
(Nicely washing the potatoes)

1501
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:15,303
(Putting the big ones into the bowl first)

1502
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,944
- Are you using sweet potatoes too?
- Yes. I need sweet potatoes too.

1503
01:06:18,804 --> 01:06:20,514
I'll wash the two big ones then.

1504
01:06:21,473 --> 01:06:24,784
(Washing the sweet potatoes dug up from her grandmother's field)

1505
01:06:25,183 --> 01:06:28,353
(Gently washing the bellflower roots with a brush)

1506
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:31,284
(They are precious roots.)

1507
01:06:31,953 --> 01:06:33,493
(Glimpsing)

1508
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:35,522
Do you think your father would really like my present?

1509
01:06:35,523 --> 01:06:38,122
He seemed very excited when I texted him a while ago.

1510
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:40,292
- He texted me back in a cute way.
- Okay.

1511
01:06:40,293 --> 01:06:41,734
He said, "Yay!"

1512
01:06:42,134 --> 01:06:43,233
- He did?
- Yes.

1513
01:06:43,234 --> 01:06:44,263
(Relieved)

1514
01:06:44,264 --> 01:06:46,404
(Dad, I'm coming with the roots.)

1515
01:06:47,134 --> 01:06:49,603
- Now we need to peel the potatoes.
- Okay.

1516
01:06:50,504 --> 01:06:52,073
All right. I'm ready.

1517
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:54,473
Gosh, Hee Won is going to make a nice dish today.

1518
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:57,213
One of the potatoes is surprisingly big.

1519
01:06:57,214 --> 01:06:58,242
It is?

1520
01:06:58,243 --> 01:07:01,013
Give me four potatoes for gamjatang, okay?

1521
01:07:01,014 --> 01:07:02,613
Okay. Put it here.

1522
01:07:02,614 --> 01:07:04,154
(They are going to peel the potatoes.)

1523
01:07:04,683 --> 01:07:05,723
How do I use this?

1524
01:07:08,223 --> 01:07:10,723
(Turning the potato peeler)

1525
01:07:11,493 --> 01:07:14,094
(Turning)

1526
01:07:14,393 --> 01:07:17,103
(What are you doing?)

1527
01:07:18,163 --> 01:07:20,873
- How does it work? Like this?
- Yes.

1528
01:07:21,573 --> 01:07:22,573
Okay, I got it.

1529
01:07:22,574 --> 01:07:24,903
(Finally, he figured out how to hold it.)

1530
01:07:25,344 --> 01:07:26,612
(Groaning)

1531
01:07:26,613 --> 01:07:28,014
(Groaning)

1532
01:07:28,243 --> 01:07:30,814
(He groans as he is fully focused.)

1533
01:07:31,144 --> 01:07:34,113
(Myoung is using a potato peeler too.)

1534
01:07:34,354 --> 01:07:37,924
(UIe is going outside to prep the potatoes with them.)

1535
01:07:38,184 --> 01:07:39,524
Right, I need a potato peeler too.

1536
01:07:40,123 --> 01:07:41,453
A potato peeler.

1537
01:07:42,623 --> 01:07:45,564
(She is back in the kitchen looking for a potato peeler.)

1538
01:07:45,823 --> 01:07:48,533
(Is there another one?)

1539
01:07:49,964 --> 01:07:52,803
- We don't need to peel it nicely.
- Okay.

1540
01:07:52,804 --> 01:07:53,873
(While they are peeling the potatoes with a peeler, )

1541
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:55,532
Will this work?

1542
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:56,844
(UIe is holding a stainless steel spoon.)

1543
01:07:59,543 --> 01:08:02,072
(Scratching)

1544
01:08:02,073 --> 01:08:04,714
(Gosh.)

1545
01:08:04,983 --> 01:08:07,714
(She is scratching the peel off with a spoon.)

1546
01:08:07,913 --> 01:08:08,913
(Amazed)

1547
01:08:08,914 --> 01:08:11,554
You're really good. I'll just peel these for you.

1548
01:08:12,554 --> 01:08:15,953
(She could peel them easily with a tool made for it, )

1549
01:08:16,264 --> 01:08:19,293
(but the guest wants to help them in any way she can.)

1550
01:08:19,464 --> 01:08:22,934
(Scraping)

1551
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:28,533
(Worn out)

1552

(A passionate potato carver)

1553
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:34,412
I'll peel it for you. You can cut it.

1554
01:08:34,413 --> 01:08:36,542
- Yes, cut it.
- Should I cut it?

1555
01:08:36,543 --> 01:08:37,543
(UIe's new task is to cut the potatoes.)

1556
01:08:37,544 --> 01:08:39,112
I'll put this over here.

1557
01:08:39,113 --> 01:08:41,184
(She picks one of the peeled potatoes...)

1558
01:08:41,514 --> 01:08:44,153
(and cuts it in half first.)

1559
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,094
(Hesitating)

1560
01:08:47,424 --> 01:08:48,723
(How do you julienne vegetables?)

1561
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:49,724
Is this right?

1562
01:08:50,594 --> 01:08:53,594
(He can't help but watch her.)

1563
01:08:53,993 --> 01:08:57,233
(Uneasy)

1564
01:08:57,964 --> 01:08:59,263
Is this right?

1565
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:00,974
(To be honest, UIe...)

1566
01:09:01,434 --> 01:09:03,403
UIe, do you want to cook something?

1567
01:09:03,844 --> 01:09:06,613
(Cook something?)

1568
01:09:07,913 --> 01:09:09,644
Nothing I make tastes good.

1569
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:12,513
I'm really bad at cooking. I don't even know what to make.

1570
01:09:12,514 --> 01:09:15,153
We'll enjoy whatever you make.

1571
01:09:15,314 --> 01:09:17,184
(That's my specialty.)

1572
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:19,692
(Cooking newbie, UIe, was filled with worries.)

1573
01:09:19,693 --> 01:09:20,724
What should I do?

1574
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,634
- Aren't you making the jeon?
- Yes.

1575
01:09:26,733 --> 01:09:29,564
(A bit nervous)

1576
01:09:30,804 --> 01:09:34,403
(It's a bit awkward, but she cuts it the best she can.)

1577
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:36,343
Is this too thick?

1578
01:09:36,344 --> 01:09:37,644
(Is this too thick?)

1579
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:42,373
(The julienned potatoes are all different sizes.)

1580
01:09:43,644 --> 01:09:44,684
Hey!

1581
01:09:45,684 --> 01:09:47,913
Hey! That looks great!

1582
01:09:48,283 --> 01:09:49,412
(Hee Won is satisfied with the potatoes UIe cut?)

1583
01:09:49,413 --> 01:09:50,453
Really?

1584
01:09:51,184 --> 01:09:52,622
You should just cut all of it.

1585
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:55,854
It's about the size of French fries.

1586
01:09:56,394 --> 01:09:59,393
- Should I just keep cutting?
- You should just do what you do.

1587
01:09:59,394 --> 01:10:00,394
I'll cut it.

1588
01:10:00,564 --> 01:10:02,094
Rather than this...

1589
01:10:02,634 --> 01:10:04,863
- Make it a bit thicker?
- Yes. Make it a bit thicker.

1590
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:06,203
Goodness.

1591
01:10:06,873 --> 01:10:07,934
Rather than this...

1592
01:10:09,134 --> 01:10:11,703
A little bit more... About this big, but a bit thicker.

1593
01:10:11,903 --> 01:10:15,043
(A cooking newbie teaches another newbie.)

1594
01:10:15,974 --> 01:10:18,613
- Thicker than that.
- Thicker?

1595
01:10:19,184 --> 01:10:20,353
Like this?

1596
01:10:20,354 --> 01:10:23,122
A lot thicker. You know...

1597
01:10:23,123 --> 01:10:24,884
Like the ones you eat at those places.

1598
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:26,894
In the style of the ones you eat at those places.

1599
01:10:28,254 --> 01:10:29,394
Isn't this too thick?

1600
01:10:30,363 --> 01:10:32,193
- Isn't this too thick?
- What?

1601
01:10:32,724 --> 01:10:34,192
That's perfect.

1602
01:10:34,193 --> 01:10:36,402
- Is it okay?
- Did you get lessons or something?

1603
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:37,463
(She's happy.)

1604
01:10:37,464 --> 01:10:40,173
- About this big?
- The size of this is perfect.

1605
01:10:40,174 --> 01:10:41,233
- Really?
- Yes.

1606
01:10:42,674 --> 01:10:43,742
Is this right?

1607
01:10:43,743 --> 01:10:44,902
(She's an expert at cutting French fries.)

1608
01:10:44,903 --> 01:10:45,974
Done.

1609
01:10:47,214 --> 01:10:48,343
Nice.

1610
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:49,373
(Her confidence goes up.)

1611
01:10:49,543 --> 01:10:52,313
That's right. Nice.

1612
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:54,412
- But it looks like this.
- Don't worry about the shape.

1613
01:10:54,413 --> 01:10:57,224
- But this is too big.
- Not at all. It's perfect.

1614
01:10:57,483 --> 01:11:00,354
(It's okay if you make them into big chunks.)

1615
01:11:00,524 --> 01:11:01,593
But this is...

1616
01:11:01,594 --> 01:11:04,323
No. This is how they have it abroad.

1617
01:11:04,663 --> 01:11:06,063
I must be a good cook.

1618
01:11:06,064 --> 01:11:08,733
Gosh, you're good.

1619
01:11:09,594 --> 01:11:12,163
I thought you learned how to cook.

1620
01:11:12,403 --> 01:11:15,903
I think it would look nice if you cut these with the roots.

1621
01:11:17,104 --> 01:11:19,844
(Struggling)

1622
01:11:20,144 --> 01:11:21,173
Okay.

1623
01:11:21,174 --> 01:11:23,913
(She cuts the bellflower roots that they're frying too.)

1624
01:11:24,014 --> 01:11:26,814
(The sweet potatoes will be thinner.)

1625
01:11:27,554 --> 01:11:30,823
(He cuts them in round circles to prepare it to get fried.)

1626
01:11:30,924 --> 01:11:33,754
These are for Dong Il. Hey, Dong Il.

1627
01:11:34,653 --> 01:11:37,094
- These are for you.
- Okay.

1628
01:11:37,193 --> 01:11:39,934
- Here. You can put it in whole.
- Okay.

1629
01:11:40,134 --> 01:11:42,934
(Dong Il is alone in the kitchen again.)

1630
01:11:43,363 --> 01:11:46,873
(While three of them are working on the potatoes...)

1631
01:11:47,604 --> 01:11:51,104
(What is the head of the house doing?)

1632
01:11:51,203 --> 01:11:52,604
(He boils the dried radish greens.)

1633
01:11:53,814 --> 01:11:56,684
(He boils them for a long time, so they're tender.)

1634
01:11:56,943 --> 01:11:58,413
(He boils the backbones.)

1635
01:11:59,644 --> 01:12:02,913
(He gets rid of the blood by boiling the backbones.)

1636
01:12:03,184 --> 01:12:04,583
(He boils them again.)

1637
01:12:06,554 --> 01:12:09,224
(While the milky broth is being made, )

1638
01:12:09,424 --> 01:12:12,363
(he cuts the main ingredient, potatoes, )

1639
01:12:12,663 --> 01:12:16,402
(and covers the backbones with them.)

1640
01:12:16,403 --> 01:12:17,434
(His right hand adds coarse red chili pepper powder.)

1641
01:12:18,504 --> 01:12:19,564
(His right hand adds fine red chili pepper powder.)

1642
01:12:20,804 --> 01:12:23,643
(He uses both hands to add some spicy colors.)

1643
01:12:23,644 --> 01:12:25,503
(He goes...)

1644
01:12:25,504 --> 01:12:27,373
(back and forth.)

1645
01:12:27,774 --> 01:12:31,144
(Making gamjatang takes a lot of effort.)

1646
01:12:31,543 --> 01:12:34,453
(He puts in a ton of boiled dried radish greens...)

1647
01:12:34,754 --> 01:12:37,323
(and plenty of other vegetables.)

1648
01:12:37,724 --> 01:12:42,354
(Then a pot of gamjatang is ready.)

1649
01:12:43,724 --> 01:12:45,493
(Goodness.)

1650
01:12:46,024 --> 01:12:47,963
(What Dong Il has done...)

1651
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:49,532
(Wash perilla leaves, boil backbones, cut potatoes...)

1652
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:50,604
(They're still cutting potatoes.)

1653
01:12:51,403 --> 01:12:52,764
- Watch your hands.
- Okay.

1654
01:12:53,104 --> 01:12:55,433
Where should we put the oil to fry this?

1655
01:12:55,434 --> 01:12:58,644
Don't we need a big round pot?

1656
01:12:59,004 --> 01:13:01,873
- We should use the big frying pan.
- Right?

1657
01:13:02,174 --> 01:13:04,243
Don't we also need...

1658
01:13:04,783 --> 01:13:07,313
a net to take it out?

1659
01:13:07,314 --> 01:13:08,982
- We have a net.
- We do?

1660
01:13:08,983 --> 01:13:11,453
(He looks for a pan to use for frying.)

1661
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:14,193
(Digging)

1662
01:13:16,123 --> 01:13:19,493
(Where should we fry it?)

1663
01:13:19,894 --> 01:13:22,094
Hey, Myoung.

1664
01:13:22,793 --> 01:13:24,703
We can't use this. Right?

1665
01:13:26,504 --> 01:13:28,774
- I don't think we can use it.
- Right? I didn't think so.

1666
01:13:28,934 --> 01:13:30,173
This isn't a pan, right?

1667
01:13:30,174 --> 01:13:32,373
- I don't think we can use it.
- Right? I didn't think so.

1668
01:13:33,814 --> 01:13:36,783
(Then what should we use?)

1669
01:13:37,144 --> 01:13:39,343
Can we use this one? Look.

1670
01:13:39,344 --> 01:13:40,354
(Myoung, what about this one?)

1671
01:13:40,684 --> 01:13:42,884
Were you talking about this?

1672
01:13:43,483 --> 01:13:45,123
- Hey, Myoung.
- Yes?

1673
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:46,554
This one.

1674
01:13:47,024 --> 01:13:48,894
(What about this one?)

1675
01:13:49,323 --> 01:13:50,623
I think that's perfect.

1676
01:13:52,564 --> 01:13:54,093
(It took forever to choose a pan.)

1677
01:13:54,094 --> 01:13:55,964
Isn't this one a bit small?

1678
01:13:59,663 --> 01:14:00,902
I'm almost done.

1679
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:02,174
(I'm almost done making the gamjatang.)

1680
01:14:02,373 --> 01:14:03,803
- We have this one too.
- We do.

1681
01:14:03,804 --> 01:14:05,103
Let's use this one.

1682
01:14:05,104 --> 01:14:07,674
- We need to shake off the oil.
- Right.

1683
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,043
I believe in you guys.

1684
01:14:10,443 --> 01:14:12,344
- What?
- I believe in you guys.

1685
01:14:12,943 --> 01:14:15,783
You'll do a great job since the three of you are working together.

1686
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:18,582
We're almost done.

1687
01:14:18,583 --> 01:14:19,893
- Are you really?
- Yes.

1688
01:14:19,894 --> 01:14:20,894
I see.

1689
01:14:21,094 --> 01:14:24,223
We just need to heat up the oil...

1690
01:14:24,224 --> 01:14:25,564
and put in the ingredients.

1691
01:14:26,733 --> 01:14:27,792
Hurry up.

1692
01:14:27,793 --> 01:14:29,464
- Okay.
- Okay.

1693
01:14:29,594 --> 01:14:30,662
Let's see.

1694
01:14:30,663 --> 01:14:32,763
(Approaching)

1695
01:14:32,764 --> 01:14:35,572
Don't we just need to put in the oil, boil it,

1696
01:14:35,573 --> 01:14:37,703
- cover it in starch, and put it in?
- Yes.

1697
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:39,073
Right?

1698
01:14:40,014 --> 01:14:41,413
(Sighing)

1699
01:14:43,043 --> 01:14:44,843
I should take a look at the recipe too.

1700
01:14:44,844 --> 01:14:45,913
(She's nervous.)

1701
01:14:47,854 --> 01:14:51,183
(Cooking newbies can't cook without a recipe.)

1702
01:14:51,184 --> 01:14:54,153
Flour, pancake mix...

1703
01:14:54,894 --> 01:14:58,662
(She measures it with a spoon and follows the recipe.)

1704
01:14:58,663 --> 01:15:01,993
(She even adds exactly one spoonful of water.)

1705
01:15:02,493 --> 01:15:05,063
(She prepares the batter with her exact measurements.)

1706
01:15:05,064 --> 01:15:06,064
Okay.

1707
01:15:07,403 --> 01:15:08,433
Lastly...

1708
01:15:08,434 --> 01:15:10,903
(She takes a look at the recipe one last time.)

1709
01:15:14,314 --> 01:15:15,613
Nice.

1710
01:15:16,783 --> 01:15:20,413
(She puts the batter on the frying pan.)

1711
01:15:20,814 --> 01:15:24,854
(Once she spreads it out, the varied sizes are more obvious.)

1712
01:15:25,384 --> 01:15:28,193
(I hope it comes out well.)

1713
01:15:29,493 --> 01:15:31,293
Oh, like that?

1714
01:15:32,163 --> 01:15:35,133
(The batter hasn't cooked yet, )

1715
01:15:35,134 --> 01:15:38,304
(but the cooking newbie doesn't wait and tries to flip it.)

1716
01:15:38,604 --> 01:15:41,533
(It's not working.)

1717
01:15:42,674 --> 01:15:45,104
(This won't do.)

1718
01:15:45,644 --> 01:15:48,974
(She grabs a big plate...)

1719
01:15:49,413 --> 01:15:52,543
(and covers the pan with it.)

1720
01:15:52,644 --> 01:15:54,214
(One, two...)

1721
01:15:55,153 --> 01:15:56,184
Wait, hold on.

1722
01:15:56,924 --> 01:15:59,153
(Hold on... This is...)

1723
01:15:59,483 --> 01:16:01,292
(She's leaving the kitchen?)

1724
01:16:01,293 --> 01:16:03,122
Don't get mad.

1725
01:16:03,123 --> 01:16:04,492
(She takes a seat in the corner.)

1726
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:05,923
Don't curse.

1727
01:16:05,924 --> 01:16:08,493
(She twists her body around to flip it.)

1728
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:12,134
(She takes the potato jeon that she flipped onto the plate...)

1729
01:16:12,604 --> 01:16:16,033
(and slides it back onto the pan.)

1730
01:16:19,504 --> 01:16:21,214
(Falling)

1731
01:16:22,043 --> 01:16:25,613
(She presses down to make them stick together.)

1732
01:16:26,184 --> 01:16:29,153
(Stay calm. You can do it.)

1733
01:16:30,153 --> 01:16:32,184
(Peeking)

1734
01:16:35,793 --> 01:16:38,663
- You were focused.
- Yes, I was.

1735
01:16:39,524 --> 01:16:42,292
(She focuses to make sure it is cooked evenly.)

1736
01:16:42,293 --> 01:16:45,434
How it tastes isn't important. How it looks is most important.

1737
01:16:46,203 --> 01:16:48,703
(That's right. How it looks!)

1738
01:16:49,733 --> 01:16:52,403
(Let's see...)

1739
01:16:53,144 --> 01:16:56,543
(UIe prepares something secretly.)

1740
01:16:57,344 --> 01:16:58,384
Dong Il said...

1741
01:16:58,943 --> 01:17:00,283
that how it looks is more important than how it tastes.

1742
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,113
- Are you making it look nice?
- Yes.

1743
01:17:03,684 --> 01:17:07,054
(What did UIe prepare to make it look nice?)

1744
01:17:07,453 --> 01:17:08,594
(Peeking)

1745
01:17:10,493 --> 01:17:13,224
(A shocking visual)

1746
01:17:13,323 --> 01:17:16,434
(She's decorating the cooked potato jeon with ham.)

1747
01:17:16,804 --> 01:17:20,333
(It is a difficult dish to understand.)

1748
01:17:20,573 --> 01:17:23,174
(What is that?)

1749
01:17:23,903 --> 01:17:27,413
(She tries to flip it.)

1750
01:17:27,844 --> 01:17:30,743
(Unsteady)

1751
01:17:31,884 --> 01:17:34,413
I'm just going to use flour for deep-frying with the sweet potatoes.

1752
01:17:34,514 --> 01:17:36,854
I'm just going to use flour for deep-frying with the sweet potatoes.

1753
01:17:37,024 --> 01:17:40,354
- What about water?
- I think I can just use flour.

1754
01:17:41,024 --> 01:17:42,793
You can just do it. It doesn't matter.

1755
01:17:43,663 --> 01:17:46,564
(She even looks a bit proud.)

1756
01:17:46,894 --> 01:17:49,634
(The dish is getting harder to understand.)

1757
01:17:50,064 --> 01:17:52,934
(She wants to flip it over to cook the ham.)

1758
01:17:53,774 --> 01:17:55,634
- Did you cut it?
- Darn it.

1759
01:17:57,004 --> 01:18:01,474
(While everyone is busy cooking the dish they're in charge of, )

1760
01:18:01,814 --> 01:18:05,684
(this dish is slowly getting ruined.)

1761
01:18:06,083 --> 01:18:08,253
(She decides to change it to stir-fried ham.)

1762
01:18:08,254 --> 01:18:09,413
Soy sauce for soup.

1763
01:18:11,684 --> 01:18:12,853
(Laughing)

1764
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,653
(Sighing)

1765
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:18,993
(It's a potato jeon with a side of ham now.)

1766
01:18:19,163 --> 01:18:21,394
(But something that you can't forget is...)

1767
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:25,362
(the colorful visual.)

1768
01:18:25,363 --> 01:18:28,004
(How will this dish taste?)

1769
01:18:28,867 --> 01:18:30,637
Shouldn't we start boiling the oil?

1770
01:18:30,638 --> 01:18:33,537
- I think we should put the oil on.
- Right.

1771
01:18:34,007 --> 01:18:35,507
I just need to pour this in, right?

1772
01:18:35,707 --> 01:18:37,417
Yes. Just take off the lid.

1773
01:18:39,917 --> 01:18:42,086
(The lid of the cooking oil isn't coming off.)

1774
01:18:42,087 --> 01:18:43,188
How do you open this?

1775
01:18:44,058 --> 01:18:47,627
(It just keeps turning in vain.)

1776
01:18:48,127 --> 01:18:49,326
Give it to me.

1777
01:18:49,327 --> 01:18:50,797
(Give it to me.)

1778
01:18:51,457 --> 01:18:53,156
(He takes a look at it...)

1779
01:18:53,157 --> 01:18:54,398
This needs to come off.

1780
01:18:55,327 --> 01:18:56,728
You just need to pull it off.

1781
01:18:56,928 --> 01:18:57,997
You just need to pull it off?

1782
01:18:58,867 --> 01:19:01,138
(Our home is just as harmonious as ever.)

1783
01:19:01,438 --> 01:19:02,738
You just need to pull it off?

1784
01:19:03,608 --> 01:19:04,638
Can you do this for me too?

1785
01:19:05,478 --> 01:19:07,247
This isn't my part.

1786
01:19:07,948 --> 01:19:09,546
So we're going to divide up into separate parts now?

1787
01:19:09,547 --> 01:19:11,716
I want to try that today.

1788
01:19:11,717 --> 01:19:14,348
- Okay.
- I really want to trust you.

1789
01:19:14,547 --> 01:19:16,286
- Okay.
- Don't put too much in.

1790
01:19:16,287 --> 01:19:18,358
- Okay.
- Just use two bottles.

1791
01:19:19,157 --> 01:19:23,457
(He tries to open up the remaining bottle, )

1792
01:19:24,657 --> 01:19:27,698
(but it won't open.)

1793
01:19:30,598 --> 01:19:31,836
- Hey, Myoung.
- Yes?

1794
01:19:31,837 --> 01:19:33,398
He said that this comes right off.

1795
01:19:34,337 --> 01:19:36,166
(Struggling)

1796
01:19:36,167 --> 01:19:37,207
Isn't that strange?

1797
01:19:37,808 --> 01:19:39,906
- Can you do it, Dong Il?
- How did you do it?

1798
01:19:39,907 --> 01:19:41,047
We can't do it.

1799
01:19:41,478 --> 01:19:43,278
(My goodness.)

1800
01:19:43,948 --> 01:19:45,017
Why won't it work?

1801
01:19:45,018 --> 01:19:46,978
(The oldest brother gets up to help.)

1802
01:19:47,547 --> 01:19:49,448
(Popping)

1803
01:19:50,488 --> 01:19:52,757
(Cool and cynical)

1804
01:19:55,428 --> 01:19:57,997
(How did he do it?)

1805
01:19:58,257 --> 01:20:01,827
(While they heat up two bottles of cooking oil...)

1806
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:03,167
Pull it.

1807
01:20:03,168 --> 01:20:04,867
(The youngest is on his knees.)

1808
01:20:05,098 --> 01:20:07,238
(He's preparing the batter for the fritters.)

1809
01:20:07,337 --> 01:20:10,608
(He seasons it with salt and pepper.)

1810
01:20:10,877 --> 01:20:13,577
(He coats it evenly.)

1811
01:20:13,808 --> 01:20:16,907
What is the ratio of the flours you're using?

1812
01:20:17,577 --> 01:20:19,716
Can't you just coat it like this?

1813
01:20:19,717 --> 01:20:20,787
Just coat it.

1814
01:20:21,087 --> 01:20:24,657
(They sit side by side to finish preparing the fritters.)

1815
01:20:25,018 --> 01:20:26,388
In the pot...

1816
01:20:26,787 --> 01:20:29,058
If you put a drop of this in...

1817
01:20:29,827 --> 01:20:32,326
- Just put a drop of it in?
- Yes.

1818
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:35,827
(He puts in a drop of the frying batter into the oil.)

1819
01:20:37,068 --> 01:20:38,597
It's floating. Look.

1820
01:20:38,598 --> 01:20:39,738
(The batter is floating around in the oil.)

1821
01:20:39,938 --> 01:20:42,768
- I'll put it in one at a time.
- Okay. Use your hands.

1822
01:20:43,907 --> 01:20:45,808
It's working! It's cooking really well!

1823
01:20:45,978 --> 01:20:47,778
I knew it.

1824
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:52,818
(The sound of the potatoes frying makes them all happy.)

1825
01:20:53,217 --> 01:20:54,517
(Stirring)

1826
01:20:54,518 --> 01:20:56,518
Look at the snap of his wrist.

1827
01:20:56,888 --> 01:20:58,656
It looks like you've done this for 23 years too.

1828
01:20:58,657 --> 01:21:01,456
You've made charcoal for 23 years and fritters for 23 years.

1829
01:21:01,457 --> 01:21:02,858
(Today, he transforms into a fritter master.)

1830
01:21:03,388 --> 01:21:04,456
He's very good.

1831
01:21:04,457 --> 01:21:06,898
Wow, that looks pretty good.

1832
01:21:07,268 --> 01:21:11,738
(The French fries are turning golden brown.)

1833
01:21:12,438 --> 01:21:14,536
(He shakes off the oil as he takes it out.)

1834
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:16,808
- The potatoes.
- They're done? Let me see.

1835
01:21:17,278 --> 01:21:18,336
These are my favorite.

1836
01:21:18,337 --> 01:21:19,507
(It tastes best right now.)

1837
01:21:19,778 --> 01:21:22,406
(They blow on it before they take a bite.)

1838
01:21:22,407 --> 01:21:23,648
Gosh. It's so good!

1839
01:21:24,717 --> 01:21:26,278
- Hee Won. This is how it tastes.
- Yes?

1840
01:21:26,577 --> 01:21:28,217
- Is it good?
- It tastes amazing.

1841
01:21:28,547 --> 01:21:30,757
- You did a great job. It's good.
- It's really good.

1842
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:32,417
- Goodness.
- Right?

1843
01:21:32,418 --> 01:21:33,657
(Exclaiming)

1844
01:21:33,928 --> 01:21:35,728
- Goodness.
- You did a great job.

1845
01:21:36,688 --> 01:21:37,756
This is really good.

1846
01:21:37,757 --> 01:21:40,028
(The French fries are crunchy and salty.)

1847
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,568
(The youngest eats one too.)

1848
01:21:43,667 --> 01:21:45,666
- Is it cooked?
- Yes.

1849
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:46,738
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1850
01:21:48,568 --> 01:21:50,706
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1851
01:21:50,707 --> 01:21:51,808
- Is it?
- Yes!

1852
01:21:51,978 --> 01:21:53,278
- Is it really good?
- Yes!

1853
01:21:53,778 --> 01:21:55,507
Nice. That's it!

1854
01:21:57,077 --> 01:22:00,278
(He continues making the sweet potato fries.)

1855
01:22:00,818 --> 01:22:02,217
Gosh, the sweet potatoes look good too.

1856
01:22:03,217 --> 01:22:04,256
(He makes the thinly sliced sweet potatoes crunchy.)

1857
01:22:04,257 --> 01:22:05,717
Gosh, the sweet potatoes look great.

1858
01:22:07,657 --> 01:22:12,698
(They even fry up plenty of bellflower roots.)

1859
01:22:14,068 --> 01:22:16,397
Gosh, it's hot. It's really delicious.

1860
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:17,667
(You have to eat fritters as soon as they come out.)

1861
01:22:18,138 --> 01:22:20,267
This is really good. This is exactly what I like.

1862
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,808
(They continue to eat them.)

1863
01:22:22,138 --> 01:22:24,607
Gosh, our food gets better and better.

1864
01:22:24,608 --> 01:22:25,877
(Their cooking gets better as time passes.)

1865
01:22:26,077 --> 01:22:27,778
- He's a great cook.
- He really is.

1866
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:30,207
- Hee Won. I saw you in a new light.
- Yes?

1867
01:22:30,678 --> 01:22:31,818
I didn't do this.

1868
01:22:32,377 --> 01:22:33,647
You and I made it together.

1869
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:35,917
- Right.
- Myoung did everything.

1870
01:22:36,787 --> 01:22:38,657
Myoung can do it on his own,

1871
01:22:39,558 --> 01:22:41,887
but you didn't interfere which is why I give you 200 points.

1872
01:22:41,888 --> 01:22:43,527
(Embarrassed)

1873
01:22:43,528 --> 01:22:44,796
Since you didn't interfere.

1874
01:22:44,797 --> 01:22:47,058
Makes sense. I didn't really say much.

1875
01:22:50,327 --> 01:22:51,937
I admit to that.

1876
01:22:51,938 --> 01:22:53,037
It's really good.

1877
01:22:53,438 --> 01:22:55,537
(Should I start finishing up too?)

1878
01:22:55,738 --> 01:22:57,308
Do you guys want perilla seeds in the gamjatang or no?

1879
01:22:57,608 --> 01:22:58,677
- Please put it in.
- It needs to go in.

1880
01:22:58,678 --> 01:23:00,278
Put in a lot of perilla seeds.

1881
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:07,417
(The thick gamjatang with a lot of perilla seeds is done.)

1882
01:23:08,547 --> 01:23:11,457
(They refry all the fritters again, )

1883
01:23:11,858 --> 01:23:15,188
(so they're nice and crispy.)

1884
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:18,827
Goodness. He's so greedy... Oh, my.

1885
01:23:19,297 --> 01:23:22,496
The French fries do a double flip in the air.

1886
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:23,567
(They're complete after spinning around in the air.)

1887
01:23:23,568 --> 01:23:26,336
- It's done.
- That's done. Wow.

1888
01:23:26,337 --> 01:23:28,407
(The freshly fried potatoes, sweet potatoes, and bellflower roots, )

1889
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,067
Until the very end.

1890
01:23:30,068 --> 01:23:31,076
(UIe's slightly experimental potato jeon, )

1891
01:23:31,077 --> 01:23:33,737
It's a potato and sweet potato party.

1892
01:23:33,738 --> 01:23:34,948
(and the spicy gamjatang...)

1893
01:23:35,608 --> 01:23:36,677
Let's dig in.

1894
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,877
(complete their Gangwon Province potato meal.)

1895
01:23:39,505 --> 01:23:40,975
- Thank you for the food!
- This looks good.

1896
01:23:43,416 --> 01:23:44,815
(Dong Il's gamjatang with Gangwon potatoes and dried radish greens)

1897
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:46,145
You're a fantastic cook.

1898
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:48,585
(Steaming)

1899
01:23:49,656 --> 01:23:53,224
(The youngest tries the soup first.)

1900
01:23:53,225 --> 01:23:54,625
Gosh, the gamjatang... Wow.

1901
01:23:58,765 --> 01:24:00,095
Goodness.

1902
01:24:00,965 --> 01:24:02,635
The gamjatang is really good.

1903
01:24:06,465 --> 01:24:08,206
- Take it off.
- You're taking off your coat again?

1904
01:24:08,536 --> 01:24:10,235
Yes. I need to take off my jacket when I eat.

1905
01:24:10,236 --> 01:24:12,146
(She takes off her coat as it's getting in the way.)

1906
01:24:12,505 --> 01:24:13,674
This is really good.

1907
01:24:13,675 --> 01:24:17,345
(She even rolls up her sleeves.)

1908
01:24:18,116 --> 01:24:22,155
(She begins to dig in properly.)

1909
01:24:22,156 --> 01:24:23,755
(Her eyes open wide.)

1910
01:24:24,986 --> 01:24:27,526
The dried radish greens are really good.

1911
01:24:30,456 --> 01:24:33,425
(He mustn't miss out on the Gangwon potatoes either.)

1912
01:24:33,925 --> 01:24:35,066
It's really good.

1913
01:24:38,536 --> 01:24:40,236
- Dong Il.
- Yes?

1914
01:24:40,505 --> 01:24:41,706
Want to open a gamjatang restaurant?

1915
01:24:44,675 --> 01:24:47,044
I'm not kidding. You really should open one.

1916
01:24:47,045 --> 01:24:48,675
(He wants to open a business after tasting the dish.)

1917
01:24:49,045 --> 01:24:50,884
(Meanwhile, the youngest...)

1918
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:55,255
(Moving around)

1919
01:24:56,585 --> 01:24:59,986
(I want to eat the meat.)

1920
01:25:02,456 --> 01:25:03,495
Oh, my.

1921
01:25:03,496 --> 01:25:05,526
(He's wrestling with the backbone by himself.)

1922
01:25:06,366 --> 01:25:07,395
(Youngest. If you want to eat the meat in gamjatang...)

1923
01:25:07,396 --> 01:25:09,635
My gosh, this is driving me crazy. My stomach...

1924
01:25:09,736 --> 01:25:15,435
(He grabs it.)

1925
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:21,015
(You have to use your hands to eat the gamjatang meat.)

1926
01:25:21,276 --> 01:25:23,945
Isn't the meat nice and chewy? Did you not try it yet?

1927
01:25:23,946 --> 01:25:26,044
(Coy)

1928
01:25:26,045 --> 01:25:30,885
(The oldest already has his face in the bowl.)

1929
01:25:30,986 --> 01:25:32,025
My chopstick broke.

1930
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:36,896
(UIe is also digging in.)

1931
01:25:37,566 --> 01:25:39,025
(Me too.)

1932
01:25:39,026 --> 01:25:41,496
Bite into it. It's nice and chewy.

1933
01:25:42,935 --> 01:25:45,206
(They all bite into it together.)

1934
01:25:47,166 --> 01:25:48,575
(Wiping)

1935
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:50,406
(Satisfied)

1936
01:25:51,475 --> 01:25:54,005
Try the potato jeon that UIe made.

1937
01:25:55,616 --> 01:25:56,616
(Nervous)

1938
01:25:56,617 --> 01:25:58,986
(My potato jeon?)

1939
01:25:59,545 --> 01:26:03,986
(It looks a bit strange.)

1940
01:26:04,755 --> 01:26:06,925
(Eating)

1941
01:26:07,755 --> 01:26:09,124
(Is it okay?)

1942
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:11,066
(On eggshells)

1943
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:14,236
(Exclaiming)

1944
01:26:18,435 --> 01:26:20,406
(Exclaiming)

1945
01:26:23,975 --> 01:26:25,875
Do you see why I said I was a bad cook now?

1946
01:26:26,746 --> 01:26:27,844
- What?
- What?

1947
01:26:27,845 --> 01:26:29,675
Do you see why I don't cook?

1948
01:26:30,515 --> 01:26:31,584
It's good.

1949
01:26:31,585 --> 01:26:33,084
(No, the potato jeon is good.)

1950
01:26:33,085 --> 01:26:34,916
- It's really good.
- It is.

1951
01:26:35,486 --> 01:26:37,755
No, but the potato jeon...

1952
01:26:38,456 --> 01:26:40,485
tastes exactly like the French fries.

1953
01:26:40,486 --> 01:26:42,495
(Honestly, it tastes just like the French fries.)

1954
01:26:42,496 --> 01:26:44,124
- It even looks the same. Right?
- Yes.

1955
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:45,295
(It looks the same too. Right?)

1956
01:26:45,795 --> 01:26:48,635
I ate this, and then I ate that. But they both taste the same.

1957
01:26:48,935 --> 01:26:50,665
(Bursting into laughter)

1958
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:52,405
But it's really good.

1959
01:26:52,406 --> 01:26:54,206
It's good. It really is.

1960
01:26:55,305 --> 01:26:56,776
The fried bellflower root is good too.

1961
01:26:57,875 --> 01:26:59,106
Myoung made it.

1962
01:26:59,345 --> 01:27:01,014
Hee Won and I made it together.

1963
01:27:01,015 --> 01:27:03,776
This really deserves 500 points.

1964
01:27:04,486 --> 01:27:06,316
(1 French fry)

1965
01:27:06,646 --> 01:27:08,054
(2 French fries)

1966
01:27:08,055 --> 01:27:09,286
(3 French fries)

1967
01:27:09,656 --> 01:27:11,425
(The youngest isn't the only one digging in.)

1968
01:27:11,885 --> 01:27:13,025
- It's good.
- It is.

1969
01:27:13,026 --> 01:27:14,325
(I want the sweet potato fries.)

1970
01:27:14,326 --> 01:27:15,695
You guys did a great job with the fritters.

1971
01:27:15,696 --> 01:27:17,326
(The entire family has fallen in love with the fritters.)

1972
01:27:18,826 --> 01:27:21,396
I'm starting to get full since I kept eating.

1973
01:27:24,135 --> 01:27:26,835
Something that made me happy while traveling on this show...

1974
01:27:27,406 --> 01:27:29,934
is that Hee Won has become...

1975
01:27:29,935 --> 01:27:31,076
More open to food?

1976
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:33,945
Very much so. He's a lot more open to trying new food.

1977
01:27:33,946 --> 01:27:35,776
He never really ate that much either.

1978
01:27:36,215 --> 01:27:37,845
But he's eating a lot now.

1979
01:27:38,116 --> 01:27:39,185
- Dong Il.
- But...

1980
01:27:39,616 --> 01:27:41,615
I didn't change. You did.

1981
01:27:41,616 --> 01:27:45,325
(You're the one who changed.)

1982
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:46,356
Why?

1983
01:27:48,826 --> 01:27:50,496
You've become a better cook.

1984
01:27:52,526 --> 01:27:53,924
(Dong Il laughs out of embarrassment.)

1985
01:27:53,925 --> 01:27:55,036
I'm serious. How could...

1986
01:27:55,996 --> 01:27:57,965
I'm serious. How could my palate change?

1987
01:27:58,335 --> 01:28:00,975
- I see.
- It's true. Isn't it?

1988
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:02,874
You've become a better cook.

1989
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:04,475
(It's because you're good.)

1990
01:28:05,675 --> 01:28:07,606
Isn't it like how a married couple becomes more like one another?

1991
01:28:08,746 --> 01:28:12,084
(We might've just become more like one another.)

1992
01:28:12,085 --> 01:28:14,215
Not at all. I don't want to become like you.

1993
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:16,486
You just became a better cook.

1994
01:28:17,385 --> 01:28:19,786
- I'm not kidding.
- You said he was your role model.

1995
01:28:19,986 --> 01:28:22,254
(At a loss for words...)

1996
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:23,695
You said he was a compass for your life.

1997
01:28:23,696 --> 01:28:25,025
He is. He's my compass.

1998
01:28:25,026 --> 01:28:26,365
But it changes.

1999
01:28:26,366 --> 01:28:28,335
(Laughing)

2000
01:28:28,635 --> 01:28:32,504
(Bursting into laughter)

2001
01:28:32,505 --> 01:28:34,375
How can a person be the same all the time?

2002
01:28:35,276 --> 01:28:38,374
(They had yet another happy day.)

2003
01:28:38,375 --> 01:28:40,105
- It was a lot of fun.
- Goodness.

2004
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:43,515
I feel like if I see the show on TV, I'll get really excited.

2005
01:28:46,585 --> 01:28:49,015
(The dads of Ssangmun-dong in "Reply 1988" have come together!)

2006
01:28:49,255 --> 01:28:51,055
(Taek's dad and owner of Bonghwangdang, Choi Moo Sung)

2007
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:53,026
(Jung Hwan's dad, Kim Sung Kyun)

2008
01:28:53,885 --> 01:28:57,295
(Nice to see you.)

2009
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:02,335
(The owner of the House on Wheels kitchen for today is Sung Kyun.)

2010
01:29:02,896 --> 01:29:04,635
(Cook something delicious!)

2011
01:29:06,066 --> 01:29:09,606
(He prepared a special dish for everyone.)

2012
01:29:10,675 --> 01:29:12,505
(Just trust me, guys.)

2013
01:29:13,446 --> 01:29:16,015
(I'll help you.)

2014
01:29:16,776 --> 01:29:18,786
(Surprised)

2015
01:29:19,515 --> 01:29:22,184
(Moo Sung is very cowardly for his size.)

2016
01:29:22,185 --> 01:29:23,785
(Moo Sung, you're so cute.)

2017
01:29:23,786 --> 01:29:24,884
(What is Hee Won doing?)

2018
01:29:24,885 --> 01:29:26,084
(Following around)

2019
01:29:26,085 --> 01:29:27,184
(A cutie who follows the owners of the house)

2020
01:29:27,185 --> 01:29:28,725
(Cute)

2021
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:31,826
(Giggling)

2022
01:29:32,366 --> 01:29:33,366
(What are you good at making?)

2023
01:29:33,367 --> 01:29:35,595
(Fried rice?)

2024
01:29:36,435 --> 01:29:38,536
(He wants to show them how good his fried rice is.)

2025
01:29:39,066 --> 01:29:40,736
(If we have rice first, we'll be full.)

2026
01:29:41,076 --> 01:29:43,236
(Must we have fried rice?)

2027
01:29:44,805 --> 01:29:46,905
(I said we should've eaten it earlier.)

2028
01:29:46,906 --> 01:29:48,045
(Upset)

2029
01:29:49,515 --> 01:29:54,116
(Another main character of "Reply 1988" is here too.)
