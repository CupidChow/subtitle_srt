1
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:30,738
(A day in autumn...)

2
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:35,867
(where you can feel the warm sunlight in the morning)

3
00:00:36,508 --> 00:00:41,547
(House on Wheels is headed...)

4
00:00:42,278 --> 00:00:48,117
(to where Mount Songni of Baekdu Mountain Range is.)

5
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:53,358
(They're in North Chungcheong Province.)

6
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:56,057
- Don't you smell the grass?
- I do.

7
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:57,928
It's so good, isn't it? The smell of mountains.

8
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:01,267
- I can smell the grass...
- It's so strong, right?

9
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:04,197
- so strongly.
- It's lovely.

10
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,267
(The smell of mountains...)

11
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:10,337
(from the mountains around them fills the air in the car.)

12
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:15,107
(Enjoying the smell with the refreshing autumn breeze)

13
00:01:15,548 --> 00:01:17,747
The color of rice paddies is so beautiful.

14
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:20,548
- It's yellowish.
- It's a bit yellow.

15
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:21,717
Yes, it's gorgeous.

16
00:01:22,848 --> 00:01:27,288
(The autumn ripens,)

17
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:31,197
(and the rice paddies start turning yellow.)

18
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:32,227
The autumn of Korea is extraordinary.

19
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:36,098
(I'm going to take a picture of it too.)

20
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:40,208
(Past the vast rice paddies,)

21
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:45,477
(and up the mountain road with thick trees)

22
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:46,508
We're almost there.

23
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:50,518
This is it, right?

24
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,518
We're here.

25
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:55,818
(The members are at a parking lot?)

26
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:57,387
Get off. I'll show you...

27
00:01:57,387 --> 00:01:58,488
Oh, boy.

28
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:00,958
- Thank you for driving.
- I'll show you guys...

29
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,087
something amazing.

30
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:06,997
I'm going to surprise the youngest.

31
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,497
- What will it be?
- "What will it be?"

32
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:18,378
(Where did Dong Il bring the guys so early in the morning?)

33
00:02:19,477 --> 00:02:20,508
Is this...

34
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,707
This is Maltijae Observatory.

35
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,848
It's going to be awesome.

36
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,288
(The three are on top of the observatory.)

37
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:30,588
You can't wait to see it, can you?

38
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:34,588
(What is he trying to show us?)

39
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:38,357
- Sinners can't easily enter.
- Why not?

40
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:40,158
They're worried someone might push them.

41
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:41,267
(Hee Won looks down first.)

42
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:42,427
That's why I can't enter.

43
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,338
(Hee Won looks down first.)

44
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:46,737
Check this out.

45
00:02:48,107 --> 00:02:49,737
This is wonderful.

46
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:52,008
(The youngest takes a picture right away.)

47
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:53,237
These guys.

48
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,008
(Amazed)

49
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,547
This is wonderful.

50
00:02:56,647 --> 00:02:58,878
(How is the scenery below the observatory?)

51
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:03,288
(On Mount Songni, Boeun, North Chungcheong Province,)

52
00:03:03,288 --> 00:03:04,288
(there's Maltijae Pass.)

53
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:06,957
- This is so...
- It's amazing.

54
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:10,327
I think they built this observatory for that road.

55
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:17,568
(Climb up the crooked hill to find "Maltijae",)

56
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:20,167
(which means the place where kings rode horses.)

57
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,938
- Isn't it tremendous, Hee Won?
- Yes.

58
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:24,637
(which means the place where kings rode horses.)

59
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:28,977
(For over a thousand years,)

60
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:33,278
(this has been guarding the gate of Mount Songni.)

61
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:40,658
(Among the rough mountain roads,)

62
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:42,028
(this is 12-curve Maltijae Pass.)

63
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:43,227
Look at that.

64
00:03:43,227 --> 00:03:46,727
(this is 12-curve Maltijae Pass.)

65
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:49,098
(Dong Il is also seeing it in real life for the first time.)

66
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:50,897
It's pretty high here.

67
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,868
It's so high.

68
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:56,838
I've never been here before, and I had no idea it existed.

69
00:03:57,908 --> 00:03:59,707
- I think I saw it on a calendar.
- A calendar?

70
00:04:00,278 --> 00:04:02,147
- You know, the pictures.
- Right.

71
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:03,207
The calendar pictures.

72
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:08,487
(A view like a page of the calendar before their eyes)

73
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:11,917
- It's gorgeous.
- Right? I don't want to go down.

74
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:13,658
- Me neither. It's refreshing.
- Right.

75
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:15,457
- It's refreshing...
- The sunlight is...

76
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:18,028
- The warm sunlight...
- The youngest is talking!

77
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,667
Why do you want to talk so much?

78
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:21,827
- What was it?
- Pardon?

79
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:24,538
- You can speak.
- It's refreshing to watch.

80
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:25,767
The open view.

81
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,267
It's refreshing!

82
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,608
(Playing along with the youngest)

83
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:32,207
The open view.

84
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:36,647
(People, the youngest says that it's refreshing!)

85
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:41,947
Dong Il, I love our youngest with all my heart.

86
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:44,058
(See how much I love him?)

87
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:47,188
It'd be great to bring today's guest here...

88
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:48,957
and show them this.

89
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,957
(I know.)

90
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:56,327
(A wonderful view you want to share with your loved ones)

91
00:04:57,137 --> 00:04:59,197
We have to go down that road with our car.

92
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:02,207
That's all right. I'm not driving.

93
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:04,178
But you're still in it.

94
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,347
(You're also in the car.)

95
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:12,318
(Hee Won got in the car first.)

96
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:13,947
(Let's see.)

97
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,947
I'll put this on L2.

98
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,517
L2.

99
00:05:19,157 --> 00:05:20,858
I'll put this on L2, and...

100
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:23,697
(Glancing)

101
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:25,957
(What is he saying?)

102
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:27,327
(Glancing again)

103
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:29,068
This isn't auto.

104
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:30,938
Shift to second gear.

105
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:31,967
(Getting ready to drive down the hill)

106
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:32,998
There.

107
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:37,077
(Be careful, Hee Won.)

108
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,808
- Let's go.
- I have to drive at 20km per hour.

109
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,378
Right, because it's downhill.

110
00:05:42,707 --> 00:05:45,878
(Let's drive slowly, shall we?)

111
00:05:46,902 --> 00:05:48,272
(They leave the observatory.)

112
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:49,442
It's interesting, isn't it?

113
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:53,342
Now we're driving down the curved road.

114
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,512
(They start driving down Maltijae Pass.)

115
00:05:56,512 --> 00:05:57,512
There.

116
00:05:59,253 --> 00:06:01,152
Oh, my.

117
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,382
(Concentrating)

118
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:06,623
Oh, my.

119
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:11,462
Goodness. It makes me dizzy.

120
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:18,433
(The car and the house are almost perpendicular.)

121
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:22,103
(Careful)

122
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:23,743
Okay.

123
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:28,483
(A long and discreet turn)

124
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:33,512
(They safely pass the first curve.)

125
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:36,123
- He's the best, indeed.
- Indeed.

126
00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:38,923
Youngest, I never...

127
00:06:39,293 --> 00:06:41,822
want to drive this car.

128
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:44,832
The only thing that Hee Won is better at than me is driving this.

129
00:06:45,762 --> 00:06:48,663
We're all born with different talents.

130
00:06:50,803 --> 00:06:52,873
Even from down here...

131
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:54,442
(The view is...)

132
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:56,743
Don't say that the view is nice.

133
00:06:56,743 --> 00:06:58,373
Hee Won takes his eyes off the road, and we're doomed.

134
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:00,313
Just keep it to yourself.

135
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:02,142
(My bad.)

136
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:04,082
See? Hee Won stopped talking.

137
00:07:04,082 --> 00:07:06,753
(He's too focused to hear anything.)

138
00:07:07,582 --> 00:07:10,223
(The 12 curves of Maltijae Pass)

139
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:13,322
It's a bit like a race track.

140
00:07:13,322 --> 00:07:14,762
You're right.

141
00:07:14,762 --> 00:07:17,733
(The members of House on Wheels slowly go down.)

142
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:22,262
- Only a couple of curves ahead.
- A couple?

143
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:23,402
(After a few curves...)

144
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:25,532
I think we're almost there.

145
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:27,572
Already?

146
00:07:27,803 --> 00:07:29,442
"Already?"

147
00:07:29,673 --> 00:07:32,613
You should be the one to know. Why are you asking me?

148
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:33,712
(Sighing)

149
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:37,353
(He's finally smiling.)

150
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:41,123
(He feels much more at ease as he's down here.)

151
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:45,022
On our way there, I asked them to prepare...

152
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:46,853
- apples.
- Apples?

153
00:07:48,323 --> 00:07:51,233
And these aren't regular apples.

154
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:52,392
Then what are they?

155
00:07:52,662 --> 00:07:53,693
You'll be surprised.

156
00:07:53,693 --> 00:07:55,062
(They're not regular apples?)

157
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:57,873
We're going to pick them and give them...

158
00:07:58,432 --> 00:08:01,973
to today's guest as a holiday present.

159
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:04,443
I bet you've never seen them, Hee Won.

160
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:07,542
Tell me if you like them.

161
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:09,912
If you want to bring them home.

162
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,182
I'll ask how much they are.

163
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:14,623
We can buy some.

164
00:08:14,922 --> 00:08:16,253
You're just going to ask?

165
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:17,953
- What?
- You're just going to ask?

166
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:20,353
- Yes.
- And we pay for them?

167
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:21,823
I'll ask about the price.

168
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:24,792
(So that's how it is.)

169
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:26,363
I can't wait to eat apples.

170
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:27,632
(Now that we're talking about apples...)

171
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,503
- You're starting to get hungry.
- Yes.

172
00:08:29,503 --> 00:08:30,703
(The family is getting hungrier.)

173
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:32,003
(Hold on.)

174
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:34,603
Youngest, you always come empty-handed.

175
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:37,443
- Sorry?
- Hee Won is clearing his throat.

176
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:38,473
(Flustered)

177
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:40,882
Hee Won, aren't you disappointed in the youngest?

178
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:43,083
Well, I just...

179
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:46,453
As long as he comes.

180
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:49,583
(Laughing)

181
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,652
You're not being forced to come here, are you?

182
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:52,693
Of course not.

183
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:54,323
That's good enough.

184
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:57,693
I only wait for this day to come.

185
00:08:57,693 --> 00:08:58,833
(Confessing out of nowhere)

186
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,632
(Feeling shy after he said it)

187
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:03,662
(Dong Il is touched.)

188
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:06,902
(Our youngest is the best.)

189
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:08,772
(In the congenial atmosphere...)

190
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:11,373
- This is it, right?
- You'll be showered...

191
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:12,843
by vitamin C.

192
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:16,983
Do you see those apples? Check out the color.

193
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:19,282
- What?
- Those are apples?

194
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:20,353
They're apples.

195
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:21,723
(What?)

196
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:26,022
They're not red apples. They're lemon yellow.

197
00:09:26,953 --> 00:09:30,323
(On the way to the front yard, Dong Il has prepared...)

198
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:36,833
(yellow-colored apples that resemble lemons for the guests.)

199
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:41,172
- Hello.
- Hello.

200
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:43,802
Nice to meet you.

201
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:45,073
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

202
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:46,473
- Hello.
- This is...

203
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:48,483
Did you see this apple on the way here?

204
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:49,882
- Right.
- Yes.

205
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,713
These are called golden apples.

206
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:53,282
- Golden apples?
- That's right.

207
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:56,022
Apples usually turn red when they ripen.

208
00:09:56,022 --> 00:09:59,792
But these golden apples turn yellow when they ripen.

209
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:03,193
Dong Il, look at this. It's yellow.

210
00:10:03,193 --> 00:10:04,432
- You haven't seen it, right?
- No.

211
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:05,463
Golden apples.

212
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:08,833
When I first saw them, since they were yellow,

213
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,932
I thought they were lemon apples.

214
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:13,333
(Splitting in half)

215
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,473
Here. Try it.

216
00:10:17,613 --> 00:10:18,873
Hee Won, split this one.

217
00:10:18,873 --> 00:10:20,912
- Me?
- Give that to Myoung.

218
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:22,983
Here you are. Split it.

219
00:10:22,983 --> 00:10:24,012
(Flustered)

220
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:31,123
You want me to split it for you?

221
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:33,522
(Trembling)

222
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:35,463
Hey, she split it too.

223
00:10:35,463 --> 00:10:37,792
(He tries hard to split it,)

224
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,532
My goodness.

225
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:40,733
(but he gives up.)

226
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,333
You try it, Dong Il.

227
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,863
(Embarrassed)

228
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:45,172
- You should try it.
- Me?

229
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:46,833
You can do it.

230
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:48,802
- Try it.
- I don't think I can do this.

231
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:51,012
- Split it.
- If I fail to do this too...

232
00:10:51,012 --> 00:10:52,042
That's right.

233
00:10:53,213 --> 00:10:55,483
(Chuckling)

234
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:58,412
(Laughing)

235
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:00,083
- Go ahead.
- Is there a tip?

236
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,882
- Try it.
- Put pressure instantly.

237
00:11:01,882 --> 00:11:03,922
- Instantly. In 1, 2.
- Right.

238
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:05,223
(It's hard, right?)

239
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:07,463
- Instantly. In 1, 2.
- Right.

240
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:08,693
(He puts pressure again.)

241
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:10,422
- One, two.
- There you go.

242
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,032
(The youngest split it.)

243
00:11:16,032 --> 00:11:17,103
What a relief!

244
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:20,302
What a relief!

245
00:11:23,103 --> 00:11:24,772
You split it.

246
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:26,843
(You split it.)

247
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:28,713
You're going to have a hard time.

248
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:31,052
Why did you split it, Myoung?

249
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:32,953
- You can eat it now.
- Right, try it.

250
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,522
It's slightly yellow inside.

251
00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:37,022
That means it's ripe.

252
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:38,593
(Taking a bite of a golden apple)

253
00:11:41,392 --> 00:11:44,333
(The youngest tries it too.)

254
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,363
It's refreshing, right?

255
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:48,333
(The refreshing taste makes him hum.)

256
00:11:49,262 --> 00:11:50,703
It's so crunchy.

257
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:53,032
It's so good.

258
00:11:53,032 --> 00:11:55,103
(Sweet and sour)

259
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:59,272
(Hee Won takes a big bite too.)

260
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:00,312
He's eating well.

261
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:04,253
Gosh, this apple is amazing.

262
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:05,983
- Is it good?
- It is.

263
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:07,182
(He even got choked up because it's delicious.)

264
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:09,282
- He really likes it.
- This is so good.

265
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:12,853
It's not that common, right?

266
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:13,993
- Right.
- This type of apple.

267
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:15,823
Like Shine Muscat grapes,

268
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:18,392
it hasn't been long since we started growing it.

269
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,292
So it's not well known.

270
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:22,662
It's becoming familiar recently.

271
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:25,132
- It's addictive.
- Right.

272
00:12:25,432 --> 00:12:26,503
Right?

273
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:28,343
It's really delicious.

274
00:12:28,343 --> 00:12:31,272
(It's really delicious!)

275
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:33,613
What?

276
00:12:33,943 --> 00:12:35,743
- He's really enjoying it.
- I mean it.

277
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:37,282
He's really enjoying it.

278
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:38,812
Do you have more?

279
00:12:39,152 --> 00:12:40,312
- Apples?
- Yes.

280
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:41,453
- Hey!
- He's really enjoying it.

281
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:43,682
You have to buy them. Hold on.

282
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:46,353
Let me just eat half of it.

283
00:12:47,562 --> 00:12:50,193
(He eats it really well.)

284
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:52,162
You must really like it.

285
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:53,363
(He's eating one more.)

286
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:55,833
- This is good.
- I think it's a bit sour for him.

287
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:56,902
But it's delicious, so...

288
00:12:57,672 --> 00:13:00,632
Today's guest is going to love this.

289
00:13:00,632 --> 00:13:01,672
I know.

290
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:03,302
The color is so pretty.

291
00:13:03,302 --> 00:13:05,073
(They're carefully picking yellow, ripe apples.)

292
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:06,973
It's like my skin.

293
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:10,182
(Hee Won picks one too.)

294
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:13,512
Gosh, this one is very yellow.

295
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:18,323
(For whom are they putting so much effort?)

296
00:13:19,022 --> 00:13:20,892
I think...

297
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:24,993
we're trying really hard to entertain the guest today.

298
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:26,693
This would be enough.

299
00:13:26,693 --> 00:13:29,032
I'm sure she'll love these apples.

300
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:30,833
They're delivered directly from the farm.

301
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,902
- We deliver them directly.
- From the farm.

302
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:34,703
- Right.
- We deliver them directly indeed.

303
00:13:34,703 --> 00:13:36,943
Directly from the farm.

304
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:43,512
(With the mountains and the blue sky as a background,)

305
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:46,483
(they drive slowly for a while.)

306
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:48,483
There are many beautiful places.

307
00:13:48,483 --> 00:13:49,753
We're almost there, Dong Il.

308
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:52,922
- It looks like a rural village.
- Right.

309
00:13:52,922 --> 00:13:56,823
(Passing by a secluded rural village,)

310
00:13:57,223 --> 00:14:01,233
You guys will be astonished when you get there.

311
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:03,062
(the House on Wheels is going deep into the mountains.)

312
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:05,373
- There are so many trees...
- I know, right?

313
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:07,402
- along the road.
- Right.

314
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:08,843
Gosh, this is really...

315
00:14:10,302 --> 00:14:15,542
(When they pass through the forest,)

316
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:20,282
(a meadow appears.)

317
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,823
(Exclaiming)

318
00:14:26,453 --> 00:14:28,593
This is paradise.

319
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:30,093
(He's fixing his gaze on the view.)

320
00:14:30,823 --> 00:14:33,162
(Where is today's front yard...)

321
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:36,302
(that the three went on an autumn day?)

322
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:42,873
(In autumn, buckwheat flowers bloom like it snowed.)

323
00:14:42,873 --> 00:14:47,983
(In autumn, buckwheat flowers bloom like it snowed.)

324
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:54,522
(Beyond our house,)

325
00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:58,493
(the field spreads out endlessly.)

326
00:14:59,193 --> 00:15:01,993
(The buckwheat field is filled with buckwheat flowers...)

327
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:04,123
(swaying in the wind.)

328
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:09,532
(In the deep forest in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province,)

329
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:14,603
(this place is hidden like a treasure.)

330
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:20,042
(You can enjoy buckwheat flowers to the fullest...)

331
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:23,912
(in front of your house.)

332
00:15:24,652 --> 00:15:26,613
(You can see the field full of buckwheat flowers...)

333
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:28,623
(out of the window.)

334
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:35,662
(When the moon rises at night...)

335
00:15:36,823 --> 00:15:44,233
(The buckwheat flowers shine under the moonlight.)

336
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:48,672
(They're here in the season when buckwheat flowers bloom.)

337
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:53,873
(This is today's front yard.)

338
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:56,483
(It's Doennaegigol buckwheat field...)

339
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:58,583
(in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province.)

340
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:08,892
(I can't wait to see it!)

341
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:11,233
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

342
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:16,802
(Safely filmed with the permission from the landowner)

343
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:23,743
(They look around the front yard.)

344
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:24,943
This is unbelievable.

345
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,842
(They look around the front yard.)

346
00:16:27,842 --> 00:16:29,713
This is buckwheat.

347
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:32,512
This place is so nice, Dong Il.

348
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:33,913
(The buckwheat flowers are swaying in the wind...)

349
00:16:33,913 --> 00:16:35,483
(in front of the house.)

350
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:38,653
- This is really...
- This place is amazing.

351
00:16:38,653 --> 00:16:41,362
(He's gone speechless at the sight.)

352
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:43,322
So this is what it looks like.

353
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:45,963
- You've never seen them, right?
- No, never.

354
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,562
(Buckwheat flowers are in bloom like snow on the green leaves.)

355
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:49,633
So pretty.

356
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:52,772
I know.

357
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:54,842
- It looks like a foreign country.
- Exactly.

358
00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:56,102
- Don't you think so, Myoung?
- Right.

359
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,203
It feels like we're in a foreign country.

360
00:16:57,203 --> 00:16:58,572
(A poem comes to his mind.)

361
00:16:58,572 --> 00:17:00,542
Buy buckwheat jelly

362
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:02,782
- Glutinous rice cake - Is that a poem?

363
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:04,383
Is that a poem?

364
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:06,312
He has adapted quickly.

365
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:08,923
- Buy buckwheat jelly - So beautiful.

366
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:12,322
Let's set up the tarp before the guest arrives.

367
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,653
Okay. Let's do it quickly.

368
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:16,322
- I'll hang it from here.
- Okay.

369
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:20,592
(The youngest is in charge of hanging the tarp on the hooks.)

370
00:17:22,362 --> 00:17:23,362
I got it.

371
00:17:23,362 --> 00:17:26,332
It's easier to drive them into the hard ground.

372
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:28,443
It's done, right?

373
00:17:29,243 --> 00:17:30,302
Good job.

374
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:35,413
(I'll take some rest now.)

375
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:40,312
(Dong Il goes into the house.)

376
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:45,592
(He goes right into the kitchen?)

377
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:49,493
(He even wears an apron.)

378
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:53,362
I heard the guest likes janchi guksu so much.

379
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:55,433
(I heard the guest likes janchi guksu so much.)

380
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:59,102
So I need to make the broth and toppings.

381
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:02,042
Okay. Where are anchovies?

382
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:03,203
(Dong Il urgently looks for anchovies.)

383
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:04,473
- There it is.
- With this...

384
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:07,072
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

385
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:10,012
Remove the guts.

386
00:18:10,743 --> 00:18:12,153
Only the guts. Hurry.

387
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:14,413
- Guts?
- Right. Sit and remove the guts.

388
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:16,453
Put the gloves away and remove the guts.

389
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:21,122
(He has undertaken an important task unexpectedly.)

390
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:25,792
(Let me see.)

391
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:31,032
(Are these guts?)

392
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:35,203
(Uncertain)

393
00:18:36,102 --> 00:18:38,213
The guts... You should remove the guts quickly.

394
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:39,743
- Sorry?
- Remove the guts quickly.

395
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,973
(I need to make the broth.)

396
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:45,413
(The youngest joins him.)

397
00:18:46,183 --> 00:18:48,223
- Open it here.
- Yes.

398
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:49,883
I don't know where the guts are.

399
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:51,753
- There's this black thing inside.
- That's right.

400
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:56,963
It's going to take some time.

401
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:02,633
Anchovies' guts are right next to their heads.

402
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:05,372
(Anchovies' guts are right next to their heads.)

403
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:09,173
- Right? Next to the heads.
- That's right.

404
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:11,473
(That's right.)

405
00:19:12,143 --> 00:19:15,743
They will stink for all their lives.

406
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:18,812
(Chuckling)

407
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:22,723
(They are removing anchovies' guts harmoniously.)

408
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:26,552
(In the kitchen, Dong Il is...)

409
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:31,393
(preparing to make the broth for janchi guksu.)

410
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:35,433
(Put in large chunks of shiitake mushrooms.)

411
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:41,903
(Chili peppers for a spicy taste)

412
00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:46,443
It won't be too spicy since we're making a lot.

413
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:47,473
(I put in chili peppers, but it won't be too spicy.)

414
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:49,883
- Do I put the anchovies in here?
- No.

415
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:52,352
- Where's the frying pan?
- Here it is.

416
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:54,312
(He doesn't put anchovies in the broth right away.)

417
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,683
(He pours them on the frying pan.)

418
00:19:58,653 --> 00:20:02,163
(He toasts the anchovies in a pan to get rid of the fishy smell.)

419
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:05,792
(He puts a great deal of effort into anchovies today.)

420
00:20:06,262 --> 00:20:09,903
(Dong Il hasn't left the kitchen since he arrived.)

421
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:12,133
(He must be tired.)

422
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:19,643
Well, I brought this for you today.

423
00:20:19,743 --> 00:20:22,582
(What did the youngest bring from home?)

424
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:24,812
(What is it?)

425
00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:27,312
- Let me see.
- My gosh.

426
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:28,723
(Sweet snacks, hangwa, and yugwa)

427
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:30,622
I love yakgwa.

428
00:20:31,322 --> 00:20:33,693
I remembered it and brought these for you.

429
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:36,822
It's Myoung's first trip with me,

430
00:20:36,822 --> 00:20:38,862
and he already knows...

431
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,993
that I like yakgwa. But you are...

432
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:42,403
Goodness.

433
00:20:43,062 --> 00:20:45,503
Didn't you complain that he came here empty-handed earlier?

434
00:20:46,272 --> 00:20:48,173
(Did I? I did.)

435
00:20:48,173 --> 00:20:51,342
And this is for you.

436
00:20:51,342 --> 00:20:52,413
Me?

437
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:54,913
Dong Il, he brought Vienna sausages for me as well.

438
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,282
(Why did you say that to such a nice kid?)

439
00:20:58,413 --> 00:20:59,683
What did he say earlier?

440
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:03,282
You kept complaining to him that he hadn't brought anything.

441
00:21:03,282 --> 00:21:04,322
I know.

442
00:21:04,753 --> 00:21:05,993
I didn't complain at all, right?

443
00:21:05,993 --> 00:21:07,052
(Teasing)

444
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:10,463
It's because he's imprudent and I'm not.

445
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:13,993
You're making me uncomfortable, Myoung.

446
00:21:13,993 --> 00:21:16,703
No, I wanted to tell you earlier,

447
00:21:16,703 --> 00:21:19,872
- but I...
- Then you should've told me.

448
00:21:20,302 --> 00:21:22,602
"I didn't come empty-handed."

449
00:21:22,943 --> 00:21:25,473
"I heard you like yakgwa, so..."

450
00:21:25,473 --> 00:21:27,042
(Just eat this.)

451
00:21:27,443 --> 00:21:30,243
- I wanted to surprise you at home.
- All right.

452
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:32,512
You're so cute.

453
00:21:33,453 --> 00:21:35,183
(Touched)

454
00:21:35,282 --> 00:21:36,852
- Is it delicious?
- It is.

455
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:37,852
- Is it good?
- It's good.

456
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:38,993
Is it good?

457
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,122
(The second eldest tastes the youngest's love.)

458
00:21:40,653 --> 00:21:42,862
(Proud)

459
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:44,663
I went grocery shopping with my mom yesterday.

460
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:45,762
- Really?
- Yes.

461
00:21:46,092 --> 00:21:49,102
I'm sorry for making your mother worry about it.

462
00:21:50,302 --> 00:21:51,532
So you tattled on him to your mom.

463
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,403
That he had scolded you for coming empty-handed.

464
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:58,713
(I'm sorry, ma'am.)

465
00:21:59,512 --> 00:22:02,383
(Put the toasted anchovies in a bag to put it in the broth.)

466
00:22:03,243 --> 00:22:05,153
You need to pour water into it and bring it to a boil, right?

467
00:22:05,983 --> 00:22:07,713
(Pouring)

468
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:11,183
(He makes a lot of broth so that it'd be enough for everyone.)

469
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:14,352
- Boil it over medium heat.
- Medium heat?

470
00:22:14,423 --> 00:22:17,262
(Safely filmed with the permission from the landowner)

471
00:22:17,693 --> 00:22:21,733
(Hee Won keeps trying to go into the ground.)

472
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:23,733
What's this?

473
00:22:24,663 --> 00:22:26,003
Where's the power switch?

474
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:27,503
(He's always unfamiliar with household chores.)

475
00:22:29,243 --> 00:22:30,302
What's wrong?

476
00:22:31,302 --> 00:22:33,372
Gosh, he's really...

477
00:22:34,673 --> 00:22:36,713
What do you think about Hee Won? Be honest.

478
00:22:37,243 --> 00:22:38,812
My goodness.

479
00:22:39,282 --> 00:22:40,383
(Glancing)

480
00:22:41,253 --> 00:22:42,883
- Say that to his face.
- What?

481
00:22:44,582 --> 00:22:46,092
It's your opinion.

482
00:22:46,723 --> 00:22:49,622
I'm not sure it's medium heat or high heat.

483
00:22:50,223 --> 00:22:53,332
(While the broth is boiling outside...)

484
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:56,963
(Stir-fry each topping to put on the noodles.)

485
00:22:57,903 --> 00:23:01,503
(Stir-fry the toppings with different colors separately.)

486
00:23:02,473 --> 00:23:03,503
What are they?

487
00:23:04,602 --> 00:23:05,673
- They're toppings.
- Toppings.

488
00:23:05,673 --> 00:23:06,872
(The youngest is amazing.)

489
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:09,243
What's that?

490
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:10,683
Gong Myoung!

491
00:23:11,143 --> 00:23:13,782
Look what he's like. What do you think?

492
00:23:14,012 --> 00:23:15,223
Show what you did earlier.

493
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:16,723
What did you do?

494
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:20,822
- What's up with you?
- That's incredible!

495
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:23,622
(The youngest sure has the art of living.)

496
00:23:24,193 --> 00:23:27,663
(Their hearts melt when the youngest acts cute.)

497
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,703
(Smiling)

498
00:23:30,062 --> 00:23:32,872
(With the perfect egg garnish...)

499
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:35,703
(and a little bit of showmanship)

500
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:37,673
(Awesome!)

501
00:23:37,673 --> 00:23:38,673
Look at this.

502
00:23:38,943 --> 00:23:40,143
This is how you do it.

503
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:42,012
Do you want to flip it?

504
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:44,042
You'll have to do it all over again.

505
00:23:45,183 --> 00:23:47,383
Myoung, you try it.

506
00:23:47,383 --> 00:23:48,383
- Flip it.
- No.

507
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:50,953
You'll have to do it all over again too.

508
00:23:50,953 --> 00:23:53,653
Go ahead and try it. You have to do it from now on.

509
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:55,522
How do I do this?

510
00:23:58,832 --> 00:23:59,862
(A forced landing)

511
00:23:59,862 --> 00:24:01,602
(Gasping)

512
00:24:01,602 --> 00:24:03,302
- Did he flip it?
- He flipped it.

513
00:24:03,302 --> 00:24:04,433
(The egg garnish is flipped too many times.)

514
00:24:04,602 --> 00:24:05,802
You did a good job.

515
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:07,973
You're much better than Hee Won who hasn't even tried.

516
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:11,473
You guys are doing great together.

517
00:24:12,943 --> 00:24:15,183
You have such great teamwork.

518
00:24:16,282 --> 00:24:18,213
(The eldest and the youngest have great teamwork.)

519
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:22,552
- We have great teamwork.
- You have such great teamwork.

520
00:24:23,453 --> 00:24:26,223
(The eldest fries the egg garnish.)

521
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:30,262
(The youngest slices it evenly.)

522
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:33,762
We're going to put in all of these, and it'll be done.

523
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:37,663
(Cut the soaked Korean thistle into small pieces.)

524
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:40,933
(Put them on the rice.)

525
00:24:41,403 --> 00:24:42,772
- Start cooking.
- Make sure you press the button.

526
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,403
(Start cooking the savory Korean thistle rice.)

527
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:46,213
Gosh, we didn't even take a break.

528
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:49,883
I think you're putting in much more effort than usual.

529
00:24:50,413 --> 00:24:52,082
- I should.
- Right.

530
00:24:53,253 --> 00:24:54,713
Dong Il, the broth is simmering.

531
00:24:54,713 --> 00:24:56,352
(The broth for janchi guksu is simmering.)

532
00:24:56,923 --> 00:24:58,022
(How does the broth taste?)

533
00:24:58,022 --> 00:24:59,052
Try it.

534
00:24:59,653 --> 00:25:01,693
I added Cheongyang chili to make it spicy.

535
00:25:05,393 --> 00:25:07,792
(He's having difficulty in breathing.)

536
00:25:11,062 --> 00:25:12,233
Is it that spicy?

537
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:15,443
(He shows how it tastes by coughing.)

538
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:18,872
What does that mean? Is it delicious or not?

539
00:25:20,012 --> 00:25:21,443
It's too spicy.

540
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:24,512
But it's really delicious.

541
00:25:25,312 --> 00:25:26,782
(Coughing)

542
00:25:27,183 --> 00:25:29,723
I was worried it might be too spicy for the guest.

543
00:25:31,082 --> 00:25:34,723
(Will today's guest like the spicy broth?)

544
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:37,663
(The youngest takes something out of the fridge.)

545
00:25:38,562 --> 00:25:42,403
(What is this in a glass jar?)

546
00:25:43,862 --> 00:25:46,272
- I brought brewed coffee.
- What?

547
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:47,473
I brought brewed coffee.

548
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:48,703
Did you brew coffee?

549
00:25:49,342 --> 00:25:52,213
Yes, we always brew coffee at home.

550
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:53,272
That's great.

551
00:25:53,413 --> 00:25:55,012
You're using your tact.

552
00:25:57,612 --> 00:26:00,012
(With the youngest's cute tact,)

553
00:26:00,483 --> 00:26:03,022
(coffee is ready in only 3 seconds.)

554
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:05,352
Okay, let's eat some yakgwa.

555
00:26:05,352 --> 00:26:06,352
(With the snack that the youngest prepared for them)

556
00:26:06,493 --> 00:26:10,693
(Crunching)

557
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:14,693
(Dong Il finally takes a breather.)

558
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:18,772
(We've worked so hard.)

559
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:21,203
I love yakgwa.

560
00:26:22,403 --> 00:26:24,872
This is for the guest. Let's set this aside.

561
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:27,072
I'm different from Hee Won.

562
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:29,812
He ate all the jelly by himself because it was delicious.

563
00:26:30,342 --> 00:26:32,713
Look, he doesn't eat yakgwa since he doesn't like it.

564
00:26:33,153 --> 00:26:34,612
I've already had two.

565
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:37,282
(He got me again.)

566
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:39,092
What do you mean I don't like it?

567
00:26:39,092 --> 00:26:40,653
(They enjoy sweet snacks that perfectly suit their taste,)

568
00:26:41,723 --> 00:26:44,923
(surrounded by the buckwheat field.)

569
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:50,003
(The scent of buckwheat flowers is wafted along by the autumn breeze.)

570
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:53,703
Gosh, it's so beautiful.

571
00:26:53,703 --> 00:26:54,772
Look at the clouds.

572
00:26:56,173 --> 00:26:57,403
It's amazing.

573
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:01,983
- The clouds look like waves.
- Right.

574
00:27:01,983 --> 00:27:03,342
The foaming waves.

575
00:27:03,342 --> 00:27:04,443
(Like the clouds that move like the waves...)

576
00:27:04,443 --> 00:27:07,983
All those mountains have different colors too.

577
00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:11,022
Some of them are covered with clouds and some of them are not.

578
00:27:11,022 --> 00:27:13,022
- That's right.
- They're so beautiful.

579
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:15,022
(Even the weather is ideal in the front yard.)

580
00:27:16,122 --> 00:27:17,663
(Our front yard is the best.)

581
00:27:18,193 --> 00:27:19,193
(Clapping)

582
00:27:19,193 --> 00:27:21,092
- It's fantastic!
- It's fantastic!

583
00:27:22,903 --> 00:27:24,633
Let's make a call.

584
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:30,342
This song is...

585
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:32,643
Today's guest is...

586
00:27:32,643 --> 00:27:33,943
(Expectant)

587
00:27:34,372 --> 00:27:36,713
- Hello?
- Mother, it's me.

588
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:38,042
Right.

589
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:41,352
Thank you for coming in this heat. How long will it take?

590
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:43,223
- I'm almost there.
- I see.

591
00:27:43,223 --> 00:27:45,253
- I'll be there soon.
- Okay.

592
00:27:45,993 --> 00:27:47,822
(Did you eat dinner?)

593
00:27:48,092 --> 00:27:50,663
(She would fix a meal for her grandchildren right away.)

594
00:27:51,092 --> 00:27:53,862
(She's the kind national grandmother.)

595
00:27:54,262 --> 00:27:55,633
(I like your smell, Grandma.)

596
00:27:55,862 --> 00:27:57,562
(You smell so good, Grandma.)

597
00:27:57,963 --> 00:27:59,733
(The great actress with 65 years of experience...)

598
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:01,433
(who's known for being warm and kind, Kim Young Ok)

599
00:28:02,143 --> 00:28:07,143
(In "Squid Game", which is popular these days,)

600
00:28:08,243 --> 00:28:12,953
(she had a son who always got into trouble.)

601
00:28:14,282 --> 00:28:16,723
(Who will be her son today?)

602
00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:20,423
(The hot-tempered eldest of the house)

603
00:28:21,753 --> 00:28:24,362
(Today's guest will make Dong Il mild.)

604
00:28:24,592 --> 00:28:26,362
(Dong Il's mother, Kim Young Ok)

605
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:29,762
(Mother, welcome!)

606
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:32,272
You invited me to come here,

607
00:28:32,272 --> 00:28:33,903
and it's nice to be here.

608
00:28:33,903 --> 00:28:35,542
When you come here...

609
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:38,943
Did you bring any gifts or did you come empty-handed?

610
00:28:38,943 --> 00:28:40,812
If you need help, we'll go pick you up.

611
00:28:40,812 --> 00:28:42,782
There's nothing much.

612
00:28:42,782 --> 00:28:45,453
- There's no need.
- I see.

613
00:28:45,552 --> 00:28:47,753
All right, Mother. We'll be waiting here.

614
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:49,122
- Okay.
- Yes.

615
00:28:49,822 --> 00:28:51,022
Does she drink coffee?

616
00:28:51,753 --> 00:28:52,852
No.

617
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:55,893
I brought delicious honey...

618
00:28:56,362 --> 00:28:58,262
from a bee farm for her.

619
00:28:58,262 --> 00:29:00,862
Why don't we make cold honey tea...

620
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:02,733
with it?

621
00:29:03,203 --> 00:29:06,133
Who's going to prepare some apples for her?

622
00:29:06,802 --> 00:29:08,943
- I'll prepare some apples.
- You?

623
00:29:08,943 --> 00:29:09,943
I will.

624
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:11,842
Sure, Hee Won is good with knives.

625
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:14,272
(Wielding)

626
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:15,913
(Wiggling his hands)

627
00:29:16,512 --> 00:29:19,153
- Are you warming up?
- I need to warm up to peel apples.

628
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:23,122
(They wait for the guest while warming up.)

629
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:25,852
It must be that one over there.

630
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:30,322
(Today's guest walks through the buckwheat field.)

631
00:29:30,322 --> 00:29:31,522
It's so lovely.

632
00:29:32,963 --> 00:29:33,963
(Impressed)

633
00:29:35,532 --> 00:29:37,633
I love this autumn sunshine.

634
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:40,473
It is nice to be out.

635
00:29:40,473 --> 00:29:41,602
(Today's guest is Kim Young Ok.)

636
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:45,673
(She has made a long trip to meet her sons.)

637
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:47,512
- I think I heard a car noise.
- Is she here now?

638
00:29:47,973 --> 00:29:49,042
Is she here?

639
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:50,342
(Getting up together)

640
00:29:50,713 --> 00:29:52,582
- I think she's walking over here.
- Where?

641
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:55,753
You mean over there? I see her.

642
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:56,753
- Right?
- I see her.

643
00:29:57,852 --> 00:29:59,393
She is bringing a lot with her.

644
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:01,993
Hello, Mother!

645
00:30:03,963 --> 00:30:06,963
- No need to come down here.
- You've come such a long way.

646
00:30:06,963 --> 00:30:08,862
- You should've waited until I come.
- Mother.

647
00:30:09,302 --> 00:30:10,933
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello.

648
00:30:11,362 --> 00:30:13,203
- Thank you for coming here.
- Sure.

649
00:30:13,503 --> 00:30:15,743
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

650
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,973
- Let's go.
- It's not heavy at all.

651
00:30:19,012 --> 00:30:20,943
It's great here.

652
00:30:20,943 --> 00:30:22,243
Isn't it really pretty?

653
00:30:22,243 --> 00:30:24,683
I've been wanting to invite you...

654
00:30:24,683 --> 00:30:26,413
- on the show so much.
- You didn't have to.

655
00:30:26,512 --> 00:30:29,483
(Their mother has come to House on Wheels.)

656
00:30:29,983 --> 00:30:32,253
- I'm so hungry right now.
- Please take a seat.

657
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:33,592
Really?

658
00:30:34,122 --> 00:30:36,122
I heard you like janchi guksu.

659
00:30:36,122 --> 00:30:38,693
I do like janchi guksu.

660
00:30:38,893 --> 00:30:40,262
But I said so because...

661
00:30:40,262 --> 00:30:43,003
it's easy to cook. I tried to be considerate.

662
00:30:43,003 --> 00:30:45,203
Otherwise, I would've said I like carp and chicken soup.

663
00:30:45,503 --> 00:30:47,832
Just tell me what you want.

664
00:30:47,832 --> 00:30:49,042
- I'll make it happen.
- If I were...

665
00:30:49,572 --> 00:30:52,243
to give you trouble...

666
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:53,812
Well, I haven't even tried that.

667
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:55,643
We can even make carp sashimi.

668
00:30:56,542 --> 00:30:58,413
I'm so hungry. I'm starving.

669
00:30:58,413 --> 00:30:59,812
- Shall I start right away?
- Let me eat something.

670
00:30:59,812 --> 00:31:01,612
- What's this? I should have it.
- That's coffee.

671
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:03,383
That's Myoung's coffee.

672
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:05,183
- That's fine.
- Would you like something cool?

673
00:31:05,183 --> 00:31:07,453
- Anything is fine.
- Would you like that?

674
00:31:07,453 --> 00:31:10,393
- Myoung.
- Make it super light.

675
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:12,792
Don't make it super light. Make it normal.

676
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:14,062
Normal?

677
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:17,802
He told us that you don't drink coffee.

678
00:31:17,802 --> 00:31:19,433
- Since when did I not drink it?
- I'm afraid it's unhealthy.

679
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:21,872
But I have to drink this at least. I'm dying.

680
00:31:22,372 --> 00:31:24,342
Please wait. I'll make something quick.

681
00:31:24,903 --> 00:31:27,572
You should make her happy. Dance if you have to.

682
00:31:27,913 --> 00:31:30,082
Have some fun time, okay?

683
00:31:30,082 --> 00:31:32,453
He called me two days ago,

684
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:34,052
after hearing that you are coming.

685
00:31:34,052 --> 00:31:35,052
He said, "Dong Il,"

686
00:31:35,052 --> 00:31:38,423
"I heard Ms. Kim is coming. You know I'm not too talkative."

687
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:39,852
"I'm worried already."

688
00:31:39,852 --> 00:31:41,552
He said, "Please take good care of me."

689
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:44,262
There is nothing you should worry about.

690
00:31:44,262 --> 00:31:46,332
I'm not a ghost. You can talk to me.

691
00:31:46,762 --> 00:31:47,993
No, I can't.

692
00:31:48,703 --> 00:31:49,802
Entertain her.

693
00:31:49,802 --> 00:31:50,802
(Dong Il goes to inside the house to cook.)

694
00:31:51,163 --> 00:31:53,332
(Myoung also goes inside to help him with cooking.)

695
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:56,372
(Nice and warm)

696
00:31:56,943 --> 00:31:58,772
(What should I talk about?)

697
00:31:58,772 --> 00:32:02,383
I can talk with just about anybody.

698
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:06,153
So you can just answer any question I ask you.

699
00:32:06,153 --> 00:32:08,082
You weren't here for too long, were you?

700
00:32:08,453 --> 00:32:11,052
- You travel around, right?
- Right.

701
00:32:11,153 --> 00:32:13,193
You haven't worked with me...

702
00:32:13,592 --> 00:32:15,463
- on a drama, have you?
- No.

703
00:32:15,463 --> 00:32:17,993
But I've seen you a lot.

704
00:32:17,993 --> 00:32:19,193
I've watched you carefully.

705
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:21,993
- I know you are good too.
- You're too kind.

706
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:23,703
(What an adorable guy.)

707
00:32:23,703 --> 00:32:24,733
I knew about you.

708
00:32:25,302 --> 00:32:29,703
I've been seeing you on TV, since I was ten years old.

709
00:32:29,703 --> 00:32:31,473
You probably did.

710
00:32:31,473 --> 00:32:33,913
- Excuse me, but how old are you?
- I'm 52 years old.

711
00:32:34,342 --> 00:32:35,582
- You're 50 years old?
- I'm 52 years old.

712
00:32:35,582 --> 00:32:38,183
My youngest son is 54 years old.

713
00:32:38,282 --> 00:32:39,352
(I see.)

714
00:32:39,352 --> 00:32:41,683
So you are about his age.

715
00:32:41,683 --> 00:32:44,753
When you were ten years old...

716
00:32:44,753 --> 00:32:46,423
Did you watch any animated movies?

717
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:48,393
I've heard you do voiceovers.

718
00:32:48,393 --> 00:32:50,592
- I see.
- Yes, I have.

719
00:32:50,592 --> 00:32:53,832
I love people who say that they remember...

720
00:32:53,832 --> 00:32:56,933
- my voice in the animations I did.
- I'm sure.

721
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,233
They remember me from animations like "Robot Taekwon V".

722
00:32:59,832 --> 00:33:01,903
I watched it without knowing...

723
00:33:01,903 --> 00:33:03,403
- that it was you.
- I'm sure you didn't.

724
00:33:03,403 --> 00:33:05,743
But when I heard about it later, I was really shocked.

725
00:33:06,012 --> 00:33:07,772
- When I heard it was you, I said, - I bet.

726
00:33:07,772 --> 00:33:09,512
"Wow, really?"

727
00:33:09,743 --> 00:33:12,782
("Robot Taekwon V" from 1976)

728
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,312
(Young Ok's dubbing)

729
00:33:17,782 --> 00:33:19,222
Dad!

730
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:20,823
I was even more surprised...

731
00:33:20,823 --> 00:33:23,122
because the voice sounded so youthful...

732
00:33:23,122 --> 00:33:26,633
like that of a cheerful kid.

733
00:33:27,432 --> 00:33:30,003
But I heard you were even older than my mom.

734
00:33:30,003 --> 00:33:32,303
- That's right.
- That's why.

735
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:35,033
Since you're younger than my sons, your mom would be younger than me.

736
00:33:36,173 --> 00:33:38,272
What are they cooking right now?

737
00:33:38,812 --> 00:33:42,013
(What are they taking out of the fridge for the guest?)

738
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:45,013
(It's fresh abalone!)

739
00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:47,653
- Do you like abalone?
- Yes, I do.

740
00:33:49,423 --> 00:33:54,492
(Making cut marks on each abalone)

741
00:33:55,823 --> 00:33:59,363
(Making it all pretty)

742
00:33:59,992 --> 00:34:02,763
(Dong Il puts great care in his cooking.)

743
00:34:02,963 --> 00:34:05,062
Don't make anything fancy!

744
00:34:05,673 --> 00:34:07,673
Just give me anything.

745
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:09,472
I have to do this.

746
00:34:09,903 --> 00:34:13,173
Why else would you suffer so much to come here?

747
00:34:13,372 --> 00:34:16,013
Are you trying to feed me gold right now?

748
00:34:16,582 --> 00:34:18,812
Have you had abalone at the top of a mountain?

749
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:21,852
Wait, why are you putting abalone in guksu?

750
00:34:22,222 --> 00:34:24,622
I'm afraid he'll cook me something strange now.

751
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:25,923
Please wait.

752
00:34:26,553 --> 00:34:28,693
We will do our best.

753
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:30,963
You don't need to do your best. Just give it to me already.

754
00:34:30,963 --> 00:34:33,193
I'm almost done. I'm cooking the noodles now.

755
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:34,763
I'm cooking the noodles now.

756
00:34:36,763 --> 00:34:39,533
Staying outdoors must be making her irritable.

757
00:34:41,272 --> 00:34:43,843
(They speed up for Young Ok who is very hungry.)

758
00:34:44,242 --> 00:34:47,642
(Placing the abalone on top of the pan with butter)

759
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:52,783
(Gulping)

760
00:34:54,053 --> 00:34:55,113
It looks good, right?

761
00:34:55,113 --> 00:34:56,483
(Impressed)

762
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,522
Oh, my goodness. I'm so hungry.

763
00:35:01,423 --> 00:35:03,423
Would you like some yakgwa?

764
00:35:03,423 --> 00:35:05,763
I was going to eat one that was right here,

765
00:35:05,763 --> 00:35:08,133
but someone took it away.

766
00:35:08,533 --> 00:35:11,733
(He is trying to give the yakgwa they were eating earlier.)

767
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:14,432
Don't give her that and make her lose appetite.

768
00:35:14,673 --> 00:35:17,202
- She said she's too hungry.
- Just wait a bit longer.

769
00:35:17,803 --> 00:35:19,513
Give her half of the yakgwa.

770
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:22,613
I wasn't going to eat the whole thing anyway.

771
00:35:23,182 --> 00:35:25,142
Don't be so stingy and tell me to eat only half of it.

772
00:35:25,142 --> 00:35:26,912
(They banter like a real mom and son.)

773
00:35:27,983 --> 00:35:29,983
(Struggling)

774
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:32,082
- So...
- Let me help you.

775
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:36,492
Dong Il and I got to work...

776
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:38,722
together on a drama.

777
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:41,633
We kept on seeing each other...

778
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:43,533
for brief moments from time to time.

779
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:47,102
I saw that he is on this show, so I watched it a few times.

780
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:51,303
As I watched them, I thought it must be nice to travel like that.

781
00:35:52,343 --> 00:35:54,673
So when I heard they'd like me on the show,

782
00:35:54,673 --> 00:35:58,042
I was so happy and couldn't refuse the offer.

783
00:35:58,383 --> 00:35:59,653
But they are keeping me so hungry.

784
00:36:00,082 --> 00:36:01,582
(Coughing)

785
00:36:02,213 --> 00:36:04,122
(Peeking)

786
00:36:04,483 --> 00:36:07,022
Can't you see that she's coughing?

787
00:36:07,492 --> 00:36:08,622
(In a hurry)

788
00:36:08,622 --> 00:36:10,662
- What did he say?
- He heard you coughing.

789
00:36:11,162 --> 00:36:13,992
- No. It's fine.
- Whatever you do,

790
00:36:13,992 --> 00:36:15,332
he will yell at me about it.

791
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:17,702
Please try not to do anything.

792
00:36:17,702 --> 00:36:19,673
- There's nothing you can do.
- I know, right?

793
00:36:19,673 --> 00:36:21,733
Once he sees you doing something,

794
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:24,142
he'll blame me for everything.

795
00:36:24,272 --> 00:36:25,472
How dare he...

796
00:36:26,713 --> 00:36:28,242
be mean to younger people!

797
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:30,343
(Did he hear that?)

798
00:36:30,883 --> 00:36:32,713
I might as well be mean to him in return.

799
00:36:33,613 --> 00:36:34,753
You can do that.

800
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:37,323
(Reliable)

801
00:36:38,022 --> 00:36:40,492
(I can't wait any longer.)

802
00:36:40,593 --> 00:36:43,263
This is so strange. They must be making something strange.

803
00:36:43,722 --> 00:36:45,263
- No, they're not.
- All it takes is to boil noodles...

804
00:36:45,263 --> 00:36:46,792
and serve them with soup.

805
00:36:47,392 --> 00:36:49,033
Please wait.

806
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:51,533
- We'll...
- Oh, my goodness.

807
00:36:52,162 --> 00:36:53,403
We made some toppings.

808
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:56,372
You made so many of them. Oh, my goodness.

809
00:36:57,542 --> 00:36:58,542
(Oh, my goodness.)

810
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:00,312
No wonder it's taking you long.

811
00:37:00,742 --> 00:37:02,242
You are really good.

812
00:37:03,642 --> 00:37:06,613
Can you pour some water and ice in there?

813
00:37:07,113 --> 00:37:08,352
- In here?
- Yes.

814
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:11,283
Do you have to use ice water for that too?

815
00:37:11,852 --> 00:37:14,593
(Pleased)

816
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:16,662
Please have a seat and enjoy the view.

817
00:37:17,263 --> 00:37:18,522
That was funny.

818
00:37:19,093 --> 00:37:21,733
They are making egg garnish and everything.

819
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:23,963
I thought janchi guksu wouldn't be too fancy.

820
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:26,832
But they are making it so fancy.

821
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:28,272
They are making it good enough for a festival.

822
00:37:28,272 --> 00:37:29,673
(Literally, they are having a party with the janchi guksu.)

823
00:37:30,272 --> 00:37:32,972
(For a real party, they are boiling noodles.)

824
00:37:33,472 --> 00:37:37,283
(Dong Il quickly boils the noodles.)

825
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:40,582
(Myoung stays right next to Dong Il...)

826
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:43,352
(and gets ready to rinse it in ice water.)

827
00:37:43,952 --> 00:37:47,522
(Dong Il is looking very busy today.)

828
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:48,992
(Peeking)

829
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,423
Pardon?

830
00:37:50,423 --> 00:37:52,693
- I'll take care of that.
- Sure.

831
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:54,292
Pardon?

832
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:55,903
(Myoung helps Dong Il who feels rushed.)

833
00:37:56,432 --> 00:38:00,832
(Rinsing the cooked noodles in ice water)

834
00:38:01,772 --> 00:38:04,372
(The bowls are already ready.)

835
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,513
Young Ok, how much noodles would you like?

836
00:38:10,513 --> 00:38:13,352
Give me a good amount. Don't give me too much.

837
00:38:13,412 --> 00:38:14,513
A good amount?

838
00:38:15,013 --> 00:38:17,722
Just a good amount. But don't give me too little either.

839
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:20,952
I haven't been in Korea for a while, so I can't tell what good amount is.

840
00:38:23,763 --> 00:38:24,823
Just half.

841
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:29,863
(I understood you perfectly, Young Ok.)

842
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:32,772
(The abalones are turning nice and golden brown.)

843
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,033
- Do we have garlic?
- Garlic?

844
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:36,042
Yes, give me some.

845
00:38:36,673 --> 00:38:38,843
Would you be okay with the garlic aroma?

846
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:41,673
That's totally fine. I can eat all sorts of things.

847
00:38:42,713 --> 00:38:44,843
I eat everything except for things like dogs and snakes.

848
00:38:46,113 --> 00:38:47,553
I'm okay with everything else.

849
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,783
The only thing that has changed about me is that...

850
00:38:49,783 --> 00:38:53,522
I used to love spicy food so much.

851
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:56,423
But now, although I'm fine with gochujang-level spiciness,

852
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,022
I try to avoid things that are really spicy with ingredients...

853
00:38:59,022 --> 00:39:00,633
like Cheongyang chili.

854
00:39:01,263 --> 00:39:02,763
- I get hiccups.
- Are you bad with spicy food?

855
00:39:02,763 --> 00:39:05,133
- If it's too spicy, I can't eat it.
- I see.

856
00:39:05,332 --> 00:39:07,332
So that's what has changed as I got older.

857
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:10,102
(What do we do with the broth?)

858
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:15,912
(It's so spicy that it makes you cough.)

859
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:16,912
Is it that bad?

860
00:39:17,582 --> 00:39:19,383
That's what has changed as I got older.

861
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:20,383
(Feeling like it's gone wrong)

862
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:24,222
I even dipped Cheongyang chili into gochujang to eat.

863
00:39:24,622 --> 00:39:27,852
But now, when I have something spicy, I get hiccups.

864
00:39:28,153 --> 00:39:30,892
I think my body can't handle it anymore like it used to.

865
00:39:30,963 --> 00:39:33,533
(Meanwhile, Dong Il is chopping Cheongyang chilies.)

866
00:39:33,863 --> 00:39:37,303
(The rhythmical chopping sound is unnecessarily exciting.)

867
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:40,733
(Putting a lot of Cheongyang chilies into the sauce for janchi guksu)

868
00:39:40,903 --> 00:39:43,102
Can you give me the minced garlic?

869
00:39:43,702 --> 00:39:44,772
You said it was done.

870
00:39:44,772 --> 00:39:46,412
(Making the spicy sauce is completed.)

871
00:39:46,642 --> 00:39:48,542
(Spiciness 1, spiciness 2)

872
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,383
Then how about spicy soup?

873
00:39:50,383 --> 00:39:51,783
- Hot and spicy soup...
- I can have it.

874
00:39:51,783 --> 00:39:53,352
- I still enjoy spicy soup.
- Okay.

875
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:54,753
(I'm relieved.)

876
00:39:55,213 --> 00:39:58,153
- You have a proper kitchen inside.
- Yes, we do.

877
00:39:58,153 --> 00:40:01,193
So how do you move the house every time?

878
00:40:01,452 --> 00:40:03,593
Does it need to be loaded? Or it can be moved just like that?

879
00:40:03,593 --> 00:40:05,363
- Do you see that car?
- That truck can pull it?

880
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:07,533
We connect the trailer to the back of the truck.

881
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:08,963
Goodness, it's interesting.

882
00:40:09,332 --> 00:40:11,363
So when the show is completely over,

883
00:40:11,363 --> 00:40:13,472
I hope you can sell it to me at a reasonable price.

884
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:14,702
- You mean the house?
- Yes.

885
00:40:14,702 --> 00:40:15,903
(You mean the house?)

886
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:18,372
- I think it's feasible.
- Really?

887
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:23,213
It's in better condition as we repeatedly fixed and renovated it.

888
00:40:24,113 --> 00:40:26,182
This version of the house is quite convenient.

889
00:40:26,553 --> 00:40:29,783
We even installed floor heating too.

890
00:40:29,783 --> 00:40:30,823
My goodness.

891
00:40:31,253 --> 00:40:34,253
Actually, the condition of the house has improved a lot.

892
00:40:35,122 --> 00:40:36,923
I haven't seen the inside yet. I'd like to have a look.

893
00:40:36,923 --> 00:40:39,733
We also have a mosquito net for every window.

894
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:41,733
- Okay.
- Please come on in, ma'am.

895
00:40:43,763 --> 00:40:47,503
Goodness, you placed a rug here.

896
00:40:47,503 --> 00:40:51,073
It's so cozy. So this is the living room.

897
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:54,343
- We have a bed over there.
- Okay.

898
00:40:54,343 --> 00:40:56,682
- We have another bed here too.
- My goodness.

899
00:40:56,682 --> 00:40:58,613
- You can see the window there.
- Okay.

900
00:40:58,613 --> 00:41:00,582
You can see the sky through the window.

901
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:02,722
My goodness, this is so great. I didn't expect this.

902
00:41:04,082 --> 00:41:06,153
Ms. Kim, this is the fuse box.

903
00:41:08,193 --> 00:41:09,562
- You have that too?
- Yes, of course.

904
00:41:09,562 --> 00:41:11,562
- So you can turn things off.
- You have everything here.

905
00:41:11,562 --> 00:41:13,733
Everything's equipped like a real house.

906
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:17,233
So I'm telling you, this house is actually pretty good.

907
00:41:17,233 --> 00:41:19,533
When the show's over, I hope I can take it over.

908
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:21,332
This house? Do you want to buy it?

909
00:41:21,332 --> 00:41:22,372
(Nodding)

910
00:41:22,872 --> 00:41:23,943
We have a deal.

911
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:25,472
(A successful deal)

912
00:41:25,642 --> 00:41:27,673
At a reasonable price, we could...

913
00:41:27,673 --> 00:41:30,682
Hey, you said you wouldn't be able to talk to her.

914
00:41:30,682 --> 00:41:31,943
You said you'd have hard time, but...

915
00:41:31,943 --> 00:41:35,653
Well, she's interested in our house, so...

916
00:41:35,983 --> 00:41:39,053
- Son, I'm starving here.
- Okay, Mother.

917
00:41:39,053 --> 00:41:41,323
It's done. It's really done.

918
00:41:42,122 --> 00:41:43,823
You're saying it's done, but it's been an hour.

919
00:41:44,292 --> 00:41:45,792
No, seriously. It's done.

920
00:41:46,492 --> 00:41:48,033
(The final step is to poach them in butter.)

921
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:49,403
Gosh, seriously.

922
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:54,003
Goodness, I feel like I'm at a restaurant.

923
00:41:54,003 --> 00:41:55,272
(Savory and chewy butter-poached abalones)

924
00:41:55,602 --> 00:41:57,003
My goodness.

925
00:41:59,443 --> 00:42:01,742
Goodness. Seriously, how does he...

926
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:04,912
It seems he's making the utmost effort today.

927
00:42:06,053 --> 00:42:08,553
You don't need to put in that much effort, you know.

928
00:42:08,553 --> 00:42:11,582
Come on, you came all the way here. I need to make everything perfect.

929
00:42:12,553 --> 00:42:15,522
(Nicely adding some garnishes made with all his heart)

930
00:42:16,622 --> 00:42:17,693
Thank you.

931
00:42:17,693 --> 00:42:19,062
(He even forgot to put on his shoes.)

932
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:21,892
(Neatly placing the spoons)

933
00:42:22,233 --> 00:42:24,202
(Satisfied)

934
00:42:24,202 --> 00:42:26,272
Why don't you wear slippers or something?

935
00:42:26,272 --> 00:42:28,533
- Yes, he's right. You should.
- I'll be coming back shortly.

936
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:31,073
I didn't mean to give you trouble.

937
00:42:31,943 --> 00:42:34,542
I guess it's better for you that you're sitting and talking to me.

938
00:42:34,542 --> 00:42:35,943
- I know, right?
- It's better than having to work.

939
00:42:35,943 --> 00:42:38,713
Right? You're funny, aren't you?

940
00:42:38,713 --> 00:42:41,383
- No, I am not.
- Yes, you're funny.

941
00:42:42,513 --> 00:42:43,582
My goodness.

942
00:42:43,582 --> 00:42:47,053
(Perfect and authentic janchi guksu is now ready.)

943
00:42:48,923 --> 00:42:51,392
Goodness, it's mouth-watering.

944
00:42:51,392 --> 00:42:54,233
Mother, would you like to taste the broth?

945
00:42:54,233 --> 00:42:56,702
Come on, I don't have to taste it. It must be great.

946
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:59,503
My opinion doesn't really matter, you know.

947
00:43:00,702 --> 00:43:03,542
(How does Young Ok like the spicy broth?)

948
00:43:03,972 --> 00:43:06,113
(How is it, Mother?)

949
00:43:06,772 --> 00:43:08,713
(Feeling nervous)

950
00:43:10,513 --> 00:43:12,113
(Coughing)

951
00:43:12,952 --> 00:43:14,653
Well, Hee Won said it'd be okay for you.

952
00:43:14,653 --> 00:43:16,383
I'm okay with spiciness,

953
00:43:17,283 --> 00:43:19,323
but the broth doesn't always need to be spicy.

954
00:43:19,852 --> 00:43:22,693
She says that the broth doesn't always need to be spicy.

955
00:43:22,693 --> 00:43:23,792
Give this to her.

956
00:43:24,892 --> 00:43:27,062
Let me see. I'll give it a try.

957
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,332
Can you bring one more of those?

958
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:33,803
(A bowl of janchi guksu made with Dong Il's heart)

959
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:39,142
(It's clear and breezy under the autumn sky.)

960
00:43:40,142 --> 00:43:44,283
(A warm meal with the view of the buckwheat field)

961
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:46,812
You can add the sauce a little bit.

962
00:43:46,812 --> 00:43:48,153
- I already did.
- Yes, with the sauce...

963
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:50,753
You go ahead and eat too. I'll try this first.

964
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,452
- Could I?
- Yes, the abalone?

965
00:43:52,452 --> 00:43:54,553
- I didn't cut them on purpose.
- Okay.

966
00:43:54,553 --> 00:43:55,653
So you can...

967
00:43:55,653 --> 00:43:57,263
How did you know I have good teeth?

968
00:43:58,992 --> 00:44:01,332
Do you need scissors? Can you bite it off?

969
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:03,832
Yes, it should be tender because I made cuts in it.

970
00:44:03,832 --> 00:44:04,903
Okay.

971
00:44:05,303 --> 00:44:07,533
- Why am I the only one eating?
- We're going to eat too.

972
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:09,602
I should've said that we could start the meal together.

973
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,042
Goodness, it's delicious.

974
00:44:12,202 --> 00:44:14,142
(It's so delicious.)

975
00:44:14,472 --> 00:44:16,343
(Relieved)

976
00:44:16,513 --> 00:44:18,943
Go ahead and try it.

977
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:21,352
It looked like it was just plainly stir-fried,

978
00:44:21,352 --> 00:44:23,283
- but it was poached in butter.
- Of course it should be.

979
00:44:25,283 --> 00:44:27,352
- With a bit of noodle...
- Gosh.

980
00:44:27,352 --> 00:44:28,423
(Amazed)

981
00:44:28,423 --> 00:44:31,193
(Gosh, you are really...)

982
00:44:32,222 --> 00:44:36,033
(Luxuriously having one whole abalone in one go)

983
00:44:36,403 --> 00:44:37,602
- You can have more.
- It's so great.

984
00:44:37,602 --> 00:44:38,662
We have more.

985
00:44:38,863 --> 00:44:40,432
If you want, I'll make more for you.

986
00:44:40,972 --> 00:44:42,102
We have a lot of them.

987
00:44:42,332 --> 00:44:45,872
(Having a mouthful of abalone made with his heart)

988
00:44:45,872 --> 00:44:48,372
Goodness, you made it so nicely.

989
00:44:48,673 --> 00:44:51,283
How lucky am I?

990
00:44:55,253 --> 00:44:56,323
Is it all right?

991
00:44:56,323 --> 00:44:59,553
(After checking her reaction first, he goes on and eats it.)

992
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:01,892
(Exclaiming)

993
00:45:03,122 --> 00:45:06,733
(Myoung, who diligently helped Dong Il,)

994
00:45:07,062 --> 00:45:08,263
(and Hee Won, who was shy, are enjoying the food.)

995
00:45:08,263 --> 00:45:09,602
- It's good, isn't it?
- Yes.

996
00:45:10,863 --> 00:45:11,963
Well, this...

997
00:45:12,633 --> 00:45:15,202
(Dong Il is constantly checking his mother's reactions.)

998
00:45:15,202 --> 00:45:17,003
(How do you like it?)

999
00:45:17,003 --> 00:45:19,613
(Is it good?)

1000
00:45:19,943 --> 00:45:23,412
(Closely checking on her)

1001
00:45:24,213 --> 00:45:26,383
Mother, this is the delicacy.

1002
00:45:26,383 --> 00:45:28,113
- Here, try it.
- I know. I like it.

1003
00:45:28,113 --> 00:45:29,182
It's good, right?

1004
00:45:29,722 --> 00:45:33,522
Serving the noodles with this kimchi...

1005
00:45:33,992 --> 00:45:35,553
- was an excellent choice.
- It was a great decision, right?

1006
00:45:36,323 --> 00:45:37,423
I didn't expect it to be so good.

1007
00:45:37,423 --> 00:45:40,593
(The young radish kimchi goes perfect with janchi guksu.)

1008
00:45:44,702 --> 00:45:47,033
- I know. I like it.
- It's good, right?

1009
00:45:47,503 --> 00:45:49,673
- Hee Won, try this.
- Okay.

1010
00:45:49,673 --> 00:45:50,803
(Leaving some young radish kimchi in front of Hee Won)

1011
00:45:50,803 --> 00:45:52,142
You give him hard times,

1012
00:45:52,142 --> 00:45:54,013
but you also take good care of him too.

1013
00:45:54,372 --> 00:45:55,642
He's being nice on purpose.

1014
00:45:56,013 --> 00:45:57,642
(Giggling)

1015
00:45:58,242 --> 00:46:00,553
To pretend that he doesn't give me hard times.

1016
00:46:00,553 --> 00:46:02,613
- He's pretty funny.
- No, he's very funny.

1017
00:46:03,653 --> 00:46:05,952
(Feeling proud)

1018
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:10,363
(Meanwhile, Myoung is enjoying the meal today as well.)

1019
00:46:10,763 --> 00:46:13,363
(One bite)

1020
00:46:13,363 --> 00:46:15,832
(Two bites)

1021
00:46:15,832 --> 00:46:18,162
(Three bites)

1022
00:46:19,003 --> 00:46:21,602
(The noodles are finished in three bites.)

1023
00:46:21,602 --> 00:46:23,343
(Wanting more)

1024
00:46:23,343 --> 00:46:26,843
Actually, don't make your stomach too full with it because...

1025
00:46:26,843 --> 00:46:27,872
Okay.

1026
00:46:27,872 --> 00:46:29,343
I cooked Korean thistle rice too.

1027
00:46:31,242 --> 00:46:33,883
Would you like to try it just a little bit?

1028
00:46:33,883 --> 00:46:35,783
- Okay. I should leave some then.
- Yes.

1029
00:46:36,053 --> 00:46:37,952
(How is Korean thistle rice cooked?)

1030
00:46:38,722 --> 00:46:42,593
(The rice is full of the scent of Korean thistle.)

1031
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:46,863
(Filling the bowl to the top as he's still hungry)

1032
00:46:47,093 --> 00:46:49,233
(Hold on.)

1033
00:46:49,233 --> 00:46:53,202
(He doesn't forget to take sesame oil with him.)

1034
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:54,332
Yes, Korean thistle rice...

1035
00:46:54,332 --> 00:46:55,633
(Starting the second round of lunch with Korean thistle rice)

1036
00:46:56,073 --> 00:46:58,443
Look, the rice is colored by the thistle.

1037
00:46:58,443 --> 00:47:00,673
- Yes, it's a nice color.
- Yes.

1038
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,613
I was...

1039
00:47:03,312 --> 00:47:05,582
Add just a bit. Too much oil is not good.

1040
00:47:05,912 --> 00:47:07,412
Come on, add more than that.

1041
00:47:08,182 --> 00:47:09,182
(What mothers say needs to be heard until the very end.)

1042
00:47:09,182 --> 00:47:10,923
Why did you stop in the middle?

1043
00:47:10,923 --> 00:47:12,323
Okay, you say stop.

1044
00:47:12,323 --> 00:47:14,622
It's just sesame oil, but I can't help but pour it politely like this.

1045
00:47:15,492 --> 00:47:17,162
- Although it's not alcohol...
- That's enough.

1046
00:47:17,662 --> 00:47:20,292
- You have good manners, though.
- Yes, of course.

1047
00:47:20,792 --> 00:47:24,733
(Mixing with a little bit of sauce)

1048
00:47:25,932 --> 00:47:27,633
(Dong Il is tasting it before she has it.)

1049
00:47:28,073 --> 00:47:29,642
(Glimpsing)

1050
00:47:31,443 --> 00:47:33,642
- If it's too salty for you...
- Okay.

1051
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,872
I'll quickly start eating before he eats it all.

1052
00:47:36,682 --> 00:47:37,943
It's a bit salty, Mother.

1053
00:47:38,642 --> 00:47:40,883
- You can add more rice.
- Why would I add more rice?

1054
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:43,553
Because it's a bit salty. I put more sauce than I should.

1055
00:47:43,923 --> 00:47:44,923
(Exclaiming)

1056
00:47:45,222 --> 00:47:47,823
- Is it okay for you? How is it?
- It's perfect for me.

1057
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,923
- How's the rice?
- I'd rather eat the rice.

1058
00:47:50,463 --> 00:47:52,792
(Dong Il is glad that she likes the rice.)

1059
00:47:52,992 --> 00:47:54,292
This is amazing.

1060
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:56,602
- You like the rice?
- Yes.

1061
00:47:56,602 --> 00:47:59,102
(The delicate scent of Korean thistle rice is appetizing.)

1062
00:47:59,363 --> 00:48:00,702
This is too great.

1063
00:48:00,702 --> 00:48:02,803
Normally, mothers always say everything is tasty,

1064
00:48:02,803 --> 00:48:04,673
- so I can't tell if they mean it.
- No.

1065
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,202
Instead of having just the noodles,

1066
00:48:06,742 --> 00:48:09,312
I love that I can have rice too.

1067
00:48:09,312 --> 00:48:13,082
(The best dessert for Koreans is rice.)

1068
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:15,412
(Myoung is happily taking a big bite of rice.)

1069
00:48:15,412 --> 00:48:16,553
It's really delicious.

1070
00:48:16,783 --> 00:48:19,323
- It goes well with the noodles too.
- I think I can eat more rice.

1071
00:48:19,323 --> 00:48:21,222
(Proud)

1072
00:48:21,423 --> 00:48:22,622
Okay, I'll go and...

1073
00:48:22,622 --> 00:48:25,792
(As Young Ok is enjoying the rice,)

1074
00:48:26,832 --> 00:48:29,963
(Dong Il enjoys his meal to the fullest.)

1075
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:33,173
To make this dish,

1076
00:48:33,173 --> 00:48:34,932
I prepared it from home.

1077
00:48:34,932 --> 00:48:36,003
(The youngest enjoys it nonstop.)

1078
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,443
I really love it.

1079
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:41,013
- You should eat more.
- Sure.

1080
00:48:41,173 --> 00:48:42,343
He's still a baby.

1081
00:48:42,343 --> 00:48:43,812
(Myoung is still a baby to Young Ok.)

1082
00:48:44,013 --> 00:48:45,642
He's younger than my grandchildren.

1083
00:48:45,912 --> 00:48:47,153
"He's younger than my grandchildren"?

1084
00:48:48,812 --> 00:48:50,582
- Mother.
- Goodness, it was wonderful.

1085
00:48:50,582 --> 00:48:52,222
I cut the abalones for you. Please eat it too.

1086
00:48:52,222 --> 00:48:53,253
No, you guys should have it.

1087
00:48:53,253 --> 00:48:54,852
- I left them for you.
- No.

1088
00:48:54,852 --> 00:48:58,162
Since I was young, I've had it a lot thinking they were just clams.

1089
00:48:58,363 --> 00:49:01,562
What a liar. You're talking nonsense.

1090
00:49:01,963 --> 00:49:04,102
I dug these abalones from the field right over there.

1091
00:49:04,803 --> 00:49:07,233
There were tons of them just behind the house.

1092
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:10,673
You talk nonsense all the time except when you sleep, right?

1093
00:49:10,673 --> 00:49:11,673
That's right.

1094
00:49:12,542 --> 00:49:14,412
(She's the only one who can control Dong Il.)

1095
00:49:14,412 --> 00:49:17,242
Sometimes I get confused. It's hard to tell if it's a lie or a truth.

1096
00:49:17,642 --> 00:49:19,753
Because he jokes around a lot.

1097
00:49:19,753 --> 00:49:21,513
(Gratifying)

1098
00:49:21,513 --> 00:49:23,323
Why are you laughing? You're worse than me.

1099
00:49:23,452 --> 00:49:25,823
When he tells a lie, he makes it sound like the truth.

1100
00:49:25,823 --> 00:49:26,823
I totally agree.

1101
00:49:26,823 --> 00:49:29,653
You can just think that everything he says is a lie.

1102
00:49:32,193 --> 00:49:34,392
Sometimes, it's hard to believe when he actually tells the truth.

1103
00:49:34,392 --> 00:49:36,363
- I hear you.
- He's completely mischievous.

1104
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:37,702
Did you hear her, Dong Il?

1105
00:49:38,633 --> 00:49:41,272
(I won't say anything in front of Mother.)

1106
00:49:41,972 --> 00:49:44,443
Goodness, I ate a lot. What should I do?

1107
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:45,443
It's because we're eating outside.

1108
00:49:46,673 --> 00:49:49,412
No, it's not because I'm outside. The food is really delicious.

1109
00:49:49,943 --> 00:49:52,582
(The best compliment for Dong Il who prepared everything)

1110
00:49:52,582 --> 00:49:56,682
I can see how much effort you had to put in to cook everything.

1111
00:49:57,383 --> 00:50:01,452
You can look at one ridge and have one bite...

1112
00:50:01,722 --> 00:50:03,562
and look at another ridge and have another bite,

1113
00:50:03,562 --> 00:50:06,222
as the ridges are overlapping.

1114
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,932
There's an old saying,

1115
00:50:07,932 --> 00:50:10,832
only when virtuous deeds are accumulated by many generations,

1116
00:50:11,363 --> 00:50:14,472
one can live in a place where more than five ridges are seen.

1117
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:15,832
- A wise person once said that.
- Okay.

1118
00:50:15,832 --> 00:50:18,073
Yes, it's an old saying.

1119
00:50:18,073 --> 00:50:21,242
That means those who haven't practiced good deeds...

1120
00:50:21,242 --> 00:50:23,312
cannot live in a place with such a great view.

1121
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,682
- Five ridges?
- Yes.

1122
00:50:26,653 --> 00:50:28,253
Although I just picked it up from somewhere.

1123
00:50:29,682 --> 00:50:31,553
Doesn't she speak in a similar way as I do?

1124
00:50:32,153 --> 00:50:33,923
So you're saying you're 84, right?

1125
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:35,352
(In the same age group)

1126
00:50:35,352 --> 00:50:36,492
You're 84 years old, that's why...

1127
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:39,062
Come to think of it, she's right. You were born in 1938.

1128
00:50:39,062 --> 00:50:40,792
- Yes, I was born in 1938.
- Exactly.

1129
00:50:40,792 --> 00:50:43,332
- Born in the Year of the Tiger.
- Yes, she's right.

1130
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,733
But it seems you were born in the Year of the Pig.

1131
00:50:45,733 --> 00:50:47,202
Why? What makes you think so?

1132
00:50:47,872 --> 00:50:49,633
Who do you think is more handsome? Hee Won and me.

1133
00:50:49,633 --> 00:50:51,972
He always says that he's better looking than me.

1134
00:50:51,972 --> 00:50:54,412
- He looks nice and kind.
- Pardon me?

1135
00:50:54,412 --> 00:50:57,283
As for you, you're lowly. No, not lowly but...

1136
00:50:57,713 --> 00:51:00,383
(Young Ok is strict with her son, Dong Il.)

1137
00:51:00,383 --> 00:51:03,682
You are so handsome, but you played a lot of weird roles.

1138
00:51:03,682 --> 00:51:06,892
The truth is, not every actor can play all different roles.

1139
00:51:06,892 --> 00:51:09,653
But from what I have seen so far,

1140
00:51:09,863 --> 00:51:11,863
Dong Il can play any role he wants.

1141
00:51:12,392 --> 00:51:14,533
A gentle person, a cool person, a bad person,

1142
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:17,702
and a trashy person. Whoever he plays, he pulls it off.

1143
00:51:18,463 --> 00:51:21,803
I think that is his biggest strength.

1144
00:51:21,803 --> 00:51:22,803
Gosh, thank you.

1145
00:51:23,272 --> 00:51:24,403
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

1146
00:51:24,843 --> 00:51:27,443
Can you split an apple for her?

1147
00:51:27,443 --> 00:51:28,513
- With your bare hands.
- That one?

1148
00:51:28,872 --> 00:51:31,142
It's tasty as is, but it's also good when it's split.

1149
00:51:31,312 --> 00:51:32,312
No, I can't.

1150
00:51:32,742 --> 00:51:34,013
Just try and split it for her.

1151
00:51:34,013 --> 00:51:36,452
It seems this apple is harder to split.

1152
00:51:36,452 --> 00:51:38,122
Not just this apple. I can't split open any apple.

1153
00:51:38,483 --> 00:51:40,452
Why did he ask you to do that when you can't do it?

1154
00:51:40,452 --> 00:51:41,553
(Trying again)

1155
00:51:42,222 --> 00:51:44,162
(Leaning awkwardly)

1156
00:51:44,963 --> 00:51:46,022
Is this your special talent?

1157
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:47,562
- Gosh, this is really...
- Ta-da.

1158
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,292
(Cracking an apple with bare hands is not easy.)

1159
00:51:49,593 --> 00:51:52,102
(He doesn't have any expectation although he asked him to do it.)

1160
00:51:53,003 --> 00:51:54,432
It's going to make a sound when...

1161
00:51:55,602 --> 00:51:57,042
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

1162
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:00,472
(You are awesome.)

1163
00:52:01,372 --> 00:52:04,013
Great. You made it.

1164
00:52:04,013 --> 00:52:05,912
- Your face is red like a tomato.
- Yes.

1165
00:52:05,912 --> 00:52:08,283
He asked me to do it because he thought I wouldn't make it.

1166
00:52:08,283 --> 00:52:11,352
He gave up twice earlier when we were in the field.

1167
00:52:11,582 --> 00:52:14,053
- I wondered why you were surprised.
- When I'm asked to do this,

1168
00:52:14,222 --> 00:52:16,392
I don't make it on purpose because I don't want them to keep asking me.

1169
00:52:16,622 --> 00:52:18,722
(Is that so?)

1170
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:22,533
- I did it now because she's here.
- You're so funny.

1171
00:52:22,533 --> 00:52:25,432
- I washed my hands beforehand.
- Go ahead and try it.

1172
00:52:25,432 --> 00:52:28,733
Please try it. You'll know it's different when you try it.

1173
00:52:29,633 --> 00:52:31,102
It's very sour.

1174
00:52:32,443 --> 00:52:34,642
(Her facial expression tells that it's sour.)

1175
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,242
(It's sour.)

1176
00:52:36,242 --> 00:52:37,312
Isn't it good?

1177
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:39,682
(It's sour.)

1178
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,483
This is really delicious.

1179
00:52:44,883 --> 00:52:47,952
Even though it's sour, it's sweet as well.

1180
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:51,522
It'd be the best if all apples taste like this.

1181
00:52:51,863 --> 00:52:52,923
Yes, isn't it great?

1182
00:52:53,792 --> 00:52:54,832
My goodness, it's delicious.

1183
00:52:56,932 --> 00:52:58,702
I'm glad that you like it.

1184
00:53:00,033 --> 00:53:02,633
I like this sourness. It's really good.

1185
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:04,843
(I'm glad.)

1186
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:09,613
- It's really sour.
- I didn't have any energy before,

1187
00:53:09,613 --> 00:53:11,443
and I got angry because I was too hungry,

1188
00:53:11,443 --> 00:53:13,783
- Yes, she was annoyed.
- but my anger disappeared.

1189
00:53:16,182 --> 00:53:18,823
Food changed my mood completely.

1190
00:53:18,823 --> 00:53:19,992
(Her anger from hunger disappeared.)

1191
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:22,193
We shot a drama called "Jirisan".

1192
00:53:22,423 --> 00:53:24,662
Although she had to come very far to the set, she never got angry.

1193
00:53:24,662 --> 00:53:27,533
Isn't it hard for you when you ride in a car for long hours?

1194
00:53:27,533 --> 00:53:29,693
It'd be a lie if I say it's not hard.

1195
00:53:30,562 --> 00:53:32,932
But I don't find it so difficult that I want to quit.

1196
00:53:32,932 --> 00:53:35,472
- You're still healthy.
- I like that I can go to the set.

1197
00:53:35,602 --> 00:53:37,472
(Admiring)

1198
00:53:37,472 --> 00:53:38,972
Your knees are stronger than mine.

1199
00:53:38,972 --> 00:53:41,113
Come on, not really...

1200
00:53:41,113 --> 00:53:43,483
I don't think they are strong, but I try to walk more.

1201
00:53:43,682 --> 00:53:45,943
But I feel more pain nowadays,

1202
00:53:46,713 --> 00:53:48,783
as I played a lot of tough characters.

1203
00:53:48,783 --> 00:53:51,352
You know, I always play a role who is at the bottom of the ladder.

1204
00:53:51,883 --> 00:53:54,323
I don't get to sit on a sofa like a rich housewife,

1205
00:53:54,323 --> 00:53:57,292
telling others what to do.

1206
00:53:57,292 --> 00:53:59,863
Maybe it's because I sound strong and tough...

1207
00:53:59,863 --> 00:54:01,892
when I speak.

1208
00:54:01,892 --> 00:54:04,602
That's because your diction is...

1209
00:54:04,602 --> 00:54:06,503
very clear and precise.

1210
00:54:06,832 --> 00:54:09,702
- You have the voice of a CEO.
- You're saying it doesn't suit me?

1211
00:54:09,702 --> 00:54:12,742
That's not true. You're just saying that to make me feel good.

1212
00:54:13,173 --> 00:54:16,013
I did many roles of CEO as well.

1213
00:54:16,213 --> 00:54:18,983
But the roles I played became rich by selling shrimp jeotgal,

1214
00:54:19,383 --> 00:54:21,182
or by selling gomtang.

1215
00:54:21,182 --> 00:54:22,452
They always give me such roles.

1216
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:25,053
When such roles are given,

1217
00:54:25,452 --> 00:54:28,323
I can act arrogant in an elegant way.

1218
00:54:28,323 --> 00:54:31,193
I act all rough, but my character is still rich.

1219
00:54:32,963 --> 00:54:34,593
It may seem that I act however I want,

1220
00:54:34,593 --> 00:54:37,363
but I decide on the details differently for each role.

1221
00:54:37,363 --> 00:54:39,332
When the lighting is good,

1222
00:54:39,332 --> 00:54:41,332
I look good on TV,

1223
00:54:41,332 --> 00:54:43,972
but sometimes I look like a monster.

1224
00:54:43,972 --> 00:54:45,073
There's nothing I can do about it though.

1225
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:48,513
To remove wrinkles, shall we go collect some honey?

1226
00:54:48,513 --> 00:54:50,283
How can we remove wrinkles?

1227
00:54:50,283 --> 00:54:53,412
I don't think I can remove wrinkles before I die.

1228
00:54:53,412 --> 00:54:55,653
Gosh, come on.

1229
00:54:55,653 --> 00:54:57,722
I already died three times on the show this year.

1230
00:54:58,522 --> 00:55:00,323
- Gosh.
- Seriously...

1231
00:55:00,323 --> 00:55:02,992
(A brutal joke only she can make)

1232
00:55:03,222 --> 00:55:05,392
- Why is this happening to me?
- Okay, before the sun goes down,

1233
00:55:05,892 --> 00:55:07,593
let's go collect some honey,

1234
00:55:07,593 --> 00:55:09,233
so you can put honey on your face. How would you like that?

1235
00:55:09,392 --> 00:55:13,403
(Under the flowing clouds...)

1236
00:55:14,033 --> 00:55:17,803
- As we're full, we can take a walk.
- I like that we're out for a walk.

1237
00:55:17,803 --> 00:55:19,003
- You do?
- It's perfect.

1238
00:55:19,843 --> 00:55:21,713
- The flowers are beautiful.
- I was really full.

1239
00:55:21,713 --> 00:55:23,443
- Yes, they are.
- Yes, they are beautiful.

1240
00:55:24,483 --> 00:55:26,213
(Beautifully spread along the walk)

1241
00:55:26,213 --> 00:55:27,582
They look white if you see them from far away.

1242
00:55:28,613 --> 00:55:31,923
The whole field looks white.

1243
00:55:33,653 --> 00:55:36,553
- Buckwheat honey is pretty rare.
- It must be great.

1244
00:55:36,553 --> 00:55:38,823
- Unlike the common acacia honey.
- Yes, you're right.

1245
00:55:39,193 --> 00:55:42,792
(I'm excited.)

1246
00:55:42,963 --> 00:55:45,102
Did you see the chestnut trees on your way up before?

1247
00:55:45,903 --> 00:55:48,673
- I didn't know. Oh, I see.
- They are chestnut trees.

1248
00:55:48,673 --> 00:55:49,803
I didn't realize it before.

1249
00:55:51,872 --> 00:55:57,682
(Chestnut trees are standing here and there in the front yard.)

1250
00:55:58,843 --> 00:56:00,013
I see many fallen chestnuts here.

1251
00:56:00,013 --> 00:56:03,452
We used to open it with our feet like this.

1252
00:56:03,622 --> 00:56:05,082
- Like this.
- Yes.

1253
00:56:05,082 --> 00:56:07,153
- Gosh, my shoes. Look.
- I see a chestnut inside.

1254
00:56:07,693 --> 00:56:08,923
You have to open it like this.

1255
00:56:08,923 --> 00:56:10,222
- Hee Won, have you ever tried it?
- Let's take some chestnuts.

1256
00:56:10,363 --> 00:56:11,562
Yes, I have, when I was younger.

1257
00:56:12,722 --> 00:56:14,463
Gosh, this is big.

1258
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:17,633
- My gosh.
- There was only one inside?

1259
00:56:17,633 --> 00:56:19,403
- Yes, there was only one.
- Goodness, look at this.

1260
00:56:19,403 --> 00:56:20,602
It doesn't look ripe.

1261
00:56:20,602 --> 00:56:21,932
- Maybe this one is ripe.
- The burr is already open.

1262
00:56:21,932 --> 00:56:24,642
- This burr is completely open.
- Gosh, there are three inside.

1263
00:56:24,642 --> 00:56:26,503
How could I not pick them when they are everywhere?

1264
00:56:27,272 --> 00:56:29,943
How could I just pass by when I can see it inside?

1265
00:56:30,242 --> 00:56:31,513
- Flip it.
- Look at this.

1266
00:56:31,943 --> 00:56:33,013
It's so pretty.

1267
00:56:34,013 --> 00:56:37,122
- Goodness, this is so much fun.
- I found three in here.

1268
00:56:37,122 --> 00:56:39,383
Let's not collect the honey. Let's just pick the chestnuts here.

1269
00:56:39,383 --> 00:56:40,452
You don't want to collect the honey?

1270
00:56:41,722 --> 00:56:43,722
(She loves it.)

1271
00:56:43,823 --> 00:56:45,522
Look at this one.

1272
00:56:45,522 --> 00:56:47,932
- This is amazing.
- Look, it's big.

1273
00:56:48,133 --> 00:56:49,932
Mother, these are already out from the burr.

1274
00:56:49,932 --> 00:56:52,702
- Goodness, this chestnut is big.
- Look at this.

1275
00:56:52,702 --> 00:56:54,832
Like she said, it's hard to just pass by.

1276
00:56:54,832 --> 00:56:56,332
How could I not pick them?

1277
00:56:56,332 --> 00:56:57,903
- You lied about your age, right?
- Here it is.

1278
00:56:57,903 --> 00:56:59,073
(The small fun fascinates everyone.)

1279
00:56:59,472 --> 00:57:01,073
I picked them for a short while,

1280
00:57:01,073 --> 00:57:03,372
- and I already have a lot.
- My goodness.

1281
00:57:03,742 --> 00:57:05,443
I should collect them.

1282
00:57:05,742 --> 00:57:07,852
I'm glad that I brought my handkerchief.

1283
00:57:10,423 --> 00:57:11,483
Do you want them?

1284
00:57:11,483 --> 00:57:15,153
Of course I want them. Were you going to take them for yourself?

1285
00:57:15,522 --> 00:57:16,823
I'm so excited.

1286
00:57:16,823 --> 00:57:18,323
(Embarrassed)

1287
00:57:18,923 --> 00:57:20,593
We'll be filling a bucket soon.

1288
00:57:20,593 --> 00:57:21,832
- Myoung.
- Yes?

1289
00:57:22,263 --> 00:57:24,932
Myoung has a lot. He has a lot in his pockets.

1290
00:57:24,932 --> 00:57:26,403
- Who?
- Myoung behind us.

1291
00:57:26,403 --> 00:57:28,233
Myoung, are you going to keep them? or are you giving them to her?

1292
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:29,332
Of course I'll give them to her.

1293
00:57:30,372 --> 00:57:32,202
(Goodness, how nice of him.)

1294
00:57:32,303 --> 00:57:34,173
Here I can just pick up the chestnuts.

1295
00:57:34,272 --> 00:57:37,843
The ones already out from the burr are fully ripe. Put them in here.

1296
00:57:38,042 --> 00:57:39,113
"Put them in here"?

1297
00:57:39,983 --> 00:57:41,352
That one. Open that burr.

1298
00:57:42,952 --> 00:57:44,783
- Open this one.
- One second, please.

1299
00:57:45,823 --> 00:57:48,122
- Yes, you're doing great.
- I don't think we can leave.

1300
00:57:48,823 --> 00:57:50,463
(Here you go.)

1301
00:57:50,463 --> 00:57:53,193
- Try this one.
- They are all from one tree.

1302
00:57:55,093 --> 00:57:56,533
Look how nicely I opened it.

1303
00:57:56,533 --> 00:57:58,263
My goodness, it has three babies.

1304
00:57:58,263 --> 00:57:59,332
Three babies?

1305
00:57:59,332 --> 00:58:00,573
(Laughing)

1306
00:58:00,733 --> 00:58:01,803
Look!

1307
00:58:02,303 --> 00:58:03,903
Yes, that's big.

1308
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,943
(She's excited like a little girl.)

1309
00:58:04,943 --> 00:58:06,073
This is big too.

1310
00:58:06,943 --> 00:58:08,073
Gosh, really.

1311
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,843
- Look at that. How could I pass by?
- Gosh, seriously.

1312
00:58:12,783 --> 00:58:14,983
Mother, give me that. I'll carry it for you.

1313
00:58:15,582 --> 00:58:17,783
- No.
- No, I won't take them.

1314
00:58:17,783 --> 00:58:19,653
Go open that burr.

1315
00:58:19,653 --> 00:58:22,492
Come on, let's go. Don't be greedy. The honey is more expensive.

1316
00:58:22,923 --> 00:58:26,522
Mother, let's go. The honey is more precious.

1317
00:58:26,522 --> 00:58:28,292
- No, it's not precious to me.
- Come on.

1318
00:58:28,292 --> 00:58:31,133
How could I not pick them? What do I do?

1319
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,533
Can someone get rid of the chestnuts on the road?

1320
00:58:32,932 --> 00:58:34,233
I don't think we'll be able to make it to the bee farm.

1321
00:58:34,233 --> 00:58:35,272
(Can someone remove the chestnuts? We need to go collect honey.)

1322
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:38,003
Look at him. He's like you.

1323
00:58:38,003 --> 00:58:40,272
Myoung is still picking chestnuts.

1324
00:58:40,272 --> 00:58:41,412
(Stubborn Myoung)

1325
00:58:41,412 --> 00:58:42,972
- Myoung.
- Yes?

1326
00:58:42,972 --> 00:58:44,443
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1327
00:58:46,013 --> 00:58:48,283
- You can stop now.
- You can stop now.

1328
00:58:49,682 --> 00:58:51,283
I didn't expect this happiness.

1329
00:58:51,283 --> 00:58:53,323
Here, let me carry it for you. I won't take them.

1330
00:58:54,022 --> 00:58:55,022
Yes, I think you will.

1331
00:58:55,022 --> 00:58:56,153
- No, I won't.
- No, he won't.

1332
00:58:56,153 --> 00:58:58,392
- I promise I won't take them.
- Let me carry some as well.

1333
00:58:58,392 --> 00:58:59,892
- Let me carry it.
- I'll carry it.

1334
00:58:59,892 --> 00:59:01,193
My goodness, it's hilarious.

1335
00:59:01,693 --> 00:59:04,432
- Let's pick more on our way up.
- Are you serious?

1336
00:59:04,432 --> 00:59:05,562
We could do that.

1337
00:59:05,963 --> 00:59:07,173
It tastes really good.

1338
00:59:07,173 --> 00:59:10,503
(The son and the mom are walking together arm in arm.)

1339
00:59:11,372 --> 00:59:12,843
- What are you doing?
- Let's walk together.

1340
00:59:12,943 --> 00:59:15,812
- Do you know what that is?
- I have no idea.

1341
00:59:15,812 --> 00:59:18,312
- It's clematis berries.
- I don't know what that is.

1342
00:59:18,312 --> 00:59:19,383
They are clematis berries.

1343
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:22,452
- These are clematis berries?
- Yes, they're edible.

1344
00:59:22,812 --> 00:59:24,022
What is that?

1345
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:26,153
(What is that?)

1346
00:59:26,682 --> 00:59:28,053
It looks like it's split open.

1347
00:59:28,992 --> 00:59:31,892
Maybe it's split open because it's ripe.

1348
00:59:33,162 --> 00:59:35,133
- Like this.
- It looks like a bug.

1349
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:39,432
(The clematis berry's white meat that comes out when it's ripe)

1350
00:59:39,832 --> 00:59:41,033
- What?
- Like this.

1351
00:59:41,033 --> 00:59:42,403
It looks like a bug.

1352
00:59:45,272 --> 00:59:47,843
(That's scary.)

1353
00:59:47,843 --> 00:59:50,142
- Doesn't it look like a bug?
- Take a look at it.

1354
00:59:51,483 --> 00:59:52,542
Like this.

1355
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:54,852
I think I've seen clematis berries that were picked.

1356
00:59:54,852 --> 00:59:57,352
Aren't the ones with black seeds inside inedible?

1357
00:59:57,582 --> 00:59:58,983
No, I think you just eat it.

1358
01:00:00,753 --> 01:00:01,792
Like this?

1359
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:03,863
(What does the unfamiliar clematis berry taste like?)

1360
01:00:04,263 --> 01:00:05,763
You should eat it all.

1361
01:00:06,162 --> 01:00:07,162
(Running away)

1362
01:00:07,162 --> 01:00:08,233
I can't eat it.

1363
01:00:10,763 --> 01:00:11,803
Is it good?

1364
01:00:13,133 --> 01:00:14,472
It's very sweet.

1365
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:17,343
- It's sweet?
- It's very sweet.

1366
01:00:17,343 --> 01:00:19,042
(Let me try some.)

1367
01:00:19,242 --> 01:00:20,472
Spit out the seed though, Mother.

1368
01:00:21,412 --> 01:00:23,713
- It's very sweet.
- It really is.

1369
01:00:24,013 --> 01:00:26,983
(That's sweet?)

1370
01:00:26,983 --> 01:00:30,153
It's sweet, but I feel like I'm eating snot.

1371
01:00:30,153 --> 01:00:31,283
Snot.

1372
01:00:32,352 --> 01:00:34,423
- It's like snot.
- Snot?

1373
01:00:36,122 --> 01:00:37,162
What is that?

1374
01:00:37,162 --> 01:00:38,463
It's a clematis berry. It's sweet.

1375
01:00:38,463 --> 01:00:40,562
About two-thirds of it...

1376
01:00:40,932 --> 01:00:41,932
Try it.

1377
01:00:42,992 --> 01:00:45,662
- It tastes like a dough with sugar.
- I bet that...

1378
01:00:45,662 --> 01:00:47,803
this is bitter when it's not ripe, but this one is really ripe.

1379
01:00:47,803 --> 01:00:49,472
- It is. That's why it was open.
- It's good. Try it.

1380
01:00:49,472 --> 01:00:50,843
You're right, Mother. Do you want more?

1381
01:00:50,843 --> 01:00:52,602
Gosh, don't kid with me. I already had some.

1382
01:00:53,503 --> 01:00:55,372
It's like rice cakes drenched in water.

1383
01:00:55,843 --> 01:00:58,312
- Right. Have more.
- Baekseolgi doused in water?

1384
01:00:58,312 --> 01:00:59,343
(The taste review is unsettling.)

1385
01:00:59,343 --> 01:01:02,553
(I don't really like this either.)

1386
01:01:03,053 --> 01:01:05,722
- It really is like snot.
- It is.

1387
01:01:08,153 --> 01:01:11,263
Look at that. They're in full bloom.

1388
01:01:11,263 --> 01:01:13,292
- Right? They're in full bloom.
- Yes, they are.

1389
01:01:13,292 --> 01:01:15,492
They must get more sun in this area.

1390
01:01:15,492 --> 01:01:17,602
(They keep walking while being entranced by the flowers.)

1391
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:19,832
The honeybees are hard at work.

1392
01:01:19,832 --> 01:01:21,073
- They're working hard.
- Yes, they are.

1393
01:01:21,073 --> 01:01:22,673
There are so many flowers here.

1394
01:01:22,872 --> 01:01:24,102
Look at those bees.

1395
01:01:25,343 --> 01:01:27,412
(Surprised)

1396
01:01:27,412 --> 01:01:29,443
- What?
- Wait right here.

1397
01:01:29,443 --> 01:01:31,682
(They arrive at the buckwheat bee farm.)

1398
01:01:31,983 --> 01:01:33,182
Hello.

1399
01:01:33,682 --> 01:01:34,983
- Goodness.
- Are you the owner?

1400
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:36,013
Hello.

1401
01:01:38,722 --> 01:01:40,423
Is that the honey you just harvested?

1402
01:01:40,423 --> 01:01:42,693
- Yes, it is.
- Goodness.

1403
01:01:42,693 --> 01:01:44,423
- This honey is from here.
- Oh, my.

1404
01:01:45,093 --> 01:01:47,593
- Is it filled with honey?
- Yes, if you look here,

1405
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:50,332
the color is different down here.

1406
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:51,963
This is the nursery.

1407
01:01:51,963 --> 01:01:54,233
- The nursery?
- Yes. This is the nursery.

1408
01:01:54,233 --> 01:01:55,872
The top is where the honey is.

1409
01:01:56,102 --> 01:01:58,972
- The honey is on the top?
- Yes, the color is different.

1410
01:01:58,972 --> 01:01:59,972
(Interested)

1411
01:02:00,173 --> 01:02:02,642
(These three are afraid of bees.)

1412
01:02:02,642 --> 01:02:04,783
He's just touching it with his bare hands.

1413
01:02:06,312 --> 01:02:10,312
(They're curious, but...)

1414
01:02:10,312 --> 01:02:13,153
So the honey goes from the bottom...

1415
01:02:13,153 --> 01:02:14,722
- They bring it up?
- Yes.

1416
01:02:14,852 --> 01:02:16,753
Hey. There are bees on your pants.

1417
01:02:18,062 --> 01:02:22,193
When they get bigger, they can't collect a lot.

1418
01:02:22,733 --> 01:02:24,562
Where did she go?

1419
01:02:24,932 --> 01:02:27,102
- Do your legs hurt?
- I'm scared.

1420
01:02:27,272 --> 01:02:29,233
- Pardon?
- The bees keep coming toward us.

1421
01:02:31,573 --> 01:02:32,642
I'm scared.

1422
01:02:32,642 --> 01:02:36,142
(Young Ok is afraid of bees.)

1423
01:02:36,972 --> 01:02:40,343
Is there a difference between buckwheat flower and acacia?

1424
01:02:40,343 --> 01:02:41,912
- It has a nice aroma, - This is...

1425
01:02:41,912 --> 01:02:43,412
and in autumn...

1426
01:02:43,412 --> 01:02:46,423
Depending on when you plant them,

1427
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:48,522
you can control it as you want.

1428
01:02:49,222 --> 01:02:53,122
It will continue producing flowers until mid-October.

1429
01:02:53,463 --> 01:02:55,792
- What is this?
- It's a wasp.

1430
01:02:55,792 --> 01:02:57,932
- It's a wasp?
- Yes.

1431
01:02:58,463 --> 01:03:00,202
What's very interesting is that...

1432
01:03:00,202 --> 01:03:01,872
when a wasp comes near it,

1433
01:03:01,872 --> 01:03:04,102
all of the bees flap their wings.

1434
01:03:04,303 --> 01:03:05,943
What they're doing is responding to it.

1435
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:08,843
I see. Whenever a wasp comes near,

1436
01:03:08,843 --> 01:03:11,542
all of the honeybees begin flapping their wings.

1437
01:03:11,542 --> 01:03:13,142
- So this is...
- At the same time. Look.

1438
01:03:13,142 --> 01:03:14,452
Oh, my!

1439
01:03:15,213 --> 01:03:17,253
- That's hilarious. Look at that.
- Oh, my.

1440
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:18,783
Look.

1441
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:20,022
(Exclaiming)

1442
01:03:20,022 --> 01:03:21,022
Oh, my gosh!

1443
01:03:23,452 --> 01:03:24,863
I should flap around.

1444
01:03:25,662 --> 01:03:27,093
I should flap around too.

1445
01:03:27,093 --> 01:03:28,662
(Flapping)

1446
01:03:28,662 --> 01:03:31,263
Can we taste it?

1447
01:03:31,263 --> 01:03:33,003
- Do you want to taste it?
- Yes.

1448
01:03:33,702 --> 01:03:35,733
(He scoops the honey with the honeycomb.)

1449
01:03:35,733 --> 01:03:37,372
The honey inside the honeycomb.

1450
01:03:37,472 --> 01:03:40,202
(What does it taste like?)

1451
01:03:40,343 --> 01:03:41,542
Oh, really?

1452
01:03:41,542 --> 01:03:43,343
(Curious)

1453
01:03:43,343 --> 01:03:47,142
(Tasting)

1454
01:03:47,283 --> 01:03:49,352
It's very sticky and aromatic, right?

1455
01:03:49,753 --> 01:03:53,053
So it's... Gosh, I can't open my mouth because it's so sticky.

1456
01:03:53,182 --> 01:03:55,292
You can only know when you taste it.

1457
01:03:57,823 --> 01:03:58,823
Mother!

1458
01:03:59,022 --> 01:04:00,492
(Young Ok ran away further.)

1459
01:04:00,492 --> 01:04:01,533
Mother!

1460
01:04:02,263 --> 01:04:03,792
The honey is really good.

1461
01:04:04,062 --> 01:04:05,602
- Gosh.
- I'll bring some.

1462
01:04:05,602 --> 01:04:07,803
I'm sure it's good, but there are so many bees there.

1463
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:10,133
- I'll bring it to you.
- I'm scared.

1464
01:04:10,573 --> 01:04:12,073
Can you give this to Mother?

1465
01:04:12,073 --> 01:04:13,142
Oh, I guess she's more like your grandma.

1466
01:04:13,142 --> 01:04:15,142
- Bring this to Grandma.
- Okay.

1467
01:04:15,772 --> 01:04:17,013
Try some of this, Mother.

1468
01:04:18,582 --> 01:04:21,682
(He delivers the spoon full of buckwheat honey.)

1469
01:04:21,852 --> 01:04:23,253
Goodness.

1470
01:04:24,553 --> 01:04:28,553
(Young Ok tries some buckwheat honey.)

1471
01:04:31,722 --> 01:04:32,792
Is it good?

1472
01:04:32,792 --> 01:04:34,162
- Oh, my.
- Isn't it sticky?

1473
01:04:34,693 --> 01:04:36,162
- What do you think?
- How is it, Mother?

1474
01:04:36,963 --> 01:04:38,303
It's good.

1475
01:04:40,503 --> 01:04:41,503
(I want to try some.)

1476
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:43,332
How was it? What do you think?

1477
01:04:44,772 --> 01:04:45,803
Isn't it good?

1478
01:04:49,372 --> 01:04:50,513
Do you want 100kg of this?

1479
01:04:51,142 --> 01:04:53,283
- Did he say 100kg?
- How about 100kg of honey?

1480
01:04:53,283 --> 01:04:54,483
(Laughing)

1481
01:04:55,553 --> 01:04:57,153
- What do you think?
- It's so good.

1482
01:04:57,153 --> 01:04:59,783
- Isn't it good? I was so surprised.
- Yes.

1483
01:04:59,783 --> 01:05:02,222
- This is so good.
- This is...

1484
01:05:02,952 --> 01:05:05,463
Youngest. Come here and try some.

1485
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,392
- This honey is so good.
- Isn't it?

1486
01:05:09,392 --> 01:05:11,332
- This is really good.
- Is it?

1487
01:05:11,332 --> 01:05:12,662
- You haven't tried it yet?
- Not yet.

1488
01:05:12,662 --> 01:05:14,372
Hurry up and have some.

1489
01:05:15,073 --> 01:05:17,033
(Excited)

1490
01:05:17,033 --> 01:05:19,503
- Try it.
- It's really good.

1491
01:05:19,503 --> 01:05:22,372
(The youngest member tries the buckwheat honey.)

1492
01:05:23,513 --> 01:05:25,042
- Right?
- Right, Mother?

1493
01:05:26,443 --> 01:05:29,352
- This is the best honey I had.
- Is it?

1494
01:05:29,613 --> 01:05:31,753
- This is really good.
- Hee Won. Over here.

1495
01:05:31,753 --> 01:05:33,082
(Hee Won, bees.)

1496
01:05:33,082 --> 01:05:34,492
Bees!

1497
01:05:35,122 --> 01:05:36,253
Just kidding.

1498
01:05:36,253 --> 01:05:38,492
(Just kidding.)

1499
01:05:39,423 --> 01:05:42,533
(Laughing)

1500
01:05:43,562 --> 01:05:46,702
(Why you little...)

1501
01:05:46,702 --> 01:05:48,102
Gosh, our youngest is so cute.

1502
01:05:48,102 --> 01:05:50,272
- Goodness.
- It's here.

1503
01:05:50,403 --> 01:05:52,102
- These are yours.
- Really?

1504
01:05:52,102 --> 01:05:53,602
(The buckwheat honey they purchased is here.)

1505
01:05:53,602 --> 01:05:55,412
- Here you go.
- It's so...

1506
01:05:55,412 --> 01:05:57,983
- You came all the way here, so...
- Gosh, this is...

1507
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:00,513
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1508
01:06:01,053 --> 01:06:02,082
This is good.

1509
01:06:02,082 --> 01:06:04,553
- This is really good.
- Thank you!

1510
01:06:04,553 --> 01:06:05,952
(With the buckwheat honey that captured their palate,)

1511
01:06:06,983 --> 01:06:10,423
(they head back to House on Wheels in good spirit.)

1512
01:06:10,423 --> 01:06:12,622
Mother. This is...

1513
01:06:13,062 --> 01:06:14,093
(They prepared something for their mother.)

1514
01:06:14,093 --> 01:06:16,233
- Goodness, it's so pretty.
- I prepared this for you.

1515
01:06:16,233 --> 01:06:17,292
I'll put your hat away.

1516
01:06:17,733 --> 01:06:19,562
Goodness gracious.

1517
01:06:20,503 --> 01:06:23,073
- So?
- You're taking good care of me.

1518
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:24,943
No, we do this for everyone.

1519
01:06:24,943 --> 01:06:27,042
- Do you really?
- Yes. For all our guests...

1520
01:06:27,042 --> 01:06:28,642
(Dong Il is treating his mother well.)

1521
01:06:28,642 --> 01:06:31,483
Mother, try one.

1522
01:06:31,483 --> 01:06:33,642
You guys are only going to eat once I eat, right?

1523
01:06:34,082 --> 01:06:35,153
Try some.

1524
01:06:35,153 --> 01:06:37,013
(They enjoy the buckwheat honey with bar rice cakes.)

1525
01:06:37,423 --> 01:06:39,582
- Are the rice cakes hard?
- They are.

1526
01:06:39,582 --> 01:06:42,253
The rice cake isn't totally soft, but it's good.

1527
01:06:42,352 --> 01:06:43,352
Is it?

1528
01:06:43,992 --> 01:06:45,823
Why is this so good?

1529
01:06:46,522 --> 01:06:49,263
- It must be because of the honey.
- The honey?

1530
01:06:49,263 --> 01:06:50,763
We had noodles just now.

1531
01:06:50,763 --> 01:06:53,162
We had lunch, and we're eating again.

1532
01:06:53,533 --> 01:06:55,202
(Taking a bite)

1533
01:06:55,202 --> 01:06:56,202
Right?

1534
01:06:56,673 --> 01:06:58,372
(Exclaiming)

1535
01:06:58,372 --> 01:06:59,602
- Is it good?
- We should grill them.

1536
01:07:00,102 --> 01:07:01,872
- It's good.
- The honey...

1537
01:07:02,513 --> 01:07:04,513
It's really delicious.

1538
01:07:05,443 --> 01:07:07,213
It has a unique scent.

1539
01:07:07,213 --> 01:07:08,312
- It does, doesn't it?
- Yes.

1540
01:07:08,312 --> 01:07:09,352
(They can taste the unique flavor of the honey.)

1541
01:07:09,352 --> 01:07:10,452
We need to eat it fast.

1542
01:07:12,852 --> 01:07:15,553
- Gosh, it tastes rich.
- It does.

1543
01:07:17,093 --> 01:07:19,792
- The honey is really rich.
- It is.

1544
01:07:20,062 --> 01:07:22,633
Right? It's really rich.

1545
01:07:22,633 --> 01:07:25,133
(Getting up)

1546
01:07:26,103 --> 01:07:29,433
Our youngest is quick on his feet and doesn't need to be told.

1547
01:07:29,433 --> 01:07:31,242
Look how he's bringing out some water for us.

1548
01:07:31,242 --> 01:07:32,542
(The youngest is so sensible.)

1549
01:07:32,643 --> 01:07:34,143
He doesn't move an inch.

1550
01:07:34,542 --> 01:07:37,813
Whether an adult comes or his junior is here...

1551
01:07:37,982 --> 01:07:40,542
He's just saying that.

1552
01:07:41,383 --> 01:07:44,013
But it's okay to do that here.

1553
01:07:45,223 --> 01:07:46,622
Don't be so respectful to him.

1554
01:07:47,053 --> 01:07:48,122
How should I treat him?

1555
01:07:48,393 --> 01:07:50,423
- Every time he says something, - Yes?

1556
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:53,023
it's very unpleasant.

1557
01:07:53,023 --> 01:07:54,992
So just say, "Hey", when you call him.

1558
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:57,133
"Hey, I didn't do that."

1559
01:07:57,133 --> 01:07:59,133
Just say "Hey" when you call him.

1560
01:07:59,133 --> 01:08:00,902
When you look at him as a whole,

1561
01:08:00,902 --> 01:08:03,773
I'm well aware that he's quite unpredictable.

1562
01:08:03,773 --> 01:08:05,103
Right? See? Even she's well aware.

1563
01:08:05,103 --> 01:08:07,103
When you go this way, he goes that way, and vice versa.

1564
01:08:07,103 --> 01:08:08,813
You don't know if what he's saying is nice,

1565
01:08:08,813 --> 01:08:11,713
and it's hard to tell what kind of person he really is.

1566
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:15,013
- I know.
- I can tell now that he's older.

1567
01:08:15,582 --> 01:08:18,322
I'm so glad that you're on my side.

1568
01:08:18,322 --> 01:08:19,652
- I finally have...
- But...

1569
01:08:19,652 --> 01:08:20,822
- someone on my side.
- Mother.

1570
01:08:21,023 --> 01:08:22,952
Don't be fooled by him.

1571
01:08:22,952 --> 01:08:24,523
He's no joke.

1572
01:08:25,992 --> 01:08:27,362
- Hey.
- Hey.

1573
01:08:27,362 --> 01:08:29,232
(Hey, Mr. Sung Dong Il.)

1574
01:08:29,532 --> 01:08:31,362
(He has a headache.)

1575
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,702
Since we're on the topic, to commemorate this moment,

1576
01:08:34,603 --> 01:08:36,072
may I ask you...

1577
01:08:36,072 --> 01:08:37,232
(Hee Won is getting Young Ok's number.)

1578
01:08:37,232 --> 01:08:39,673
- for your number?
- You want my number?

1579
01:08:40,273 --> 01:08:42,813
- Are you asking for her number too?
- Why not?

1580
01:08:43,343 --> 01:08:44,442
No, so when...

1581
01:08:45,143 --> 01:08:47,813
the new year comes,

1582
01:08:48,383 --> 01:08:49,753
I'll call to wish her a new year.

1583
01:08:49,753 --> 01:08:51,082
(Stuck like glue)

1584
01:08:51,683 --> 01:08:52,753
Keep this in mind.

1585
01:08:52,982 --> 01:08:55,652
Just because we met this once and it's a fleeting moment,

1586
01:08:55,652 --> 01:08:58,963
you might think that I'd forget about you and move on.

1587
01:08:59,393 --> 01:09:01,862
But it's not like that. When I see you on TV, I recognize you.

1588
01:09:01,862 --> 01:09:03,593
So I watch more carefully...

1589
01:09:03,593 --> 01:09:06,662
to see if you're doing well. I think all sorts of things.

1590
01:09:07,063 --> 01:09:10,032
We may not always keep in contact,

1591
01:09:10,503 --> 01:09:12,273
but I'd be glad to see you on TV.

1592
01:09:12,773 --> 01:09:14,003
When I don't see you,

1593
01:09:14,003 --> 01:09:15,872
I'd wonder what happened to you...

1594
01:09:16,343 --> 01:09:17,442
and feel sad.

1595
01:09:17,782 --> 01:09:20,813
Now, you'll watch all of us more carefully.

1596
01:09:20,982 --> 01:09:22,013
That's right.

1597
01:09:22,313 --> 01:09:24,652
- Oh, my.
- I'll watch out for you guys.

1598
01:09:26,883 --> 01:09:29,753
What do you think? Is it uncomfortable to spend the day...

1599
01:09:29,753 --> 01:09:30,853
with your senior?

1600
01:09:30,853 --> 01:09:34,292
No. I don't feel like that at all.

1601
01:09:34,862 --> 01:09:36,933
The younger generations don't feel uncomfortable around me.

1602
01:09:36,933 --> 01:09:38,603
They're all so rude.

1603
01:09:38,603 --> 01:09:42,273
(Gasping)

1604
01:09:42,273 --> 01:09:43,832
- Kids these days...
- It's like that after meeting once,

1605
01:09:43,832 --> 01:09:45,643
so imagine how it'll be like after meeting me 2, 3 times.

1606
01:09:46,242 --> 01:09:47,473
- Like him.
- Me?

1607
01:09:47,473 --> 01:09:48,473
Yes.

1608
01:09:48,912 --> 01:09:50,412
What is the world coming to?

1609
01:09:51,883 --> 01:09:54,353
What is the world coming to?

1610
01:09:54,353 --> 01:09:55,782
(What is the world coming to? They're so rude.)

1611
01:09:56,713 --> 01:10:00,582
They don't know how bad they are, and they're quick to judge others.

1612
01:10:00,582 --> 01:10:01,952
(Their laughter is as splendid as the buckwheat flowers.)

1613
01:10:02,553 --> 01:10:03,952
(The bright fall sun...)

1614
01:10:03,952 --> 01:10:05,862
He's very funny.

1615
01:10:06,992 --> 01:10:08,232
Where are you from?

1616
01:10:08,232 --> 01:10:09,263
Me?

1617
01:10:09,263 --> 01:10:11,503
- I'm from Seoul.
- That's why...

1618
01:10:12,003 --> 01:10:13,362
(The bright fall sun begun to set behind our home.)

1619
01:10:13,362 --> 01:10:15,933
- We'll collect some of it, and...
- You have something on your eye.

1620
01:10:15,933 --> 01:10:16,973
I'm sorry.

1621
01:10:20,973 --> 01:10:25,813
(They don't stop laughing.)

1622
01:10:27,412 --> 01:10:31,553
(The time in the buckwheat field flows slowly.)

1623
01:10:32,582 --> 01:10:36,652
(We captured these moments with photographs.)

1624
01:10:37,763 --> 01:10:40,192
(What will happen during dinner...)

1625
01:10:40,192 --> 01:10:45,862
(in this place as beautiful as a watercolor painting?)

1626
01:10:47,162 --> 01:10:50,332
(Young Ok comes into the house alone.)

1627
01:10:50,702 --> 01:10:53,603
(Walking quickly)

1628
01:10:53,942 --> 01:10:58,883
(She puts on a pair of slippers...)

1629
01:10:58,982 --> 01:11:02,782
(and heads toward the kitchen.)

1630
01:11:03,282 --> 01:11:07,452
(Does Young Ok have something to do in the kitchen?)

1631
01:11:07,622 --> 01:11:09,923
- He's so cute.
- You guys have two stoves.

1632
01:11:09,923 --> 01:11:12,263
- That's nice.
- Yes, we do. Don't worry.

1633
01:11:12,963 --> 01:11:14,933
I customized them.

1634
01:11:14,933 --> 01:11:17,093
(She even puts on an apron.)

1635
01:11:17,433 --> 01:11:21,732
Mother is really good at making kimchi dumplings.

1636
01:11:21,732 --> 01:11:25,473
- I'm not that good.
- Her children love it.

1637
01:11:25,473 --> 01:11:26,603
(Dumplings sound delicious.)

1638
01:11:26,603 --> 01:11:29,143
I'll season everything. You guys can stir-fry it.

1639
01:11:29,143 --> 01:11:32,143
Once that's done, I'll mix it together and make it.

1640
01:11:32,143 --> 01:11:33,183
Should I start now?

1641
01:11:33,183 --> 01:11:36,482
Should we have dumpling soup if you make them?

1642
01:11:36,482 --> 01:11:37,982
Okay. Let's do that.

1643
01:11:38,883 --> 01:11:42,452
(Young Ok is making dumpling soup for the family.)

1644
01:11:42,753 --> 01:11:44,862
Are you sure it's not too tight?

1645
01:11:44,862 --> 01:11:47,093
Yes. It's okay.

1646
01:11:47,362 --> 01:11:48,763
Is this okay?

1647
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:51,263
- It's fine whichever way.
- Give it to me.

1648
01:11:51,263 --> 01:11:53,032
(He ties it into a ribbon.)

1649
01:11:53,032 --> 01:11:54,103
Thank you.

1650
01:11:55,003 --> 01:11:57,433
There are gloves on the apron. It's attached with Velcro.

1651
01:11:57,532 --> 01:11:58,742
- I see.
- You can use it for hot pots.

1652
01:11:58,742 --> 01:12:00,702
I see. Goodness. Is that how you made it?

1653
01:12:00,702 --> 01:12:01,713
Yes, I customized them.

1654
01:12:02,742 --> 01:12:05,213
(Young Ok begins to get ready to cook.)

1655
01:12:05,213 --> 01:12:06,513
We have to cut it up fast.

1656
01:12:07,412 --> 01:12:11,013
Youngest, set the cutting board up.

1657
01:12:11,423 --> 01:12:12,482
Okay.

1658
01:12:12,482 --> 01:12:13,683
This is kimchi.

1659
01:12:15,223 --> 01:12:16,423
Is this ground meat?

1660
01:12:16,423 --> 01:12:18,162
(The youngest pulls out the meat.)

1661
01:12:18,523 --> 01:12:21,292
Cut it with a pair of scissors if you want to do it fast.

1662
01:12:21,292 --> 01:12:22,662
(He cuts it open so that she can take it out quickly.)

1663
01:12:23,093 --> 01:12:24,832
(He takes out the seasoning in advance too.)

1664
01:12:24,832 --> 01:12:25,902
Salt.

1665
01:12:26,532 --> 01:12:28,433
- Okay.
- Do you have a frying pan?

1666
01:12:28,433 --> 01:12:29,433
Yes.

1667
01:12:30,003 --> 01:12:31,273
Do you want me to turn on the stove?

1668
01:12:31,273 --> 01:12:32,343
Hold on.

1669
01:12:32,942 --> 01:12:36,143
I'm going to put your sunglasses up here too.

1670
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:38,542
- Okay. As long as I can find them.
- Okay.

1671
01:12:39,082 --> 01:12:40,912
If she forgets them, you can keep them.

1672
01:12:40,912 --> 01:12:41,912
(Joking)

1673
01:12:42,582 --> 01:12:45,383
(She has fun as she prepares, thanks to the three brothers.)

1674
01:12:46,582 --> 01:12:48,093
I can't make a lot.

1675
01:12:49,192 --> 01:12:50,492
What kind of knife do you want?

1676
01:12:51,292 --> 01:12:52,423
Just give me that.

1677
01:12:52,423 --> 01:12:56,093
We bought this knife at a traditional market.

1678
01:12:56,093 --> 01:12:59,532
(Oh, really?)

1679
01:13:00,133 --> 01:13:02,232
(She cuts off the end of the kimchi firsts.)

1680
01:13:02,232 --> 01:13:03,872
Gosh, the knife works well.

1681
01:13:05,242 --> 01:13:08,612
We don't have much time, so I can't make a lot.

1682
01:13:09,412 --> 01:13:12,542
- It takes too long to cut it small.
- Right.

1683
01:13:12,542 --> 01:13:16,582
(Chopping)

1684
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:23,423
(A heap of kimchi)

1685
01:13:24,452 --> 01:13:26,963
(It looks like a little too much.)

1686
01:13:27,122 --> 01:13:28,963
Is this too much kimchi?

1687
01:13:28,963 --> 01:13:29,992
(Is this too much?)

1688
01:13:29,992 --> 01:13:32,232
You need this much to be full, right?

1689
01:13:32,232 --> 01:13:33,263
Right.

1690
01:13:33,263 --> 01:13:36,332
(This time, it's the meat.)

1691
01:13:37,603 --> 01:13:39,973
(Is this enough?)

1692
01:13:39,973 --> 01:13:42,042
(A little more?)

1693
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:45,412
(Thinking...)

1694
01:13:45,412 --> 01:13:48,282
(This will be the last one.)

1695
01:13:48,282 --> 01:13:50,553
(Just kidding.)

1696
01:13:51,183 --> 01:13:54,923
(She's making a tower of meat.)

1697
01:13:55,152 --> 01:13:59,093
(She's even using a lot of meat.)

1698
01:13:59,093 --> 01:14:00,563
(She adds a ton of...)

1699
01:14:00,563 --> 01:14:02,792
(mung bean sprouts too.)

1700
01:14:04,702 --> 01:14:07,133
(That's enough to feed 8 people.)

1701
01:14:07,232 --> 01:14:10,032
Should I take out 1 pack of tofu? We have 2.

1702
01:14:10,372 --> 01:14:11,572
We need two.

1703
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:13,473
(No, take out two packs.)

1704
01:14:13,872 --> 01:14:16,313
Can we use a small frying pan?

1705
01:14:16,412 --> 01:14:18,143
- No. We need a big one.
- We need a big one?

1706
01:14:18,582 --> 01:14:21,183
I don't know. I'm going to make it casually,

1707
01:14:21,452 --> 01:14:22,952
so enjoy them with your strong teeth.

1708
01:14:23,412 --> 01:14:26,723
(This is Young Ok's idea of being casual.)

1709
01:14:26,723 --> 01:14:29,093
We'll just have to do with what we have.

1710
01:14:31,463 --> 01:14:32,963
How many skins should I make?

1711
01:14:33,923 --> 01:14:36,032
I think you'll need to make at least 50.

1712
01:14:36,032 --> 01:14:37,263
Did you say 50?

1713
01:14:37,263 --> 01:14:38,603
Will someone else be joining us?

1714
01:14:38,633 --> 01:14:40,963
(Will someone else be joining us?)

1715
01:14:41,303 --> 01:14:43,572
(We're having a dumpling party tonight!)

1716
01:14:43,773 --> 01:14:47,143
(Meanwhile, they get ready to make the dumpling skins outside.)

1717
01:14:47,702 --> 01:14:50,673
(He sprinkles flour and makes space for the dough to lay down on.)

1718
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:54,313
When you sprinkle it, you need to use your wrist. Look.

1719
01:14:55,713 --> 01:14:59,023
(Flinching)

1720
01:14:59,782 --> 01:15:02,853
(They begin rolling the dough.)

1721
01:15:03,053 --> 01:15:06,563
(Pushing)

1722
01:15:06,563 --> 01:15:09,463
(She sees them.)

1723
01:15:10,192 --> 01:15:12,662
(Hold on...)

1724
01:15:13,662 --> 01:15:15,532
Are you just rolling them like that?

1725
01:15:15,702 --> 01:15:16,702
How should we do it?

1726
01:15:16,702 --> 01:15:18,003
(Surprised)

1727
01:15:18,473 --> 01:15:21,412
I was going to tell you to cut it up, but it's fine. Go ahead.

1728
01:15:21,673 --> 01:15:22,673
Okay.

1729
01:15:22,673 --> 01:15:24,643
(Okay.)

1730
01:15:26,013 --> 01:15:29,053
(They feel someone staring at them from behind.)

1731
01:15:29,053 --> 01:15:32,183
Why would you roll the dough out like that?

1732
01:15:32,183 --> 01:15:33,423
(Goodness.)

1733
01:15:33,622 --> 01:15:37,753
(Obedient)

1734
01:15:38,162 --> 01:15:41,023
(Mother is watching us!)

1735
01:15:41,492 --> 01:15:43,393
The thinner it is, the better!

1736
01:15:44,633 --> 01:15:46,862
- She said the thinner, the better.
- Okay!

1737
01:15:47,402 --> 01:15:49,173
Make sure it's not too thin that it would rip.

1738
01:15:49,173 --> 01:15:50,173
Okay.

1739
01:15:50,572 --> 01:15:53,773
- Sprinkle flour as you go.
- Okay.

1740
01:15:54,713 --> 01:15:55,942
We'll make it as thin as possible.

1741
01:15:55,942 --> 01:15:57,982
(Doing their best)

1742
01:15:58,742 --> 01:16:00,982
(Shall we take a look?)

1743
01:16:01,588 --> 01:16:02,828
We'll make it as thin as possible.

1744
01:16:02,828 --> 01:16:04,857
(Doing their best)

1745
01:16:05,557 --> 01:16:07,498
(Shall we take a look?)

1746
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:12,097
(Tattered)

1747
01:16:12,097 --> 01:16:13,998
(Glancing)

1748
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:19,237
(It's not a piece of paper.)

1749
01:16:19,538 --> 01:16:22,578
There's nothing more to do.

1750
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,807
(Dong Il's dough is nice and flat.)

1751
01:16:24,147 --> 01:16:25,618
Is this thin enough?

1752
01:16:26,347 --> 01:16:27,517
(Laughing)

1753
01:16:27,517 --> 01:16:28,947
Can you cut off a piece and give it to me?

1754
01:16:29,888 --> 01:16:32,017
Really? Is it too thin?

1755
01:16:33,418 --> 01:16:34,788
- It's perfect.
- Is it?

1756
01:16:34,788 --> 01:16:35,958
It's not too thin.

1757
01:16:36,057 --> 01:16:39,057
(Triumphant)

1758
01:16:39,197 --> 01:16:40,397
Should we roll it from each side?

1759
01:16:40,397 --> 01:16:41,628
(Should we roll it from each side?)

1760
01:16:41,868 --> 01:16:43,668
Don't try to piggyback on my success!

1761
01:16:43,998 --> 01:16:45,168
It's not that, Dong Il...

1762
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:47,968
(He's happy after getting praised.)

1763
01:16:47,968 --> 01:16:48,968
- Over here.
- Okay.

1764
01:16:49,168 --> 01:16:51,977
Do we have a metal bowl? Hey. What about this?

1765
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:54,138
- That's good.
- Gosh, this is...

1766
01:16:54,138 --> 01:16:55,548
(This is perfect.)

1767
01:16:55,708 --> 01:16:57,008
Dong Il. What about this?

1768
01:16:57,647 --> 01:16:59,248
- It's perfect.
- This.

1769
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:00,777
(They're going to cut it with the kettle lid?)

1770
01:17:00,777 --> 01:17:03,347
Isn't it too small? It looks a bit small to me.

1771
01:17:03,347 --> 01:17:04,487
But this is all we have.

1772
01:17:05,557 --> 01:17:06,788
This is the big one.

1773
01:17:07,588 --> 01:17:08,687
- Show me the big one.
- Let me see.

1774
01:17:09,128 --> 01:17:10,157
Isn't this too big?

1775
01:17:10,157 --> 01:17:12,557
- Let me see it.
- Won't these dumplings be huge?

1776
01:17:12,557 --> 01:17:14,397
Should we make big dumplings or small dumplings?

1777
01:17:15,428 --> 01:17:18,767
We only have these two to cut the dumpling skins with.

1778
01:17:19,567 --> 01:17:21,708
- This one's big. Use this.
- Okay.

1779
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:24,607
- We can make it big and cut it.
- Right.

1780
01:17:25,237 --> 01:17:27,038
We'll make all the dumpling skins in no time.

1781
01:17:27,578 --> 01:17:29,147
We'll be done after we stamp it three times.

1782
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:32,517
- We'll be done after three times.
- No. Since they're big dumplings,

1783
01:17:32,517 --> 01:17:34,748
we'll be full after two dumplings.

1784
01:17:35,888 --> 01:17:36,947
Two?

1785
01:17:37,748 --> 01:17:39,718
You'll eat at least five.

1786
01:17:39,718 --> 01:17:42,258
We can divide it up. Since they're big dumplings...

1787
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:43,657
(We're in trouble.)

1788
01:17:44,357 --> 01:17:45,958
We need to divide it up.

1789
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:48,267
How should we cut it to get the most out of this?

1790
01:17:48,267 --> 01:17:49,368
(How can we cut the most skins?)

1791
01:17:49,368 --> 01:17:52,298
(It looks like it needs a mathematical approach.)

1792
01:17:52,298 --> 01:17:53,298
Like this.

1793
01:17:54,338 --> 01:17:56,008
- Let's try to...
- Yes?

1794
01:17:56,008 --> 01:17:57,008
(They try to cut the dumpling skins.)

1795
01:17:57,008 --> 01:17:58,138
divide it up the best we can.

1796
01:17:58,508 --> 01:18:02,307
(He starts by getting as close to the edge of the dough as possible.)

1797
01:18:02,307 --> 01:18:05,477
(Pressing)

1798
01:18:06,378 --> 01:18:08,487
(Exclaiming)

1799
01:18:09,487 --> 01:18:12,657
(The thin and round shape makes them exclaim.)

1800
01:18:13,557 --> 01:18:15,388
(Ta-da)

1801
01:18:15,388 --> 01:18:16,857
It's perfect. Isn't it?

1802
01:18:16,857 --> 01:18:18,128
(The first dumpling skin is done.)

1803
01:18:18,128 --> 01:18:19,128
That's perfect.

1804
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:22,067
- Isn't it perfect, Mother?
- That's not even that big.

1805
01:18:23,128 --> 01:18:25,767
Is it just a bit big?

1806
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:27,498
Mother, can you compliment me?

1807
01:18:29,067 --> 01:18:31,208
- Mother?
- This is perfect.

1808
01:18:31,678 --> 01:18:32,678
Mother?

1809
01:18:32,678 --> 01:18:33,777
(He calls her in vain.)

1810
01:18:33,777 --> 01:18:35,178
I'll tell you where to cut it.

1811
01:18:35,178 --> 01:18:36,578
(This time, it's Hee Won's turn.)

1812
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:39,048
(Focusing)

1813
01:18:39,418 --> 01:18:41,178
So that I don't even leave 1mm.

1814
01:18:42,048 --> 01:18:43,317
(Grunting)

1815
01:18:43,817 --> 01:18:45,187
Did you study electronic engineering?

1816
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:47,157
Gosh, look at this.

1817
01:18:47,157 --> 01:18:48,987
- That's incredible.
- That's right.

1818
01:18:49,588 --> 01:18:50,828
(Hee Won successfully makes a pretty dumpling skin.)

1819
01:18:50,828 --> 01:18:51,958
You're very good.

1820
01:18:53,397 --> 01:18:55,227
(He places it diagonally so that it doesn't overlap.)

1821
01:18:55,227 --> 01:18:56,397
That's incredible.

1822
01:18:56,397 --> 01:18:59,298
How did Hee Won make it look so beautiful?

1823
01:19:00,298 --> 01:19:03,368
(This is the Young Ok Effect.)

1824
01:19:03,567 --> 01:19:05,078
- If you look at it...
- If you cut it here...

1825
01:19:05,078 --> 01:19:07,708
- We can get more out of that.
- Right. It's right here.

1826
01:19:07,708 --> 01:19:11,078
(With the determination to waste nothing...)

1827
01:19:13,378 --> 01:19:14,618
Okay.

1828
01:19:14,618 --> 01:19:16,487
(They cut each piece with the mind of a master.)

1829
01:19:17,847 --> 01:19:18,987
(Round)

1830
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:21,288
- There's nothing more to say.
- I know.

1831
01:19:22,687 --> 01:19:24,628
We won't be wasting anything.

1832
01:19:24,628 --> 01:19:26,557
(Proud)

1833
01:19:26,657 --> 01:19:28,057
(The dough that was as big as the table...)

1834
01:19:28,968 --> 01:19:31,298
- You and I are on a roll today.
- I know.

1835
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:33,798
We don't usually have such good teamwork.

1836
01:19:34,338 --> 01:19:35,767
(The dumpling skins have piled up in no time.)

1837
01:19:35,767 --> 01:19:37,368
We have plenty of dumpling skins.

1838
01:19:38,008 --> 01:19:40,437
Let's use this to make sujebi.

1839
01:19:40,437 --> 01:19:42,807
(They're using the remaining dough as sujebi.)

1840
01:19:43,107 --> 01:19:44,878
(Proud)

1841
01:19:44,878 --> 01:19:46,947
Since we decided on big dumplings,

1842
01:19:46,947 --> 01:19:50,218
we'll need quite a bit of filling.

1843
01:19:53,857 --> 01:19:57,227
(He's used to this.)

1844
01:19:57,687 --> 01:20:00,557
(She's busy making the stuffing for the dumplings.)

1845
01:20:01,328 --> 01:20:04,428
(She stir-fries the seasoned meat on high heat.)

1846
01:20:04,727 --> 01:20:07,368
Gosh, that smell. It smells incredible.

1847
01:20:08,097 --> 01:20:10,607
- What does?
- The smell coming from there.

1848
01:20:10,607 --> 01:20:11,807
It's the smell of meat.

1849
01:20:12,138 --> 01:20:13,578
(Laughing)

1850
01:20:14,378 --> 01:20:15,508
- Hey.
- Yes?

1851
01:20:15,508 --> 01:20:17,607
Give me your hand. It's a bit hot.

1852
01:20:17,607 --> 01:20:19,718
(Try some of this.)

1853
01:20:19,718 --> 01:20:20,718
Try it.

1854
01:20:20,718 --> 01:20:22,947
(Eating)

1855
01:20:22,947 --> 01:20:24,647
How is it? Is it salty?

1856
01:20:25,357 --> 01:20:26,657
It's a bit salty.

1857
01:20:26,657 --> 01:20:29,458
That's perfect then. I'm not going to season the tofu.

1858
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:35,397
(The meat is good as is.)

1859
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:40,168
(She only added the meat, but it's already filled.)

1860
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:42,267
(She adds the spicy stir-fried kimchi.)

1861
01:20:42,267 --> 01:20:44,807
(Savory tofu)

1862
01:20:44,807 --> 01:20:45,838
So...

1863
01:20:45,838 --> 01:20:46,977
(Excuse me.)

1864
01:20:46,977 --> 01:20:49,008
(Ripping)

1865
01:20:50,248 --> 01:20:51,508
It's a bit salty, but that's okay.

1866
01:20:51,508 --> 01:20:53,447
(He picks up the pot with the gloves he borrowed from Young Ok.)

1867
01:20:53,447 --> 01:20:56,447
(Lastly, he rinses the blanched mung bean sprouts with cold water.)

1868
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,458
I think I can add all of it.

1869
01:21:01,218 --> 01:21:04,458
(She puts everything together and mixes it up to finish.)

1870
01:21:04,987 --> 01:21:08,097
This is pretty much a meat and kimchi dumpling.

1871
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,527
I tend to add a lot of meat to my dumplings.

1872
01:21:11,397 --> 01:21:13,197
- Have a taste. Is it salty?
- Don't worry.

1873
01:21:13,197 --> 01:21:16,107
(She has another son taste it this time.)

1874
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:19,508
- Is it good?
- Yes. It's very good.

1875
01:21:20,678 --> 01:21:22,607
(Thank goodness.)

1876
01:21:22,607 --> 01:21:23,878
I was going to hit you if you said it tasted bad.

1877
01:21:23,878 --> 01:21:26,277
No. It's very good.

1878
01:21:26,918 --> 01:21:28,147
(The dumpling stuffing has been mixed well.)

1879
01:21:28,147 --> 01:21:30,718
It's okay. Goodness.

1880
01:21:30,718 --> 01:21:32,487
(Exclaiming)

1881
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:33,487
Goodness.

1882
01:21:33,487 --> 01:21:34,758
(Finished)

1883
01:21:34,758 --> 01:21:36,057
(She pats it for extra flavor.)

1884
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:37,088
- Give it here, Mother.
- Is it ready?

1885
01:21:37,088 --> 01:21:39,557
Give it to Hee Won. There.

1886
01:21:39,557 --> 01:21:41,428
(It's Young Ok's delicious dumpling stuffing.)

1887
01:21:41,428 --> 01:21:43,798
- It's a bit cold.
- I can do it if I want.

1888
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:44,868
Goodness.

1889
01:21:44,868 --> 01:21:46,067
(The entire family gathers to make dumplings.)

1890
01:21:46,205 --> 01:21:48,105
- It's a bit cold.
- I can do it if I want.

1891
01:21:48,105 --> 01:21:50,105
- Goodness.
- This is...

1892
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:53,646
I didn't add anything other than meat.

1893
01:21:53,905 --> 01:21:55,846
- It's meat and kimchi dumplings.
- Right.

1894
01:21:56,915 --> 01:21:59,445
Is this how you do it?

1895
01:22:00,445 --> 01:22:03,655
- Like this.
- You already made a pretty one.

1896
01:22:04,315 --> 01:22:06,785
How cute.

1897
01:22:07,325 --> 01:22:08,756
How did you scoop it up without a spoon?

1898
01:22:08,756 --> 01:22:10,155
I just grabbed some with my hand.

1899
01:22:12,195 --> 01:22:14,926
(I should hurry up and make some too.)

1900
01:22:15,126 --> 01:22:17,195
You guys made it like a wrapping cloth.

1901
01:22:17,195 --> 01:22:18,665
(She's satisfied.)

1902
01:22:19,636 --> 01:22:22,205
(She takes the dumpling skin as nice as a wrapping cloth,)

1903
01:22:22,205 --> 01:22:26,405
(and fills it with the stuffing.)

1904
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,745
Gosh, I'm so greedy.

1905
01:22:28,745 --> 01:22:31,945
Since we have so much stuffing, I keep wanting to put more.

1906
01:22:32,915 --> 01:22:34,785
How many spoonfuls of this did you put in?

1907
01:22:34,785 --> 01:22:35,915
Two spoonfuls?

1908
01:22:36,455 --> 01:22:38,086
There are no correct measurements.

1909
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:39,926
Just put in as much as you want.

1910
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:43,495
- If you put in a lot...
- Yes?

1911
01:22:44,195 --> 01:22:48,296
(She seals the edges well so that the stuffing doesn't come out.)

1912
01:22:48,896 --> 01:22:50,495
This is how you make big dumplings.

1913
01:22:52,365 --> 01:22:54,636
- If you put in a lot...
- Yes?

1914
01:22:56,376 --> 01:22:58,506
We used to make dumplings like this back in the day.

1915
01:22:58,846 --> 01:22:59,976
I see.

1916
01:22:59,976 --> 01:23:01,745
This is a big dumpling.

1917
01:23:02,115 --> 01:23:04,676
(Proud)

1918
01:23:04,676 --> 01:23:06,016
Right. It's good to make it like this.

1919
01:23:06,016 --> 01:23:08,716
(Young Ok's dumpling is as round as a fist.)

1920
01:23:09,315 --> 01:23:11,756
We used to buy the dumpling skins.

1921
01:23:11,756 --> 01:23:13,226
(Myoung tries to make a big dumpling like Young Ok did.)

1922
01:23:13,226 --> 01:23:15,155
You need to put in a lot of stuffing for it to taste good.

1923
01:23:15,155 --> 01:23:17,525
You can't put a lot in that small skin.

1924
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:18,626
(I should put some more in.)

1925
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:19,695
Right?

1926
01:23:20,466 --> 01:23:23,596
(Adding a lot)

1927
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:27,405
Everything in this has already been cooked, so you can just eat it.

1928
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:29,705
You freeze the dumplings?

1929
01:23:29,705 --> 01:23:31,705
- Yes. You can freeze it...
- Oh, my.

1930
01:23:31,705 --> 01:23:33,075
and make potstickers later.

1931
01:23:33,075 --> 01:23:34,146
(Eating the fallen pieces)

1932
01:23:34,146 --> 01:23:37,046
(Glancing)

1933
01:23:37,775 --> 01:23:39,285
Is the stuffing good?

1934
01:23:39,285 --> 01:23:40,516
- Yes.
- Is it still okay?

1935
01:23:42,115 --> 01:23:45,985
(He carefully makes his dumpling in the way Young Ok taught him.)

1936
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:48,325
Oh, like that?

1937
01:23:48,325 --> 01:23:50,195
Right. You can do whatever you like.

1938
01:23:50,195 --> 01:23:52,825
- It looks like a throne.
- You can do it like that.

1939
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:55,296
(He doesn't use a spoon.)

1940
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:57,596
(He scoops up the stuffing with his hands.)

1941
01:23:58,096 --> 01:23:59,735
Oh, it came out.

1942
01:23:59,735 --> 01:24:03,176
(His lips show how focused he is.)

1943
01:24:04,376 --> 01:24:06,676
You don't need to cook the tofu, so I just added it in.

1944
01:24:06,676 --> 01:24:08,815
That's mung bean sprouts.

1945
01:24:09,876 --> 01:24:11,415
You guys are all very good.

1946
01:24:12,146 --> 01:24:13,846
You guys must've all done this.

1947
01:24:13,846 --> 01:24:14,945
(Whose dumplings will taste best?)

1948
01:24:15,886 --> 01:24:17,915
(The family doesn't realize how much time has passed...)

1949
01:24:17,915 --> 01:24:20,025
(while they make the dumplings.)

1950
01:24:22,096 --> 01:24:27,226
(The sun begins to set at the buckwheat field.)

1951
01:24:27,226 --> 01:24:29,195
Do you want a blanket?

1952
01:24:29,495 --> 01:24:30,865
This works too.

1953
01:24:31,136 --> 01:24:33,506
Pardon? Do you want a blanket, Mother?

1954
01:24:33,506 --> 01:24:34,705
- Do you want a blanket?
- Not right now.

1955
01:24:34,705 --> 01:24:36,836
Why would I want a blanket when it's so hot?

1956
01:24:37,336 --> 01:24:38,506
Not right now.

1957
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:40,546
Why would I want a blanket when it's so hot?

1958
01:24:41,905 --> 01:24:43,945
Mother, you're quite an angry person.

1959
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:45,745
Of course, I am.

1960
01:24:45,745 --> 01:24:49,315
(Teasing my son is so much fun.)

1961
01:24:49,315 --> 01:24:51,985
I'm going to leave the blanket behind you.

1962
01:24:51,985 --> 01:24:54,025
Okay. Leave it there. I'll use it later when I get cold.

1963
01:24:54,025 --> 01:24:55,186
(Her son is the only one who thinks about her.)

1964
01:24:55,426 --> 01:24:57,596
Gosh, it's been a while since I did this, and I'm doing so poorly.

1965
01:24:58,766 --> 01:25:00,926
I'm not fast either.

1966
01:25:01,426 --> 01:25:03,796
You made everything so quickly.

1967
01:25:04,296 --> 01:25:06,806
I managed to do it quickly because you helped me.

1968
01:25:07,565 --> 01:25:09,836
- I'm worried as I make this.
- Why?

1969
01:25:10,006 --> 01:25:12,306
What if it bursts and tastes bad?

1970
01:25:13,306 --> 01:25:14,976
It'll be good no matter what.

1971
01:25:15,205 --> 01:25:16,615
I'm just doing what I always did.

1972
01:25:16,976 --> 01:25:19,546
I don't know any secrets to make it taste better than others.

1973
01:25:19,546 --> 01:25:22,016
My family enjoys it, so I guess it's good.

1974
01:25:22,016 --> 01:25:23,516
(She made it the way her family eats it without a special recipe.)

1975
01:25:23,516 --> 01:25:26,155
This is enough for five people.

1976
01:25:26,586 --> 01:25:27,586
Pardon?

1977
01:25:27,586 --> 01:25:30,096
- This is enough for five people.
- Of course.

1978
01:25:30,556 --> 01:25:32,266
We can always have some rice too.

1979
01:25:32,266 --> 01:25:34,096
You want to eat rice too?

1980
01:25:34,726 --> 01:25:38,495
(To ensure there will be enough for everyone...)

1981
01:25:38,636 --> 01:25:39,936
(He brought scaly hedgehog mushroom for their special guest, Young Ok.)

1982
01:25:39,936 --> 01:25:42,205
Gosh, it smells really good.

1983
01:25:43,336 --> 01:25:47,306
(He cuts it up so that the smell of the mushroom is released.)

1984
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:51,445
(He adds a lot of ingredients like beef and radishes...)

1985
01:25:52,016 --> 01:25:55,245
(and boils it together to make scaly hedgehog mushroom soup.)

1986
01:25:56,216 --> 01:25:58,686
(His scaly hedgehog mushroom soup made with his sincerity...)

1987
01:26:00,226 --> 01:26:04,426
(will be combined with the dumplings made by the whole family.)

1988
01:26:05,155 --> 01:26:08,025
(Does anyone want to try it too?)

1989
01:26:09,096 --> 01:26:10,896
Oh, is this buckwheat flower?

1990
01:26:11,235 --> 01:26:13,235
Gosh, this is nice.

1991
01:26:13,466 --> 01:26:17,075
They must get buckwheat honey here.

1992
01:26:17,075 --> 01:26:18,136
Right.

1993
01:26:18,846 --> 01:26:21,006
(The two men are in awe at the vast buckwheat field.)

1994
01:26:21,006 --> 01:26:22,075
This is so nice.

1995
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:26,716
It's a bit weird to walk this field with another man.

1996
01:26:28,115 --> 01:26:30,615
You need to hold hands in a field like this.

1997
01:26:30,615 --> 01:26:32,586
(Who are these two guests that are already chatty?)

1998
01:26:32,586 --> 01:26:34,556
- Chestnuts!
- Gosh, look at those chestnuts.

1999
01:26:35,226 --> 01:26:36,325
Try it like this.

2000
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,126
- Mother.
- Are you okay?

2001
01:26:38,155 --> 01:26:43,266
(Mother, the moon has risen.)

2002
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:46,205
- It's really big.
- Gosh, how pretty.

2003
01:26:46,205 --> 01:26:52,806
(The night at House on Wheels is heartwarming.)

2004
01:26:53,006 --> 01:26:56,046
(Thanks to her son and House on Wheels,)

2005
01:26:56,046 --> 01:26:59,046
(I was really happy.)

2006
01:26:59,846 --> 01:27:01,186
(Dong Il and Hee Won's friends came to visit.)

2007
01:27:01,186 --> 01:27:03,315
(Actors Kim Kwang Kyu and Shin Seung Hwan)

2008
01:27:03,315 --> 01:27:05,626
(Eating)

2009
01:27:05,626 --> 01:27:06,686
(Slurping)

2010
01:27:06,686 --> 01:27:08,426
(Seung Hwan eats all day.)

2011
01:27:08,426 --> 01:27:10,655
(Pulling)

2012
01:27:11,126 --> 01:27:12,796
(Two meals? Three meals?)

2013
01:27:12,796 --> 01:27:14,065
(Three servings for breakfast?)

2014
01:27:14,065 --> 01:27:17,136
(It's fun just seeing your friend enjoy his meal.)

2015
01:27:17,136 --> 01:27:19,235
(They may be clumsy,)

2016
01:27:19,235 --> 01:27:23,306
(but they're happy as they're together.)

2017
01:27:23,436 --> 01:27:26,575
(A bicycle ride to enjoy the autumn scenery)

2018
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:27,945
(Good. Let's ride!)

2019
01:27:28,846 --> 01:27:30,976
(The wind feels nice.)

2020
01:27:31,115 --> 01:27:35,186
(Would you like to join them on the golden autumn trip?)
