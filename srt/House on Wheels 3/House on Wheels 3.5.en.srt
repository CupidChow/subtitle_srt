1
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:27,753
(Last spring,)

2
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:33,017
(Na Ra, the special guest, visited House on Wheels.)

3
00:00:33,352 --> 00:00:36,063
(A married couple in a drama)

4
00:00:36,363 --> 00:00:41,093
(Na Ra's handmade gift...)

5
00:00:41,363 --> 00:00:45,403
(made Hee Won dance.)

6
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:49,242
(Fun Na Ra's dance...)

7
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:53,643
(turned House on Wheels upside down.)

8
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:57,412
(Na Ra with the bright energy returns...)

9
00:00:57,882 --> 00:01:02,723
(with someone cuter than her.)

10
00:01:03,283 --> 00:01:06,493
(With fun Na Ra and cute Seung Ryong,)

11
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:10,022
(how amusing will the trip be?)

12
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:17,062
(The autumn rain wets the ground.)

13
00:01:17,463 --> 00:01:19,172
The house got much better.

14
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:21,972
I know. It looks more like a cabin.

15
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:22,972
(They hit the road with a welcome guest.)

16
00:01:23,172 --> 00:01:25,312
How long has it been since my wife came here?

17
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:28,942
Your wife? About six months ago, no?

18
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:31,042
Six months? You ran away from home. Did you like it?

19
00:01:31,043 --> 00:01:33,281
I did. It made me miss my house.

20
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:35,052
There's a rumor that you bring...

21
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,682
- A man?
- a man every time you step out.

22
00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:39,023
You bring the guys that you remarried.

23
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:41,452
Are you bringing someone today?

24
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:44,022
It's a man with a beard.

25
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:46,031
He has a beard this time?

26
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:47,992
Yes, a grey beard.

27
00:01:47,993 --> 00:01:50,002
(Her current husband will be joining them.)

28
00:01:52,232 --> 00:01:55,641
Myoung, you and I were in a TV series together.

29
00:01:55,642 --> 00:01:56,742
Do you remember?

30
00:01:56,743 --> 00:01:59,311
You remember that?

31
00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:00,972
Why wouldn't I?

32
00:02:01,543 --> 00:02:04,542
It was so short.

33
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:06,182
- And it was a one-act drama.
- I still remember.

34
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:08,111
Right. So you remember too.

35
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:10,653
- Yes, I do.
- How long has it been?

36
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:16,963
(They were in a one-act drama "The Happy Loner" in 2017.)

37
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:21,793
(They acted together in only one scene.)

38
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:24,361
- That's nice.
- Was it five years ago?

39
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:26,571
- Yes, it's been a while.
- It was about five years ago.

40
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:28,871
You've kept an eye on him since then?

41
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:31,702
He was so cute and acted really well.

42
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:34,871
I like junior actors who are good and friendly.

43
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:36,281
Though it was short,

44
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:38,983
I enjoyed the scene we were in together.

45
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:40,912
You must hate Hee Won.

46
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:43,182
He's very friendly.

47
00:02:43,183 --> 00:02:44,652
- Hee Won?
- Yes.

48
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:46,322
He rubs his hands very well.

49
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:48,992
- "I'm sorry, Na Ra." - Like a fly?

50
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:50,393
"It's my bad, Na Ra."

51
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:52,091
He is Kim Fly.

52
00:02:52,092 --> 00:02:53,162
(Kim Fly, 51 years old, Specialty: Apologizing)

53
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,403
- When Na Ra is here, - Yes?

54
00:02:56,863 --> 00:02:59,273
it feels like I'm adequately drunk.

55
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:01,902
She brings a heightened mood.

56
00:03:01,903 --> 00:03:03,703
- Because of her energy...
- Yes.

57
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:06,243
I haven't even started.

58
00:03:08,643 --> 00:03:11,311
This is my first time dragging the house behind us.

59
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:12,851
Connected to the car.

60
00:03:12,852 --> 00:03:15,251
- But I can't feel anything.
- Of course not.

61
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:16,583
I thought it'd be really heavy.

62
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:18,721
The car must feel the weight, not us.

63
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:20,222
The house follows so well.

64
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:23,661
(They're near the front yard in no time.)

65
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:28,592
The place we're going used to be a giant quarry.

66
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:32,332
It could have been abandoned looking ugly,

67
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,471
but they renovated the place for people to enjoy.

68
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:36,072
That's where we're going.

69
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:38,941
It's in trend these days. They remodel...

70
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:42,143
abandoned factories to make coffee shops.

71
00:03:43,143 --> 00:03:44,212
That sounds nice.

72
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:45,243
(Looking forward to it)

73
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:49,282
(They go deeper into the woods.)

74
00:03:50,282 --> 00:03:51,552
(A giant building ahead of them?)

75
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:53,192
The scenery is amazing.

76
00:03:54,523 --> 00:03:57,662
It's an abandoned mine right there.

77
00:03:57,893 --> 00:03:58,893
That one?

78
00:03:58,894 --> 00:04:00,893
Yes, the quarry isn't used right now.

79
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:02,862
(The giant quarry is at the entrance.)

80
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:04,332
This used to be a quarry.

81
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,803
(The giant quarry is at the entrance.)

82
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:11,142
Why does that heavy vehicle...

83
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:12,273
look like a toy?

84
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:14,941
- That must be for display.
- Right?

85
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:16,282
(Past the yellow heavy vehicle for display)

86
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:20,113
A lake.

87
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:22,023
It's beautiful.

88
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:23,652
It's amazing.

89
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:25,281
- It's gorgeous.
- Totally.

90
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:26,321
This is insane.

91
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:27,792
(What does the front yard that put them in awe look like?)

92
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:33,233
(Hidden among Taebaek Mountains is this mysterious place.)

93
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:35,802
(Today's front yard is...)

94
00:04:36,263 --> 00:04:37,732
(by the emerald waters.)

95
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:41,273
(Donghae Mureung Quarry)

96
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:46,213
(The lake that holds the sky by the front yard...)

97
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:50,643
(shows off its gemlike colors made by the limestone.)

98
00:04:51,412 --> 00:04:54,982
(As you glance into the magnificent view created by water and light,)

99
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:59,153
(you might fall in love with someone.)

100
00:04:59,953 --> 00:05:03,693
(The largest limestone quarry in the country)

101
00:05:04,193 --> 00:05:07,963
(It was to be abandoned when the mining work ended in 2017.)

102
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:12,472
(They planted trees and flowers again...)

103
00:05:12,932 --> 00:05:16,443
(to bring beautiful nature...)

104
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:20,472
(back to the abandoned quarry.)

105
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:23,643
(As peaceful as the gentle waves,)

106
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,341
(it's today's front yard, Donghae Mureung Quarry.)

107
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:27,883
- This place is so...
- It's gorgeous.

108
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:29,912
I really want to go inside.

109
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,821
The mountain and the lake share the same color.

110
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:36,890
It's beautiful like decalcomania.

111
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:39,060
(Decalcomania presented by the transparent lake)

112
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:41,165
This used to be a quarry, so...

113
00:05:41,564 --> 00:05:44,464
- there're limestones in the area.
- Yes?

114
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:46,934
On a clear day, the lake...

115
00:05:46,935 --> 00:05:50,234
- has an emerald color.
- It's so green.

116
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:52,204
(The emerald color would have been brighter if the weather was clear.)

117
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,073
It still looks graceful without the sun.

118
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:58,114
Under this weather...

119
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:00,114
- It is graceful.
- Yes.

120
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:01,213
(The view by the lake still looks good when it's cloudy.)

121
00:06:01,214 --> 00:06:02,454
It's the most graceful.

122
00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:06,185
We have to park the car by the lake.

123
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,953
- We should.
- Here...

124
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:10,894
(Can I turn the car around there?)

125
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,764
I think it's too narrow.

126
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:15,865
Do you want me to get off and check?

127
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:18,194
- Yes.
- I don't think I can do it.

128
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:19,534
All right.

129
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:22,235
(Youngest goes.)

130
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:26,744
- It won't work, right?
- I think it will.

131
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:27,844
- I think you can do it.
- Do you?

132
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,943
- I can?
- Yes.

133
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:30,273
Keep turning?

134
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:31,345
Yes, there's room.

135
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:32,984
(He carefully turns his steering wheel.)

136
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:33,985
Is there room?

137
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:36,253
- Can I go through?
- I think so.

138
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:37,355
It's working.

139
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:39,125
You have enough room.

140
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:41,253
That one.

141
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:42,795
No, you've got enough room.

142
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:44,595
(I'm scared.)

143
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:47,164
Myoung is pretty careful.

144
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:50,165
(He safely turns the car around thanks to the careful clerk.)

145
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:53,304
You're a good driver.

146
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:55,234
- He is.
- Not everyone can do this.

147
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:56,875
You did it in one try.

148
00:06:57,805 --> 00:07:01,404
- It's raining, so wait at home.
- Right.

149
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:02,674
- At home?
- Yes.

150
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:05,375
- We should set this up.
- I'll help.

151
00:07:05,745 --> 00:07:06,813
Let me help.

152
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:09,354
You would help us while wearing that wool shirt? What if you get wet?

153
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:10,454
With the wool flying around.

154
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:13,453
(Revisiting House on Wheels after 6 months)

155
00:07:13,454 --> 00:07:14,954
Did you change the interior design?

156
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:16,994
I'll open the door for you.

157
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:18,153
Thanks.

158
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:19,523
- No.
- No.

159
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:21,823
(Open sesame!)

160
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:23,563
There's a key.

161
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:24,595
(We have to unlock it first.)

162
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:27,104
I tried using my strength.

163
00:07:27,105 --> 00:07:28,333
Just wait inside.

164
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:29,474
(Wool Shirt, wait inside.)

165
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:31,503
- Don't get rain on you.
- But I want to help.

166
00:07:31,504 --> 00:07:34,644
Since it's raining, let's set up the tarp first.

167
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:38,245
- How did you change it inside?
- Go on in.

168
00:07:39,384 --> 00:07:41,615
Oh, my knees.

169
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:44,754
- What changed?
- It changed completely.

170
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,725
What changed? It's more spacious.

171
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:49,225
It's wider now.

172
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:50,253
(No, it's the same.)

173
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:52,095
No, it's not.

174
00:07:52,394 --> 00:07:53,464
There are two gas stoves.

175
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:55,494
(There were 2 of them in the 1st place.)

176
00:07:55,495 --> 00:07:57,465
- And...
- Check this out.

177
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:00,065
We added that.

178
00:08:00,465 --> 00:08:03,734
The ceiling is higher, so it's easier to sleep.

179
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:07,143
You're right. You have little windows up there.

180
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:08,144
Exactly.

181
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:11,575
And there have been small changes too.

182
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:13,144
- Really?
- Yes.

183
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:16,414
What else changed?

184
00:08:17,784 --> 00:08:22,125
(She opens the ingredient cupboard.)

185
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,095
(What did Na Ra find?)

186
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:31,695
The cutting board. They're still using my gifts.

187
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:32,934
(The cutting board that she made herself)

188
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:34,634
I drew them so well too.

189
00:08:36,404 --> 00:08:38,503
(Feeling proud to see them use her gift)

190
00:08:38,504 --> 00:08:39,504
It's well-made.

191
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:41,903
Why does this feel like my own house?

192
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:44,514
(Na Ra who's like family looks around on her own.)

193
00:08:45,144 --> 00:08:46,183
(Where's her next destination?)

194
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:47,315
This place reminds me.

195
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:50,855
It's so cozy.

196
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:52,955
It's tough to go in.

197
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:56,825
I can look outside.

198
00:08:57,924 --> 00:08:59,995
It's nice.

199
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:04,995
(Dong Il was setting things up in the front yard.)

200
00:09:08,365 --> 00:09:09,475
How do I get down?

201
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:12,774
What is she doing by herself?

202
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,375
How do I get down there?

203
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:17,013
Oh, no.

204
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,614
(Bumping her head)

205
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:19,884
(Bumping again)

206
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:21,144
(She can't seem to come down.)

207
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,245
I want to go down.

208
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:24,254
What are you doing?

209
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:27,585
How do I get down there?

210
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,225
You're so high-maintenance.

211
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,763
Hang on. What should I do?

212
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:35,023
Step on that.

213
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:36,533
- Yes. There.
- Is there a step?

214
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,064
- That's right.
- Oh, boy.

215
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:39,965
(She finds the stairs thanks to Dong Il.)

216
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:43,774
(She barely made it out.)

217
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:46,673
It's comfortable even though it's been a while, right?

218
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:48,804
- Yes, it feels like home.
- Right?

219
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:50,075
It feels like...

220
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:53,845
- I visited my own brother's house.
- Really?

221
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:55,384
Yes.

222
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,855
(Her brother feels proud.)

223
00:09:58,384 --> 00:09:59,884
It looks sturdy.

224
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,553
It's very sturdy.

225
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:02,894
(They set up the tarp to block the rain.)

226
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:06,594
- Do you want some coffee?
- I'd love that.

227
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:08,293
How quick-witted you are.

228
00:10:08,294 --> 00:10:09,763
(Shall we enjoy some coffee?)

229
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:11,164
This is nice.

230
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:14,464
The light rain feels nice.

231
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:17,104
I love this type of weather. I loved it since I was little.

232
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:19,773
I loved looking outside in my comforter...

233
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:21,745
- on a rainy day when I was a child.
- Right.

234
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:24,043
I hope it rains a little harder.

235
00:10:24,044 --> 00:10:25,375
That'd be the best.

236
00:10:25,945 --> 00:10:27,215
And we build a fire here.

237
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:29,485
It's got a good view.

238
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:31,784
(Thanks to the cloudy weather due to the drizzle,)

239
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:35,355
(they get to watch the raindrops hit the calm lake.)

240
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:39,565
(They're glad to see the autumn rain over the lake,)

241
00:10:40,495 --> 00:10:43,533
(but they'll be even more glad to see the new guest.)

242
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:45,194
We've all worked with Seung Ryong before,

243
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:47,433
so it wouldn't be that awkward.

244
00:10:47,434 --> 00:10:49,504
You're right. We've all worked with him before.

245
00:10:49,975 --> 00:10:52,404
He takes great care of his junior actors.

246
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:56,044
And I know Seung Ryong will bring a bunch of stuff for us.

247
00:10:58,014 --> 00:11:01,745
(A man approaches with the sound of wheels.)

248
00:11:02,184 --> 00:11:05,855
(He even brought a cart to carry his stuff.)

249
00:11:06,554 --> 00:11:07,884
(This is heavy.)

250
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:09,754
(Rolling down)

251
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:11,125
(Got it!)

252
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:13,263
(This man that looks like a porter is...)

253
00:11:13,264 --> 00:11:14,264
What's that?

254
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:15,894
(This man that looks like a porter is...)

255
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:19,434
(There has never been an actor like him.)

256
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:24,034
(The incredible presence that takes over the screen)

257
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:27,774
(He played the lead role in 4 movies that had over 10 million viewers.)

258
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:31,445
(The actor with the record of 40 million viewers)

259
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,514
(He looked for children with Dong Il in "Children...")

260
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:39,114
(He was on the drug squad with Myoung on "Extreme Job.")

261
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:44,195
(He was on the drug squad with Myoung on "Extreme Job.")

262
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:47,494
(And he was in a love triangle with Hee Won and Na Ra...)

263
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:49,835
(on "Perhaps Love.")

264
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:54,134
(Actor Ryu Seung Ryong who's welcomed by everyone is here.)

265
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:56,575
Is this it?

266
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,174
(He came to House on Wheels 3 with both hands full.)

267
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:03,414
(I'm here.)

268
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:07,715
(Glad to see him)

269
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:09,214
Seung Ryong, welcome.

270
00:12:09,215 --> 00:12:12,585
He hasn't changed. Look at all his stuff.

271
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:14,224
But...

272
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:17,393
(Doggy Myoung rushes over to greet him.)

273
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:18,954
- But...
- Why did you bring so much?

274
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:21,594
- What are all these?
- He brought kimchi.

275
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:23,834
(As Hee Won was greeting him,)

276
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:24,864
What's this?

277
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:27,465
(he pays attention to Seung Ryong's cart.)

278
00:12:28,034 --> 00:12:29,874
- Hello.
- What did you bring?

279
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,033
- I'm so happy to see you.
- You too.

280
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:33,204
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

281
00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:34,445
(Dong Il gives him a hug.)

282
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:36,474
What are all these?

283
00:12:36,475 --> 00:12:37,644
(These people are more curious about the cart.)

284
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:40,284
- Are you here to sell things?
- But...

285
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:42,384
- Are you here to sell?
- They're not all for you.

286
00:12:43,215 --> 00:12:44,814
It won't be Christmas anytime soon.

287
00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:45,954
(What presents did he bring?)

288
00:12:45,955 --> 00:12:47,023
Put these here.

289
00:12:47,024 --> 00:12:48,384
- I'll give you yours first.
- Me?

290
00:12:49,154 --> 00:12:50,893
I'm confused, so I have to hurry...

291
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:51,954
(Dong Il gets one first?)

292
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:53,024
and sort them.

293
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:55,465
(Rummaging through)

294
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:58,294
- You get the most gifts.
- Seung Ryong!

295
00:12:58,865 --> 00:12:59,964
(You didn't have to.)

296
00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:03,874
It's dishware for a family of five.

297
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,804
(He brought dishware for Dong Il's family.)

298
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:08,604
This is for you, Na Ra.

299
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:10,013
- You brought one for me too?
- Of course.

300
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:11,814
- Hee Won. Since you don't drink, - My goodness.

301
00:13:11,815 --> 00:13:12,913
- it's a tea set for one person.
- Thank you.

302
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:13,984
It's drinkware for liquor.

303
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:15,244
(He brought so many gifts.)

304
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:16,414
Gosh, this is so nice.

305
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:20,325
(Dishware for Na Ra who likes to decorate her dishes)

306
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:24,294
(A tea set for Hee Won who doesn't drink)

307
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,524
(Drinkware for the youngest who must be drinking often)

308
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:30,334
This is so pretty.

309
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:31,364
I know, right?

310
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:32,834
- You can use it for salad.
- Sure thing.

311
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:34,334
I didn't have a chance to say hello to your wife.

312
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,804
Gosh. Why did you prepare all these?

313
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:39,503
You should visit my place so we can use these.

314
00:13:39,504 --> 00:13:40,574
- I know.
- Right.

315
00:13:40,575 --> 00:13:42,874
- These are for each of you.
- My goodness.

316
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,673
And this is for the team.

317
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:45,913
- For the team?
- Right.

318
00:13:45,914 --> 00:13:46,984
- This is for the team?
- I see.

319
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:49,714
- I made it myself.
- You made it yourself?

320
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:51,214
Yes. So this is...

321
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:52,215
(He made it himself?)

322
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:54,484
So I made this myself.

323
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:55,824
(What is it that Seung Ryong made by himself?)

324
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:57,294
- It's a speaker.
- It's so pretty.

325
00:13:57,654 --> 00:13:58,894
I'm going to give this to the team.

326
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:02,164
- So you made it?
- Of course.

327
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:03,595
How can you make that?

328
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:07,504
(From leather crafting...)

329
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:13,845
(to pottery and carpentry,)

330
00:14:14,105 --> 00:14:16,375
(Seung Ryong has many talents.)

331
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:19,384
(He's especially into carpentry.)

332
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:23,914
(He makes practical wooden pieces such as chairs or desks.)

333
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:28,855
(He even makes art pieces too.)

334
00:14:29,654 --> 00:14:36,335
(He made the wooden speaker himself.)

335
00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:40,364
This suits the house as it's made of wood.

336
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:41,634
- Right.
- It does.

337
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:43,133
My goodness.

338
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:44,575
(It's precious as Seung Ryong put efforts in it.)

339
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:47,344
- You can pair Bluetooth like this.
- I see.

340
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,543
- It's so pretty.
- Try connecting it.

341
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:50,344
- Try it.
- Play something.

342
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:52,644
(He plays a song right away.)

343
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:56,414
- Gosh.
- It's nice, isn't it?

344
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:58,014
- It sounds...
- Gosh.

345
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:00,783
This is so high-tech.

346
00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:04,524
This wood and bronze texture go well together.

347
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,464
- This is so nice.
- I agree.

348
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:10,134
I'm going to leave this here too.

349
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:11,695
- Here?
- Yes.

350
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:17,375
(It's the table that he carried on his shoulder.)

351
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:19,474
(It's a table for a tea party where you can sit around together.)

352
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:21,444
- The wood is so beautiful.
- It's nice.

353
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:23,244
- You got a good one for this.
- I like things like this.

354
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:24,574
- With patterns like this.
- Right.

355
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:26,945
(It's a gift from Seung Ryong who loves tea and wood.)

356
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:30,514
(I love it.)

357
00:15:31,884 --> 00:15:33,585
Gosh, this is amazing.

358
00:15:33,784 --> 00:15:35,624
If you see here...

359
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,195
(Everyone is impressed by his amazing gift.)

360
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:39,893
- I want to have that speaker.
- I know, right?

361
00:15:39,894 --> 00:15:40,894
Right.

362
00:15:41,394 --> 00:15:44,565
(He's proud as everyone likes them.)

363
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:47,764
That's so cool. How could you bring such a gift?

364
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:50,903
(He looks around the house.)

365
00:15:50,904 --> 00:15:51,904
It's cozy, right?

366
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:53,605
- You can sleep up there too?
- Yes.

367
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:54,803
How do you go up there?

368
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:56,214
You should try going up there.

369
00:15:56,215 --> 00:15:58,074
- You can...
- I will...

370
00:15:58,075 --> 00:15:59,214
This is amazing.

371
00:15:59,215 --> 00:16:00,814
(Na Ra had a hard time coming down from the bunk bed.)

372
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:02,444
- This should be...
- Wait a second.

373
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:04,783
- My goodness.
- It's hard to go up there.

374
00:16:04,784 --> 00:16:07,153
(He takes off his jacket before going up.)

375
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:08,154
When you go up there...

376
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:11,695
(He jumps in.)

377
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:13,924
How can someone... You should have opened it earlier.

378
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:16,595
So this opens like that?

379
00:16:17,164 --> 00:16:19,393
It was like doing yoga when I tried going up there.

380
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:20,803
- There's another one there too.
- Right.

381
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:22,835
Try looking to your side from up there.

382
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,535
Gosh, this is so...

383
00:16:27,244 --> 00:16:28,643
- Isn't it nice?
- Nice. You would be able to see...

384
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:29,875
stars from here.

385
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:32,345
This is so beautiful.

386
00:16:33,515 --> 00:16:35,184
You're coming down so easily.

387
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:37,354
Of course. Gosh, my back hurts.

388
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:39,085
(My back hurts.)

389
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:41,285
(It's hilarious.)

390
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:42,483
This should be...

391
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:47,194
(Myoung has been watching Seung Ryong.)

392
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:50,535
- Try going up there too.
- You do it.

393
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:54,964
(He delivers coffee to Seung Ryong's seat.)

394
00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:57,933
- Like this?
- It's nice in here, right?

395
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,334
(He's hovering around Seung Ryong.)

396
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:01,305
- The rice is ready.
- The rice is ready!

397
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:03,413
Isn't this place so cute?

398
00:17:03,414 --> 00:17:05,815
(He's like a puppy waiting for his owner.)

399
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,344
You've lost a lot of weight.

400
00:17:08,345 --> 00:17:09,514
(Hugging)

401
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:11,213
Why are you hugging me from the back? This is awkward.

402
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:13,085
Gosh. You've become sneaky.

403
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,285
- You're tainted.
- By the variety shows?

404
00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:18,724
(Touching)

405
00:17:19,224 --> 00:17:20,364
This is so nice.

406
00:17:20,365 --> 00:17:21,424
- This place?
- Yes.

407
00:17:22,795 --> 00:17:24,163
Gosh.

408
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:27,065
(They sit and take a breather.)

409
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,704
- I've watched this show.
- I see.

410
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:33,044
I've seen the one with Tae Goo and Jung Se.

411
00:17:33,045 --> 00:17:34,774
- They didn't talk.
- They didn't!

412
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:36,974
- Don't talk if you don't want to.
- Really?

413
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:42,014
You know that I feel awkward when I'm on variety shows.

414
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:43,214
- Right.
- Up until now...

415
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:46,183
- I've done one with him.
- Right.

416
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:49,653
And the one where you guess songs.

417
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:50,795
(He's been on variety shows for a couple of times.)

418
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:54,265
It was full of...

419
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:55,864
I had to study...

420
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,633
and use my brain to answer the questions. It was so hard.

421
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:58,693
(Myoung called him when he was thinking about the show.)

422
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:00,604
While I was thinking about it, Myoung called me.

423
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:03,633
He said, "Seung Ryong." He's become sneaky.

424
00:18:03,634 --> 00:18:04,903
(He's shy now.)

425
00:18:04,904 --> 00:18:07,204
He said, "You should come to the show."

426
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:10,444
I went out for a shoot while thinking about it.

427
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:12,413
Then I ran into Hee Won.

428
00:18:12,414 --> 00:18:13,884
(He ran into Hee Won this time.)

429
00:18:14,515 --> 00:18:17,055
Then he talked me into this.

430
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:18,453
- He did?
- Yes.

431
00:18:18,454 --> 00:18:19,483
Hee Won did?

432
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:21,423
I told him to join us.

433
00:18:21,424 --> 00:18:24,795
Gosh, I didn't know he could do something like that.

434
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:28,265
You know what? You get better as you get older.

435
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,565
He used to have fierce eyes.

436
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:31,993
Right, I did back then.

437
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:34,564
He did. His eyes were so fierce back then.

438
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:35,834
- Really?
- Yes.

439
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:37,504
(He received attention with his fierce acting.)

440
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:39,133
(From the movie "War of the Arrows")

441
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:43,115
Now he got those wrinkles that make him look like he's smiling.

442
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:45,014
His eyes look much softer now.

443
00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:46,883
If you watch the movies that I was in back then,

444
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:49,755
- I look really fierce.
- Right. He really did.

445
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:52,924
I used to chew up rocks for snacks.

446
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:55,784
"Have some rocks. Here."

447
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:59,154
He ruined his health from using so much strength in acting.

448
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:00,794
He's one of the members who started "Nanta."

449
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:01,864
Right, I know.

450
00:19:01,865 --> 00:19:03,133
- That performance, you know.
- Right. I forgot about it.

451
00:19:03,134 --> 00:19:04,765
See? He says it hurts when I hit him like this.

452
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:06,865
Gosh, my shoulder.

453
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:09,404
It hurts even more since it's raining.

454
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:12,534
Gosh. He burst into laughter.

455
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:13,743
What's the matter?

456
00:19:13,744 --> 00:19:16,545
(Why did Hee Won suddenly burst into laughter?)

457
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,214
(While listening to Seung Ryong's silly jokes...)

458
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:22,115
(He had rocks as snacks?)

459
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,555
(He even acted while making jokes.)

460
00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:26,355
(Chuckling)

461
00:19:26,356 --> 00:19:30,194
(He bursts into laughter.)

462
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:33,723
Gosh, Seung Ryong. You said you won't talk at all.

463
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:34,993
Well, I was just...

464
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:36,094
(So who feels awkward on a variety show?)

465
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:38,193
- I can't stop talking.
- Right. You can't resist it.

466
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:40,004
- Gosh. How did Tae Goo...
- I think...

467
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:41,305
and Jung Se stay so quiet?

468
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:44,374
It'd be awkward not to say anything.

469
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,304
You can't stop talking.

470
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:47,305
You know, this is fun.

471
00:19:47,306 --> 00:19:49,574
Gosh. You're perfect for this.

472
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:51,744
It's been a while, and we're talking about the old days.

473
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:55,384
I think you're a variety-show material.

474
00:19:56,085 --> 00:19:59,654
(The lunchtime is coming as they laugh and chat.)

475
00:20:00,224 --> 00:20:02,953
- Did you have breakfast?
- You didn't, right?

476
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:04,594
I had a shake before coming here.

477
00:20:04,595 --> 00:20:05,693
- A shake?
- Yes.

478
00:20:05,694 --> 00:20:07,723
He's on a diet these days.

479
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:09,223
(Seung Ryong recently started going on a diet.)

480
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:12,264
He brought chicken breast for lunch.

481
00:20:12,265 --> 00:20:14,903
He took it out saying that he'll have it for lunch.

482
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:16,164
(He took out chicken breast for lunch.)

483
00:20:16,474 --> 00:20:19,374
Then he devoured jjamppong and fried rice.

484
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,545
He did? When he brought chicken breast?

485
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:23,243
It was a side dish.

486
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:25,114
So that was a side dish?

487
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:27,814
He had yangjangpi and everything.

488
00:20:27,815 --> 00:20:29,214
I like something that's thick.

489
00:20:32,654 --> 00:20:34,854
Did you have something you want to eat at a place like this?

490
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:36,694
- Me?
- Something you want out here.

491
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:40,723
It's a little early, but we should make a fire.

492
00:20:40,724 --> 00:20:42,094
- Really?
- Can we do that?

493
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:43,694
- Sure thing. Just tell me about it.
- Really?

494
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:45,933
Since we're close to the East Sea, what about some seafood?

495
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:46,964
You mean something like sashimi?

496
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:49,403
What was that fish from the East Sea?

497
00:20:49,404 --> 00:20:50,433
Monkfish?

498
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:52,733
I had it a couple of times, and it was refreshing.

499
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:53,774
- Really?
- Yes.

500
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:57,413
We can have a barbecue and cook some rockfish too.

501
00:20:57,414 --> 00:20:58,643
- So you want a barbecue?
- Some grilled fish.

502
00:20:58,644 --> 00:21:00,243
- Something like grilled clams?
- I see.

503
00:21:00,244 --> 00:21:01,514
- Grilled clams?
- Really?

504
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:02,614
We need to grill some food.

505
00:21:02,615 --> 00:21:04,714
Dong Il. Didn't you say we have whelks?

506
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:06,355
What was that again?

507
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:08,285
My goodness.

508
00:21:09,924 --> 00:21:12,294
(She opens the packed lunch while talking.)

509
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:14,364
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
- My goodness.

510
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:16,294
You start eating while Seung Ryong is talking?

511
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:17,663
I'm starving.

512
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:20,163
- My goodness.
- Let's talk while eating.

513
00:21:20,164 --> 00:21:21,834
- I didn't have breakfast.
- Where did you get that?

514
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:23,274
They sell it over there.

515
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:25,304
- This is famous, you know.
- It came out of nowhere.

516
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:26,844
You think I came empty-handed?

517
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:28,504
- You think I came with nothing?
- She was...

518
00:21:28,505 --> 00:21:30,644
looking for the right time to take it out.

519
00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:32,143
It'd be different if you try it.

520
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:34,213
It has shredded potatoes in it.

521
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:35,314
(Potato gimbap with shredded potatoes in it)

522
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:36,384
So the white part is the potato?

523
00:21:36,615 --> 00:21:38,384
My goodness. It looks so good.

524
00:21:39,085 --> 00:21:41,454
You can't miss out on squid sundae when you're in Gangwon Province.

525
00:21:41,785 --> 00:21:43,324
This is squid sundae.

526
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:46,464
There's more. I got spicy marinated crab.

527
00:21:46,664 --> 00:21:49,424
(She opens the spicy marinated crab.)

528
00:21:50,494 --> 00:21:52,693
Is it from a famous place?

529
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:57,173
I have a friend who gives me good food.

530
00:21:57,174 --> 00:21:58,604
So I have them at home.

531
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:00,005
Gosh, this looks nice.

532
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:03,844
It will be delicious to put some spicy marinated crab on top.

533
00:22:03,845 --> 00:22:06,884
(Meanwhile...)

534
00:22:07,585 --> 00:22:10,084
- Dong Il. All of them are gimbap.
- Really?

535
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:11,883
Right. We'll have one each.

536
00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:13,254
I don't think we can eat them all.

537
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:15,325
- We should give some to the staff.
- I see.

538
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:21,964
(Rummaging)

539
00:22:22,494 --> 00:22:24,264
(He takes something out.)

540
00:22:24,265 --> 00:22:26,264
This is my lunch. Can you place it next to them?

541
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:28,764
Look at that. He brought that here too.

542
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,774
- You're not going to eat that.
- He won't eat that.

543
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:32,104
This is a side dish.

544
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:34,443
I have to eat it because my wife packed it for me.

545
00:22:34,444 --> 00:22:36,644
- My goodness.
- Your wife packed it?

546
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:38,874
Look at this.

547
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,383
- Okay. I'll serve them together.
- Let's serve them together.

548
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:42,883
- We have to eat it.
- Spread the word, okay?

549
00:22:42,884 --> 00:22:43,954
(You know what I mean, right?)

550
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:46,285
- All right.
- Good.

551
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,723
You know what? You look cute next to Dong Il.

552
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:50,724
Of course.

553
00:22:51,025 --> 00:22:52,723
In fact, Seung Ryong is...

554
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:53,765
(He's showing his cute side.)

555
00:22:54,394 --> 00:22:55,764
- Seung Ryong is...
- Give me some allowance, please.

556
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:57,134
(He's so cute.)

557
00:22:57,434 --> 00:22:59,193
(Laughing)

558
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:00,534
(His cute act makes them burst into laughter.)

559
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:01,633
So cute.

560
00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:04,874
Seung Ryong loves to have fun.

561
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,334
I thought of him as a big brother,

562
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:08,575
but he's so cute too.

563
00:23:09,944 --> 00:23:10,973
Let's put it there.

564
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:11,974
(He finishes plating with Seung Ryong's chicken breast.)

565
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,913
This looks amazing.

566
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:14,914
(He finishes plating with Seung Ryong's chicken breast.)

567
00:23:15,914 --> 00:23:16,914
Okay.

568
00:23:17,684 --> 00:23:18,684
- It's done, right?
- Goodness.

569
00:23:18,685 --> 00:23:20,453
(They just put them on the cutting board,)

570
00:23:20,454 --> 00:23:21,983
Isn't it pretty? It looks like a big meal.

571
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,954
(and a hearty lunch is ready.)

572
00:23:25,394 --> 00:23:29,795
(They will have lunch by the beautiful lake today.)

573
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,794
(What will it be like to have lunch at such a beautiful place?)

574
00:23:32,795 --> 00:23:34,133
I feel so happy.

575
00:23:34,134 --> 00:23:36,265
(What will it be like to have lunch at such a beautiful place?)

576
00:23:36,505 --> 00:23:37,574
Sure thing.

577
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:40,045
It looks good.

578
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:43,474
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

579
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:46,544
Let's dig in.

580
00:23:46,545 --> 00:23:48,913
(He tries potato gimbap first.)

581
00:23:48,914 --> 00:23:51,854
- You're eating already.
- Let him try it.

582
00:23:51,855 --> 00:23:53,954
Isn't it good? Gimbap with shredded potatoes in it.

583
00:23:54,525 --> 00:23:56,183
- It's so good.
- Right?

584
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,255
Right.

585
00:23:57,954 --> 00:23:59,923
Do I dip squid sundae in chojang?

586
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:00,964
(Have chewy squid sundae with chojang.)

587
00:24:01,865 --> 00:24:04,295
(It's so delicious.)

588
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:07,203
- It's good.
- It's cooked well.

589
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:08,904
- Isn't it good?
- It's good.

590
00:24:09,704 --> 00:24:10,804
Gosh, it's good.

591
00:24:10,805 --> 00:24:13,204
(Na Ra who brought the food is satisfied too.)

592
00:24:13,404 --> 00:24:17,174
(Seung Ryong is eating with a serious look on his face.)

593
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:21,444
(The members of House on Wheels are devouring the food.)

594
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:23,214
You should try it with that.

595
00:24:23,215 --> 00:24:25,983
(Savoring)

596
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:28,454
(It's tasty.)

597
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:31,994
(I'll have one more.)

598
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:36,494
(Myoung fell into spicy marinated crab.)

599
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:39,795
(Staring)

600
00:24:40,365 --> 00:24:43,234
(Is there any more of it?)

601
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:47,105
(Smiling)

602
00:24:47,605 --> 00:24:52,575
(The spicy marinated crab is to Myoung's liking.)

603
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,684
Myoung eats really well.

604
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,954
- He's chewing on it.
- It's so delicious.

605
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:00,884
Eat a lot.

606
00:25:02,825 --> 00:25:03,994
Tell me about it.

607
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:05,653
- It's done.
- Good.

608
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:06,663
(Meanwhile, Seung Ryong who's on a diet...)

609
00:25:06,664 --> 00:25:07,795
- Gosh, it looks good.
- Right.

610
00:25:08,694 --> 00:25:11,463
(is eating the chicken breast to fill up his stomach.)

611
00:25:11,464 --> 00:25:13,305
Spicy marinated crab goes well with rice.

612
00:25:13,535 --> 00:25:15,964
Gosh. Try this marinated crab.

613
00:25:16,904 --> 00:25:18,034
(Spicy marinated crab is delicious.)

614
00:25:18,035 --> 00:25:19,904
I feel much better now. It's my first meal of the day.

615
00:25:21,174 --> 00:25:26,045
(They are all enjoying their lunch.)

616
00:25:26,884 --> 00:25:28,913
(Seung Ryong is just looking at them.)

617
00:25:28,914 --> 00:25:31,615
(And he takes a bite of the chicken breast.)

618
00:25:31,984 --> 00:25:33,084
(Glancing)

619
00:25:33,085 --> 00:25:34,525
If gimbap is too bland...

620
00:25:35,424 --> 00:25:38,525
When are we going to do this again? it's really...

621
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:40,663
- No, just give me that.
- You sure?

622
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,024
- You don't want this?
- No, I'll just try it like this.

623
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:44,765
(His eyes are fixed on it.)

624
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,105
(He just takes another bite of chicken breast.)

625
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:51,634
(Glancing)

626
00:25:51,674 --> 00:25:52,805
- It's good.
- Is that so?

627
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,374
Seung Ryong, pick up that gimbap. I'll put some sauce on it.

628
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,744
(Seung Ryong, pick up that gimbap. I'll put some sauce on it.)

629
00:25:57,845 --> 00:25:58,874
It's so good.

630
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,515
(Really?)

631
00:26:01,684 --> 00:26:02,684
- This is so good.
- Right.

632
00:26:02,685 --> 00:26:03,883
(Do I eat it or not?)

633
00:26:03,884 --> 00:26:04,954
Kimchi tastes so good.

634
00:26:05,785 --> 00:26:08,484
(I'm curious.)

635
00:26:10,025 --> 00:26:12,454
- Where's the potato? This part?
- Yes, it's white.

636
00:26:12,555 --> 00:26:14,394
(Staring hard)

637
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,835
(It goes into his mouth.)

638
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:19,494
(This is it.)

639
00:26:20,565 --> 00:26:22,404
- Isn't it good?
- Right.

640
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:26,474
(But I need something more.)

641
00:26:26,904 --> 00:26:28,605
(Try some spicy marinated crab.)

642
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,345
(Impressed)

643
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:34,315
(He takes a big mouthful of it.)

644
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:38,255
(It's fantastic!)

645
00:26:38,984 --> 00:26:39,984
(He eats chicken breast too.)

646
00:26:41,785 --> 00:26:45,325
(He doesn't forget to have protein.)

647
00:26:46,095 --> 00:26:48,795
(This time, he eats chicken breast with spicy marinated crab.)

648
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:52,663
- Isn't it good?
- Right.

649
00:26:52,664 --> 00:26:53,664
(He's satisfied.)

650
00:26:54,035 --> 00:26:55,765
(Myoung's kimchi)

651
00:26:56,734 --> 00:27:00,174
(He has kimchi to cleanse his palate.)

652
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:03,075
(It's delicious, Myoung.)

653
00:27:03,305 --> 00:27:05,275
(I'm glad you like it.)

654
00:27:06,345 --> 00:27:08,644
(He's happy.)

655
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:10,914
I can't stop eating. What do I do?

656
00:27:11,515 --> 00:27:13,383
- Today is your cheat day.
- It's so delicious.

657
00:27:13,384 --> 00:27:16,724
(I'll go on a diet starting from tomorrow.)

658
00:27:17,355 --> 00:27:19,524
- We finished them all.
- Gosh, it was so good.

659
00:27:19,525 --> 00:27:22,065
- I devoured it.
- It was really good.

660
00:27:23,694 --> 00:27:24,765
I ate them all.

661
00:27:25,095 --> 00:27:27,233
- Right, you ate them all.
- I ate all of these.

662
00:27:27,234 --> 00:27:28,535
- Right.
- I devoured it.

663
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:31,904
(I'm glad you all enjoyed them.)

664
00:27:32,904 --> 00:27:34,904
Actors try hard to stay in shape, you know.

665
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:37,315
Eating clean and staying away from alcohol.

666
00:27:37,974 --> 00:27:39,444
(That's right.)

667
00:27:39,775 --> 00:27:42,244
I wanted to ask you this, Seung Ryong.

668
00:27:43,585 --> 00:27:45,754
I met him one day and asked him to have a drink with me.

669
00:27:45,755 --> 00:27:46,954
And he said he quit drinking.

670
00:27:47,585 --> 00:27:49,454
I was really surprised to hear that.

671
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:52,193
Do you feel better after quitting drinking?

672
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:54,065
- Of course.
- It'll improve your health.

673
00:27:54,664 --> 00:27:57,233
- Your wife must be happy about it.
- Sure thing.

674
00:27:57,234 --> 00:27:59,233
You must be spending a lot of time with your wife.

675
00:27:59,234 --> 00:28:00,234
- Sure thing.
- Together.

676
00:28:00,235 --> 00:28:01,634
We always walk together.

677
00:28:02,365 --> 00:28:03,805
That's not easy to do.

678
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:06,704
It's great. Walking is really good.

679
00:28:07,674 --> 00:28:10,104
When I go for a walk, I see many people walking.

680
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,614
- Many people do that.
- We were the only ones who didn't.

681
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:12,974
- That's right.
- Seriously.

682
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:16,214
I thought I'd lost a good friend.

683
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,654
I disagree.

684
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:21,384
You may think that way, but I have a good friend now.

685
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:23,355
(Shy)

686
00:28:24,255 --> 00:28:25,525
We drink tea together.

687
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:28,795
By the way, do you get along well with Hee Won?

688
00:28:29,765 --> 00:28:34,565
(Dong Il suddenly asked a question.)

689
00:28:35,404 --> 00:28:38,634
(In fact, Seung Ryong and Hee Won are the same age, but...)

690
00:28:39,174 --> 00:28:42,005
(Mr. Kim. Since you don't drink...)

691
00:28:42,244 --> 00:28:44,315
(Did you make it yourself?)

692
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,643
(Seung Ryong calls him Mr. Kim.)

693
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:48,214
(Hee Won calls him Mr. Ryu.)

694
00:28:48,744 --> 00:28:50,883
Is there a water tank somewhere here?

695
00:28:50,884 --> 00:28:53,085
There is a place where we store water.

696
00:28:54,055 --> 00:28:57,154
How come you and Seung Ryong don't talk casually?

697
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:01,525
(It wasn't easy to talk casually to him.)

698
00:29:01,994 --> 00:29:04,964
(They need some time to get along well.)

699
00:29:05,795 --> 00:29:10,305
(They sat apart from each other because they felt awkward.)

700
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:15,474
(They still need some time to get along well.)

701
00:29:16,305 --> 00:29:17,544
Do you get along well with Hee Won?

702
00:29:17,545 --> 00:29:18,815
(Dong Il was curious about their relationship.)

703
00:29:19,815 --> 00:29:21,615
Maybe it's because we're the same age.

704
00:29:22,144 --> 00:29:24,653
If he were younger or older than me,

705
00:29:24,654 --> 00:29:26,255
it would've been easier.

706
00:29:26,954 --> 00:29:28,625
And he was my junior in school.

707
00:29:29,255 --> 00:29:30,693
- I know.
- Also,

708
00:29:30,694 --> 00:29:32,825
we're not actually the same age. Since we have this concept in Korea.

709
00:29:33,894 --> 00:29:36,894
And Hee Won is...

710
00:29:37,434 --> 00:29:39,794
- a bit shy.
- Right.

711
00:29:39,795 --> 00:29:41,403
(Will they get close to each other through House on Wheels?)

712
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,834
You'll feel comfortable if you see each other often.

713
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:44,275
Sure thing.

714
00:29:45,474 --> 00:29:47,805
Okay. Let's see if Seung Ryong...

715
00:29:48,305 --> 00:29:50,344
feels relaxed...

716
00:29:50,345 --> 00:29:52,074
and comfortable now.

717
00:29:52,075 --> 00:29:53,744
Let's test it out.

718
00:29:54,285 --> 00:29:55,515
(What are you talking about?)

719
00:29:56,515 --> 00:29:57,515
Please do the dishes.

720
00:29:58,214 --> 00:29:59,814
(Do the dishes?)

721
00:29:59,815 --> 00:30:00,883
(A forced smile)

722
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,024
- Do you know what he told me?
- He has to do the dishes.

723
00:30:03,025 --> 00:30:04,454
He asked me not to make him do the dishes.

724
00:30:06,154 --> 00:30:07,265
You really said that?

725
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:09,224
I do it all the time at home. I don't want to do it here.

726
00:30:10,295 --> 00:30:11,295
That's why.

727
00:30:11,296 --> 00:30:12,894
(Pleading)

728
00:30:13,535 --> 00:30:15,364
- No, you don't need to do it.
- Seung Ryong.

729
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:16,633
- I'll do it. Please don't.
- Really?

730
00:30:16,634 --> 00:30:18,074
- No, I'll do it.
- It's okay.

731
00:30:18,075 --> 00:30:19,505
All right. I'll do it.

732
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:23,575
(He wears rubber gloves carefully.)

733
00:30:24,714 --> 00:30:27,413
(By driblets)

734
00:30:27,414 --> 00:30:31,014
Rinse it like this. With this water...

735
00:30:31,015 --> 00:30:33,315
- Look at him saving water.
- Is it to save water?

736
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:36,755
- To save water?
- That's right.

737
00:30:37,494 --> 00:30:38,724
(Observing)

738
00:30:38,825 --> 00:30:40,525
- But he's pouting.
- Well...

739
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:42,964
(He purses his lips in haste.)

740
00:30:43,194 --> 00:30:44,664
- I always look like this.
- His mouth is...

741
00:30:45,335 --> 00:30:48,234
It came out farther than his nose. It isn't like that before.

742
00:30:49,035 --> 00:30:51,075
I always look like this.

743
00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:53,274
All the way here.

744
00:30:53,275 --> 00:30:54,444
(Hee Won pouts when he focuses on something.)

745
00:30:55,404 --> 00:30:57,345
(Pursing his lips)

746
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,315
That's not true.

747
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:02,484
(Hee Won is funny.)

748
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:06,884
(He starts doing the dishes while pursing his lips.)

749
00:31:07,224 --> 00:31:09,484
(He washes them thoroughly.)

750
00:31:10,555 --> 00:31:14,664
(He cleans the sink as well.)

751
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:16,865
Done.

752
00:31:18,434 --> 00:31:20,034
(Good work.)

753
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:21,065
It's done.

754
00:31:21,565 --> 00:31:24,174
- Gosh, my back.
- Take a seat, Hee Won.

755
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:27,403
Try them. They're really famous in Gangwon Province.

756
00:31:27,404 --> 00:31:29,074
They are potato bread and sweet potato bread.

757
00:31:29,075 --> 00:31:30,814
- This one looks like a potato.
- This is sweet potato bread.

758
00:31:30,815 --> 00:31:32,075
Right, it looks like a potato.

759
00:31:32,744 --> 00:31:34,815
Goodness. It really looks like a sweet potato.

760
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:38,115
- Does it have potatoes in it?
- Yes.

761
00:31:38,214 --> 00:31:40,555
(The bread is filled with mashed potatoes.)

762
00:31:41,184 --> 00:31:43,855
(Na Ra takes a big bite first.)

763
00:31:45,295 --> 00:31:46,355
(Savoring)

764
00:31:47,224 --> 00:31:50,025
(Hee Won tries the sweet potato bread first.)

765
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,194
This is really tasty.

766
00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:56,265
(They're all eating happily.)

767
00:31:57,005 --> 00:31:59,634
(Longing)

768
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:02,703
- Gosh, how come it's so delicious?
- It's good, isn't it?

769
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:03,713
Yes.

770
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:04,744
- It has cheese in it.
- Gosh.

771
00:32:06,444 --> 00:32:08,483
- Cheese?
- It has cheese and potatoes in it.

772
00:32:08,484 --> 00:32:10,515
(Sure, cheese is delicious.)

773
00:32:11,255 --> 00:32:13,383
- It's pretty unique.
- Right.

774
00:32:13,384 --> 00:32:14,625
(They have a lot of delicious snacks today.)

775
00:32:15,285 --> 00:32:16,285
Here. This is sweet potato bread.

776
00:32:16,286 --> 00:32:17,493
(He can't take eyes off of it.)

777
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:18,525
That's amazing.

778
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:19,754
(He just gulps down his coffee.)

779
00:32:19,755 --> 00:32:20,764
Try this one too.

780
00:32:20,765 --> 00:32:21,765
(He just gulps down his coffee.)

781
00:32:22,095 --> 00:32:24,364
It's not bread. They are just potatoes and sweet potatoes.

782
00:32:24,365 --> 00:32:25,365
It's really good.

783
00:32:25,366 --> 00:32:28,234
(If it's not bread...)

784
00:32:28,734 --> 00:32:30,874
- It's famous in Gangwon Province?
- It's so delicious.

785
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,274
- Right, it's famous.
- This is really good.

786
00:32:32,275 --> 00:32:33,404
I'll try a little bit then.

787
00:32:33,605 --> 00:32:34,805
It's filled with potatoes.

788
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:36,973
It's chewy and delicious.

789
00:32:36,974 --> 00:32:37,974
(Savoring)

790
00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:39,014
- Isn't it good?
- It's good.

791
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:41,184
You're eating a lot of carbs today, Seung Ryong.

792
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:42,344
(Carbs are so good.)

793
00:32:42,345 --> 00:32:43,345
Isn't it delicious?

794
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:47,785
Just eat today. You can work out harder later.

795
00:32:48,184 --> 00:32:49,354
Right, Seung Ryong.

796
00:32:49,355 --> 00:32:50,723
- This is amazing.
- Right, it's delicious.

797
00:32:50,724 --> 00:32:52,295
- It has cheese and potatoes in it.
- I told you so.

798
00:32:52,494 --> 00:32:54,724
- Gosh, this is so...
- I told you so.

799
00:32:55,464 --> 00:32:57,164
(He's proud.)

800
00:32:57,595 --> 00:32:58,634
This is good.

801
00:32:59,164 --> 00:33:02,805
(It's okay to eat up today.)

802
00:33:03,035 --> 00:33:05,605
(Let the dieting begin tomorrow.)

803
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:07,775
(Smiling)

804
00:33:08,474 --> 00:33:11,344
The weather today is nice and breezy.

805
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:12,615
It's perfect.

806
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:14,483
The weather is being considerate of Seung Ryong.

807
00:33:14,484 --> 00:33:15,615
(After the morning rain of fall stopped raining.)

808
00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:20,384
(It became even more refreshing at the front yard.)

809
00:33:21,285 --> 00:33:23,154
I was worried because it was raining earlier.

810
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:24,924
It's so refreshing.

811
00:33:25,355 --> 00:33:26,724
The water here is pretty.

812
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:30,533
There is limestone powder here since it's a quarry.

813
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:33,735
Under the sunlight, the water looks like the Mediterranean Sea.

814
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:36,735
(Curious)

815
00:33:37,135 --> 00:33:40,905
(When the sky clears up,)

816
00:33:41,744 --> 00:33:44,675
(in the picturesque pond at the front yard,)

817
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:48,684
(you will see another sky that's available just for you.)

818
00:33:49,784 --> 00:33:53,414
(In the pond that is as clear as a mirror,)

819
00:33:54,054 --> 00:33:57,454
(even the clouds take a quick break.)

820
00:33:57,554 --> 00:33:59,925
Are we going to put a boat in the pond?

821
00:34:00,094 --> 00:34:01,525
(I have a clear boat prepared.)

822
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:03,363
I have a clear boat prepared.

823
00:34:03,364 --> 00:34:04,493
- Really?
- Really?

824
00:34:04,494 --> 00:34:06,635
- Yes.
- Are we canoeing today?

825
00:34:07,434 --> 00:34:10,065
Yes, I have 1 for 3 people, another for 2 people.

826
00:34:11,034 --> 00:34:14,675
(It's another way to fully enjoy the pond at the front yard.)

827
00:34:16,644 --> 00:34:19,474
(The pond shines brilliantly below you.)

828
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:23,215
(It's time for a majestic ride on top of the clouds.)

829
00:34:24,054 --> 00:34:27,454
(For enjoying this beautiful view,)

830
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:30,925
(no place is better than on top of the pond.)

831
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:35,125
(How will it feel to go on a boat in the middle of a forest?)

832
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,363
(Excited)

833
00:34:37,364 --> 00:34:39,594
- I didn't expect this.
- That's what we'll really do.

834
00:34:40,635 --> 00:34:43,504
It's like canoeing. Just to relax on a small boat.

835
00:34:43,505 --> 00:34:44,505
(Thinking)

836
00:34:44,934 --> 00:34:47,074
- Myoung really isn't doing a thing.
- Pardon?

837
00:34:47,744 --> 00:34:49,875
(Pardon?)

838
00:34:52,114 --> 00:34:53,143
All he does is smile.

839
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:55,545
(Chuckling)

840
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:58,214
Myoung is charming like a puppy.

841
00:34:58,215 --> 00:34:59,754
Right. That's his nickname.

842
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:01,554
- Is it really?
- Ha Nee named it.

843
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:03,154
(Staring)

844
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:05,394
(I thought you were on a diet, but you took another chunk.)

845
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,724
I thought you were on a diet, but you took another chunk.

846
00:35:08,864 --> 00:35:10,464
You took it before you even noticed it, right?

847
00:35:10,465 --> 00:35:12,334
(He has a big appetite today.)

848
00:35:12,335 --> 00:35:15,405
- You didn't even notice it, right?
- Just forget all about it today.

849
00:35:16,335 --> 00:35:19,175
You can't help it. It's really good.

850
00:35:19,275 --> 00:35:22,044
You can't help but keep eating if there is food in front of you.

851
00:35:22,045 --> 00:35:23,804
(This is really good.)

852
00:35:25,144 --> 00:35:26,815
- Shall we get going?
- Shall we go on the boat?

853
00:35:26,914 --> 00:35:28,385
Let's do that. Just leave it like that.

854
00:35:29,715 --> 00:35:32,985
(There is a place to take a boat right in the front.)

855
00:35:33,385 --> 00:35:35,925
(Walking swiftly to the port)

856
00:35:36,324 --> 00:35:37,894
The color of the water looks different from before.

857
00:35:38,695 --> 00:35:40,525
Right? It looks even more green now.

858
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,625
It's so pretty.

859
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:47,304
(The emerald pond looks glorious.)

860
00:35:48,135 --> 00:35:50,204
The flowers are so pretty.

861
00:35:51,304 --> 00:35:52,875
Would you like a picture with the flowers?

862
00:35:53,704 --> 00:35:54,775
Hee Won.

863
00:35:55,144 --> 00:35:56,445
We should sit down to show the flowers.

864
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:58,143
(Friendly)

865
00:35:58,144 --> 00:36:00,045
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Look at Hee Won smiling.

866
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,085
(With the guests prettier than flowers,)

867
00:36:03,885 --> 00:36:06,885
(they experience simple happiness as they chat and laugh.)

868
00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:09,683
It's right over here.

869
00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:11,125
(What did they find at the end of the road?)

870
00:36:11,494 --> 00:36:13,993
They must be a pedal boat.

871
00:36:13,994 --> 00:36:15,593
This is a pedal boat. and these are paddles.

872
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:17,834
- I've never been on this.
- You mean the boat?

873
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:18,894
- Yes.
- A clear boat?

874
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:21,735
- Should I wear the jacket first?
- You should do that.

875
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:23,664
- Let's wear the life jackets.
- Let's do that.

876
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:26,574
(This video was filmed under the safety expert's guidance.)

877
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:28,275
I'm so excited.

878
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,644
- Did you tighten it?
- Yes.

879
00:36:31,244 --> 00:36:33,744
(Hee Won is suspicious today as always.)

880
00:36:34,715 --> 00:36:38,054
(Seung Ryong's life-vest must feel loose.)

881
00:36:40,255 --> 00:36:43,485
(Everyone finished wearing the life-vests.)

882
00:36:44,695 --> 00:36:45,695
How do you ride this?

883
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:49,094
- You have to row this one.
- How should we split up?

884
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:51,835
The two of you with the worst teamwork...

885
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,134
Hee Won and Seung Ryong should go on the boat together.

886
00:36:54,135 --> 00:36:55,204
(They are going on the same boat.)

887
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:58,303
You are the most awkward around each other. Try to get closer.

888
00:36:58,304 --> 00:36:59,304
Should I do that?

889
00:36:59,305 --> 00:37:00,905
- You should be together.
- Sounds good.

890
00:37:03,675 --> 00:37:05,744
- How should you sit?
- One of them...

891
00:37:06,244 --> 00:37:07,244
should ride it and push.

892
00:37:07,914 --> 00:37:09,045
I'm scared it'll flip over.

893
00:37:09,715 --> 00:37:10,784
You should step inside.

894
00:37:10,815 --> 00:37:12,553
(Carefully)

895
00:37:12,554 --> 00:37:13,614
Okay.

896
00:37:13,985 --> 00:37:16,525
- This boat looks scary.
- I'll hold it for you.

897
00:37:17,155 --> 00:37:19,724
This looks fun. You can see the floor too.

898
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:21,925
You should talk it over.

899
00:37:22,224 --> 00:37:23,224
Now, sit down.

900
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,763
(Ouch!)

901
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:27,664
Seung Ryong. Your turn.

902
00:37:28,235 --> 00:37:30,775
- You should go.
- You two should go.

903
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:32,105
I'll push it for you.

904
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:34,675
(Seung Ryong carefully gets on the boat as well.)

905
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:35,775
There.

906
00:37:35,776 --> 00:37:37,275
(Nervous)

907
00:37:37,574 --> 00:37:38,814
(Holding tight)

908
00:37:38,815 --> 00:37:39,945
Hold the paddle.

909
00:37:41,315 --> 00:37:42,343
All good?

910
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:43,384
(Moving away)

911
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:44,385
Have a good time.

912
00:37:44,885 --> 00:37:47,155
- Bye.
- Hee Won, your neck is missing.

913
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:48,925
- What?
- I can't see your neck.

914
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,755
I can't help it.

915
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:53,355
- They are just too funny.
- Have fun.

916
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:55,564
(Two men, feeling awkward around each other, start their journey.)

917
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:56,664
Have a good time.

918
00:37:57,164 --> 00:37:59,234
(The kayak couple calmly travel away into the pond.)

919
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,235
You look great together.

920
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:05,704
(Hee Won has his neck completely hidden...)

921
00:38:06,235 --> 00:38:09,244
(while Seung Ryong still feels very insecure.)

922
00:38:09,474 --> 00:38:10,974
Why does it keep turning?

923
00:38:12,144 --> 00:38:14,085
It keeps spinning around.

924
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:16,144
Aren't you supposed to move it diagonally?

925
00:38:18,514 --> 00:38:21,224
- I don't know.
- When you do that, I'll do this.

926
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:23,154
- When you do that...
- Like that?

927
00:38:23,155 --> 00:38:24,195
I'll do this.

928
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:29,224
(While their awkward kayak date continues,)

929
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:30,593
(these three are getting on the pedal boat.)

930
00:38:30,594 --> 00:38:31,635
I'm so excited.

931
00:38:32,465 --> 00:38:34,804
(Na Ra and Myoung take the front seats.)

932
00:38:35,405 --> 00:38:36,405
Push with your foot.

933
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:38,635
- There.
- Great. Let's go!

934
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:42,005
(They step on the pedals to start the boat.)

935
00:38:42,574 --> 00:38:43,945
It's moving!

936
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,514
(They step on the pedals as hard as they can.)

937
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:49,084
This is a nice workout. There you go!

938
00:38:49,085 --> 00:38:50,085
(The pedal boat is almost like an exercise machine.)

939
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:53,585
My legs feel so tired.

940
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:55,954
- It's too slow.
- Take your time.

941
00:38:56,454 --> 00:38:58,625
Who said this is going to be romantic?

942
00:38:59,324 --> 00:39:00,454
This is like a boot camp.

943
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:04,994
(It's a pedal boot camp that pretends to be romantic.)

944
00:39:05,864 --> 00:39:07,804
Let's go catch them! Where are they?

945
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:10,734
- That is the easier one.
- It really is.

946
00:39:10,735 --> 00:39:11,835
That one is easier.

947
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:14,545
(Silent)

948
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:17,545
That one looks easier.

949
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:20,815
You can just step on the pedals like riding a bicycle.

950
00:39:21,144 --> 00:39:22,215
That looks tiring.

951
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:25,784
Have you done this before when you were on dates?

952
00:39:26,315 --> 00:39:27,315
I did really long ago.

953
00:39:28,184 --> 00:39:30,454
That one is hard. Even from looking at it, it's hard.

954
00:39:31,355 --> 00:39:33,355
Hey, there. You are looking good.

955
00:39:33,594 --> 00:39:34,625
Do we look good?

956
00:39:35,065 --> 00:39:36,425
Seriously.

957
00:39:37,094 --> 00:39:38,634
We could take all the time in the world.

958
00:39:38,635 --> 00:39:40,735
This is so nice. There is no sun either.

959
00:39:42,235 --> 00:39:45,905
(Taking a break from rowing)

960
00:39:47,974 --> 00:39:54,614
(They are enjoying the best view right in front of their house.)

961
00:39:55,815 --> 00:39:58,484
- Look at the color of the water.
- The floor is green.

962
00:39:58,485 --> 00:39:59,613
- Look at the water.
- It's amazing.

963
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:01,723
(Underneath the boat is sparkly emerald water.)

964
00:40:01,724 --> 00:40:04,424
When I do something like this with my kids,

965
00:40:04,425 --> 00:40:06,795
I try not to sound too excited since I'm their father.

966
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:09,624
I like this.

967
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:11,295
(Today, he truly enjoys his time.)

968
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:13,764
(It's the best today as always.)

969
00:40:14,965 --> 00:40:16,104
What's at the top?

970
00:40:16,105 --> 00:40:18,434
Over at the top, there is an observatory.

971
00:40:19,034 --> 00:40:20,634
It's really pretty at the observatory.

972
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:23,304
- Shall we visit the observatory?
- Let's do that.

973
00:40:23,445 --> 00:40:26,715
(They drive uphill to the observatory.)

974
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:29,843
Do you see something that looks like stairs way up at the top?

975
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,953
That's the observatory. It's at the northwest of us.

976
00:40:32,954 --> 00:40:35,954
- I thought it was a forklift.
- That's what I thought too.

977
00:40:36,724 --> 00:40:39,024
That's where we are going. It's pretty high up there.

978
00:40:39,025 --> 00:40:40,994
It is pretty high up.

979
00:40:41,695 --> 00:40:43,965
When you are up there, you can see the entire pond in one glance.

980
00:40:44,335 --> 00:40:46,135
Then, you'll see the size of this entire place.

981
00:40:48,105 --> 00:40:51,005
(It's a tough road up to the observatory.)

982
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:53,335
- This place is incredible.
- Oh, my goodness.

983
00:40:54,275 --> 00:40:55,405
It really is.

984
00:40:56,045 --> 00:40:57,544
It's a sharp turn.

985
00:40:57,545 --> 00:40:59,275
(Following the road where people traveled to dig up the limestones)

986
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,013
Hee Won is a great driver for places like this.

987
00:41:01,014 --> 00:41:05,284
(Traveling up a steep slope)

988
00:41:07,184 --> 00:41:08,385
Now, that's the observatory.

989
00:41:08,755 --> 00:41:09,784
(Impressive)

990
00:41:10,585 --> 00:41:11,594
"Dumir."

991
00:41:11,855 --> 00:41:14,124
"Dumir Observatory."

992
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:15,524
(Arrived at the observatory)

993
00:41:15,525 --> 00:41:16,594
"Dumir."

994
00:41:20,894 --> 00:41:23,203
(Taking steps forward in excitement)

995
00:41:23,204 --> 00:41:25,204
There are such nice places all over Korea.

996
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:28,105
Doesn't this feel like a stairway to paradise?

997
00:41:29,144 --> 00:41:33,875
(It's a staircase that reaches all the way up close to paradise.)

998
00:41:34,914 --> 00:41:37,684
This place is so beautiful. Oh, my goodness.

999
00:41:38,684 --> 00:41:40,585
So, this is how it looks.

1000
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:42,625
It's so cool, right?

1001
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,093
(Getting more excited for the view as they go up)

1002
00:41:45,094 --> 00:41:46,295
It's a cliff.

1003
00:41:47,454 --> 00:41:49,664
I don't think it's safe to come all the way up here.

1004
00:41:50,094 --> 00:41:51,135
Really?

1005
00:41:51,864 --> 00:41:54,235
This is incredible. I did not expect this.

1006
00:41:54,764 --> 00:41:59,135
(How is the view seen over at the top of the observatory?)

1007
00:42:01,074 --> 00:42:04,314
(It's a magnificent view right before your eyes.)

1008
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:05,874
It's so pretty!

1009
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:07,175
(It's a magnificent view right before your eyes.)

1010
00:42:08,844 --> 00:42:12,815
(The emerald pond in front of the house...)

1011
00:42:13,485 --> 00:42:17,254
(became a picture frame that contains the sky and clouds.)

1012
00:42:17,255 --> 00:42:19,323
Look at the color of the water.

1013
00:42:19,324 --> 00:42:24,195
(It is even bluer.)

1014
00:42:24,735 --> 00:42:25,764
Look at the quarry.

1015
00:42:26,864 --> 00:42:27,864
It's really big.

1016
00:42:27,865 --> 00:42:29,404
(The quarry looks giant when you see it at your eye level.)

1017
00:42:29,405 --> 00:42:30,864
It's pretty amazing.

1018
00:42:32,735 --> 00:42:36,474
(You can also see the East Sea over the quarry.)

1019
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:39,815
Doesn't this cliff look pretty mysterious?

1020
00:42:40,045 --> 00:42:42,284
It's artificial but doesn't it look as if it was formed naturally...

1021
00:42:43,114 --> 00:42:44,144
over a long time?

1022
00:42:44,315 --> 00:42:45,783
(Over it, more grass has grown.)

1023
00:42:45,784 --> 00:42:48,723
It's amazing how you can restore some of the damage...

1024
00:42:48,724 --> 00:42:51,554
that's been caused by human activity.

1025
00:42:52,594 --> 00:42:54,695
(Impressed)

1026
00:42:54,965 --> 00:42:56,094
This is crazy.

1027
00:42:58,195 --> 00:42:59,195
Seung Ryong, look down.

1028
00:42:59,364 --> 00:43:01,764
(Startled)

1029
00:43:01,965 --> 00:43:04,973
(Dizzy)

1030
00:43:04,974 --> 00:43:09,445
(They realized how high up they are.)

1031
00:43:10,275 --> 00:43:11,614
My gosh, it's too high.

1032
00:43:13,574 --> 00:43:16,344
(Are you scared?)

1033
00:43:17,184 --> 00:43:20,385
(My safety is more important than the scenery.)

1034
00:43:20,985 --> 00:43:23,324
- The view is clearer here though.
- Yes.

1035
00:43:23,755 --> 00:43:25,794
- The view is different from here.
- Yes, totally.

1036
00:43:25,795 --> 00:43:26,823
I agree.

1037
00:43:26,824 --> 00:43:27,993
Although we didn't go up a lot,

1038
00:43:27,994 --> 00:43:30,124
- I felt it was higher up there.
- Yes, right.

1039
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,533
I feel safe here, and I can enjoy the view.

1040
00:43:31,534 --> 00:43:33,834
- We can really enjoy the view here.
- I feel more comfortable here.

1041
00:43:33,835 --> 00:43:35,634
Now that I'm standing on the ground, I feel safer.

1042
00:43:35,635 --> 00:43:36,663
Yes, definitely.

1043
00:43:36,664 --> 00:43:38,504
(The scenery is peaceful as they feel at ease.)

1044
00:43:38,505 --> 00:43:40,405
- The sea looks like a painting.
- Yes.

1045
00:43:41,034 --> 00:43:42,505
It looks like another ridge.

1046
00:43:42,744 --> 00:43:43,945
- Yes, it does.
- Yes.

1047
00:43:44,144 --> 00:43:45,675
- That is the sea?
- Yes, that's the sea.

1048
00:43:46,844 --> 00:43:49,485
- Oh my, that's the sea.
- Right, that's the sea over there.

1049
00:43:50,215 --> 00:43:52,154
From here, it seems like the sea is higher.

1050
00:43:52,155 --> 00:43:53,814
- It seems like it's much higher.
- Absolutely.

1051
00:43:53,815 --> 00:43:54,884
(You're right. It seems like that.)

1052
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:55,885
It seems higher than the mountain.

1053
00:43:56,454 --> 00:43:59,223
(It seems like the sea is floating on top of the mountain.)

1054
00:43:59,224 --> 00:44:00,295
It's mesmerizing.

1055
00:44:00,394 --> 00:44:05,065
I think it would be really lonely if only two people come here.

1056
00:44:05,465 --> 00:44:06,734
What if it was just you and me?

1057
00:44:06,735 --> 00:44:08,303
It would've been lonelier if just you two came here.

1058
00:44:08,304 --> 00:44:10,604
- Well, needless to say, - If you two were here alone...

1059
00:44:10,605 --> 00:44:12,433
we would feel so lonely that...

1060
00:44:12,434 --> 00:44:14,203
we might disappear into thin air.

1061
00:44:14,204 --> 00:44:15,574
(We might be dissolved into loneliness.)

1062
00:44:15,844 --> 00:44:18,414
- Let's take a group photo.
- Yes, what a nice idea.

1063
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:21,384
- Father.
- Well, where is he?

1064
00:44:21,385 --> 00:44:24,385
Come on, Father.

1065
00:44:25,355 --> 00:44:26,855
It's the pictures that last a lifetime.

1066
00:44:27,114 --> 00:44:28,355
Gosh, I feel great.

1067
00:44:29,925 --> 00:44:32,655
- It's so great that we came here.
- Yes.

1068
00:44:33,224 --> 00:44:34,464
(I feel so great.)

1069
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:35,763
It reminds me of my kids.

1070
00:44:35,764 --> 00:44:37,263
(Tapping)

1071
00:44:37,264 --> 00:44:38,335
I mean it, seriously.

1072
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:41,164
Are you checking stock prices?

1073
00:44:41,465 --> 00:44:44,604
(As he invested in stocks, whenever he gets a chance...)

1074
00:44:44,605 --> 00:44:46,234
No, I am not. I already checked before.

1075
00:44:46,235 --> 00:44:47,335
Do you think it will go up?

1076
00:44:48,474 --> 00:44:50,974
Whether it goes up or not, tomorrow I'm selling it.

1077
00:44:52,844 --> 00:44:54,885
I don't know. I will just sell it.

1078
00:44:55,244 --> 00:44:57,815
Whether it goes up or not, I'm selling it tomorrow.

1079
00:44:58,954 --> 00:45:00,484
- Did you invest in stocks too?
- No, I didn't.

1080
00:45:00,485 --> 00:45:01,554
Me neither. I don't know much about stocks.

1081
00:45:01,855 --> 00:45:04,554
As you two are shooting together, you will be seeing on set that,

1082
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:06,223
if he didn't memorize his lines,

1083
00:45:06,224 --> 00:45:08,424
that means he was busy learning about stocks.

1084
00:45:08,425 --> 00:45:11,465
No, that's not true. I don't usually memorize my lines.

1085
00:45:12,894 --> 00:45:14,164
- So you're a genius.
- Yes.

1086
00:45:14,704 --> 00:45:17,364
Now that you're older, can you still learn your lines quickly?

1087
00:45:17,804 --> 00:45:19,105
I don't play roles with many lines.

1088
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:23,803
But as you know, I did many lines in foreign languages.

1089
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,343
- And...
- Yes, you spoke Mongolian too.

1090
00:45:25,344 --> 00:45:27,143
I still remember those lines that I did ten years ago.

1091
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:28,944
- You must have practiced a lot.
- So you tried so hard to memorize.

1092
00:45:28,945 --> 00:45:30,183
In the movie with the arrows...

1093
00:45:30,184 --> 00:45:31,814
(He played Jyuushinta in "War of the Arrows.")

1094
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:32,884
Okay. So the language they used.

1095
00:45:32,885 --> 00:45:34,684
- Mongolian.
- Yes, it went like this.

1096
00:45:35,425 --> 00:45:39,525
(One of the quotes from the film is, "You can calculate the wind?")

1097
00:45:40,025 --> 00:45:42,524
And the lines in French in the movie "All About My Wife."

1098
00:45:42,525 --> 00:45:43,894
(He still remembers the famous lines in another language.)

1099
00:45:44,894 --> 00:45:49,164
(He remembers the lines in French from "All About My Wife.")

1100
00:45:49,465 --> 00:45:51,234
(In good pronunciation)

1101
00:45:51,235 --> 00:45:52,334
It went like this.

1102
00:45:52,335 --> 00:45:55,974
Imagine how many times I had to repeat them to still remember them.

1103
00:45:56,204 --> 00:45:58,513
My manager, who worked with me at that time, remembers them too,

1104
00:45:58,514 --> 00:46:00,274
although he got married and is not working as a manager anymore.

1105
00:46:00,275 --> 00:46:02,614
(Incredible)

1106
00:46:02,815 --> 00:46:05,613
(I'm amazed too.)

1107
00:46:05,614 --> 00:46:07,183
- All right. Now, let's go.
- Okay.

1108
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:08,255
- Okay.
- Gosh.

1109
00:46:08,425 --> 00:46:11,254
Let's go grill beef that Seung Ryong loves.

1110
00:46:11,255 --> 00:46:13,425
Let's go make a fire.

1111
00:46:16,695 --> 00:46:18,564
We are back.

1112
00:46:18,565 --> 00:46:20,194
(They are back from the observatory.)

1113
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:24,104
Okay, shall we make a fire? Seung Ryong's favorite?

1114
00:46:24,105 --> 00:46:25,105
All right.

1115
00:46:26,574 --> 00:46:27,674
I will open it when I go home.

1116
00:46:27,675 --> 00:46:31,104
- So shall I make the noodles?
- Yes, you shall.

1117
00:46:31,105 --> 00:46:32,215
- Good.
- Okay.

1118
00:46:33,114 --> 00:46:37,014
(Instead of Chef Sung, Hee Won is going into the kitchen.)

1119
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:39,953
Okay, and then...

1120
00:46:39,954 --> 00:46:41,925
(He is carefully checking a recipe.)

1121
00:46:42,985 --> 00:46:46,394
(Rattling)

1122
00:46:46,994 --> 00:46:50,525
(Will he be all right by himself?)

1123
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:54,465
You are going to boil the whelks first, right?

1124
00:46:55,005 --> 00:46:56,234
Yes, I'm thinking...

1125
00:46:56,235 --> 00:46:58,175
(What is today's menu with whelks?)

1126
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:00,874
(Last time, Hee Won made jjolmyeon for Na Ra.)

1127
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:03,275
(Of course. We can make noodles for you.)

1128
00:47:03,775 --> 00:47:06,144
(Looking forward)

1129
00:47:06,514 --> 00:47:08,544
(How can I chop scallions into small pieces?)

1130
00:47:08,545 --> 00:47:10,413
I saw people doing like this though.

1131
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:12,013
(Rolling)

1132
00:47:12,014 --> 00:47:13,113
It's for jjolmyeon, right?

1133
00:47:13,114 --> 00:47:15,125
(Pouring the sugar)

1134
00:47:15,284 --> 00:47:17,024
(I'll have the sauce that came with the noodles.)

1135
00:47:17,025 --> 00:47:19,054
(Come on, Dong Il.)

1136
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:25,635
(Although he wasn't skillful, he did his best to cook jjolmyeon.)

1137
00:47:25,835 --> 00:47:27,494
- Yes, I'm thinking...
- Okay.

1138
00:47:27,795 --> 00:47:30,064
- Yes, one task for each person.
- That one.

1139
00:47:30,065 --> 00:47:32,573
- I think you can use that pot.
- It will be ready when you're back.

1140
00:47:32,574 --> 00:47:33,905
- This is the one?
- Yes, that one.

1141
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:37,375
(Unsteady)

1142
00:47:38,045 --> 00:47:41,314
(He pulled out the pot first to boil whelks.)

1143
00:47:41,315 --> 00:47:43,113
When the water boils,

1144
00:47:43,114 --> 00:47:45,514
- put the whelks on the tray, - Yes.

1145
00:47:46,054 --> 00:47:47,885
and boil for 20 minutes.

1146
00:47:48,224 --> 00:47:50,625
- And let it stand for five minutes.
- Yes, that's right.

1147
00:47:51,355 --> 00:47:53,195
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Okay.

1148
00:47:53,795 --> 00:47:56,024
It's my first time to have fresh whelks.

1149
00:47:56,025 --> 00:47:57,924
So far, I've only had the canned ones.

1150
00:47:57,925 --> 00:47:59,295
- Really?
- Yes.

1151
00:47:59,894 --> 00:48:00,993
Actually, me too.

1152
00:48:00,994 --> 00:48:02,204
(Is it your first time? Actually, me too.)

1153
00:48:02,405 --> 00:48:04,404
(Still, I'll make it delicious.)

1154
00:48:04,405 --> 00:48:05,905
- So now...
- Okay.

1155
00:48:06,905 --> 00:48:08,973
And after this...

1156
00:48:08,974 --> 00:48:11,304
(Boiling the water to steam whelks)

1157
00:48:13,514 --> 00:48:16,385
(Hee Won is washing the vegetables for the whelk salad and noodles.)

1158
00:48:16,844 --> 00:48:21,284
(When he chopped the lettuce for jjolmyeon last time...)

1159
00:48:21,755 --> 00:48:23,424
(Hee Won, did you wash the lettuce?)

1160
00:48:23,425 --> 00:48:25,294
(Gosh, I forgot.)

1161
00:48:25,295 --> 00:48:27,054
Actually, I was hoping you wouldn't notice that.

1162
00:48:27,394 --> 00:48:31,264
(Taking the sliced lettuce to the faucet)

1163
00:48:32,264 --> 00:48:36,304
(That time, his cooking was in a different order,)

1164
00:48:36,934 --> 00:48:39,905
(but now he washes veggies first before chopping them.)

1165
00:48:41,005 --> 00:48:43,974
(He shakes off the water too.)

1166
00:48:44,144 --> 00:48:46,243
I need to wash the onion after peeling it.

1167
00:48:46,244 --> 00:48:47,644
(Now he knows how to prep onions.)

1168
00:48:51,485 --> 00:48:53,215
(Glimpsing)

1169
00:48:53,614 --> 00:48:55,885
- You're doing great.
- What?

1170
00:48:56,784 --> 00:48:58,053
No, I am not.

1171
00:48:58,054 --> 00:48:59,094
(Feeling shy)

1172
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:02,764
(Meanwhile, Dong Il, who is outside, started to...)

1173
00:49:03,264 --> 00:49:06,993
(make a fire with firewood.)

1174
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:08,464
(Safely filmed with permission from the local government)

1175
00:49:08,465 --> 00:49:09,763
You like to gaze at the fire, right?

1176
00:49:09,764 --> 00:49:11,203
I made it for you.

1177
00:49:11,204 --> 00:49:12,303
(Dong Il made a fire for Seung Ryong as he likes to gaze at the fire.)

1178
00:49:12,304 --> 00:49:13,905
(This is nice.)

1179
00:49:14,074 --> 00:49:17,004
I made a special order. It will be delivered here.

1180
00:49:17,005 --> 00:49:19,114
(I ordered something special.)

1181
00:49:19,474 --> 00:49:21,315
We can have it raw and grilled too.

1182
00:49:21,945 --> 00:49:24,584
(What is it that he prepared for?)

1183
00:49:24,585 --> 00:49:26,113
Seung Ryong, just sit here.

1184
00:49:26,114 --> 00:49:27,513
The guests don't move.

1185
00:49:27,514 --> 00:49:29,284
(Seung Ryong, you're a guest. You sit.)

1186
00:49:30,025 --> 00:49:31,553
Where is the potato peeler?

1187
00:49:31,554 --> 00:49:32,993
It's here, right here.

1188
00:49:32,994 --> 00:49:34,655
Hee Won, you're steaming the whelks first, right?

1189
00:49:35,565 --> 00:49:37,965
(Everyone seems busy.)

1190
00:49:38,664 --> 00:49:39,664
Can I...

1191
00:49:39,665 --> 00:49:41,334
(He stood up to help?)

1192
00:49:41,335 --> 00:49:43,434
Once you get out of that chair, you will be working.

1193
00:49:43,965 --> 00:49:45,973
- No, I just want to take this off.
- All right.

1194
00:49:45,974 --> 00:49:47,004
Because I feel hot.

1195
00:49:47,005 --> 00:49:49,175
(Although that's what he said...)

1196
00:49:51,005 --> 00:49:53,315
Na Ra. Do you... Well...

1197
00:49:55,184 --> 00:49:56,744
Yes, what?

1198
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,684
Are you murmuring, Seung Ryong?

1199
00:49:59,014 --> 00:50:00,613
- "Murmuring?" - You seem you're doing fine, so...

1200
00:50:00,614 --> 00:50:02,184
(You seem you're doing fine.)

1201
00:50:02,655 --> 00:50:05,554
(Hee Won, who is making the whelk salad and noodles, is...)

1202
00:50:05,724 --> 00:50:08,564
For the sauce, gochujang, vinegar, and sugar...

1203
00:50:08,565 --> 00:50:10,694
(mumbling the condiments on the recipe.)

1204
00:50:10,695 --> 00:50:12,494
One spoon like this.

1205
00:50:13,795 --> 00:50:15,504
(He started with a spoon of gochujang.)

1206
00:50:15,505 --> 00:50:16,604
One spoon.

1207
00:50:16,605 --> 00:50:18,374
Two spoons? Maybe?

1208
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:19,675
(Is it too little? Maybe two spoons?)

1209
00:50:20,175 --> 00:50:21,274
Okay, good.

1210
00:50:21,275 --> 00:50:22,874
(Carefully adding one more spoon)

1211
00:50:22,875 --> 00:50:23,875
Sugar...

1212
00:50:23,876 --> 00:50:26,014
(Sugar...)

1213
00:50:26,414 --> 00:50:27,715
Can you make sure the amount?

1214
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:31,814
(He's trying to be careful so that he wouldn't pour it like last time.)

1215
00:50:31,815 --> 00:50:33,754
- How is it? Is it enough?
- Yes, I think so.

1216
00:50:33,755 --> 00:50:34,824
- Good?
- Yes.

1217
00:50:35,655 --> 00:50:37,754
How about the vinegar? Is it enough?

1218
00:50:37,755 --> 00:50:38,795
Yes.

1219
00:50:39,094 --> 00:50:40,524
And is this enough for the minced garlic?

1220
00:50:40,525 --> 00:50:42,823
- That's good. That's enough.
- Okay.

1221
00:50:42,824 --> 00:50:43,824
Okay, good.

1222
00:50:44,565 --> 00:50:47,764
(Mixing the sauce well)

1223
00:50:48,204 --> 00:50:49,263
- Na Ra.
- Yes?

1224
00:50:49,264 --> 00:50:50,964
(Look, Na Ra.)

1225
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,304
Taste it with your finger.

1226
00:50:53,735 --> 00:50:56,045
(Let's see.)

1227
00:50:56,405 --> 00:50:57,774
Hee Won, you made it nice.

1228
00:50:57,775 --> 00:50:59,143
- How is it?
- It's great.

1229
00:50:59,144 --> 00:51:00,314
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1230
00:51:00,315 --> 00:51:02,414
- It's good?
- Yes.

1231
00:51:02,844 --> 00:51:04,545
- Really?
- It's so good.

1232
00:51:04,885 --> 00:51:06,355
- All right then.
- You did a good job.

1233
00:51:07,054 --> 00:51:08,454
- Okay then.
- Good.

1234
00:51:08,954 --> 00:51:10,625
I'll chop these for you.

1235
00:51:10,954 --> 00:51:14,025
(Meanwhile, Na Ra is...)

1236
00:51:15,164 --> 00:51:17,263
(helping Hee Won and chopping the vegetables for the dish.)

1237
00:51:17,264 --> 00:51:19,264
Good. Everything's going great.

1238
00:51:19,565 --> 00:51:20,964
Everything's going perfect.

1239
00:51:20,965 --> 00:51:22,934
I think we're making it too fast.

1240
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:27,204
I think I'll burn the charcoal before using it.

1241
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:31,175
(Is there anything I can help with?)

1242
00:51:31,945 --> 00:51:34,844
(Seung Ryong is wandering to find something he could help with.)

1243
00:51:36,784 --> 00:51:39,154
- Can I do this at least?
- Do you want?

1244
00:51:39,155 --> 00:51:40,914
(Dong Il, can I do this at least?)

1245
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,823
(Look at him.)

1246
00:51:42,824 --> 00:51:44,585
- I have nothing to do.
- Hey guys, look at him.

1247
00:51:44,855 --> 00:51:46,754
The delivery will be here soon. You can get that for us.

1248
00:51:46,755 --> 00:51:48,194
Okay. Now I don't know what to do.

1249
00:51:48,195 --> 00:51:49,624
You feel sorry for us?

1250
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:50,863
- Of course he feels that way.
- Because you're not doing anything?

1251
00:51:50,864 --> 00:51:51,933
I can understand.

1252
00:51:51,934 --> 00:51:53,764
It's better to do something rather than sitting.

1253
00:51:54,094 --> 00:51:55,734
(Maybe I can help with this.)

1254
00:51:55,735 --> 00:51:56,735
Seung Ryong.

1255
00:51:57,335 --> 00:51:58,504
- You're shaking it?
- Seung Ryong.

1256
00:51:58,505 --> 00:52:00,175
- Yes?
- Get the delivery.

1257
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:03,105
(Seung Ryong, get the delivery.)

1258
00:52:04,105 --> 00:52:05,143
Hello.

1259
00:52:05,144 --> 00:52:06,944
(He is gladly receiving the delivery as he has something to do now.)

1260
00:52:06,945 --> 00:52:08,284
Gosh, these are heavy.

1261
00:52:08,514 --> 00:52:11,684
This is so funny. How come he's so cute?

1262
00:52:11,885 --> 00:52:12,914
- My gosh.
- Okay. Now...

1263
00:52:13,554 --> 00:52:15,183
put them down there. On the table.

1264
00:52:15,184 --> 00:52:17,125
These are heavy. How did he carry them like they are nothing?

1265
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:22,823
You'll be so surprised.

1266
00:52:22,824 --> 00:52:24,795
(As soon as he put them down, he started to open the boxes.)

1267
00:52:25,094 --> 00:52:26,134
(Exclaiming)

1268
00:52:26,135 --> 00:52:27,664
Guys, come look at the size of the whelks.

1269
00:52:28,405 --> 00:52:31,303
(Her jaw drops as soon as she sees them.)

1270
00:52:31,304 --> 00:52:33,835
- They are whelks?
- Look how big they are.

1271
00:52:33,974 --> 00:52:35,444
These are called white whelks.

1272
00:52:35,445 --> 00:52:36,904
Aren't those conch shells?

1273
00:52:36,905 --> 00:52:39,374
(The white whelks will be used for the whelk salad and noodles.)

1274
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:41,143
- This is my first time seeing it.
- They are so expensive.

1275
00:52:41,144 --> 00:52:42,384
(I prepared for them specifically for you guys.)

1276
00:52:42,385 --> 00:52:43,444
- My gosh.
- I haven't seen anything like it.

1277
00:52:43,445 --> 00:52:44,484
(It is as big as a hand.)

1278
00:52:44,485 --> 00:52:46,085
- They look so pretty though.
- Yes, right.

1279
00:52:46,585 --> 00:52:48,013
There must be the kuruma prawns in this box.

1280
00:52:48,014 --> 00:52:49,323
(Out of curiosity, he opens another box as well.)

1281
00:52:49,324 --> 00:52:50,954
You'll be shocked when you see the prawns.

1282
00:52:52,994 --> 00:52:55,624
(What's in this box?)

1283
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:56,925
- What is that?
- These are kuruma prawns.

1284
00:52:57,264 --> 00:52:58,394
Oh, my gosh.

1285
00:52:59,335 --> 00:53:00,363
Look at this.

1286
00:53:00,364 --> 00:53:02,534
(Seung Ryong is carefully taking out a kuruma prawn.)

1287
00:53:03,135 --> 00:53:05,434
It's still alive. Pull it out. Look how big it is.

1288
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,605
(Shaking)

1289
00:53:09,275 --> 00:53:11,574
(They burst out laughing because of Seung Ryong's joke.)

1290
00:53:11,744 --> 00:53:13,945
- They are still alive.
- He's an acting genius.

1291
00:53:14,985 --> 00:53:16,914
(His hand acting is detailed.)

1292
00:53:17,244 --> 00:53:18,453
Good. He is so great.

1293
00:53:18,454 --> 00:53:20,385
(What are the fresh ingredients for today?)

1294
00:53:20,715 --> 00:53:22,953
(Beyond the lake in front of their house...)

1295
00:53:22,954 --> 00:53:26,994
(lies the sea in the distance.)

1296
00:53:27,894 --> 00:53:32,795
(Dong Il prepared for the seasonal ingredients caught in the East Sea.)

1297
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:39,275
(The kuruma prawns are known as one of the best types of prawns.)

1298
00:53:39,574 --> 00:53:43,204
(The key features of it are the firm texture and the yellowish tail.)

1299
00:53:43,445 --> 00:53:46,775
(It's delicious when it's roasted.)

1300
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:50,485
(But it is the finest ingredient which can be eaten raw as well.)

1301
00:53:50,784 --> 00:53:54,014
(The next ingredient is white whelks.)

1302
00:53:54,514 --> 00:53:57,485
(The flesh of white whelks is soft and white.)

1303
00:53:57,925 --> 00:54:01,554
(It's delicious with chojang when it's steamed.)

1304
00:54:01,824 --> 00:54:05,565
(Today, they are going to use it to make the whelk salad and noodles.)

1305
00:54:05,994 --> 00:54:07,564
(And here comes the ingredient that Seung Ryong wanted.)

1306
00:54:07,565 --> 00:54:09,835
- It looks excellent.
- It's Korean beef sirloin.

1307
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:11,234
That one is strip loin.

1308
00:54:11,235 --> 00:54:12,574
(Dong Il prepared for beef too.)

1309
00:54:12,974 --> 00:54:15,875
Eat a lot and re-energize yourself before leaving, okay?

1310
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:19,214
- It's my first time seeing this.
- Isn't it huge?

1311
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:22,744
(Seung Ryong is impressed by the prawns that Dong Il prepared.)

1312
00:54:24,315 --> 00:54:25,854
(He cannot take his eyes off.)

1313
00:54:25,855 --> 00:54:26,953
You can eat it raw, right?

1314
00:54:26,954 --> 00:54:28,154
Gosh, I'd love that.

1315
00:54:28,155 --> 00:54:29,925
Let's peel it and try it raw.

1316
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,254
- Do you need a knife?
- Yes.

1317
00:54:31,255 --> 00:54:33,654
(Seung Ryong is peeling the prawn right away.)

1318
00:54:33,655 --> 00:54:34,994
My gosh, you're good at it.

1319
00:54:36,465 --> 00:54:37,493
Can you give me the scissors?

1320
00:54:37,494 --> 00:54:38,864
- No, I don't need them.
- Here, use these.

1321
00:54:39,195 --> 00:54:41,264
- I'm done. I already peeled it.
- Already?

1322
00:54:42,434 --> 00:54:43,533
Here, Dong Il.

1323
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:44,605
(You try it first.)

1324
00:54:44,835 --> 00:54:46,635
You go ahead first.

1325
00:54:48,644 --> 00:54:49,905
Look. We're eating kuruma prawns.

1326
00:54:50,804 --> 00:54:51,843
Already?

1327
00:54:51,844 --> 00:54:53,144
- Na Ra.
- Yes?

1328
00:54:53,815 --> 00:54:55,283
- Is that a kuruma prawn?
- Yes.

1329
00:54:55,284 --> 00:54:58,485
(He is taking a bite of a fresh raw kuruma prawn.)

1330
00:54:59,085 --> 00:55:01,113
- Just like that?
- To see if it's okay to eat it raw.

1331
00:55:01,114 --> 00:55:02,155
Seriously, just like that?

1332
00:55:03,684 --> 00:55:05,254
We want to see if it's okay to eat it raw or not.

1333
00:55:05,255 --> 00:55:06,894
(We want to see if it's okay to eat it raw or not.)

1334
00:55:06,994 --> 00:55:08,024
How is it?

1335
00:55:08,025 --> 00:55:10,795
(Exclaiming)

1336
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:11,934
Try it.

1337
00:55:12,195 --> 00:55:13,294
(Seung Ryong is also tasting a kuruma prawn.)

1338
00:55:13,295 --> 00:55:14,364
It's so fleshy.

1339
00:55:18,005 --> 00:55:20,274
- This is amazing.
- Is it delicious? It's amazing?

1340
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,304
(How is it?)

1341
00:55:21,635 --> 00:55:25,614
(This is so delicious.)

1342
00:55:26,175 --> 00:55:27,243
(The fresh taste with the chewy texture)

1343
00:55:27,244 --> 00:55:29,344
- I'll peel it for you.
- Come try this prawn.

1344
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,284
- Is it that good?
- Totally.

1345
00:55:32,215 --> 00:55:34,254
It's completely different from the normal shrimps we know.

1346
00:55:34,255 --> 00:55:36,553
- Is that right? Is it chewy?
- Absolutely.

1347
00:55:36,554 --> 00:55:37,724
(Is it chewy? Absolutely.)

1348
00:55:39,094 --> 00:55:40,124
Just try it. It's good.

1349
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:41,323
I want to taste it too.

1350
00:55:41,324 --> 00:55:42,464
- Come quick.
- It's so fresh.

1351
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:43,525
(I want to taste it too.)

1352
00:55:44,565 --> 00:55:47,364
Gosh, I think I'll be eating a lot again today.

1353
00:55:48,364 --> 00:55:49,465
I'll peel it for you.

1354
00:55:49,864 --> 00:55:51,104
Come here. Try one.

1355
00:55:51,105 --> 00:55:52,334
- Hee Won, try it.
- Okay.

1356
00:55:52,335 --> 00:55:54,175
Seung Ryong, you're so good at peeling prawns.

1357
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:55,803
- Yes, I am good at it.
- That's big.

1358
00:55:55,804 --> 00:55:57,243
- Yes.
- That is for me?

1359
00:55:57,244 --> 00:55:58,405
- Yes.
- Try it with chojang.

1360
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:04,315
(He peels one more in a flash.)

1361
00:56:05,114 --> 00:56:06,254
Here. It's yours.

1362
00:56:06,255 --> 00:56:07,655
(Here. It's yours.)

1363
00:56:08,215 --> 00:56:10,484
(I can't wait.)

1364
00:56:10,485 --> 00:56:13,054
- This is how I should eat it?
- Yes, with a lot of chojang.

1365
00:56:14,795 --> 00:56:16,363
Separate the heads. We can roast them to eat.

1366
00:56:16,364 --> 00:56:17,593
I peeled them separately.

1367
00:56:17,594 --> 00:56:18,694
Oh my, I'm so excited.

1368
00:56:18,695 --> 00:56:21,335
- We could eat it too.
- Really?

1369
00:56:21,764 --> 00:56:24,565
- You're right. There's more in it.
- Yes.

1370
00:56:25,835 --> 00:56:26,875
Totally.

1371
00:56:27,835 --> 00:56:29,744
Isn't it so chewy?

1372
00:56:30,105 --> 00:56:32,674
How can it be so firm?

1373
00:56:32,675 --> 00:56:33,875
- It really is, isn't it?
- Yes.

1374
00:56:35,514 --> 00:56:37,315
It tastes so great. I've never had it like this before.

1375
00:56:38,684 --> 00:56:41,155
(Myoung is also taking a bite.)

1376
00:56:42,224 --> 00:56:43,385
He's so good at peeling it.

1377
00:56:43,824 --> 00:56:44,954
Have you tried something like this before?

1378
00:56:45,525 --> 00:56:47,254
This is my first time. It's marvelous.

1379
00:56:47,255 --> 00:56:48,493
- Isn't it so great?
- Yes, it is.

1380
00:56:48,494 --> 00:56:50,094
(Everyone is fascinated by the sweet taste of kuruma prawn.)

1381
00:56:50,224 --> 00:56:51,294
(Let's see.)

1382
00:56:51,295 --> 00:56:53,795
I think he has also worked on boats.

1383
00:56:54,695 --> 00:56:56,404
- He's so good at peeling it.
- How can you be so good?

1384
00:56:56,405 --> 00:56:57,604
I know, right? This is unexpected.

1385
00:56:57,605 --> 00:56:59,434
Come on, I have done this a lot.

1386
00:57:01,074 --> 00:57:02,743
Thank you, Seung Ryong. Why don't you take a break?

1387
00:57:02,744 --> 00:57:03,874
(Seung Ryong, thank you for peeling the prawns.)

1388
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:05,044
Thank you for peeling the prawns.

1389
00:57:05,045 --> 00:57:06,945
(After he peeled the prawns for everyone...)

1390
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:09,715
(Is there anything I can do?)

1391
00:57:10,085 --> 00:57:13,215
(Peeking around)

1392
00:57:14,454 --> 00:57:16,485
How do you get the water? Is there a water tank inside?

1393
00:57:16,655 --> 00:57:18,424
There's the tank we can fill.

1394
00:57:18,425 --> 00:57:20,625
Is that right?

1395
00:57:20,925 --> 00:57:22,664
But the water runs out so quickly.

1396
00:57:22,965 --> 00:57:26,434
(I see.)

1397
00:57:26,764 --> 00:57:30,034
(Right at that moment, a whirring sound is heard.)

1398
00:57:30,434 --> 00:57:31,504
It's the water tank.

1399
00:57:31,505 --> 00:57:32,505
(Maybe we ran out of water again.)

1400
00:57:32,506 --> 00:57:33,574
Why is it suddenly making noise?

1401
00:57:34,974 --> 00:57:37,004
- Seung Ryong.
- Yes?

1402
00:57:37,005 --> 00:57:38,614
Do you want to fill the water tank?

1403
00:57:39,545 --> 00:57:41,573
- The water tank?
- It's on the side of the house.

1404
00:57:41,574 --> 00:57:42,643
Okay.

1405
00:57:42,644 --> 00:57:44,985
It seems the two of you are closer now.

1406
00:57:45,184 --> 00:57:47,113
Filling the water tank isn't a one-person job.

1407
00:57:47,114 --> 00:57:49,454
(It's hard to do it by myself.)

1408
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:51,993
(Come on.)

1409
00:57:51,994 --> 00:57:53,453
We both have back problems,

1410
00:57:53,454 --> 00:57:56,093
- We both have back pain, so...
- so we could help each other.

1411
00:57:56,094 --> 00:57:58,093
Hee Won, be honest. You just want to do it with him, right?

1412
00:57:58,094 --> 00:57:59,094
No, it's not like that.

1413
00:58:00,195 --> 00:58:02,105
- I'll lift it up.
- Okay.

1414
00:58:02,704 --> 00:58:03,834
- I'll hold it from here, and...
- It's heavy.

1415
00:58:03,835 --> 00:58:04,864
(Hee Won and Seung Ryong are filling the water tank together.)

1416
00:58:05,164 --> 00:58:06,703
Dong Il, we're in good harmony.

1417
00:58:06,704 --> 00:58:07,704
(Are they doing okay?)

1418
00:58:08,204 --> 00:58:10,573
Seung Ryong, among all the guests we had so far,

1419
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:12,815
you're holding the jug in the most stable way.

1420
00:58:13,244 --> 00:58:14,244
I mean, seriously...

1421
00:58:14,245 --> 00:58:15,314
(Like this...)

1422
00:58:15,315 --> 00:58:17,545
That is a beautiful way to hold the jug.

1423
00:58:17,815 --> 00:58:18,884
Of course.

1424
00:58:18,885 --> 00:58:20,554
(His fingers are holding it so delicately.)

1425
00:58:20,755 --> 00:58:22,855
He's trembling his hands. I can feel it.

1426
00:58:23,255 --> 00:58:25,525
- Because he has no energy.
- I'm exhausted.

1427
00:58:25,795 --> 00:58:26,954
You two have good chemistry.

1428
00:58:28,994 --> 00:58:31,194
They are so funny, aren't they?

1429
00:58:31,195 --> 00:58:32,465
(They are very funny.)

1430
00:58:32,594 --> 00:58:33,764
They are funny guys.

1431
00:58:34,195 --> 00:58:35,464
Do you have to sit like that to hold it?

1432
00:58:35,465 --> 00:58:36,533
(Do you have to sit like that to fill the tank?)

1433
00:58:36,534 --> 00:58:38,875
This is a scientifically calculated posture.

1434
00:58:39,204 --> 00:58:40,474
- Is it?
- For sure.

1435
00:58:41,405 --> 00:58:43,905
They seem like they are making a movie poster or something.

1436
00:58:45,744 --> 00:58:46,774
Look how cute they are.

1437
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:48,784
(I shouldn't miss this.)

1438
00:58:49,014 --> 00:58:50,243
It's like they are making a movie poster or something.

1439
00:58:50,244 --> 00:58:52,013
(We have good chemistry.)

1440
00:58:52,014 --> 00:58:53,755
I'm seeing so much of bromance here.

1441
00:58:56,554 --> 00:58:57,724
You two have good chemistry.

1442
00:58:58,655 --> 00:58:59,655
I think so, right?

1443
00:59:00,994 --> 00:59:01,994
The water is boiling.

1444
00:59:01,995 --> 00:59:03,524
(Meanwhile, the steam is coming out from the pot.)

1445
00:59:03,525 --> 00:59:04,724
Shall we put the whelks now?

1446
00:59:05,795 --> 00:59:07,334
We're putting the whelks into the pot.

1447
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,394
(The whelks are going in.)

1448
00:59:09,465 --> 00:59:10,964
(They are putting the whelks one by one into the pot.)

1449
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:13,234
I've never had fresh whelks before.

1450
00:59:13,235 --> 00:59:15,105
I've only had canned ones so far.

1451
00:59:16,474 --> 00:59:17,843
That heat is weak.

1452
00:59:17,844 --> 00:59:18,875
(The stove isn't as strong as fire.)

1453
00:59:19,914 --> 00:59:21,513
It will take only five minutes here.

1454
00:59:21,514 --> 00:59:22,715
Really?

1455
00:59:25,514 --> 00:59:26,884
(Boiling the pot over high heat)

1456
00:59:26,885 --> 00:59:28,824
This is very effective.

1457
00:59:29,485 --> 00:59:31,224
The charcoal is burning nicely.

1458
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,755
- I think it's the perfect timing.
- Is it?

1459
00:59:36,295 --> 00:59:41,534
(The boat worker is starting to grill kuruma prawns.)

1460
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:46,704
(Placing the prawns side by side over the heated charcoal)

1461
00:59:48,474 --> 00:59:53,175
(Once they are grilled enough,)

1462
00:59:56,315 --> 01:00:01,414
(a piece of beef is being placed by the prawns.)

1463
01:00:01,614 --> 01:00:03,084
Gosh, it looks just remarkable.

1464
01:00:03,085 --> 01:00:04,125
(It looks remarkable.)

1465
01:00:04,255 --> 01:00:06,855
Gosh, this is crazy.

1466
01:00:07,324 --> 01:00:11,664
(As if he were the host, he is cutting the meat too.)

1467
01:00:13,034 --> 01:00:15,534
(I guess it will take more time to finish everything.)

1468
01:00:16,565 --> 01:00:17,735
- Okay, so now...
- You could've switched before.

1469
01:00:18,235 --> 01:00:19,275
This?

1470
01:00:19,974 --> 01:00:21,074
- Seung Ryong.
- Yes?

1471
01:00:21,304 --> 01:00:22,904
- I'm sorry, but...
- Okay.

1472
01:00:22,905 --> 01:00:24,973
can you peel 5 to 6 prawns for me?

1473
01:00:24,974 --> 01:00:26,244
- You want them peeled?
- Yes.

1474
01:00:27,014 --> 01:00:28,985
What is he trying to do?

1475
01:00:29,545 --> 01:00:30,585
I'm curious.

1476
01:00:31,445 --> 01:00:33,683
(Just wait for a moment.)

1477
01:00:33,684 --> 01:00:34,715
Can you give me that plate?

1478
01:00:34,815 --> 01:00:36,855
(Dong Il is slicing the onion into thin pieces.)

1479
01:00:37,085 --> 01:00:40,054
(And he is chopping scallions...)

1480
01:00:40,594 --> 01:00:44,864
(as well as a lot of garlic.)

1481
01:00:45,324 --> 01:00:47,393
(And then he slices off a big chunk of butter.)

1482
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,933
In butter?

1483
01:00:49,934 --> 01:00:51,803
- Yes.
- To stir-fry them?

1484
01:00:51,804 --> 01:00:53,775
- Yes.
- It will be so tasty.

1485
01:00:58,675 --> 01:01:01,174
(Dong Il, are these enough?)

1486
01:01:01,175 --> 01:01:02,184
Okay.

1487
01:01:04,045 --> 01:01:06,814
His facial expression was like the one from "Puss in Boots."

1488
01:01:06,815 --> 01:01:07,984
- He was so cute.
- Yes.

1489
01:01:07,985 --> 01:01:11,183
Now that we're here, I realized he is a cute person.

1490
01:01:11,184 --> 01:01:13,124
Isn't he like this on set as well?

1491
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:14,295
On set, he is...

1492
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:16,163
completely...

1493
01:01:16,164 --> 01:01:19,195
- What? He's so charismatic on set?
- Yes, very much.

1494
01:01:19,965 --> 01:01:21,735
How come he is so cute here?

1495
01:01:22,135 --> 01:01:25,034
(He is showing the cute side of him a lot on House on Wheels.)

1496
01:01:25,335 --> 01:01:26,604
He's actually a very cute person.

1497
01:01:26,605 --> 01:01:28,974
Indeed. I'm seeing a different side of him.

1498
01:01:29,204 --> 01:01:32,815
(He is pretty cute once you get to know him.)

1499
01:01:33,574 --> 01:01:39,485
(Making a cut on each prawn)

1500
01:01:42,554 --> 01:01:45,154
(Seasoning with salt)

1501
01:01:45,155 --> 01:01:48,195
(Dong Il's special menu is ready to be cooked.)

1502
01:01:48,324 --> 01:01:49,524
Look how it's boiling.

1503
01:01:49,525 --> 01:01:51,893
Look at that. That's how it should be boiled up.

1504
01:01:51,894 --> 01:01:53,294
Doesn't it need to be boiled for 20 minutes?

1505
01:01:53,295 --> 01:01:54,994
(The pot with the whelks is boiled up.)

1506
01:01:55,164 --> 01:01:58,364
In gloves... It should be lifted by two people. One on each side.

1507
01:01:59,204 --> 01:02:01,405
- Hold that handle. You move over.
- Okay.

1508
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:03,703
- We have gloves.
- So we will...

1509
01:02:03,704 --> 01:02:05,914
- lift it up and put it down here.
- Okay.

1510
01:02:06,215 --> 01:02:07,744
- Wait. Is it hot?
- No, it's not hot.

1511
01:02:07,844 --> 01:02:08,985
One, two.

1512
01:02:09,514 --> 01:02:11,113
It's really hot.

1513
01:02:11,114 --> 01:02:12,114
It's hot?

1514
01:02:12,115 --> 01:02:13,184
(It was hot?)

1515
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:16,084
(What happened?)

1516
01:02:16,085 --> 01:02:17,553
- It was so hot.
- Where's ice?

1517
01:02:17,554 --> 01:02:18,625
Be careful.

1518
01:02:18,784 --> 01:02:20,354
- Soak your hand.
- Myoung, you didn't feel it hot?

1519
01:02:20,355 --> 01:02:22,763
It wasn't hot at all for me.

1520
01:02:22,764 --> 01:02:24,364
Maybe the fire heated up the handle he held.

1521
01:02:24,594 --> 01:02:27,295
If you say it wasn't hot at all, that makes him look strange.

1522
01:02:27,594 --> 01:02:29,564
- I guess this side was more heated.
- Yes, I think so.

1523
01:02:29,565 --> 01:02:31,734
- Probably the fire heated it up.
- I believe so.

1524
01:02:31,735 --> 01:02:34,104
- I can see this was heated up.
- Yes.

1525
01:02:34,105 --> 01:02:35,544
(It seems the handle Hee Won held was heated up.)

1526
01:02:35,545 --> 01:02:38,573
- But he didn't let go of it.
- Right.

1527
01:02:38,574 --> 01:02:39,574
(He didn't let go of the handle not to ruin the whelks.)

1528
01:02:39,744 --> 01:02:41,073
I think I am all right now.

1529
01:02:41,074 --> 01:02:42,175
- You okay?
- Look.

1530
01:02:43,644 --> 01:02:46,985
I should've lifted it up. I shouldn't have asked him to do it.

1531
01:02:47,114 --> 01:02:50,324
(I have to finish making the whelk salad and noodles though.)

1532
01:02:51,954 --> 01:02:54,093
It's been five minutes. Let's check if they are cooked.

1533
01:02:54,094 --> 01:02:55,094
Okay, let's see.

1534
01:02:57,695 --> 01:03:01,034
(The steam is rising from the pot.)

1535
01:03:01,534 --> 01:03:03,905
- How do I remove it?
- Myoung.

1536
01:03:04,764 --> 01:03:06,804
- Can you...
- Look, it's done.

1537
01:03:07,235 --> 01:03:08,574
It's quite big.

1538
01:03:09,144 --> 01:03:10,643
(You can tell how firm it is just by looking at it.)

1539
01:03:10,644 --> 01:03:11,644
It looks so good.

1540
01:03:11,775 --> 01:03:14,044
(The chef of white whelk is relieved.)

1541
01:03:14,045 --> 01:03:15,744
Give it to me. I'll remove them.

1542
01:03:16,815 --> 01:03:17,884
(Slipping out)

1543
01:03:17,885 --> 01:03:18,885
I'm good at removing them.

1544
01:03:20,554 --> 01:03:21,784
It comes out so smoothly.

1545
01:03:24,184 --> 01:03:27,854
(They gather in a huddle to remove the meat.)

1546
01:03:27,855 --> 01:03:28,855
You should...

1547
01:03:28,856 --> 01:03:30,194
We can wash them in cold water...

1548
01:03:30,195 --> 01:03:31,863
and cut them, right?

1549
01:03:31,864 --> 01:03:32,864
(He memorized the recipe.)

1550
01:03:33,664 --> 01:03:36,905
(Just as Hee Won said...)

1551
01:03:37,804 --> 01:03:41,204
(they wash the whelk meat in cold water.)

1552
01:03:41,505 --> 01:03:44,803
(They remove the guts as well.)

1553
01:03:44,804 --> 01:03:46,144
I should cut them thinly, right?

1554
01:03:46,344 --> 01:03:49,413
(Cut the meat in a small size that befits whelk salad and noodles.)

1555
01:03:49,414 --> 01:03:50,545
It's really big.

1556
01:03:50,815 --> 01:03:52,914
It's called white whelk because it's white.

1557
01:03:55,284 --> 01:03:56,323
It's good.

1558
01:03:56,324 --> 01:03:57,354
(Shall I try one?)

1559
01:03:57,355 --> 01:03:58,453
Try the white whelk.

1560
01:03:58,454 --> 01:03:59,593
(Appearing out of nowhere)

1561
01:03:59,594 --> 01:04:00,894
It's good even when it's not seasoned.

1562
01:04:01,355 --> 01:04:02,723
(It's good as is.)

1563
01:04:02,724 --> 01:04:03,724
Is it good?

1564
01:04:04,894 --> 01:04:06,194
I was going to have a bite,

1565
01:04:06,195 --> 01:04:07,295
but Seung Ryong came with his mouth open.

1566
01:04:07,394 --> 01:04:09,434
Look at him. I'm like a mother bird.

1567
01:04:12,065 --> 01:04:15,704
(Na Ra finally has a bite after feeding Seung Ryong.)

1568
01:04:15,945 --> 01:04:18,204
My, it's so firm. How come it's so firm?

1569
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:21,174
- Shall I put them in here?
- Yes, please.

1570
01:04:21,175 --> 01:04:23,243
(Adding lots of white whelks)

1571
01:04:23,244 --> 01:04:26,114
- This is enough, right?
- I think so.

1572
01:04:26,585 --> 01:04:29,284
(Na Ra finishes up whelk salad and noodles.)

1573
01:04:29,755 --> 01:04:30,985
It looks so good.

1574
01:04:32,224 --> 01:04:34,823
(Will it taste okay?)

1575
01:04:34,824 --> 01:04:37,164
(Shall I try it?)

1576
01:04:40,065 --> 01:04:42,764
(How is it?)

1577
01:04:43,434 --> 01:04:44,465
It's perfect.

1578
01:04:46,804 --> 01:04:48,073
- Hee Won.
- Is it good?

1579
01:04:48,074 --> 01:04:49,844
Yes. Do you want to try some?

1580
01:04:50,204 --> 01:04:53,014
(Hee Won takes a bite as well.)

1581
01:04:54,675 --> 01:04:56,143
It's good, right? It's perfect, right?

1582
01:04:56,144 --> 01:04:57,444
You did a good job with the sauce.

1583
01:04:57,445 --> 01:04:59,184
It's a success.

1584
01:04:59,954 --> 01:05:02,014
- It's really delicious.
- It's a huge success.

1585
01:05:02,885 --> 01:05:03,925
It's good.

1586
01:05:04,784 --> 01:05:06,125
Next is...

1587
01:05:07,594 --> 01:05:09,824
(A special dish that Dong Il prepared)

1588
01:05:10,264 --> 01:05:11,363
Is the heat strong enough?

1589
01:05:11,364 --> 01:05:12,864
(Adding butter and garlic on the pan)

1590
01:05:13,295 --> 01:05:16,764
(When the scent of garlic is absorbed in butter,)

1591
01:05:17,335 --> 01:05:21,335
(he adds plentiful of kuruma prawn.)

1592
01:05:23,574 --> 01:05:26,014
Wow, it looks good.

1593
01:05:27,244 --> 01:05:28,315
Right?

1594
01:05:29,485 --> 01:05:31,444
You used butter? Oh, my. it looks so good.

1595
01:05:31,445 --> 01:05:33,255
Goodness, it smells delicious.

1596
01:05:33,684 --> 01:05:35,783
It smells really delicious.

1597
01:05:35,784 --> 01:05:36,954
- Right?
- Yes.

1598
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:40,024
Wow, it looks really good.

1599
01:05:40,025 --> 01:05:42,294
- It looks amazing, doesn't it?
- It does. I'm so happy.

1600
01:05:42,295 --> 01:05:44,195
Wow, it smells amazing.

1601
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:46,163
I'm salivating.

1602
01:05:46,164 --> 01:05:47,364
I know.

1603
01:05:48,835 --> 01:05:50,363
It looks really good.

1604
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:51,934
Wow, it's incredible.

1605
01:05:52,304 --> 01:05:54,033
My goodness.

1606
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:55,703
(On top of well-done kuruma prawn...)

1607
01:05:55,704 --> 01:05:58,174
Then I'll stir-fry vegetables with the remaining butter.

1608
01:05:58,175 --> 01:05:59,613
You'll add them on top as a garnish, right?

1609
01:05:59,614 --> 01:06:01,844
- Right. I'll add them on top.
- On top?

1610
01:06:04,385 --> 01:06:05,444
All right.

1611
01:06:05,445 --> 01:06:08,354
l was going to make dinner all by myself tonight.

1612
01:06:08,355 --> 01:06:09,424
Right.

1613
01:06:09,425 --> 01:06:11,183
But I couldn't because I hurt my hand.

1614
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:12,594
(You know how I feel, right?)

1615
01:06:12,724 --> 01:06:15,355
(Laughing)

1616
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:17,593
- Seung Ryong, come take a seat.
- Okay.

1617
01:06:17,594 --> 01:06:19,533
Try the kuruma prawn.

1618
01:06:19,534 --> 01:06:20,763
(Try it before it gets cold.)

1619
01:06:20,764 --> 01:06:21,965
And the noodles that Hee Won made.

1620
01:06:24,304 --> 01:06:26,074
Oh, my gosh!

1621
01:06:26,204 --> 01:06:27,204
And the noodles that Hee Won made.

1622
01:06:27,204 --> 01:06:28,204
(A table filled with dishes made with ingredients from the East Sea)

1623
01:06:29,605 --> 01:06:32,005
I didn't know we'd be treated so well.

1624
01:06:32,144 --> 01:06:34,343
- It looks so good.
- Let's put the pot away.

1625
01:06:34,344 --> 01:06:36,445
- It's perfect.
- We always present it nicely.

1626
01:06:36,744 --> 01:06:37,884
This is crazy.

1627
01:06:37,885 --> 01:06:41,014
(From the rare kuruma prawn...)

1628
01:06:41,655 --> 01:06:43,654
- My goodness.
- Wow.

1629
01:06:43,655 --> 01:06:45,625
(to juicy beef and grilled kuruma prawn with butter and garlic)

1630
01:06:46,355 --> 01:06:47,453
Hee Won...

1631
01:06:47,454 --> 01:06:48,454
(And whelk salad and noodles made with Hee Won's sauce)

1632
01:06:48,455 --> 01:06:49,525
made the sauce.

1633
01:06:50,364 --> 01:06:53,494
(They're having another feast for their dinner.)

1634
01:06:54,065 --> 01:06:56,864
- Let's try it.
- Thank you for the food.

1635
01:06:57,204 --> 01:06:59,375
I like its texture. Try it.

1636
01:06:59,775 --> 01:07:01,704
- I'll give you a big piece.
- Thank you.

1637
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:04,105
Dip it in wasabi.

1638
01:07:04,675 --> 01:07:06,545
- It's huge.
- It's for you.

1639
01:07:07,244 --> 01:07:10,843
(Seung Ryong, who's on a diet, tries a bite first.)

1640
01:07:10,844 --> 01:07:11,844
How is it?

1641
01:07:12,144 --> 01:07:13,155
Is it good?

1642
01:07:14,355 --> 01:07:15,514
It's very crunchy.

1643
01:07:16,755 --> 01:07:18,154
The piece was too big.

1644
01:07:18,155 --> 01:07:19,324
I'll dip it in wasabi.

1645
01:07:20,394 --> 01:07:22,564
- That's it.
- Should I put this on top?

1646
01:07:22,565 --> 01:07:24,194
- No, you can just have it as is.
- Can I?

1647
01:07:24,195 --> 01:07:25,564
That way, you can feel its texture.

1648
01:07:25,565 --> 01:07:27,135
(Taking a big bite)

1649
01:07:28,835 --> 01:07:30,905
(Exclaiming)

1650
01:07:31,764 --> 01:07:33,434
It's so good.

1651
01:07:35,475 --> 01:07:36,704
The beef is so good.

1652
01:07:37,175 --> 01:07:38,475
It just melted in my mouth.

1653
01:07:40,145 --> 01:07:42,074
(Surprised)

1654
01:07:42,715 --> 01:07:44,544
- What do you think?
- That'd be better.

1655
01:07:44,545 --> 01:07:46,113
How is it? Is it incredible?

1656
01:07:46,114 --> 01:07:47,783
- Is it that good?
- The beef is...

1657
01:07:47,784 --> 01:07:49,225
The beef is really good!

1658
01:07:50,585 --> 01:07:51,853
The beef is of good quality.

1659
01:07:51,854 --> 01:07:53,024
We should have the beef...

1660
01:07:53,725 --> 01:07:56,663
- with the noodles Hee Won made.
- We should wrap it with noodles.

1661
01:07:56,664 --> 01:07:58,563
We're supposed to have it with noodles.

1662
01:07:58,564 --> 01:07:59,895
(Juicy beef...)

1663
01:08:00,635 --> 01:08:02,764
(and whelk salad and noodles look like they'd go well together.)

1664
01:08:02,765 --> 01:08:04,264
Right, we should have the beef with that.

1665
01:08:04,265 --> 01:08:07,204
- Let's have the noodles with beef.
- Like this. That's it.

1666
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,545
- I should...
- This is it!

1667
01:08:10,204 --> 01:08:11,273
It's beef with whelk salad and noodles.

1668
01:08:11,274 --> 01:08:13,943
- I should wrap it like this.
- Beef with whelk salad and noodles.

1669
01:08:13,944 --> 01:08:15,773
(Taking a bite of beef with whelk salad and noodles)

1670
01:08:15,774 --> 01:08:16,914
This is it.

1671
01:08:17,114 --> 01:08:18,585
(Exclaiming)

1672
01:08:19,045 --> 01:08:20,054
I'm touched.

1673
01:08:20,055 --> 01:08:21,114
How is it?

1674
01:08:22,725 --> 01:08:23,854
It's so good.

1675
01:08:26,024 --> 01:08:29,024
Whelk salad and noodles goes well with beef.

1676
01:08:29,694 --> 01:08:31,124
How is whelk salad and noodles?

1677
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:33,335
- It's good.
- I made the sauce.

1678
01:08:34,095 --> 01:08:35,935
(Well done!)

1679
01:08:36,305 --> 01:08:37,465
He's not saying a word.

1680
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:39,203
- Right?
- Yes.

1681
01:08:39,204 --> 01:08:40,234
(Slurping in noodles together)

1682
01:08:41,975 --> 01:08:43,074
So that's what happened.

1683
01:08:43,574 --> 01:08:45,005
The noodles are really good.

1684
01:08:45,244 --> 01:08:47,144
- It's so good.
- I know, right?

1685
01:08:47,145 --> 01:08:48,813
Seung Ryong, there's another sauce.

1686
01:08:48,814 --> 01:08:49,885
You can dip it in there.

1687
01:08:50,685 --> 01:08:53,114
- It's really refreshing.
- Have it with garlic.

1688
01:08:54,015 --> 01:08:55,353
(Meanwhile...)

1689
01:08:55,354 --> 01:08:56,954
- This is it.
- It's perfect.

1690
01:08:57,255 --> 01:08:59,225
I shouldn't be having noodles, but I can't help myself.

1691
01:09:00,024 --> 01:09:02,095
- I know.
- Beef with whelk salad and noodles.

1692
01:09:02,664 --> 01:09:03,964
Look at this.

1693
01:09:03,965 --> 01:09:04,965
(Wrapping the beef with noodles)

1694
01:09:04,966 --> 01:09:06,095
- Beef with whelk salad and noodles.
- Look.

1695
01:09:07,795 --> 01:09:08,935
This is it.

1696
01:09:09,864 --> 01:09:11,465
(Slurping in)

1697
01:09:12,564 --> 01:09:14,274
(How is it?)

1698
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:19,874
(It's so good.)

1699
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:20,875
It's delicious.

1700
01:09:21,515 --> 01:09:27,015
(He can't hold back. He has another bite.)

1701
01:09:27,555 --> 01:09:29,353
(Is he a dieter...)

1702
01:09:29,354 --> 01:09:30,483
(or a food fighter?)

1703
01:09:30,484 --> 01:09:31,524
It's perfect.

1704
01:09:33,595 --> 01:09:36,664
(By the way...)

1705
01:09:37,095 --> 01:09:39,635
- It has whelk in it, right?
- Yes, this is the whelk.

1706
01:09:39,734 --> 01:09:41,363
- This is the whelk.
- But mine doesn't have any.

1707
01:09:41,364 --> 01:09:42,904
But mine doesn't have any.

1708
01:09:43,664 --> 01:09:44,964
- Not even a piece.
- Here.

1709
01:09:44,965 --> 01:09:46,174
(Grumbling because there's no whelk in his noodles)

1710
01:09:46,175 --> 01:09:47,375
Thank you.

1711
01:09:47,774 --> 01:09:49,134
I guess it wasn't added in yours.

1712
01:09:49,135 --> 01:09:50,144
(A dieter who looks for more food)

1713
01:09:50,145 --> 01:09:51,404
How come there's no whelk in yours?

1714
01:09:51,845 --> 01:09:54,344
(Securing whelk for himself)

1715
01:09:54,345 --> 01:09:55,413
It's really good.

1716
01:09:55,414 --> 01:09:56,914
(He's eating a lot.)

1717
01:09:57,784 --> 01:09:58,845
He looks different, doesn't he?

1718
01:09:59,755 --> 01:10:00,954
(Smiling)

1719
01:10:03,484 --> 01:10:05,023
- Seung Ryong, try this.
- Try it.

1720
01:10:05,024 --> 01:10:06,024
(Try this too.)

1721
01:10:06,025 --> 01:10:07,724
- I think it'll be really good.
- I stir-fried it with butter.

1722
01:10:07,725 --> 01:10:09,255
- Try the prawn.
- It looks really good.

1723
01:10:09,925 --> 01:10:11,625
Have a piece each while it's still hot.

1724
01:10:12,364 --> 01:10:13,834
- All right.
- I'm sure it won't be salty.

1725
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,493
I only added a bit of coarse salt.

1726
01:10:15,494 --> 01:10:16,765
(Seung Ryong, who's having a cheat day, takes a bite first.)

1727
01:10:19,064 --> 01:10:21,104
(Does it taste okay?)

1728
01:10:21,774 --> 01:10:24,175
Have it with the vegetables.

1729
01:10:25,005 --> 01:10:26,715
Have it with garlic too.

1730
01:10:27,274 --> 01:10:30,044
It tastes like a dish sold in a high-end restaurant.

1731
01:10:30,045 --> 01:10:31,045
I know.

1732
01:10:32,085 --> 01:10:35,784
(Will the picky eater like it too?)

1733
01:10:35,984 --> 01:10:38,255
How is it? Does it taste okay?

1734
01:10:39,494 --> 01:10:41,554
- Hee Won.
- It's so good.

1735
01:10:41,555 --> 01:10:44,095
- Really?
- It's not dry at all.

1736
01:10:44,524 --> 01:10:46,264
- You should try one.
- The onion is really good.

1737
01:10:46,265 --> 01:10:47,363
- Hurry.
- I was hoping...

1738
01:10:47,364 --> 01:10:48,435
it would have a garlic scent.

1739
01:10:48,664 --> 01:10:49,903
It's delicious.

1740
01:10:49,904 --> 01:10:51,934
"Delicious?" Is it? Does it taste okay?

1741
01:10:51,935 --> 01:10:54,135
You need to have it with vegetables.

1742
01:10:54,734 --> 01:10:56,273
We should have this as our signature menu.

1743
01:10:56,274 --> 01:10:57,344
(Grilled kuruma prawn with butter and garlic calls for an applause.)

1744
01:10:57,345 --> 01:10:58,604
Is it really good? Do you mean it?

1745
01:10:59,614 --> 01:11:00,744
- How was it?
- It was so good.

1746
01:11:01,545 --> 01:11:02,784
(Exclaiming)

1747
01:11:02,984 --> 01:11:04,814
- It turned out really well.
- It's good.

1748
01:11:05,284 --> 01:11:08,153
- Share the recipe with me.
- My mouth is filled with happiness.

1749
01:11:08,154 --> 01:11:09,353
It turned out really well.

1750
01:11:09,354 --> 01:11:11,284
Wow, it's seriously so good.

1751
01:11:11,755 --> 01:11:13,693
Dong Il, it's like a work of art.

1752
01:11:13,694 --> 01:11:14,854
- Right?
- Yes.

1753
01:11:16,324 --> 01:11:17,725
Share the recipe with me.

1754
01:11:18,194 --> 01:11:20,264
I'm so happy to have my mouth filled with it.

1755
01:11:20,265 --> 01:11:21,364
The sweetness...

1756
01:11:22,034 --> 01:11:24,504
from onion made it more delicious.

1757
01:11:24,505 --> 01:11:25,704
It's so good.

1758
01:11:26,904 --> 01:11:29,475
Seung Ryong peeled one for me, so I should peel one for him too.

1759
01:11:30,305 --> 01:11:31,443
Gosh, the prawn...

1760
01:11:31,444 --> 01:11:33,515
(The kuruma prawn is grilled deliciously.)

1761
01:11:33,944 --> 01:11:37,313
The kuruma prawn is...

1762
01:11:37,314 --> 01:11:38,844
(The dieter eats everything well.)

1763
01:11:38,845 --> 01:11:41,685
Here, Na Ra. Try this.

1764
01:11:41,885 --> 01:11:42,885
Myoung.

1765
01:11:42,886 --> 01:11:43,983
(Dong Il peels the prawn for everyone.)

1766
01:11:43,984 --> 01:11:45,924
Try it. Share it with Hee Won.

1767
01:11:45,925 --> 01:11:46,925
Okay.

1768
01:11:46,926 --> 01:11:49,925
(Endlessly having a dish after another)

1769
01:11:50,164 --> 01:11:51,264
It's so good.

1770
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:52,834
(The food master Myoung has the prawn with beef.)

1771
01:11:52,835 --> 01:11:54,895
- How is it?
- Is it good?

1772
01:11:55,465 --> 01:11:57,334
Have the big piece. Have the big one, Seung Ryong.

1773
01:11:57,335 --> 01:11:58,335
It's crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.

1774
01:11:58,336 --> 01:11:59,874
Na Ra, can you cut this for me?

1775
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:01,533
- Shall I cut it for you?
- Can you cut it with scissors?

1776
01:12:01,534 --> 01:12:03,474
Hee Won must really like it.

1777
01:12:03,475 --> 01:12:04,504
(Hee Won's favorite is kuruma prawn with butter and garlic.)

1778
01:12:04,505 --> 01:12:05,805
- That's...
- Dong Il, it tastes like...

1779
01:12:06,744 --> 01:12:09,044
a delicious dish...

1780
01:12:09,045 --> 01:12:11,645
from Southeast Asia.

1781
01:12:12,585 --> 01:12:14,414
(Proud)

1782
01:12:15,354 --> 01:12:17,054
It'll be nice to mix rice...

1783
01:12:17,055 --> 01:12:18,754
- Try it.
- in the sauce.

1784
01:12:18,755 --> 01:12:20,425
- It'll be nice to fry rice with it.
- Right.

1785
01:12:20,824 --> 01:12:22,493
It'll be really delicious if it's fried on high heat.

1786
01:12:22,494 --> 01:12:23,563
Shall I make it for you?

1787
01:12:23,564 --> 01:12:25,424
Well, we can't miss out on fried rice.

1788
01:12:25,425 --> 01:12:27,134
- Exactly.
- Shall we fry rice with this?

1789
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,295
Bring some more rice.

1790
01:12:28,534 --> 01:12:30,533
It's what Myoung wants to have.

1791
01:12:30,534 --> 01:12:31,664
I can make anything for him.

1792
01:12:32,404 --> 01:12:34,904
(Today's dinner is really good.)

1793
01:12:36,345 --> 01:12:38,903
(Taking a big scoop)

1794
01:12:38,904 --> 01:12:41,074
(Taking two scoops)

1795
01:12:41,944 --> 01:12:44,614
(While everyone is busy preparing to make fried rice,)

1796
01:12:44,814 --> 01:12:46,653
(there's a man who's in agony.)

1797
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:48,854
Should I eat it or not?

1798
01:12:49,484 --> 01:12:50,584
- Just eat.
- Just est.

1799
01:12:50,585 --> 01:12:52,554
- Just enjoy it for tonight.
- Right. Let's just enjoy it.

1800
01:12:52,555 --> 01:12:54,124
You should.

1801
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:55,193
I might gain weight.

1802
01:12:55,194 --> 01:12:57,163
If you eat like this every day, you will.

1803
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:58,164
(It's a little too late to worry about that.)

1804
01:12:58,465 --> 01:13:00,795
As long as you don't eat after 7pm, it's fine.

1805
01:13:01,064 --> 01:13:02,363
But it's hard not to.

1806
01:13:02,364 --> 01:13:04,965
- It is. It's already past 7pm.
- It is.

1807
01:13:06,335 --> 01:13:08,104
Do you want to hear something shocking?

1808
01:13:08,404 --> 01:13:09,675
It's not even 7pm.

1809
01:13:10,704 --> 01:13:12,974
- It's not 7pm yet.
- You can still eat more.

1810
01:13:12,975 --> 01:13:16,344
- Wow, it's not 7pm yet.
- It's two minutes...

1811
01:13:16,345 --> 01:13:17,845
- Then why did I eat so much?
- before 7pm.

1812
01:13:18,085 --> 01:13:19,313
It's 2 to 3 minutes before 7pm.

1813
01:13:19,314 --> 01:13:21,153
You can eat more for two minutes.

1814
01:13:21,154 --> 01:13:22,853
- Okay.
- You still have two more minutes.

1815
01:13:22,854 --> 01:13:24,425
I'm going to have it all.

1816
01:13:25,185 --> 01:13:28,354
(The grand finale of the splendid dinner)

1817
01:13:29,824 --> 01:13:34,465
(Kuruma prawn fried rice that they came up with on the spot)

1818
01:13:35,135 --> 01:13:36,265
I should break down the rice.

1819
01:13:36,935 --> 01:13:38,863
This is the real fried rice with shrimp.

1820
01:13:38,864 --> 01:13:40,203
You're right.

1821
01:13:40,204 --> 01:13:42,274
- It's fried rice with shrimp.
- It is.

1822
01:13:43,274 --> 01:13:46,145
(Myoung seasons it with salt.)

1823
01:13:48,045 --> 01:13:50,885
(And Chef Sung shows off his fancy wok work.)

1824
01:13:52,444 --> 01:13:53,684
It looks insanely good.

1825
01:13:53,685 --> 01:13:55,015
(Finishing it with sesame seeds)

1826
01:13:55,954 --> 01:13:56,983
(Cheering)

1827
01:13:56,984 --> 01:13:58,653
(Cheering)

1828
01:13:58,654 --> 01:13:59,853
It looks so good.

1829
01:13:59,854 --> 01:14:01,724
My goodness.

1830
01:14:01,725 --> 01:14:02,894
(They finished making the fried rice in no time.)

1831
01:14:02,895 --> 01:14:04,863
It's all about presentation.

1832
01:14:04,864 --> 01:14:06,064
That's all it matters.

1833
01:14:06,795 --> 01:14:09,434
All right. Give it a taste, everyone.

1834
01:14:09,435 --> 01:14:10,704
Try a bite.

1835
01:14:10,835 --> 01:14:11,835
(Smiling)

1836
01:14:11,836 --> 01:14:12,864
It looks so good.

1837
01:14:13,935 --> 01:14:14,974
(Taking a bite naturally)

1838
01:14:14,975 --> 01:14:17,005
- It looks really hot.
- It should be hot.

1839
01:14:17,675 --> 01:14:19,814
(I'll just give it a taste.)

1840
01:14:20,614 --> 01:14:21,743
(Impressed)

1841
01:14:21,744 --> 01:14:22,774
Does it taste okay?

1842
01:14:22,984 --> 01:14:24,345
(Exclaiming)

1843
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:26,614
- You want some more?
- Don't spill it.

1844
01:14:26,984 --> 01:14:28,614
You should try a bite too.

1845
01:14:28,784 --> 01:14:29,784
Try it.

1846
01:14:29,785 --> 01:14:31,754
(Myoung takes a bite of the fried rice...)

1847
01:14:31,755 --> 01:14:33,823
(he's been hoping to have.)

1848
01:14:33,824 --> 01:14:35,194
Just leave it there.

1849
01:14:38,564 --> 01:14:40,465
(Exclaiming)

1850
01:14:43,265 --> 01:14:45,505
(Chef Sung, who made the fried rice in no time, tries a bite too.)

1851
01:14:46,274 --> 01:14:48,204
You seasoned it so well.

1852
01:14:50,175 --> 01:14:51,374
It's really clean.

1853
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:53,045
- It really is, right?
- Yes.

1854
01:14:54,175 --> 01:14:55,244
It's crispy too.

1855
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:57,784
I think we should sell it.

1856
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,515
(It's just too good!)

1857
01:15:01,314 --> 01:15:02,354
(Having another bite)

1858
01:15:02,954 --> 01:15:04,954
I thought you were going to have just one bite.

1859
01:15:05,354 --> 01:15:06,395
I shouldn't have...

1860
01:15:07,024 --> 01:15:09,394
Just leave it there.

1861
01:15:09,395 --> 01:15:10,465
(Having a third bite)

1862
01:15:11,064 --> 01:15:12,064
Let me help you.

1863
01:15:12,664 --> 01:15:13,734
(Exclaiming)

1864
01:15:14,364 --> 01:15:15,493
It's so savory.

1865
01:15:15,494 --> 01:15:16,504
- Right?
- Yes.

1866
01:15:16,505 --> 01:15:18,504
It's not too salty. It's seasoned perfectly.

1867
01:15:18,505 --> 01:15:19,564
(Satisfied)

1868
01:15:19,675 --> 01:15:21,135
The fried rice is really good.

1869
01:15:21,574 --> 01:15:22,734
Have it with beef.

1870
01:15:24,444 --> 01:15:26,073
(I want to have some more.)

1871
01:15:26,074 --> 01:15:27,875
- You want some more?
- Let me have one more bite.

1872
01:15:30,614 --> 01:15:31,614
(Dropping)

1873
01:15:31,615 --> 01:15:33,014
- Here you go.
- You dropped the prawn.

1874
01:15:33,015 --> 01:15:35,254
- Did I?
- The one on the pan.

1875
01:15:35,255 --> 01:15:36,453
- Over here.
- This one?

1876
01:15:36,454 --> 01:15:37,555
Yes, yes.

1877
01:15:41,395 --> 01:15:42,725
Seung Ryong...

1878
01:15:43,425 --> 01:15:45,323
is on a diet and working out,

1879
01:15:45,324 --> 01:15:47,594
so I'm really grateful that he's enjoying it.

1880
01:15:47,595 --> 01:15:50,435
(I'll start my diet tomorrow.)

1881
01:15:51,204 --> 01:15:53,533
I think we're getting better at cooking.

1882
01:15:53,534 --> 01:15:55,305
Right, they are.

1883
01:15:55,574 --> 01:15:56,874
- Right?
- We're getting better.

1884
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:58,243
In Season One,

1885
01:15:58,244 --> 01:16:00,114
there were quite a lot of dishes that I said was good when it wasn't.

1886
01:16:01,045 --> 01:16:05,345
(Hee Won's sudden confession)

1887
01:16:05,614 --> 01:16:07,585
It wasn't that bad,

1888
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:09,954
but there was nothing that impressive.

1889
01:16:10,185 --> 01:16:12,755
But I think we're getting better and better.

1890
01:16:13,024 --> 01:16:14,255
I ate too much today.

1891
01:16:15,055 --> 01:16:16,295
Gosh, I'm so full.

1892
01:16:16,494 --> 01:16:18,124
There's not much left. It's almost finished.

1893
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:20,965
It'll be wonderful if we have a cup of tea after this.

1894
01:16:21,064 --> 01:16:22,295
- Right.
- A cup of tea?

1895
01:16:22,564 --> 01:16:24,334
- Right. Seung Ryong brought it.
- Let's try it.

1896
01:16:24,335 --> 01:16:25,564
Let's have a tea ceremony.

1897
01:16:25,765 --> 01:16:28,103
- Let's finish this first.
- Ha Nee said she learned it...

1898
01:16:28,104 --> 01:16:30,974
- She said she learned it from you.
- from you. She brought the tea.

1899
01:16:30,975 --> 01:16:31,975
Then today...

1900
01:16:32,074 --> 01:16:33,974
- The student has become the master.
- That's right.

1901
01:16:33,975 --> 01:16:35,715
Ha Nee is having...

1902
01:16:36,145 --> 01:16:37,685
more tea gatherings than I am.

1903
01:16:38,085 --> 01:16:41,354
Once she sets her hands on something, she does it properly.

1904
01:16:42,814 --> 01:16:45,555
(Seung Ryong taught Ha Nee how to have a tea ceremony.)

1905
01:16:46,255 --> 01:16:48,854
(My tea ceremony master)

1906
01:16:49,694 --> 01:16:51,124
(When Ha Nee came last time,)

1907
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:52,564
(she taught tea ceremonies to the members.)

1908
01:16:53,194 --> 01:16:56,135
(I actually learned it from Seung Ryong.)

1909
01:16:56,664 --> 01:16:59,435
(Please be easy on me since this won't be too formal.)

1910
01:16:59,604 --> 01:17:02,274
(I haven't even seen the informal version.)

1911
01:17:02,475 --> 01:17:05,103
- Let's see how the formal one goes.
- It must be different.

1912
01:17:05,104 --> 01:17:06,975
Let's check out the formal one.

1913
01:17:07,645 --> 01:17:10,144
You can just drink however you want. I do it without formalities.

1914
01:17:10,145 --> 01:17:13,114
(Seung Ryong is today's brewer. How will his tea ceremony go?)

1915
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,360
(Quietly moving)

1916
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:18,629
- Shall I bring it over, then?
- Yes, go ahead.

1917
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:19,969
(Seung Ryong heads to the cart that he brought in the morning.)

1918
01:17:20,639 --> 01:17:24,139
(He takes out a lot of things from it.)

1919
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:26,979
(What's all that?)

1920
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:30,410
He brought so much stuff.

1921
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:32,179
No, it's nothing.

1922
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,718
I thought I brought the water.

1923
01:17:35,719 --> 01:17:37,019
I brought the tray.

1924
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:38,919
We should boil the water too, right?

1925
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,258
Yes, can you boil water for me? I'll set this up.

1926
01:17:41,259 --> 01:17:42,558
Where? Can I just boil it in anything?

1927
01:17:42,559 --> 01:17:43,928
- A kettle?
- Should I boil it in a kettle?

1928
01:17:43,929 --> 01:17:44,989
You can boil it in anything.

1929
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:46,229
(He sounds cool.)

1930
01:17:46,729 --> 01:17:49,098
(What's in the box that Seung Ryong brought?)

1931
01:17:49,099 --> 01:17:52,499
Oh, this must be the tea set.

1932
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,968
It's so pretty. It looks like a toolbox.

1933
01:17:54,969 --> 01:17:56,000
It's looking good.

1934
01:17:56,509 --> 01:17:58,610
Why don't you assemble them for me?

1935
01:17:59,339 --> 01:18:00,380
Oh, my.

1936
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,308
(It opens on both sides like an actual toolbox?)

1937
01:18:02,309 --> 01:18:04,809
What's this? I've never seen it before.

1938
01:18:05,009 --> 01:18:07,519
(Fascinated)

1939
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,119
This is...

1940
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,219
(Let me take these out first.)

1941
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,449
(There's quite a lot of tea leaves in the tea set.)

1942
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:13,519
That's...

1943
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:15,519
What leaves are in there?

1944
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,229
I got everything. I got all kinds.

1945
01:18:19,089 --> 01:18:20,699
We can move this.

1946
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,798
(He brought so many that they fell off the table.)

1947
01:18:21,799 --> 01:18:23,129
- Is it set?
- I can put them here.

1948
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:25,398
Push it forward a little. Wouldn't it be uncomfortable?

1949
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:26,468
Move this.

1950
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:27,499
(He brought so many.)

1951
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,500
Let's see.

1952
01:18:28,501 --> 01:18:30,509
(I'll put the tea leaves here.)

1953
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:32,239
Try assembling it.

1954
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,939
- How? It's my first time seeing it.
- How do we do it?

1955
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,080
What's this?

1956
01:18:35,081 --> 01:18:36,849
- I don't know.
- It's my first time seeing it.

1957
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:38,949
We'll begin.

1958
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:41,548
(Ha Nee's tea set was complete when she brought it.)

1959
01:18:41,549 --> 01:18:45,219
(But Seung Ryong's tea set looks quite different.)

1960
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:48,419
- Doesn't it look like Lego?
- How do we assemble them?

1961
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:49,928
How can you tell us to assemble them when we don't know anything?

1962
01:18:49,929 --> 01:18:52,429
You can place them on top. That's how you assemble them.

1963
01:18:52,589 --> 01:18:54,459
These three go here.

1964
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:55,659
- This one is...
- I'll only brew the tea...

1965
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:57,269
if you help me with that.

1966
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,598
(He gives it a try anyway.)

1967
01:18:59,599 --> 01:19:00,639
This should go here.

1968
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:03,769
- I got it. It's set.
- Try it.

1969
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:07,540
(How will Seung Ryong's tea set look like?)

1970
01:19:07,839 --> 01:19:10,579
- That's it! We got it.
- Yes, that's how it's done.

1971
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:12,609
- That's how it looks.
- I knew you could do it.

1972
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:13,880
There you go. You're pretty good.

1973
01:19:14,179 --> 01:19:16,450
- That's it. That fits in there.
- Try it.

1974
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,388
- There you go.
- It's all set.

1975
01:19:18,389 --> 01:19:19,389
(Can we finally have the tea now?)

1976
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:21,259
- Wait.
- Hold on.

1977
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,018
(Rattling)

1978
01:19:23,019 --> 01:19:24,859
Hold on. We need to do it again. Disassemble them.

1979
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:25,959
- My gosh.
- Why?

1980
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,029
We need to do it again. Disassemble them.

1981
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:28,058
- My gosh.
- Why?

1982
01:19:28,059 --> 01:19:29,499
- We should've put the handle down.
- We should've put it down.

1983
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,269
- Oh, gosh.
- Come on.

1984
01:19:31,599 --> 01:19:33,338
- You don't even know how.
- You should've told us beforehand.

1985
01:19:33,339 --> 01:19:34,939
No, I was watching...

1986
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,638
- if you'd be able to do it.
- Right. We should've put this down.

1987
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:39,869
- There you go.
- Oh, we should fold this.

1988
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:41,478
- There. We got it.
- Put this in here.

1989
01:19:41,479 --> 01:19:43,879
- What about this one?
- You can put it in there too.

1990
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,008
(Looking around)

1991
01:19:45,009 --> 01:19:47,420
- It fits in there too.
- Here?

1992
01:19:49,049 --> 01:19:51,250
(Running)

1993
01:19:52,889 --> 01:19:54,789
(He runs around the house like a ghost.)

1994
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,960
We don't have it.

1995
01:19:57,030 --> 01:20:00,960
(Then he walks toward the bush.)

1996
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:04,229
(What on earth is he looking for?)

1997
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:09,299
(Myoung went around to find a wildflower when Ha Nee was here.)

1998
01:20:09,939 --> 01:20:12,638
(If you add the flower to the tea set,)

1999
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:15,439
(it'll be pretty.)

2000
01:20:15,809 --> 01:20:18,780
(So I brought it.)

2001
01:20:19,549 --> 01:20:21,648
Oh, my. What's that? Is that cosmos?

2002
01:20:21,649 --> 01:20:22,649
(Today, it's cosmos.)

2003
01:20:23,049 --> 01:20:24,148
This is why I do it.

2004
01:20:24,149 --> 01:20:26,518
- When we have a tea ceremony...
- He learned it from Ha Nee.

2005
01:20:26,519 --> 01:20:28,660
- I see.
- That's what Ha Nee does.

2006
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,489
This is beautiful.

2007
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:31,889
(He's pretty serious about tea ceremonies.)

2008
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:33,258
It's so pretty.

2009
01:20:33,259 --> 01:20:34,329
- Right?
- Yes.

2010
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:39,500
(A beautiful flower makes the tea ceremony more graceful.)

2011
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:41,869
Choose a cup each.

2012
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,240
(It's time to choose your teacup.)

2013
01:20:43,969 --> 01:20:45,639
Oh, my. The cups are so cute.

2014
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,678
You can pick any cup to your liking.

2015
01:20:48,679 --> 01:20:50,479
(Quickly grabbing one)

2016
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:54,250
I got that from Hwagae Market.

2017
01:20:54,519 --> 01:20:56,048
- It's well-carved.
- My goodness.

2018
01:20:56,049 --> 01:20:58,348
I bought that from a tea expo.

2019
01:20:58,349 --> 01:20:59,389
(He got the teacup from an international tea expo.)

2020
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:01,889
This is from Hoeryong. It's made with soil...

2021
01:21:02,559 --> 01:21:03,728
from North Korea.

2022
01:21:03,729 --> 01:21:05,790
- It looks different.
- It's really from North Korea.

2023
01:21:06,259 --> 01:21:08,159
- What about this? Did you buy it?
- I also got that.

2024
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,298
Of course. I bought it myself.

2025
01:21:09,299 --> 01:21:10,569
(Seung Ryong traveled all over the country...)

2026
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:11,869
(and collected the teacups.)

2027
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:12,969
Are you going to take this one?

2028
01:21:13,399 --> 01:21:14,570
I should.

2029
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,008
- There's a crane on it.
- Right. It's a crane.

2030
01:21:17,009 --> 01:21:18,009
(It's fun to choose a teacup according to their tastes.)

2031
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:20,839
- This is...
- What shall we drink?

2032
01:21:21,479 --> 01:21:23,080
There are so many.

2033
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:24,449
This is...

2034
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:26,110
(Pick one.)

2035
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,580
I want to try this.

2036
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:33,049
- Oh, Oriental Beauty?
- Oriental Beauty.

2037
01:21:34,059 --> 01:21:35,159
You picked Oriental Beauty?

2038
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,159
- Yes, I want that.
- What's Oriental Beauty?

2039
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,798
It's an oolong tea from Taiwan.

2040
01:21:40,799 --> 01:21:42,959
It's high in oxidation, so it's similar to black tea.

2041
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,098
(It has the sweetness of black tea as it's high in oxidation.)

2042
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:45,799
- It's high in oxidation.
- Oh, is it?

2043
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:47,469
It smells nice.

2044
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:49,838
It has the scent of an apple, so it's really delicious.

2045
01:21:49,839 --> 01:21:51,339
It's the most popular one.

2046
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,338
- You should have this.
- I picked the good one.

2047
01:21:53,339 --> 01:21:54,439
You really did.

2048
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,409
- Queen Elizabeth...
- Queen Elizabeth?

2049
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:00,379
named it Oriental Beauty after trying it.

2050
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:02,449
She said it's like the beauty of the east.

2051
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,019
Oh, you mean its taste?

2052
01:22:05,189 --> 01:22:07,920
(The leaves fluttering in hot water...)

2053
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,258
(looked like the dress of oriental beauty,)

2054
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:12,160
(hence the name, Oriental Beauty.)

2055
01:22:13,259 --> 01:22:14,460
Did I rinse it?

2056
01:22:16,184 --> 01:22:17,252
Did I rinse it?

2057
01:22:17,253 --> 01:22:18,253
(It smells nice too.)

2058
01:22:18,384 --> 01:22:20,922
This is called gaewan.

2059
01:22:20,923 --> 01:22:23,554
That's where I brew my tea.

2060
01:22:23,823 --> 01:22:24,992
Look at the color.

2061
01:22:24,993 --> 01:22:26,493
(The cup that brews tea, gaewan)

2062
01:22:27,594 --> 01:22:30,023
(Pouring tea leaves into gaewan)

2063
01:22:30,024 --> 01:22:31,063
Here we go.

2064
01:22:31,064 --> 01:22:32,962
(He pours the boiled water into the cup.)

2065
01:22:32,963 --> 01:22:34,463
Just pour it like this.

2066
01:22:35,564 --> 01:22:38,002
- Why are you throwing that out?
- We need to wash them.

2067
01:22:38,003 --> 01:22:39,702
- Clean what?
- We should wash the leaves first.

2068
01:22:39,703 --> 01:22:41,073
(The tea leaves need to be washed.)

2069
01:22:41,304 --> 01:22:43,304
(I've seen this somewhere.)

2070
01:22:44,073 --> 01:22:46,413
(In the previous trip, in the same seat,)

2071
01:22:46,984 --> 01:22:50,083
(he learned to wash the leaves from Ha Nee.)

2072
01:22:50,984 --> 01:22:53,984
(Ha Nee also threw it out without drinking it.)

2073
01:22:54,984 --> 01:22:57,594
- We should...
- I can pour it out here, right?

2074
01:22:57,923 --> 01:22:59,323
I can pour it out here, right?

2075
01:22:59,493 --> 01:23:01,123
- No, don't pour it there.
- Is that so?

2076
01:23:01,423 --> 01:23:02,523
Isn't that what it's for?

2077
01:23:02,524 --> 01:23:05,093
I don't like it when it gets wet.

2078
01:23:05,094 --> 01:23:07,103
- Pour it like this.
- He doesn't like it when it's wet.

2079
01:23:07,104 --> 01:23:08,863
My wife hates it.

2080
01:23:09,764 --> 01:23:12,103
- She doesn't like it?
- So I changed my method.

2081
01:23:12,104 --> 01:23:13,774
(Every brewer has his own style.)

2082
01:23:14,003 --> 01:23:16,844
(Today, they follow the new brewer's style...)

2083
01:23:17,314 --> 01:23:21,043
(to enjoy the tea ceremony.)

2084
01:23:21,243 --> 01:23:24,984
(It feels hallowed for some reason.)

2085
01:23:25,113 --> 01:23:26,752
It makes me calm.

2086
01:23:26,753 --> 01:23:28,654
- Calm?
- Yes, it helps me calm down.

2087
01:23:29,554 --> 01:23:30,823
Because we're brewing tea.

2088
01:23:31,493 --> 01:23:32,524
You're right.

2089
01:23:33,594 --> 01:23:36,493
(What is this?)

2090
01:23:36,623 --> 01:23:38,593
That's called gongdobae.

2091
01:23:38,594 --> 01:23:41,764
- We will...
- Do you divide the tea in there?

2092
01:23:42,404 --> 01:23:44,832
The handle is made of bamboo.

2093
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:46,233
Yes, it is.

2094
01:23:46,234 --> 01:23:47,343
(They still have a lot to learn about tea ceremonies.)

2095
01:23:47,344 --> 01:23:48,773
This is how it's done.

2096
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,672
Tea ceremonies are surely difficult.

2097
01:23:50,673 --> 01:23:52,013
No, they're not.

2098
01:23:52,014 --> 01:23:53,983
You shouldn't make it difficult.

2099
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:58,014
You know the saying, "A matter of everyday occurrence"?

2100
01:23:58,854 --> 01:24:00,623
Just like how you have a meal every day.

2101
01:24:01,024 --> 01:24:03,653
The letters used in the saying...

2102
01:24:03,654 --> 01:24:05,752
represent tea and meal.

2103
01:24:05,753 --> 01:24:07,963
(A tea and a meal is a matter of everyday occurrence.)

2104
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:10,094
So your everyday life...

2105
01:24:10,564 --> 01:24:12,032
We need to brew this.

2106
01:24:12,033 --> 01:24:14,603
Your everyday life is about having a meal and tea.

2107
01:24:14,604 --> 01:24:17,274
In the old days, Koreans enjoyed having tea.

2108
01:24:17,634 --> 01:24:20,033
Koreans loved having tea,

2109
01:24:20,373 --> 01:24:23,542
but after the Korean War, people started having coffee more.

2110
01:24:23,543 --> 01:24:25,042
So the tea culture regressed,

2111
01:24:25,043 --> 01:24:26,542
and people only had tea with tea bags.

2112
01:24:26,543 --> 01:24:27,782
(Focused)

2113
01:24:27,783 --> 01:24:29,813
That's why they didn't find tea delicious...

2114
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:31,083
when it's actually really good.

2115
01:24:31,613 --> 01:24:34,554
He sounds very credible.

2116
01:24:35,123 --> 01:24:37,853
(Dignified)

2117
01:24:37,854 --> 01:24:38,854
That... Gosh, it's hot.

2118
01:24:39,623 --> 01:24:40,623
(Gosh, it's hot.)

2119
01:24:40,624 --> 01:24:42,224
It's hot, right?

2120
01:24:43,323 --> 01:24:45,792
(It is quite hot.)

2121
01:24:45,793 --> 01:24:46,893
(Sympathizing with him)

2122
01:24:46,894 --> 01:24:48,134
This is why it needs to be more convenient.

2123
01:24:48,963 --> 01:24:52,333
Tea ceremonies look too complicated, right?

2124
01:24:53,003 --> 01:24:54,372
That's why people can't start it easily.

2125
01:24:54,373 --> 01:24:55,873
(He gives it a try again.)

2126
01:24:56,104 --> 01:24:58,913
(Checking the temperature)

2127
01:25:00,913 --> 01:25:03,752
(Spilling)

2128
01:25:03,753 --> 01:25:05,384
Why are you spilling it? It's a waste.

2129
01:25:05,753 --> 01:25:07,752
Well, it's...

2130
01:25:07,753 --> 01:25:11,623
(Pretending to look calm)

2131
01:25:11,993 --> 01:25:15,493
It doesn't have to be difficult.

2132
01:25:15,823 --> 01:25:18,093
We're familiar with black tea...

2133
01:25:18,094 --> 01:25:19,734
whether it's made with tea bags or whatnot.

2134
01:25:19,963 --> 01:25:22,333
We're familiar with it.

2135
01:25:22,533 --> 01:25:25,333
(I can't hold it any longer.)

2136
01:25:26,234 --> 01:25:29,372
(Tea ceremonies aren't difficult.)

2137
01:25:29,373 --> 01:25:30,672
(They're done brewing Oriental Beauty...)

2138
01:25:30,673 --> 01:25:32,043
(after twist and turns. How will it taste?)

2139
01:25:33,144 --> 01:25:34,513
(Sniffing)

2140
01:25:34,514 --> 01:25:36,844
- Right.
- It does smell like black tea.

2141
01:25:37,154 --> 01:25:39,213
- So this is called Oriental Beauty?
- Yes.

2142
01:25:39,453 --> 01:25:41,782
It smells really nice.

2143
01:25:41,783 --> 01:25:44,054
(The scent itself is to her liking.)

2144
01:25:45,253 --> 01:25:46,322
(Let me try it.)

2145
01:25:46,323 --> 01:25:47,863
Oh, we should drink it from here?

2146
01:25:48,694 --> 01:25:49,823
(Grunting)

2147
01:25:51,363 --> 01:25:52,434
Right.

2148
01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:54,264
(Exclaiming)

2149
01:25:55,264 --> 01:25:57,173
- It's nice.
- It's really nice.

2150
01:25:58,234 --> 01:26:01,373
(The sweet and deep scent of Oriental Beauty...)

2151
01:26:02,404 --> 01:26:05,212
(helps warm your body.)

2152
01:26:05,213 --> 01:26:06,213
It's so cool.

2153
01:26:06,214 --> 01:26:07,612
It would've been disappointing if we didn't try it.

2154
01:26:07,613 --> 01:26:08,613
Right?

2155
01:26:08,614 --> 01:26:10,952
(You can't help but close your eyes as you have the tea.)

2156
01:26:10,953 --> 01:26:13,513
I personally like this.

2157
01:26:13,514 --> 01:26:16,653
It makes me put the cup on the saucer because it's hot.

2158
01:26:16,654 --> 01:26:18,252
It makes you look classy.

2159
01:26:18,253 --> 01:26:20,863
Of course. It's fun.

2160
01:26:21,323 --> 01:26:23,292
(As it's their second tea ceremony,)

2161
01:26:23,293 --> 01:26:25,264
(the members savor the tea more calmly.)

2162
01:26:25,463 --> 01:26:28,304
- The aftertaste is gentle.
- It really is.

2163
01:26:29,163 --> 01:26:30,303
- Wait.
- What is it?

2164
01:26:30,304 --> 01:26:32,832
Oh, my. It tastes like black tea and green tea inbetween.

2165
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:35,343
It has that bitter taste too.

2166
01:26:35,344 --> 01:26:36,473
(The tea that suits the crisp air of autumn)

2167
01:26:36,474 --> 01:26:38,112
He's credible when it comes to tea.

2168
01:26:38,113 --> 01:26:39,912
It's perfect for this season.

2169
01:26:39,913 --> 01:26:41,943
- It's so good.
- It's really good.

2170
01:26:41,944 --> 01:26:43,513
It would've been disappointing if we didn't try it.

2171
01:26:43,514 --> 01:26:44,514
- Is that so?
- Yes.

2172
01:26:44,515 --> 01:26:47,683
Of course. It's fun.

2173
01:26:47,684 --> 01:26:49,683
It'll be fun for the beginners too.

2174
01:26:49,684 --> 01:26:52,723
You need to lift your pinky when you drink tea.

2175
01:26:52,724 --> 01:26:54,663
- Like this?
- Yes. That's it.

2176
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:56,462
But it's too short.

2177
01:26:56,463 --> 01:26:59,134
(But it's too short.)

2178
01:27:00,064 --> 01:27:02,332
That's how you should have tea. It should be fun and delicious.

2179
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:03,934
It's good to have it often.

2180
01:27:04,404 --> 01:27:05,933
Well, this thought occurred to me.

2181
01:27:05,934 --> 01:27:07,804
Is there a tea that's good for burns?

2182
01:27:08,404 --> 01:27:10,773
Gosh, that fool.

2183
01:27:10,774 --> 01:27:13,984
That fool. When will he grow up?

2184
01:27:14,243 --> 01:27:16,644
(The brewer is loving the atmosphere.)

2185
01:27:16,783 --> 01:27:19,514
(Just like tea that gets deeper the more you brew it...)

2186
01:27:19,783 --> 01:27:22,283
I was really scared to death.

2187
01:27:22,753 --> 01:27:24,393
When we were canoeing,

2188
01:27:24,394 --> 01:27:25,993
I thought I should've fastened the life jacket.

2189
01:27:26,923 --> 01:27:29,193
He thinks too much.

2190
01:27:29,194 --> 01:27:31,234
- "I should've fastened it." - "I should've done that."

2191
01:27:31,594 --> 01:27:33,933
In 1, 2, 3.

2192
01:27:33,934 --> 01:27:36,804
(The warmth of the guests spread in the front yard.)

2193
01:27:38,104 --> 01:27:41,873
(Storing it for good)

2194
01:27:42,274 --> 01:27:43,473
(It's the perfect season to go on a trip.)

2195
01:27:43,474 --> 01:27:44,713
(And the guest that came to visit House on Wheels)

2196
01:27:45,014 --> 01:27:48,413
(Actress Chun Woo Hee)

2197
01:27:48,644 --> 01:27:51,713
(I haven't gone on a trip for so long. I'm so excited!)

2198
01:27:52,713 --> 01:27:54,822
(You can do whatever you want, Woo Hee.)

2199
01:27:54,823 --> 01:27:57,154
(Highly expectant)

2200
01:27:57,753 --> 01:28:01,293
(Strongly making her case with both hands)

2201
01:28:01,564 --> 01:28:04,032
(I'll do the hammering.)

2202
01:28:04,033 --> 01:28:05,433
(Rhythmical)

2203
01:28:05,434 --> 01:28:07,064
(Smiling)

2204
01:28:07,203 --> 01:28:10,573
(Woo Hee's assertively adjusts to House on Wheels.)

2205
01:28:10,604 --> 01:28:12,974
(Woo Hee takes over and prepares the ingredients.)

2206
01:28:13,304 --> 01:28:15,774
(Smiling)

2207
01:28:16,144 --> 01:28:17,144
(Getting aboard)

2208
01:28:17,145 --> 01:28:21,743
(She naturally gets in the driver's seat.)

2209
01:28:21,814 --> 01:28:24,083
(I'll take it for you.)

2210
01:28:24,184 --> 01:28:27,323
(The guest who's passionate about taking pictures)

2211
01:28:27,884 --> 01:28:29,683
(The exceptionally introverted Woo Hee's day on House on Wheels)

2212
01:28:29,684 --> 01:28:31,694
(I'll do it too.)

2213
01:28:31,993 --> 01:28:34,694
(Meanwhile, someone has arrived at the empty House on Wheels.)

2214

(Actor Cho Hyun Chul of "D.P." and "Hotel Del Luna")

(Please come home soon, guys.)
