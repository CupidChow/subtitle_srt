1
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:27,273
(The familiar sight of drying persimmons)

2
00:00:27,273 --> 00:00:30,042
(The start of winter)

3
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:33,242
(The bare persimmon tree with only some fruits for magpies...)

4
00:00:34,113 --> 00:00:36,543
(greets its welcome visitors in this season.)

5
00:00:38,013 --> 00:00:40,153
- It's warm out.
- Yes.

6
00:00:40,153 --> 00:00:41,482
(On a warm, sunny day, House on Wheels 3 came to...)

7
00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:44,822
Is that hanok?

8
00:00:46,252 --> 00:00:49,623
I guess they're all hanok in this neighbourhood.

9
00:00:49,723 --> 00:00:51,492
I think...

10
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:53,763
- that's the case.
- Yes.

11
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:58,573
(The region of scholars still holds the quiet vibe of hanok.)

12
00:00:58,772 --> 00:01:02,473
(Buseok Temple that's become one with nature...)

13
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:06,373
(and our people's proud historic sites still stand.)

14
00:01:07,643 --> 00:01:08,683
(Yeongju, North Gyeongsang Province)

15
00:01:08,683 --> 00:01:11,882
I'm starting to see a couple of hanok.

16
00:01:13,183 --> 00:01:15,623
Usually, Dong Il explains to us...

17
00:01:15,623 --> 00:01:18,422
- what today's front yard is like.
- Exactly.

18
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,123
He should be explaining it to us.

19
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:22,362
(Dong Il isn't here today?)

20
00:01:22,862 --> 00:01:25,362
We have no clue what the front yard will be like.

21
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:27,892
I only know the address.

22
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:30,562
We're just going there.

23
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:34,903
It's like we're entertaining two guests today.

24
00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:36,873
Right. It's awkward, isn't it?

25
00:01:36,873 --> 00:01:39,972
(Which guest will visit earlier than Dong Il?)

26
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:42,582
Do you know Hae In?

27
00:01:43,743 --> 00:01:45,282
I've never...

28
00:01:45,683 --> 00:01:47,612
been on a show with him.

29
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:49,853
But last week,

30
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:52,922
I met him once.

31
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:55,663
- You met Hae In?
- Yes.

32
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:58,362
He was too worried about our show,

33
00:01:58,862 --> 00:02:00,092
so I met him.

34
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:01,392
(Youngest went to ease his burden.)

35
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:02,433
And we talked.

36
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:06,832
He's in trouble.

37
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:09,642
(Who's the guest who's particularly nervous?)

38
00:02:09,642 --> 00:02:10,743
Oh, boy.

39
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:15,982
(The one that made every older woman's heart flutter)

40
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:19,683
(The textbook younger boyfriend)

41
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:21,183
You...

42
00:02:22,383 --> 00:02:28,592
(Even Gong Yoo acknowledged his good looks.)

43
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:30,523
(I'm going to be on House on Wheels 3 soon.)

44
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:32,132
You're right.

45
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:34,662
(I was there last week.)

46
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:37,032
(I'll do well out there.)

47
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:39,132
You will not lay a finger...

48
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:46,613
(Hae In is invited by Hee Won to House on Wheels 3.)

49
00:02:47,643 --> 00:02:51,752
(His acting skills improve every day,)

50
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:56,923
(and he's broadening his spectrum of genres.)

51
00:02:58,023 --> 00:03:03,863
(Actor Jung Hae In is on House on Wheels 3.)

52
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,192
Should I give him a call?

53
00:03:07,393 --> 00:03:11,062
His name should be "King Jung Hae In".

54
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:12,233
Call him.

55
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,102
(They met once in the movie "The King's Case Note".)

56
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:20,273
(He tries calling Hae In.)

57
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:22,782
- Hello, Hee Won.
- Hey, Hae In.

58
00:03:22,782 --> 00:03:25,983
- Hi.
- I heard you were worried.

59
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:27,713
Yes.

60
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:30,752
What are you worried about?

61
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,752
Myoung told me not to feel pressure, so...

62
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:35,192
That's right.

63
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:38,162
I'm going with a light heart as if I'm going camping.

64
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:40,433
You should feel some pressure, though.

65
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:41,433
(Hae In is confused.)

66
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:43,863
Dong Il won't be with us in the morning.

67
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:44,933
(It's an emergency.)

68
00:03:45,032 --> 00:03:47,072
When Dong Il is here,

69
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,602
we'll be able to treat you nicely.

70
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:52,412
That's all right.

71
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:53,812
But I lack the skills.

72
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:55,183
(Apologizing in advance)

73
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:56,782
Do you know how to cook?

74
00:03:56,782 --> 00:03:58,213
(Cook?)

75
00:03:58,213 --> 00:03:59,882
I'll do my best.

76
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:01,583
You should come here and...

77
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:03,822
You can just stay here without pressure.

78
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:06,453
- All right.
- Come safely.

79
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:07,792
- Okay.
- Bye.

80
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:10,493
- See you soon, Hae In!
- Okay.

81
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:12,132
(See you later.)

82
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:16,632
I want to cook delicious food for him.

83
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:18,602
But what do we do?

84
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:20,132
(It's just the two of us.)

85
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:23,203
He picked the wrong day.

86
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:26,472
What should we cook for lunch?

87
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:29,683
Our main chef won't be here...

88
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:32,213
- during lunchtime.
- Exactly.

89
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:36,252
(Normally, Dong Il chooses what to eat that day.)

90
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,652
(Something that only grows in this region.)

91
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:42,462
(He knows his regional specialties.)

92
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:45,632
(Yeongdong is known for its apples.)

93
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:48,733
(There's a butcher's shop that only sells special cuts.)

94
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:53,002
(Chef Sung always had a plan for food.)

95
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:57,103
(He even came up with a detailed timetable.)

96
00:04:58,072 --> 00:05:02,212
(Chef Sung of House on Wheels commanded the kitchen.)

97
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:07,512
(These two members only worked as assistants.)

98
00:05:08,353 --> 00:05:12,053
(How will they prepare lunch without Dong Il today?)

99
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:16,293
Shouldn't we do something for Dong Il?

100
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:18,223
What can we do?

101
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:20,192
I doubt he'll have eaten.

102
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,202
First, we'll cook kimchi stew...

103
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:26,632
Kimchi stew and...

104
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:29,142
Or kimchi Jeon.

105
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:31,603
Kimchi stew and kimchi Jeon?

106
00:05:32,272 --> 00:05:33,613
Is it too much kimchi?

107
00:05:34,142 --> 00:05:35,882
Anything is good as long as it's tasty.

108
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:38,683
Kimchi Jeon sounds nice.

109
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:42,152
(Contemplating)

110
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:46,892
If Hae In is a good cook...

111
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:49,322
Should we ask him to cook for us?

112
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:51,022
(On the same page)

113
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:53,062
You should ask him.

114
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:56,332
(They're like actual brothers from time to time.)

115
00:05:57,902 --> 00:06:00,303
Doesn't rolled omelet go well with kimchi stew?

116
00:06:00,572 --> 00:06:02,473
- We should make a rolled omelet.
- What?

117
00:06:02,473 --> 00:06:04,772
Should we fry some eggs?

118
00:06:04,772 --> 00:06:05,843
(As they drive while thinking about lunch...)

119
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:06,913
That would taste good.

120
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:10,843
This looks pretty cool.

121
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:11,882
(They arrive at the entrance of the hanok town.)

122
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:13,483
It's a town of hanok.

123
00:06:13,483 --> 00:06:15,353
(They arrive at the entrance of the hanok town.)

124
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:21,723
(What front yard will they see in Yeongju?)

125
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:24,727
I think we're almost there.

126
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:26,366
(They're almost at the destination.)

127
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,265
Wait, this place...

128
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:31,236
(Today's destination hides behind a pine forest.)

129
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:33,437
What is this place?

130
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:35,506
(They'll see it at the end of the forest path.)

131
00:06:35,506 --> 00:06:38,346
- This is amazing.
- It's so...

132
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:40,076
(What's today's front yard?)

133
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:41,076
This is...

134
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:42,917
(What's today's front yard?)

135
00:06:44,516 --> 00:06:47,417
(Today's front yard surrounded by a green pine forest...)

136
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:52,026
(is where a thousand crocks live and breathe.)

137
00:06:52,656 --> 00:06:55,667
(10 seconds from their house...)

138
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:59,567
(are our traditional sauces being fermented.)

139
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:03,107
(The crocks lined up in the front yard present...)

140
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:07,977
(a cozy view behind the window.)

141
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:11,307
(Move aside from the crocks,)

142
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:15,747
(and you see a traditional hanok.)

143
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:19,716
(The sauces to use for cooking...)

144
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:23,526
(can be delivered straight from the front yard.)

145
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:27,026
(The pine forest behind the house works as a windshield.)

146
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:29,367
(This place has the traditional taste and charm.)

147
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,627
(Today's front yard)

148
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:37,067
(Yeongju Pine Forest Crock Yard)

149
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:39,677
(The two place the house without Dong Il's help.)

150
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:40,677
Stop!

151
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:41,906
(The two place the house without Dong Il's help.)

152
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:43,706
Is it good?

153
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:45,417
- Is it good?
- I think so.

154
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:48,576
Isn't this good enough?

155
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:52,116
- Wait, what?
- What is it?

156
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:54,557
(They see a parade of crocks a second too late.)

157
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,626
- How are there so many crocks?
- There are so many.

158
00:07:58,456 --> 00:07:59,596
Is there something inside?

159
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:02,667
We might not have to buy doenjang at all.

160
00:08:03,427 --> 00:08:05,126
I feel like...

161
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:06,767
What if Hae In is hiding inside one?

162
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:09,137
Do we have to open them up and find him?

163
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:10,137
No way.

164
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,476
I'm telling you. Hae In is hiding there.

165
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:15,106
- No way.
- No?

166
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:16,147
Of course not.

167
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:17,677
Let's set up the deck.

168
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:20,177
- Should I bring the deck?
- Yes.

169
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:24,017
If we don't do it now, he'll be all over us.

170
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:26,757
Hey, Hee Won!

171
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:27,986
(They can almost hear Dong Il's nagging.)

172
00:08:28,787 --> 00:08:31,687
(They hurriedly set up the deck.)

173
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:32,757
Get it close.

174
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:35,897
(Moving)

175
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:39,496
(1 deck, 2 decks, 3 decks...)

176
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:43,167
(It's twice the work as there are only two of them.)

177
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,606
Hae In said he was nearby. When will he get here?

178
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:49,576
He said he wanted to do stuff like this.

179
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:50,606
He did?

180
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,677
Did he really say he wanted to do this?

181
00:08:53,677 --> 00:08:54,817
(Glad to hear it)

182
00:08:55,517 --> 00:08:56,986
Should we wait for Hae In to come?

183
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,517
Let go.

184
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:02,387
(While the two struggle...)

185
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:07,996
(On the path with fallen leaves next to the front yard)

186
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:13,297
(Today's guest enters with hurried steps.)

187
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:14,366
This is...

188
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:16,767
Is this where they ferment the sauce?

189
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,637
(Interested)

190
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:23,177
Let's see. Where are they?

191
00:09:23,177 --> 00:09:25,817
(Today's guest is Actor Jung Hae In.)

192
00:09:26,677 --> 00:09:28,376
There they are.

193
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,047
Hello.

194
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:32,456
(He runs as he's excited to see them.)

195
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:34,057
- Hey.
- You're here, Hae In.

196
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,986
- I'll get you gloves, Hae In.
- Okay. What should I do?

197
00:09:36,986 --> 00:09:38,956
- No. I was kidding.
- What is it?

198
00:09:39,226 --> 00:09:40,657
My gosh. Hello.

199
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:42,626
- It's been a while.
- Right.

200
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:44,027
(It's been 4 years since Hae In and Hee Won met.)

201
00:09:44,027 --> 00:09:45,696
- How have you been?
- Good.

202
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:47,696
- What are you doing so early?
- This is...

203
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:49,037
Give me those gloves.

204
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:50,807
No. Don't do it.

205
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:52,706
We will put it here.

206
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:54,576
- Hae In.
- Yes?

207
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:57,106
- Have you gone on camping?
- No.

208
00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:58,817
- No? Never?
- No.

209
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:01,047
- No. It's my first time.
- Really?

210
00:10:01,777 --> 00:10:03,047
- Give me the gloves.
- It's done.

211
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,887
Just give them to me. Let's do this together.

212
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:09,057
I will give you the gloves. Wait.

213
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:11,226
(Make yourself at home.)

214
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:12,996
- Are you feeling shy?
- A little bit.

215
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:16,626
- I feel a bit shy.
- Why would you be shy?

216
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:18,167
(He doesn't know what to do.)

217
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:22,037
(The guest joins them putting the deck.)

218
00:10:22,507 --> 00:10:24,836
(He works with Hee Won.)

219
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:25,836
Put it there.

220
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:27,106
- Here?
- Yes.

221
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:28,137
(Working hard)

222
00:10:29,147 --> 00:10:30,177
(Hae In works hard even though it's his first time.)

223
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:31,476
You can let it go.

224
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:34,346
It's done.

225
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:36,716
This looks good, right?

226
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,187
(It's easier when they work together.)

227
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:39,356
This looks good.

228
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:42,387
(Hae In finds it interesting.)

229
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:43,856
What have you been doing recently?

230
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:45,187
- Me?
- Yes.

231
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:48,226
I've been working without a break.

232
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:50,866
Right. It seemed that you were so busy.

233
00:10:51,626 --> 00:10:54,267
I haven't taken a break for more than a month.

234
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:55,336
- Right?
- Yes.

235
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:57,567
Was it "That Thing in the Rain"?

236
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:58,667
That's right.

237
00:10:58,836 --> 00:11:01,206
What was the title?

238
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:03,407
- It's "Something in the Rain".
- Right. That drama.

239
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:06,317
That was a huge hit.

240
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:08,346
Since that drama...

241
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:12,387
But even before that drama, I didn't take a break.

242
00:11:12,387 --> 00:11:13,956
I've never taken a break like this before.

243
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,527
(Hae In came to the House on Wheels during his break.)

244
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:16,626
I see.

245
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,927
(Myoung, who is well-trained, hammers the peg.)

246
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:22,596
(Hae In can't take his eyes off of him.)

247
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:24,797
Do you want to try hammering the peg?

248
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:26,696
- This? Yes.
- Do you want to try it?

249
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,007
This is what you do with a peg.

250
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:33,236
(Passionate)

251
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:37,177
- You should wear gloves.
- I'm fine.

252
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:38,246
Is it okay?

253
00:11:38,246 --> 00:11:39,417
(Very passionate)

254
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:42,446
I'll be blamed if you get hurt while doing that.

255
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:45,246
(I'll be careful.)

256
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,216
(I will keep Hae In safe.)

257
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:48,927
There's a lot of work to do, right?

258
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:51,586
Now I see why you said that time flies when you come here.

259
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,956
Right. Time flies in an instant.

260
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:59,336
(Passionate Hae In brings 2 at once.)

261
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:01,336
Have you been working out?

262
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:03,007
Why would you bring two at once?

263
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:04,706
(Don't work too hard, Hae In.)

264
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:07,677
- Something's off, right?
- This is weird.

265
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:11,007
This should be... It's not because of you.

266
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:12,147
Wait. This is how you do it, right?

267
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:14,216
- Right. This should go like this.
- It's supposed to be...

268
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,986
done easily like this,

269
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,147
but something went wrong.

270
00:12:17,147 --> 00:12:18,287
(The chair is the one to be blamed.)

271
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:19,287
Done.

272
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:21,486
We're done, right?

273
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:25,757
(They finish setting up fast thanks to the guest.)

274
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:28,757
Gosh.

275
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:31,326
(He finally gets to look around the house.)

276
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:35,366
(Staring)

277
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:39,637
(He gazes at every corner of the house.)

278
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:41,507
So you have everything here.

279
00:12:41,507 --> 00:12:43,946
Right. If you see here...

280
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:46,716
We have a lot, right?

281
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:48,116
- We have everything here.
- Right.

282
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:51,716
(Peeking)

283
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:56,086
(The guest opens every door in the house.)

284
00:12:56,086 --> 00:12:58,057
We got everything. We have air-conditioning too.

285
00:12:58,057 --> 00:13:01,356
(Fascinated)

286
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:05,196
Dong Il makes a lot of delicious dishes when we come here.

287
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:07,996
- I see.
- But we're not good at it.

288
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,037
- So for lunch...
- I'll do it then.

289
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:12,007
What can you cook?

290
00:13:12,677 --> 00:13:13,677
(Smiling)

291
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:14,706
Well...

292
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:16,476
Don't say it. You have to do it then.

293
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:18,177
Well... I'll make something for you.

294
00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:20,047
- No. It's okay.
- It's simple.

295
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:21,946
Eggs... Do you know how to make a rolled omelet?

296
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:25,187
Yes.

297
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:27,917
Why would you say yes? I know you haven't done it before.

298
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:29,787
- I just say yes first.
- I knew it.

299
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:31,126
Let's have a seat first.

300
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,956
- Shall we have some coffee?
- That would be good.

301
00:13:32,956 --> 00:13:34,557
- Let's think while having coffee.
- All right.

302
00:13:34,956 --> 00:13:36,226
(He prepares coffee as always.)

303
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:38,397
We set up a tent, and two people slept there.

304
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:43,206
(Something's off.)

305
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:46,037
(Did I forget something?)

306
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:48,907
(At this spot...)

307
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:54,376
(Dong Il always cooked rice as soon as they arrived.)

308
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:57,446
(Thinking hard)

309
00:13:57,446 --> 00:14:01,187
- Shall we cook rice first?
- Oh, right.

310
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:03,527
- That's right.
- He always cooked rice first.

311
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:04,586
Rinse rice first.

312
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:06,427
(Turning)

313
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:08,126
- I'll do it.
- No.

314
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:09,226
Don't do it.

315
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:11,667
Right. He always cooked rice first.

316
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:16,206
(An awkward encounter with the rice cooker)

317
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:20,037
Do you know how to make four servings?

318
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,777
The amount of rice. Right. It's written here.

319
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,817
What does it say?

320
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:30,647
(There are gradations for the amount of rice and water.)

321
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:33,017
What do these numbers mean? Is this for four servings?

322
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:35,116
(They both don't know how to read them.)

323
00:14:35,116 --> 00:14:37,687
What's this? Myoung, what are these numbers?

324
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:39,397
- What are these numbers here?
- Yes?

325
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:42,157
- Does this mean the servings?
- I guess so.

326
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:46,096
- That's for the amount of water.
- For water...

327
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:51,366
(For Dong Il, cooking rice is not a big deal.)

328
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:53,437
- Just enough water to cover rice.
- Okay.

329
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:55,177
That's...

330
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:57,147
And Dong Il told me...

331
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,946
to put some glutinous rice in it.

332
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:00,976
In here?

333
00:15:01,376 --> 00:15:04,547
Yes. He said that'd make it taste better.

334
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:08,116
I think this is enough.

335
00:15:08,956 --> 00:15:10,657
How do I do this? It says menu here.

336
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:13,596
(Beeping)

337
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:17,267
(Beeping)

338
00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:19,496
(Should I try it?)

339
00:15:21,297 --> 00:15:22,706
Dong Il.

340
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:24,037
(Well-cooked rice)

341
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:25,407
(Slightly cooked rice)

342
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:28,307
I know you're hiding somewhere and watching us.

343
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:29,307
(He denies the reality.)

344
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:32,376
Come out and do it for us.

345
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:35,246
We're starving.

346
00:15:35,246 --> 00:15:37,417
I can't hear what it's saying.

347
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:38,486
I'm sorry, Hee Won.

348
00:15:38,486 --> 00:15:40,956
You should set it to this and press here.

349
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:43,356
Right.

350
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:45,456
(Turn the lid to lock.)

351
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:46,596
Lock?

352
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:48,527
- Yes.
- Lock it and...

353
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:50,027
Here.

354
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:52,667
(Listening carefully)

355
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,137
- Yes.
- It's done.

356
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:57,167
- Here's the coffee you ordered.
- Let's go out.

357
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,106
Let's go out and rest.

358
00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:03,047
(Grunting)

359
00:16:03,606 --> 00:16:06,346
(They are already exhausted from cooking rice.)

360
00:16:06,547 --> 00:16:07,547
Gosh.

361
00:16:07,547 --> 00:16:10,517
(The guest sits down for the first time after working.)

362
00:16:12,557 --> 00:16:15,456
- Did you see those crocks?
- I was surprised to see them.

363
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:19,057
It must be a place where they make gochujang and doenjang.

364
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:22,596
This place is really tranquil.

365
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:24,497
That's what it feels like.

366
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,697
(There are crocks in the front yard.)

367
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:29,737
This is nice.

368
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:31,336
It's a relief that it's not too cold.

369
00:16:31,336 --> 00:16:34,136
(The quiet and tranquil view of the front yard)

370
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:36,977
This is so nice.

371
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,317
We're usually quite busy here.

372
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,646
We have to cook and work without a rest.

373
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:43,386
But because of short breaks like this,

374
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:46,416
we go on a trip together.

375
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,957
That's right.

376
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:49,586
(That's right.)

377
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:51,487
I guess I didn't have to worry.

378
00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:53,557
While you're here...

379
00:16:54,426 --> 00:16:56,297
Do whatever you want to do.

380
00:16:56,297 --> 00:16:57,866
Just don't go home.

381
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,836
- Why would I go home suddenly?
- Just don't go home.

382
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:02,967
- After saying goodbye?
- You can't go home.

383
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:04,537
Except that,

384
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:06,277
you can do whatever you want to do.

385
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:10,507
Eat what you want and do what you want.

386
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:11,547
Okay.

387
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:13,017
When did we shoot "The King's Case Note"?

388
00:17:13,017 --> 00:17:14,176
Was it about five years ago?

389
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,547
- Right.
- It's been so long.

390
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:17,686
- That's right.
- Right.

391
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:20,517
I went to the action school...

392
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:22,356
with Sun Kyun and Hee Won back then.

393
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:25,186
We shot the scene where I got stabbed.

394
00:17:25,186 --> 00:17:26,656
- Right.
- I got stabbed in my chest.

395
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:29,596
He gets killed in that scene by me.

396
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:35,336
(From "The King's Case Note")

397
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:41,406
(They had a fierce fight in the movie.)

398
00:17:41,406 --> 00:17:44,247
We were fighting like this.

399
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,547
When I block it like this,

400
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:49,517
he hits me with the sword like this.

401
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:51,247
He hits me like that.

402
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:53,557
Our swords should've been touching each other,

403
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:55,416
but his hand got in between them.

404
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,886
- So...
- That's right.

405
00:17:56,886 --> 00:17:58,326
I just remember him getting hurt.

406
00:17:58,326 --> 00:17:59,426
I don't even remember the story of the movie.

407
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:01,426
- I...
- "Gosh. Hae In got hurt."

408
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:04,626
I can't forget your pale face when that happened.

409
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,666
- My goodness.
- Your face turned ashen.

410
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,737
The sword hit your fingers, so...

411
00:18:09,737 --> 00:18:11,207
(Hee Won felt sorry for Hae In who got hurt while shooting.)

412
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:13,636
It wasn't that serious,

413
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:15,676
and Hee Won bought me some meat right after that.

414
00:18:15,947 --> 00:18:17,846
- And...
- That place was really good.

415
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,576
- It was a famous restaurant.
- Right, it was.

416
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,876
I'm shooting right next to that place these days.

417
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:24,247
- He said it reminds him of you.
- So whenever I see that place,

418
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,487
I think, "This was the place..."

419
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:28,987
"where I had meat with Hae In for the first time."

420
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:30,826
You must have spent a lot on that day.

421
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:32,287
- He even paid for the managers too.
- No, I didn't.

422
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:36,666
Anyway, I was so surprised when he got hurt.

423
00:18:37,497 --> 00:18:38,497
(Shall we move on?)

424
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:39,936
What should we have?

425
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:42,237
- What?
- Let's think about our lunch menu.

426
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:44,467
- Lunch menu?
- It's 10:30am.

427
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:46,707
We should hurry. We're not fast enough.

428
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:50,807
We're going to make kimchi stew and kimchi Jeon.

429
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:53,947
We should cook kimchi Jeon on a large pan.

430
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:57,017
- Right. Like a griddle.
- Like cooking mung-bean pancakes.

431
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,047
- Shall we do it like that?
- Yes.

432
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:02,826
Let's have kimchi stew and kimchi Jeon.

433
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:05,487
- Those two will be good enough.
- Let's make it simple like that.

434
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:06,626
(They're going to prepare today's lunch without Chef Sung.)

435
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:11,567
(It's a dish they can make easily with well-ripe kimchi.)

436
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:14,797
(It's the taste you can never get fed up.)

437
00:19:15,396 --> 00:19:19,807
(Kimchi stew with a generous amount of pork)

438
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:23,547
(It's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.)

439
00:19:24,277 --> 00:19:29,416
(Even the sound of cooking kimchi Jeon is beautiful.)

440
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:34,017
(Last summer, Dong Il cooked pork kimchi stew.)

441
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:36,257
(Chef Sung's secret is adding a generous amount of ingredients...)

442
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:38,126
(and boiling it for a long time.)

443
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:42,666
(Will Hee Won be able to cook one that tastes like Dong Il's?)

444
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:44,396
(He's a bit worried.)

445
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:47,237
It feels like we should prepare some food...

446
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:49,707
and surprise Dong Il when he gets here.

447
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:50,836
He must be very tired.

448
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:53,376
Let's treat Dong Il like our guest today.

449
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:56,576
- Right.
- Let's treat him like our guest.

450
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:57,576
That sounds good.

451
00:19:57,576 --> 00:20:00,116
We should ask him if he brought gifts for us.

452
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:02,346
(Guests must bring gifts.)

453
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:04,287
He has to bring housewarming gifts when it's his own house?

454
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,447
(He has to bring housewarming gifts when it's his own house?)

455
00:20:05,886 --> 00:20:07,487
- Dong Il is today's special guest.
- Right.

456
00:20:07,487 --> 00:20:09,386
(Today's special guest, Sung Dong Il)

457
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:12,487
- Will you make a fire?
- Okay.

458
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,326
Have you done it before?

459
00:20:15,727 --> 00:20:16,797
Well...

460
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,567
- I haven't.
- You haven't, right?

461
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:21,537
No. I can try it this time.

462
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:24,866
It's easy to make a fire here.

463
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:28,076
You can make a fire with this, Hae In.

464
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:33,676
(Gas stove?)

465
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:36,547
- Are you sure about this?
- Of course.

466
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:38,987
It doesn't have to be a bonfire.

467
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:42,217
I guess that's right, but this is...

468
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:44,227
I just brought this.

469
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:45,457
(He was joking.)

470
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:49,057
(Hae In is flustered while Myoung is used to it.)

471
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:52,497
(He comes back with a brazier.)

472
00:20:56,336 --> 00:20:57,666
(Do I put it here?)

473
00:20:57,936 --> 00:21:00,207
No, not there.

474
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:01,977
Are you going to cook that too?

475
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:05,176
(That's an extraordinary idea.)

476
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:07,576
(Embarrassed)

477
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:10,017
He's going to make a fire in a bold way.

478
00:21:10,017 --> 00:21:12,717
- You were going to put it here?
- He was going to put it there.

479
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:16,156
- Gosh. I feel stupid.
- Don't be.

480
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:19,527
(Safely filmed with permission from the owner)

481
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:22,457
(Hee Won shows them how to make a fire.)

482
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:30,406
(Blazing)

483
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:31,436
What's up with this?

484
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:33,537
(Surprised)

485
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,406
(He made a fire but didn't look cool.)

486
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:36,477
Gosh.

487
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:38,007
(He made a fire but didn't look cool.)

488
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:39,076
Gosh.

489
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:42,416
- Done.
- What?

490
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,817
- We're done?
- Yes. We're done.

491
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:46,856
(It took 1 second to make a fire.)

492
00:21:47,886 --> 00:21:50,586
(He loves it.)

493
00:21:50,586 --> 00:21:51,626
What's this?

494
00:21:52,426 --> 00:21:53,856
Why are you laughing?

495
00:21:56,267 --> 00:21:57,326
What was that?

496
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:58,967
(A neat demonstration from the experienced)

497
00:21:59,636 --> 00:22:02,166
- It was like a skit.
- No, I wasn't.

498
00:22:02,596 --> 00:22:03,936
- We're done.
- All right.

499
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,606
It will catch fire soon.

500
00:22:07,977 --> 00:22:09,876
Now, let's make kimchi stew.

501
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:14,547
I was so surprised.

502
00:22:14,547 --> 00:22:16,416
(In fact, I was so surprised.)

503
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,447
Gosh. This is so funny.

504
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:19,757
(Making a fire is fun.)

505
00:22:20,086 --> 00:22:21,586
Let's do it 1 by 1.

506
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:23,426
Let's cook kimchi stew first.

507
00:22:23,757 --> 00:22:25,487
If we're going to make kimchi stew,

508
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:28,797
don't we have to stir-fry pork and kimchi first?

509
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:30,866
How do you make kimchi stew?

510
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:32,297
Why do you ask? I've never made it before.

511
00:22:33,336 --> 00:22:36,807
(This looks somewhat familiar.)

512
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:43,076
(He looks for pots in the same posture every time he cooks.)

513
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:49,616
(Today, he takes out all the pots in the house.)

514
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:52,747
- We can stir-fry them here, right?
- Yes.

515
00:22:53,517 --> 00:22:55,086
Right? We can use this one.

516
00:22:55,086 --> 00:22:56,326
(He finally finds a pot he wants.)

517
00:22:56,326 --> 00:22:57,457
- Kimchi...
- This will do.

518
00:22:57,457 --> 00:22:59,957
Hey. Don't you think we can cook kimchi stew here?

519
00:22:59,957 --> 00:23:01,497
(How about an iron pot?)

520
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:03,467
- Gosh.
- You don't think so?

521
00:23:04,027 --> 00:23:05,826
- It looks cool.
- I think it will work.

522
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:08,866
- I think we should cook it here.
- Right? Kimchi stew in an iron pot.

523
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:11,067
Good.

524
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:13,936
- Or... Since it's pork kimchi stew, - What?

525
00:23:14,336 --> 00:23:16,247
how about this nickel-silver pot?

526
00:23:16,606 --> 00:23:17,807
Sure. Let's use this.

527
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:19,747
That would be better.

528
00:23:21,277 --> 00:23:24,047
Hae In. You change your opinion fast.

529
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,787
You said you liked the iron pot,

530
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:28,787
- The nickel-silver pot seems good.
- but you suddenly...

531
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:30,826
changed your mind.

532
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:33,497
What kind of kimchi are you going to use?

533
00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:35,757
- We have ripe kimchi.
- What do we have?

534
00:23:35,757 --> 00:23:37,197
Right. We should use ripe kimchi.

535
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:39,636
(They take out pork for kimchi stew.)

536
00:23:39,636 --> 00:23:41,467
- Pork and...
- Pork.

537
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:44,237
(Let me see.)

538
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:47,037
- Last time, Dong Il...
- Yes?

539
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:49,576
cooked delicious kimchi stew when we went to Jeju Island.

540
00:23:49,777 --> 00:23:52,477
He put the whole kimchi...

541
00:23:52,477 --> 00:23:54,076
in the stew.

542
00:23:54,076 --> 00:23:55,076
(I see.)

543
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:57,086
- He put in the whole kimchi?
- Yes, the whole kimchi.

544
00:23:57,287 --> 00:23:59,447
Are you going to add this pork belly without cutting it too?

545
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:02,356
- Right. That's how Dong Il did it.
- We can grill this first...

546
00:24:02,356 --> 00:24:05,326
like this,

547
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:08,227
and then we can put in all of these together.

548
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,866
- That's how we do it, right?
- That's right.

549
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:14,596
(He puts it in right away.)

550
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:16,307
But we should...

551
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:19,136
- Well...
- What?

552
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:20,636
(Hae In doesn't know what to say since Hee Won is so confident.)

553
00:24:20,636 --> 00:24:22,076
What? What are you going to do?

554
00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:26,146
- Do you want to say something?
- Well, shall we turn this on first?

555
00:24:26,777 --> 00:24:29,217
- Oh, right. We should heat the pot.
- Right.

556
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,287
We need to heat the pot first.

557
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,416
That's right. Gosh. I shouldn't have done this.

558
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,186
(He takes it out hurriedly.)

559
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:35,616
(They heat the pot first.)

560
00:24:35,616 --> 00:24:36,626
- It's working.
- Did you turn it on?

561
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:37,626
(They heat the pot first.)

562
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:38,757
- Okay.
- Let's heat it.

563
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:40,497
But this is...

564
00:24:42,257 --> 00:24:43,326
- What are you going to do?
- We shouldn't put them in...

565
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:44,396
as a whole.

566
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:46,737
- Do you think we should cut them?
- I think...

567
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:48,336
- we should cut them.
- Really? Then let's cut them.

568
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:50,836
- No, let's put them in as a whole.
- Without cutting them? Okay.

569
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:52,767
We can sear the meat first,

570
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:54,977
add this kimchi without cutting it, and cook them thoroughly.

571
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:56,807
- After searing the surface of pork?
- Exactly.

572
00:24:56,807 --> 00:24:57,947
Okay.

573
00:24:58,376 --> 00:25:01,076
(Hee Won, who's not a good cook, feels lonely.)

574
00:25:02,346 --> 00:25:03,386
All right.

575
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:05,217
- When should I...
- I think we can put it in now.

576
00:25:05,217 --> 00:25:06,247
- We can put it in now?
- Yes.

577
00:25:06,957 --> 00:25:09,386
(They put in the meat as a whole.)

578
00:25:10,086 --> 00:25:11,287
(He takes the tongs right away.)

579
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:12,287
That's right.

580
00:25:12,686 --> 00:25:14,697
(He's a bit slow.)

581
00:25:15,396 --> 00:25:17,926
(He naturally takes a step back.)

582
00:25:19,366 --> 00:25:21,237
Hey, this is hot. Don't hold it.

583
00:25:21,237 --> 00:25:23,866
- I'm fine. It's not hot.
- No. You shouldn't do that.

584
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:27,136
You should wear this apron.

585
00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:28,277
(If you're going to do it, you should be safe.)

586
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,146
Hyo Jin gave us this apron.

587
00:25:30,477 --> 00:25:32,376
- It was a gift for us.
- It has a glove too.

588
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:34,346
You should hold it with the glove on.

589
00:25:34,777 --> 00:25:36,416
It's hot, so you need to be careful.

590
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:40,186
(Wriggling)

591
00:25:41,787 --> 00:25:44,626
(Hee Won is a kind brother who doesn't know how to cook.)

592
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:47,957
Be careful not to burn your hands and turn it over.

593
00:25:52,396 --> 00:25:54,866
(Getting cooked well)

594
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:58,507
I'm hungry.

595
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:00,707
- You get hungry as you cook, right?
- You're hungry now, right?

596
00:26:02,336 --> 00:26:05,176
That's what happens here. You get hungry right after you eat.

597
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:06,207
- I see.
- That's right.

598
00:26:06,777 --> 00:26:10,217
Don't we need to add other ingredients to kimchi stew?

599
00:26:10,217 --> 00:26:11,686
- Onions, scallions, - Onions and scallions.

600
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:13,116
- minced garlic...
- Are you preparing them?

601
00:26:13,116 --> 00:26:14,386
- Is that what you're doing?
- Yes.

602
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:19,027
(He cuts it into big pieces as it's for the stew.)

603
00:26:20,656 --> 00:26:22,697
(The ingredients are ready.)

604
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:24,227
- You're good.
- Me?

605
00:26:24,227 --> 00:26:25,227
- Yes.
- No, I'm not.

606
00:26:25,896 --> 00:26:27,797
Myoung is really good.

607
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:31,067
He dreams of becoming the next Dong Il.

608
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:33,777
(Laughing)

609
00:26:34,307 --> 00:26:35,606
Do I add kimchi now?

610
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:37,676
- Kimchi should be...
- Yes?

611
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:39,307
(He adds kimchi without cutting it.)

612
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:41,777
- Without cutting it?
- It's okay.

613
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:43,086
What if it doesn't get cooked well?

614
00:26:44,447 --> 00:26:46,086
(He's going to put in everything that is left.)

615
00:26:46,086 --> 00:26:47,787
- Give me that.
- Why?

616
00:26:47,787 --> 00:26:49,356
- We need to make kimchi Jeon.
- Right.

617
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:51,426
Then we're only having this much kimchi in the stew?

618
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:54,926
Kimchi Jeon is not the main dish here.

619
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:57,697
Then can I just cut it and have half of it?

620
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,967
- How will you take half of it?
- You can give it to me.

621
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:00,967
(He feels somewhat upset.)

622
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,906
- I'll cut it like this.
- Then should I take this?

623
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:05,467
- I think this would be enough.
- This is enough.

624
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:07,576
I will add the kimchi soup too.

625
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:09,007
(Everything that is left goes into the kimchi stew.)

626
00:27:09,436 --> 00:27:11,606
- Leave it until it's cooked well.
- Right. I'll leave it.

627
00:27:11,606 --> 00:27:13,116
(While the big piece of kimchi gets cooked...)

628
00:27:13,616 --> 00:27:17,017
(Myoung prepares the batter for kimchi Jeon.)

629
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:20,686
(Kimchi is sliced into small pieces.)

630
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:23,626
I'm going to add water.

631
00:27:23,626 --> 00:27:27,126
I'm going to add frying powder as well.

632
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:32,997
(He adds Cheongyang chilli that Dong Il likes.)

633
00:27:34,497 --> 00:27:36,436
(Adding chilli powder to give some colour to it)

634
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:41,176
(The batter for kimchi Jeon is ready in no time.)

635
00:27:42,676 --> 00:27:43,676
Good.

636
00:27:43,676 --> 00:27:44,807
(Let me see.)

637
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,017
(Exclaiming)

638
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:49,277
(It already smells good.)

639
00:27:49,277 --> 00:27:50,886
- It already smells good.
- I know, right?

640
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:54,457
This is the smell of ripe kimchi.

641
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,457
- That's all we need to add?
- Yes.

642
00:27:57,457 --> 00:27:58,457
We add this.

643
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:01,227
- We can add a lot of minced garlic.
- Right.

644
00:28:01,227 --> 00:28:02,297
Garlic is...

645
00:28:02,957 --> 00:28:05,227
Even when you add a lot of it...

646
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:06,997
- This is enough, right?
- Right.

647
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:09,436
Minced ginger? What do you think?

648
00:28:10,436 --> 00:28:12,636
(He adds a spoonful.)

649
00:28:13,307 --> 00:28:15,336
I'm not sure if we should add ginger or not.

650
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,376
I think it would be good to put it in.

651
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:19,007
It must be.

652
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:20,346
(It's going to be delicious.)

653
00:28:20,846 --> 00:28:22,076
(It is done when it's boiled.)

654
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,247
We just need to boil it, right?

655
00:28:23,247 --> 00:28:24,517
(It is done when it's boiled.)

656
00:28:25,487 --> 00:28:28,957
(He leaves the kimchi stew to be boiled.)

657
00:28:30,027 --> 00:28:32,586
- Myoung. Call the guest.
- Yes?

658
00:28:32,686 --> 00:28:33,797
- Okay.
- Ask him when he will be here.

659
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:38,967
(They call the guest of the day.)

660
00:28:41,936 --> 00:28:44,567
- Myoung.
- Hello, Dong Il.

661
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:46,676
I'm on my way. I'm almost there.

662
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:47,676
Where are you now, Dong Il?

663
00:28:48,277 --> 00:28:50,576
- I'm almost there.
- Are you sure?

664
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,547
- I'll be there in five minutes.
- Is that so?

665
00:28:54,176 --> 00:28:56,886
- Hurry up, Dong Il.
- All right.

666
00:28:57,186 --> 00:28:58,547
The guest is already there, right?

667
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,987
You're the guest today, so come quickly.

668
00:29:01,557 --> 00:29:02,656
(Hurry up, today's guest.)

669
00:29:02,656 --> 00:29:04,856
You're the guest today, so come quickly.

670
00:29:04,987 --> 00:29:06,086
Dong Il. How do you do?

671
00:29:06,697 --> 00:29:08,126
It's nice talking to you.

672
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:10,926
I'll catch up with you when I get there.

673
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:12,096
Okay. Come safely.

674
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:15,237
Is there anything you want to eat? I can buy it on my way there.

675
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:17,166
No, you don't need to bring anything.

676
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:19,507
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

677
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,737
If you go there empty-handed, they won't like it.

678
00:29:23,406 --> 00:29:25,047
We cooked yummy food already.

679
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:27,616
- Is that so? Thank you.
- Okay.

680
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:30,817
Shall we get started with fried eggs and everything?

681
00:29:30,817 --> 00:29:33,116
- Shall we?
- Let's do that.

682
00:29:33,656 --> 00:29:35,856
(Hae In makes kimchi Jeon himself.)

683
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:39,856
(Pouring oil on a large griddle)

684
00:29:41,957 --> 00:29:45,426
(Putting the batter all at once)

685
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:51,136
(Filling up the empty space with the batter)

686
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:55,636
(How can I flip this?)

687
00:29:56,777 --> 00:30:00,247
(It's a bit too large to flip.)

688
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:02,247
How do I flip this?

689
00:30:06,317 --> 00:30:09,257
Hee Won, could you help me?

690
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:11,287
- With what?
- I'm not sure how to flip this.

691
00:30:11,557 --> 00:30:12,586
Hold here and remove it from the heat.

692
00:30:13,757 --> 00:30:15,396
You know you have to shake it really hard, right?

693
00:30:15,656 --> 00:30:17,567
Wait a minute.

694
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:20,666
- You have to shake it.
- It may fly out.

695
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:22,567
- It would.
- What should we do?

696
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:25,507
I want to try tossing it in the air.

697
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:29,076
I have a feeling you can handle that.

698
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:31,876
- Just swing it?
- Do you want to try that?

699
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:33,876
(Will he try throwing it to flip it?)

700
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:35,376
Try it.

701
00:30:36,517 --> 00:30:37,517
Okay.

702
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:38,987
Throw it really high.

703
00:30:40,086 --> 00:30:42,156
(Hesitant)

704
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:44,186
Okay.

705
00:30:44,987 --> 00:30:46,326
Try it. It's fine.

706
00:30:47,757 --> 00:30:49,027
(Slippery)

707
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:50,797
Don't do it.

708
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:52,826
This is not good.

709
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:54,396
Let's flip it.

710
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:55,737
It's burnt.

711
00:30:56,336 --> 00:30:57,567
It's burnt.

712
00:30:58,267 --> 00:30:59,537
It's too burnt.

713
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:00,836
What?

714
00:31:00,977 --> 00:31:02,136
- It's fine.
- It burned.

715
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:04,646
(Oh, no.)

716
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:05,646
Just keep going.

717
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,447
- The heat was too high, right?
- I think it was.

718
00:31:08,447 --> 00:31:09,777
(High heat and low oil made this happen.)

719
00:31:10,586 --> 00:31:13,717
(We're in trouble.)

720
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:16,656
This is really hard.

721
00:31:18,987 --> 00:31:21,596
(What should I do?)

722
00:31:22,156 --> 00:31:25,467
(The kimchi Jeon is all burnt,)

723
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:29,636
(and Hae In feels more anxious.)

724
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:33,737
This is bad. This really is.

725
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:40,317
(Scrapping out the burnt parts)

726
00:31:40,777 --> 00:31:44,717
(Taking emergency measures)

727
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:46,416
(Cold air)

728
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:48,186
(Wait, I know this feeling.)

729
00:31:48,287 --> 00:31:49,586
I think Dong Il is here.

730
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:52,057
I think Dong Il is here.

731
00:31:53,596 --> 00:31:54,626
Oh, no!

732
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:57,267
No? I thought I heard a car.

733
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,237
Hurry up. Otherwise, he'll yell at us.

734
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:05,037
He is bad-tempered.

735
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,176
This is bad.

736
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:10,846
Oh, no.

737
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,176
(The kimchi Jeon got all soggy.)

738
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:15,146
Just hide that for now!

739
00:32:17,217 --> 00:32:19,017
- I'll put it away.
- Do that.

740
00:32:20,586 --> 00:32:21,586
Hey.

741
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:23,527
(Quickly hiding it next to the house)

742
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:25,926
I'm in trouble.

743
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:28,426
(Which way should I go?)

744
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:29,497
What should I do with this?

745
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:30,967
(Which way should I go?)

746
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:35,896
(Restless)

747
00:32:36,596 --> 00:32:39,307
(Finding a space in a corner)

748
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:40,876
Is he here?

749
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:43,707
(Peeking)

750
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:46,146
(The guest is nervous that the owner of the house has arrived.)

751
00:32:46,146 --> 00:32:47,247
This is bad.

752
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:53,317
(They suddenly feel rushed.)

753
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:57,527
(How is Hee Won doing with his kimchi stew?)

754
00:32:58,457 --> 00:33:03,096
(Cutting up the pork chunk into bite-sized pieces)

755
00:33:05,227 --> 00:33:07,666
(Myoung quickly prepares his ham side dish.)

756
00:33:08,336 --> 00:33:12,007
(Cooking assorted ham)

757
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:16,277
(Moving them around by hand)

758
00:33:17,646 --> 00:33:22,017
(He's making fried eggs too.)

759
00:33:22,646 --> 00:33:26,186
(Then there is one man who stands in front of a wall.)

760
00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:30,356
(Is he here?)

761
00:33:31,286 --> 00:33:34,827
(Cutting up the Jeon into pieces to hide the burnt parts)

762
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:37,467
(Laughing)

763
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:40,896
(While they are busy preparing food...)

764
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:44,266
This is really pretty.

765
00:33:44,266 --> 00:33:45,867
(A familiar man approaches home.)

766
00:33:46,436 --> 00:33:49,876
(Today's guest, Dong Il, has finally arrived.)

767
00:33:50,677 --> 00:33:52,146
(Home feels unfamiliar today to him for some reason.)

768
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:53,447
This feels new.

769
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:54,516
(Home feels unfamiliar today to him for some reason.)

770
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:58,987
I wonder if the guys are ready to show good hospitality.

771
00:34:00,856 --> 00:34:01,987
Where is Hae In?

772
00:34:01,987 --> 00:34:03,356
(Oh, right. Hae In is our guest.)

773
00:34:03,856 --> 00:34:06,186
I made this too big. Let me make these smaller.

774
00:34:06,186 --> 00:34:07,427
(The guest is having the busiest time.)

775
00:34:10,927 --> 00:34:13,536
I'm here!

776
00:34:13,737 --> 00:34:14,766
Oh, my goodness.

777
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:17,536
Dong Il!

778
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:20,067
(He finally came.)

779
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:22,036
How is it going? Is it going great?

780
00:34:22,036 --> 00:34:23,376
(Did you enjoy my absence?)

781
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:25,806
- Without having you, it felt...
- Nice, right?

782
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:27,277
- Right.
- I thought so.

783
00:34:29,117 --> 00:34:31,387
I thought so.

784
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:33,757
I'm in trouble.

785
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:36,416
- Hello.
- Hey, Myoung!

786
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,427
(Happily greeting Myoung)

787
00:34:37,887 --> 00:34:39,856
Where is Hae In?

788
00:34:41,157 --> 00:34:42,496
(He shows up with his apron flying in the air.)

789
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:44,266
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

790
00:34:44,597 --> 00:34:46,067
(In a hurry)

791
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:48,097
It's nice to meet you.

792
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:49,967
You are really handsome in real.

793
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,367
This is from a famous store.

794
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:54,306
It's custard injeolmi.

795
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:56,036
- Thank you.
- It's nice to meet you.

796
00:34:56,036 --> 00:34:57,277
We finally meet.

797
00:34:57,577 --> 00:35:00,007
But I think I'm in trouble.

798
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,217
Did he get himself in trouble as soon as he got here?

799
00:35:03,217 --> 00:35:04,416
- No, it's fine.
- Then, what?

800
00:35:04,947 --> 00:35:06,016
He didn't do anything wrong.

801
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:09,487
I burned a bit of the kimchi Jeon.

802
00:35:10,257 --> 00:35:11,356
- You burned it?
- Yes.

803
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:13,056
I'll bring it over.

804
00:35:14,356 --> 00:35:15,657
Why would you bring what's burnt?

805
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:17,496
But I tried to make it better.

806
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:20,126
He hid it, so you wouldn't yell at him.

807
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:22,967
(Unbelievable)

808
00:35:23,766 --> 00:35:26,266
We had all the batter and everything.

809
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:27,507
Really? Let me see.

810
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:28,507
(Embarrassed)

811
00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:32,376
This is how you are supposed to cook it.

812
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:36,177
- Right? I told you.
- Right.

813
00:35:36,516 --> 00:35:37,586
Let me try it.

814
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:39,646
(Trying a piece)

815
00:35:42,956 --> 00:35:44,257
- You did great.
- Is it okay?

816
00:35:44,257 --> 00:35:45,286
It's fine.

817
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:46,586
(Thank goodness.)

818
00:35:46,586 --> 00:35:47,626
Try it.

819
00:35:49,157 --> 00:35:50,197
I made the batter.

820
00:35:50,197 --> 00:35:51,197
(Getting the credit)

821
00:35:51,197 --> 00:35:52,597
- What?
- Nothing.

822
00:35:52,597 --> 00:35:54,536
- Did you help out too?
- Yes.

823
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:58,106
Myoung made the batter, but I burned it.

824
00:35:58,106 --> 00:36:00,606
No. It's good. It's really good.

825
00:36:00,836 --> 00:36:02,737
(Thank goodness.)

826
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,577
(In the meantime, the kimchi stew is looking very nice.)

827
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,677
- You made the kimchi stew?
- Yes.

828
00:36:08,077 --> 00:36:10,746
(Touched)

829
00:36:10,746 --> 00:36:13,487
Give it to me. You must've been watching what I've been doing.

830
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:14,556
Of course, I did, Dong Il.

831
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:16,657
Give it a try.

832
00:36:17,327 --> 00:36:18,586
Wow, this looks good.

833
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,056
It's incredible.

834
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:23,697
(The kimchi stew looks yummy and spicy.)

835
00:36:26,697 --> 00:36:28,967
(Hee Won...)

836
00:36:30,197 --> 00:36:31,336
How is it?

837
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:34,476
- I smell the pork a lot.
- Pardon?

838
00:36:34,476 --> 00:36:35,536
I smell the pork.

839
00:36:35,577 --> 00:36:37,547
What should I do, then? Should I add doenjang?

840
00:36:38,146 --> 00:36:40,177
You should've. Put it now.

841
00:36:40,177 --> 00:36:41,416
- Give me doenjang.
- Doenjang.

842
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,077
(Rushing)

843
00:36:43,847 --> 00:36:45,617
- We need doenjang.
- That...

844
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:48,286
- and add a bit of sugar.
- Did you say sugar?

845
00:36:48,286 --> 00:36:49,657
- Yes, sugar.
- Sugar, I see.

846
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:52,086
- But it really is good.
- Right? Not bad, right?

847
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:53,726
It just smells a bit, but it really is good.

848
00:36:53,726 --> 00:36:54,797
(Laughing)

849
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:55,856
I'm serious.

850
00:36:55,956 --> 00:36:57,396
- Let me see.
- This much?

851
00:36:57,396 --> 00:36:58,427
- That's good.
- This much?

852
00:36:58,427 --> 00:36:59,427
Yes.

853
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:01,496
(Preparing sugar for reducing acidity)

854
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:03,467
(Is this sugar?)

855
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:07,407
(Hae In tries it to avoid making a mistake.)

856
00:37:07,677 --> 00:37:09,036
- Sugar.
- Put it in.

857
00:37:09,237 --> 00:37:10,976
- How much should I add?
- Put some...

858
00:37:11,407 --> 00:37:13,547
on the hand. Use your hand.

859
00:37:14,246 --> 00:37:16,047
He is pretty funny.

860
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:17,416
(After the kimchi Jeon incident, he keeps showing his clumsy side.)

861
00:37:17,947 --> 00:37:19,547
- Do that.
- Should I add this much?

862
00:37:19,547 --> 00:37:21,117
- A bit more.
- More?

863
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:22,856
That's good. Put it in now.

864
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:25,927
(He adds sugar to the stew.)

865
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:26,956
That's good.

866
00:37:27,297 --> 00:37:30,056
(Now the kimchi stew with plenty of meat is done.)

867
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:31,567
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

868
00:37:32,097 --> 00:37:35,336
You and I could run a restaurant now.

869
00:37:35,996 --> 00:37:38,637
You've gained my trust. Let's open a restaurant together.

870
00:37:38,836 --> 00:37:40,677
Let us do that, Dong Il.

871
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:45,876
(Serving the less burnt pieces of the kimchi Jeon)

872
00:37:46,947 --> 00:37:48,677
This is crazy.

873
00:37:49,277 --> 00:37:50,277
After that,

874
00:37:51,246 --> 00:37:53,416
- this is what you do at the end.
- Put it here.

875
00:37:53,717 --> 00:37:56,056
- The sesame seeds.
- Right.

876
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:57,056
- Should I sprinkle it here?
- Yes.

877
00:37:57,056 --> 00:37:58,286
(Adding sesame seeds to the kimchi stew)

878
00:37:58,286 --> 00:37:59,356
Okay.

879
00:37:59,786 --> 00:38:01,197
You need sesame seeds for fried eggs too.

880
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:03,797
You need sesame seeds for sausages too.

881
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,697
- Of course.
- Do you need it for every dish?

882
00:38:05,697 --> 00:38:06,827
- You do need it for everything.
- Right.

883
00:38:07,396 --> 00:38:09,737
Let's add some here too.

884
00:38:10,297 --> 00:38:12,036
- Kimchi Jeon too?
- That's right.

885
00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:13,507
(They plate their dishes in a creative style.)

886
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:14,577
You just need sesame seeds for everything.

887
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:17,347
(Today's lunch is nutty with plenty of sesame seeds.)

888
00:38:17,347 --> 00:38:18,347
The stew though!

889
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:21,277
(Hee Won's kimchi stew)

890
00:38:21,277 --> 00:38:22,317
It smells great.

891
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:23,887
(Hee Won's kimchi stew)

892
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:26,786
(Taking a bite of the rice first)

893
00:38:26,817 --> 00:38:28,117
Who cooked the rice?

894
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:31,186
- I made the rice, Dong Il.
- Really?

895
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:32,556
I mixed in some sticky rice!

896
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:33,586
(Proud)

897
00:38:33,927 --> 00:38:34,996
(Really?)

898
00:38:34,996 --> 00:38:36,157
The rice is really good.

899
00:38:37,797 --> 00:38:41,467
(Trying the kimchi stew)

900
00:38:43,597 --> 00:38:45,907
(How is it?)

901
00:38:47,007 --> 00:38:50,237
(Let me try some too.)

902
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:53,847
- The stew is so good!
- It's good, right?

903
00:38:54,277 --> 00:38:55,376
- It's good.
- It's good.

904
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:56,416
- It's good, right?
- It is.

905
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:57,416
(It's bound to be good when I make it.)

906
00:38:58,286 --> 00:38:59,987
(Taking a piece of the meat)

907
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:03,786
(Going into the mouth)

908
00:39:05,487 --> 00:39:07,797
(Pairing it with Myoung's fried eggs as well)

909
00:39:07,797 --> 00:39:09,757
- The kimchi stew is good.
- It is good.

910
00:39:10,427 --> 00:39:13,226
(Enjoying the food)

911
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:17,536
(The tofu is really good too!)

912
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:20,536
Now Hee Won knows how to make kimchi stew nicely.

913
00:39:20,536 --> 00:39:22,306
- Not really, Dong Il.
- Come on.

914
00:39:22,806 --> 00:39:24,907
- The kimchi stew is amazing.
- Is it?

915
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:27,817
Well, it was you who did everything.

916
00:39:28,246 --> 00:39:31,516
(Dong Il is just proud of Hee Won and Myoung.)

917
00:39:32,317 --> 00:39:33,416
(Luckily, everyone likes the kimchi stew.)

918
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:35,856
This kimchi stew tastes really awesome.

919
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:38,856
(Everyone is enjoying their meal with laughter,)

920
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:41,757
Gosh, that was too much.

921
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:42,956
(but no one has tried kimchi Jeon yet.)

922
00:39:43,456 --> 00:39:46,697
(Well...)

923
00:39:48,036 --> 00:39:49,436
(Still, he wants to taste the kimchi Jeon.)

924
00:39:49,436 --> 00:39:50,666
The stew is really good though.

925
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:51,836
- I know, right?
- Right.

926
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:56,876
So many of your family members gather on national holidays?

927
00:39:56,876 --> 00:39:59,106
(Hae In is quietly eating the kimchi Jeon he made.)

928
00:40:03,077 --> 00:40:04,186
Is it good?

929
00:40:04,186 --> 00:40:06,146
(Glancing at him)

930
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:08,617
Can you hold the bottom part?

931
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:10,056
(One after another, they are trying the kimchi Jeon.)

932
00:40:10,217 --> 00:40:13,356
(Taking a bite from a big piece)

933
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:19,697
Just don't eat the burnt part.

934
00:40:21,396 --> 00:40:23,936
(I'll have all the burnt parts.)

935
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:26,306
(Savouring)

936
00:40:30,507 --> 00:40:32,106
(It tastes good.)

937
00:40:32,646 --> 00:40:35,646
(You like it?)

938
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:39,817
(A mouthful of stew)

939
00:40:39,817 --> 00:40:43,356
(A mouthful of kimchi Jeon)

940
00:40:43,356 --> 00:40:45,126
It's delicious, isn't it?

941
00:40:45,856 --> 00:40:49,496
(Everyone likes the kimchi Jeon.)

942
00:40:50,126 --> 00:40:51,166
Hae In,

943
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:53,567
you are still handsome with a sesame seed on the tip of your lips.

944
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:54,637
Oh, there is?

945
00:40:54,637 --> 00:40:58,067
(He was so enjoying eating that he didn't know a seed was on his lips.)

946
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:00,806
- I'm very full.
- It was so delicious.

947
00:41:02,137 --> 00:41:05,077
(Hae In starts to clean up naturally.)

948
00:41:05,077 --> 00:41:06,246
(Staring)

949
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:07,617
(Working hard)

950
00:41:07,617 --> 00:41:10,586
Hee Won, look. Hae In just can't stay still.

951
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:13,117
Right. Come on, Hae In.

952
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:14,487
Of course, I should do it.

953
00:41:14,487 --> 00:41:17,217
Once you start working hard, you will have to keep doing it.

954
00:41:18,427 --> 00:41:20,726
(I'm all right with that.)

955
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:24,496
(Dong Il is going to the kitchen to prepare a dessert for the guest.)

956
00:41:24,697 --> 00:41:26,927
(Opening the present)

957
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:29,536
- My gosh.
- It's castella rice cake.

958
00:41:30,266 --> 00:41:32,106
It will soothe the spiciness.

959
00:41:33,137 --> 00:41:35,706
(And there is one more present.)

960
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:38,677
- I heard you like something spicy.
- Yes, I do.

961
00:41:38,677 --> 00:41:41,646
I also bought this really spicy tteokbokki.

962
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:44,186
I heard this region is very famous for tteokbokki.

963
00:41:44,186 --> 00:41:45,217
(And the spicy tteokbokki Yeongju is famous for)

964
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,646
Thank you for the dessert.

965
00:41:46,646 --> 00:41:47,817
(They are going to have tea time with Dong Il's presents.)

966
00:41:47,817 --> 00:41:48,987
- Myoung, go ahead and try it.
- Okay.

967
00:41:48,987 --> 00:41:50,586
- Hae In, you too. Dig in.
- This is big.

968
00:41:50,586 --> 00:41:52,856
- Okay.
- Take a soft rice cake first.

969
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:54,626
Try it.

970
00:41:55,226 --> 00:41:56,626
Did you buy them at the local market?

971
00:41:58,567 --> 00:41:59,726
- Isn't it delicious?
- It's so good.

972
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,137
- It tastes great, right?
- Yes.

973
00:42:01,137 --> 00:42:02,496
(My gosh, I love this rice cake.)

974
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:07,137
(I love spicy food.)

975
00:42:08,936 --> 00:42:11,606
It's soft. Take a soft rice cake.

976
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,577
Would you like to take some home with you?

977
00:42:14,146 --> 00:42:15,217
Yes, please.

978
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:19,016
Look at you. You got comfortable with us.

979
00:42:19,516 --> 00:42:21,916
- My parents love rice cakes.
- They do?

980
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:23,856
- You should take some then.
- They always have them in fridge.

981
00:42:24,327 --> 00:42:26,027
Okay, that's great.

982
00:42:26,027 --> 00:42:27,157
(It's good that I bought rice cakes.)

983
00:42:27,427 --> 00:42:28,927
- Turn it on then.
- Right.

984
00:42:28,927 --> 00:42:30,657
He also brought something for us.

985
00:42:30,657 --> 00:42:32,396
- A present? Okay.
- Yes.

986
00:42:32,396 --> 00:42:34,436
- So when we open it, we can...
- Okay. Shall we?

987
00:42:34,896 --> 00:42:37,036
It's really nothing though.

988
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:39,806
(Worried)

989
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:42,077
(He is bringing his bag.)

990
00:42:42,306 --> 00:42:45,106
- Look. His bag is big.
- No, actually...

991
00:42:45,507 --> 00:42:46,876
I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable though.

992
00:42:47,077 --> 00:42:49,016
(Curious)

993
00:42:49,016 --> 00:42:50,217
Well, it's a cup.

994
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:55,456
(Hae In bought camping mugs as a present.)

995
00:42:55,856 --> 00:42:58,427
(Excited)

996
00:42:58,427 --> 00:43:00,186
It seems expensive.

997
00:43:00,856 --> 00:43:03,697
It maintains the temperature whether it's cold or hot.

998
00:43:04,327 --> 00:43:07,836
I thought you could use it on sets. I mean, you can use it here as well.

999
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:10,567
- Please pick the colour.
- Can I pick the colour?

1000
00:43:10,836 --> 00:43:14,177
(Transferring the coffee in the mug Hae In bought)

1001
00:43:15,577 --> 00:43:17,907
(Sipping)

1002
00:43:18,047 --> 00:43:21,117
The coffee smells different in this mug.

1003
00:43:21,577 --> 00:43:23,777
- Pardon me?
- It smells great in this mug.

1004
00:43:26,286 --> 00:43:29,016
I thought about it, and I picked the ones with a handle.

1005
00:43:29,016 --> 00:43:30,456
- Yes, of course.
- I prefer a mug with a handle.

1006
00:43:31,456 --> 00:43:33,626
I'm going to bring it when I go camping.

1007
00:43:33,626 --> 00:43:34,757
(I'm going to bring it when I go camping.)

1008
00:43:34,956 --> 00:43:36,056
When?

1009
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:37,896
- When?
- When?

1010
00:43:38,266 --> 00:43:39,827
- In about two years?
- When can you go camping?

1011
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:41,436
(Myoung, 28 years old, will become an active duty soldier in December.)

1012
00:43:41,436 --> 00:43:42,766
- Don't you think so?
- Right.

1013
00:43:42,766 --> 00:43:47,436
You know what? I'll write down my name on my mug...

1014
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:49,507
- and after the military service, - Okay.

1015
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:50,677
I'll come back for my mug.

1016
00:43:50,677 --> 00:43:52,476
(Myoung's mug with his name on it)

1017
00:43:52,706 --> 00:43:54,577
(It's mine!)

1018
00:43:54,577 --> 00:43:57,217
Anyway, you take good care of yourself in the military. Okay?

1019
00:43:57,646 --> 00:43:58,717
That means...

1020
00:43:59,646 --> 00:44:01,056
there will be a vacancy.

1021
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:03,956
Right.

1022
00:44:05,657 --> 00:44:06,786
Do you want me to...

1023
00:44:06,786 --> 00:44:08,056
(Do you want me to take over his place?)

1024
00:44:08,257 --> 00:44:09,496
You two should talk about it.

1025
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:13,626
Well, can you?

1026
00:44:14,336 --> 00:44:16,597
(Hae In, would you like to...)

1027
00:44:16,996 --> 00:44:19,336
(go on trips with us?)

1028
00:44:21,836 --> 00:44:24,706
Hee Won and I will pretend that we are not listening.

1029
00:44:25,206 --> 00:44:28,077
Why don't we leave them alone for a minute? They will have a talk.

1030
00:44:28,077 --> 00:44:29,277
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1031
00:44:29,547 --> 00:44:31,217
- You guys talk, okay?
- Yes, you two talk.

1032
00:44:31,217 --> 00:44:33,047
But I don't want you to feel burdened.

1033
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:35,217
Myoung, don't be greedy. Okay?

1034
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:36,456
Go. Let's go.

1035
00:44:36,456 --> 00:44:39,257
- You guys talk, okay?
- Okay.

1036
00:44:39,257 --> 00:44:40,356
(They left them alone so that Myoung can cast a new youngest member.)

1037
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,996
I wonder who will be the next member after me.

1038
00:44:47,697 --> 00:44:50,597
(Myoung is feeling jealous.)

1039
00:44:51,436 --> 00:44:53,907
In what year will you be discharged?

1040
00:44:54,336 --> 00:44:57,306
In the year after next year. So in 2023.

1041
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:01,516
That doesn't seem far away though.

1042
00:45:02,577 --> 00:45:04,817
It'll be 2022 soon.

1043
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:08,317
- True. It will be 2023 soon too.
- Right.

1044
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:12,086
It doesn't seem like a long time for those who aren't soldiers.

1045
00:45:12,286 --> 00:45:14,496
- But for those in the military...
- For those in the military,

1046
00:45:14,996 --> 00:45:16,226
- it's not soon.
- No.

1047
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:18,726
They feel like time passes differently in there.

1048
00:45:19,527 --> 00:45:22,967
House on Wheels 3 will be over soon.

1049
00:45:23,737 --> 00:45:25,737
Let's say, there will be another season next year, and then...

1050
00:45:25,737 --> 00:45:27,836
(He is calculating time.)

1051
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,007
Would you like to join for seasons 4 and 5?

1052
00:45:34,277 --> 00:45:35,416
Shall I?

1053
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:36,947
(Well, shall I?)

1054
00:45:37,246 --> 00:45:39,387
They will juggle the schedule for you.

1055
00:45:39,387 --> 00:45:41,516
- We already made a deal for that.
- Well...

1056
00:45:42,186 --> 00:45:43,817
I haven't made up my mind yet though.

1057
00:45:44,856 --> 00:45:47,056
(Playing jokes on each other)

1058
00:45:47,056 --> 00:45:48,496
So for seasons 4 and 5?

1059
00:45:48,757 --> 00:45:50,297
Or how about just the fifth season?

1060
00:45:50,297 --> 00:45:51,797
- Before I come back...
- When you come back,

1061
00:45:51,797 --> 00:45:53,697
- Just for one season...
- I could give you the baton.

1062
00:45:53,697 --> 00:45:54,797
For the fourth season...

1063
00:45:54,797 --> 00:45:56,396
Wait. What am I talking about?

1064
00:45:56,737 --> 00:45:58,637
He just said that he would pass me the baton, right?

1065
00:45:58,637 --> 00:46:00,867
It's recorded on the cameras, right?

1066
00:46:00,867 --> 00:46:02,007
(I knew this would happen.)

1067
00:46:02,007 --> 00:46:03,036
Okay.

1068
00:46:03,036 --> 00:46:06,507
Myoung is one smooth talker.

1069
00:46:06,976 --> 00:46:09,876
Great. It's done. Now I can leave peacefully.

1070
00:46:09,876 --> 00:46:12,487
(I succeeded in scouting a new youngest member.)

1071
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,186
- Did you talk him into it?
- Yes, I did.

1072
00:46:14,186 --> 00:46:16,717
- So?
- He will do one season...

1073
00:46:16,717 --> 00:46:18,527
for the fifth season, and he'll pass me the baton.

1074
00:46:18,987 --> 00:46:21,427
- We'll have to think about that.
- I'm sorry?

1075
00:46:21,427 --> 00:46:23,726
- Whether we want you back or not.
- Pardon me?

1076
00:46:23,927 --> 00:46:25,766
(He is cute.)

1077
00:46:26,027 --> 00:46:28,266
(The house is full of laughter again.)

1078
00:46:28,597 --> 00:46:30,297
(Myoung is the one and only youngest member...)

1079
00:46:30,297 --> 00:46:31,907
(who always takes their jokes.)

1080
00:46:32,806 --> 00:46:34,806
Hae In, are you 27 years old this year?

1081
00:46:34,806 --> 00:46:37,806
No, I'm 34. I'm turning 35 soon.

1082
00:46:37,806 --> 00:46:39,606
- He looks younger than his age.
- Yes.

1083
00:46:39,606 --> 00:46:42,476
He looks much younger, and he is such a beautiful boy.

1084
00:46:43,516 --> 00:46:45,916
- He seems very innocent, and...
- Right.

1085
00:46:46,186 --> 00:46:47,887
The title was really suitable too.

1086
00:46:47,887 --> 00:46:50,157
- "Something in the Rain".
- "Something in the Rain".

1087
00:46:50,157 --> 00:46:53,126
Look at him. Anyone would want to buy him food.

1088
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:54,496
I know what you mean.

1089
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,427
- To me, that's the drama...
- Okay.

1090
00:46:58,427 --> 00:47:02,036
I feel very grateful for.

1091
00:47:02,036 --> 00:47:03,567
People recognized me and supported me more...

1092
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:04,706
after that drama.

1093
00:47:05,266 --> 00:47:07,606
The scene where I was riding a bicycle remains in my memory.

1094
00:47:07,606 --> 00:47:08,907
- The scene with the bicycle...
- Yes, with the bicycle...

1095
00:47:09,137 --> 00:47:10,677
Yes, I saw that scene.

1096
00:47:13,007 --> 00:47:15,047
Well, while you are asleep?

1097
00:47:15,577 --> 00:47:17,817
(The cute scene where he consoles her...)

1098
00:47:17,817 --> 00:47:20,047
(who has a hard time)

1099
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:22,317
(It's one of the best scenes...)

1100
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:24,217
(of "Something in the Rain".)

1101
00:47:24,686 --> 00:47:28,996
Dong Il, you know what? The scene with the bicycle is very delicate.

1102
00:47:28,996 --> 00:47:31,027
- Okay. You mean, his acting?
- Yes.

1103
00:47:31,027 --> 00:47:32,967
He hovers around her on the bicycle.

1104
00:47:33,867 --> 00:47:36,867
And I was thinking, "Is he trying to flirt with her?"

1105
00:47:36,867 --> 00:47:38,737
- It's somehow confusing.
- Well...

1106
00:47:38,737 --> 00:47:41,106
- He is very...
- Charming?

1107
00:47:41,106 --> 00:47:43,436
Yes. Although he doesn't talk much in the scene,

1108
00:47:43,436 --> 00:47:44,746
- you know what I'm saying, right?
- And she was in front of him?

1109
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:49,516
It was a very thrilling move. It somehow made me feel thrilled.

1110
00:47:50,777 --> 00:47:52,347
I think I should ride a bicycle too.

1111
00:47:52,817 --> 00:47:54,387
Yes, after you get discharged from the military.

1112
00:47:54,387 --> 00:47:57,016
(Myoung can ride a bicycle after the military service.)

1113
00:47:57,217 --> 00:47:58,657
Was your acting based on...

1114
00:47:58,657 --> 00:48:00,586
- your real experience?
- Of course.

1115
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,597
- Really?
- Yes.

1116
00:48:01,597 --> 00:48:03,356
(Of course.)

1117
00:48:03,356 --> 00:48:06,327
You know, that's what happens when you start dating someone.

1118
00:48:06,327 --> 00:48:08,097
In the beginning, your heart flutters.

1119
00:48:08,266 --> 00:48:12,106
Those feelings when you start getting to know about the person.

1120
00:48:12,106 --> 00:48:13,106
Right.

1121
00:48:13,106 --> 00:48:14,777
(Butterflies in the stomach)

1122
00:48:14,777 --> 00:48:17,277
How did you feel when you acted for the very first time?

1123
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:18,777
You mean, my début work?

1124
00:48:18,777 --> 00:48:21,177
- Well, it could be your début work.
- Okay.

1125
00:48:21,177 --> 00:48:22,416
But I meant your very first acting.

1126
00:48:23,246 --> 00:48:25,916
It was a scene where I was having wine in a bar.

1127
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:26,916
Okay.

1128
00:48:27,186 --> 00:48:30,487
I got stiff like a robot. I felt stupid.

1129
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:33,356
After a sip, I should have put down the glass,

1130
00:48:33,356 --> 00:48:35,527
but I went on with my lines holding the glass like this.

1131
00:48:35,527 --> 00:48:37,157
I just couldn't move my arm.

1132
00:48:37,157 --> 00:48:38,427
- I see.
- All right.

1133
00:48:38,427 --> 00:48:41,396
I couldn't put it down as I thought I wouldn't be able to lift it up.

1134
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:43,697
- You were too nervous to do that.
- Exactly.

1135
00:48:44,336 --> 00:48:47,836
I needed to drink wine relaxedly, but I just couldn't do it.

1136
00:48:48,336 --> 00:48:51,746
They pointed that out,

1137
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:53,507
- and I got...
- You got more nervous, right?

1138
00:48:53,507 --> 00:48:55,376
- It was in your head?
- Yes, I had a mental breakdown.

1139
00:48:56,047 --> 00:48:58,347
I couldn't speak my lines I practiced.

1140
00:48:58,347 --> 00:48:59,887
(The time when he got disheartened after a reprimand)

1141
00:48:59,987 --> 00:49:02,186
(Hae In, when he was a rookie)

1142
00:49:03,086 --> 00:49:04,427
(After many bloopers,)

1143
00:49:04,427 --> 00:49:06,686
(the scene with a glass of wine...)

1144
00:49:07,086 --> 00:49:09,657
(was finally completed.)

1145
00:49:10,027 --> 00:49:12,427
And at that moment,

1146
00:49:12,427 --> 00:49:14,867
I was afraid of everyone on set including the staff.

1147
00:49:15,436 --> 00:49:16,797
You felt like they were watching you to see...

1148
00:49:16,797 --> 00:49:18,637
- if you were good or bad, right?
- Yes, exactly.

1149
00:49:19,237 --> 00:49:21,206
I felt like I was being tested.

1150
00:49:21,206 --> 00:49:23,177
(He felt like he had to prove his capabilities as an actor.)

1151
00:49:23,436 --> 00:49:26,206
Myoung is a positive person. I'm sure he didn't feel like that.

1152
00:49:26,206 --> 00:49:27,306
- Me?
- Yes.

1153
00:49:27,306 --> 00:49:28,577
I was excited.

1154
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:30,617
Yes, I knew it.

1155
00:49:30,617 --> 00:49:32,186
Even on the day you acted for the very first time?

1156
00:49:32,617 --> 00:49:33,786
I was just excited.

1157
00:49:33,947 --> 00:49:35,956
- How come you are...
- I liked getting all the attention.

1158
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:41,757
Then what was your very first take?

1159
00:49:42,726 --> 00:49:45,126
My experience was pretty different from Hae In's first take...

1160
00:49:45,126 --> 00:49:48,166
because it was a 30-minute-long movie about human rights.

1161
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:50,536
So there weren't many staff members.

1162
00:49:50,536 --> 00:49:52,666
- It was actually a small crew.
- I see.

1163
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:57,476
It was a scene where I worked in a repair shop.

1164
00:49:57,907 --> 00:49:59,746
It was the first scene I shot.

1165
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,416
- Yeon Ju.
- Can you approve it?

1166
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:04,016
(Gong Myoung, when he was a rookie)

1167
00:50:04,947 --> 00:50:07,016
I was so excited.

1168
00:50:07,016 --> 00:50:08,786
- You were just excited?
- Yes.

1169
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:11,387
I always try to...

1170
00:50:11,387 --> 00:50:15,726
remember that moment and the first excitement I felt.

1171
00:50:15,726 --> 00:50:16,856
(Myoung tries not to forget the excitement as a new actor.)

1172
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,927
Dong Il, what about you? What was your first take?

1173
00:50:19,097 --> 00:50:20,567
I guess maybe it was too long ago...

1174
00:50:20,996 --> 00:50:22,737
to remember.

1175
00:50:23,436 --> 00:50:25,637
(Searching through his memory)

1176
00:50:25,637 --> 00:50:26,737
I remember it.

1177
00:50:27,737 --> 00:50:29,637
You know, in the 80s,

1178
00:50:29,637 --> 00:50:31,847
(Surprised)

1179
00:50:31,847 --> 00:50:34,246
- music videos were popular.
- Right.

1180
00:50:34,617 --> 00:50:37,847
And unlike now, I looked much better back then.

1181
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:41,757
Seriously, he was so handsome when he was younger.

1182
00:50:42,157 --> 00:50:44,016
Yes, I saw his picture.

1183
00:50:44,927 --> 00:50:47,956
I played opposite a singer.

1184
00:50:48,556 --> 00:50:52,367
I had to smile in a hotel lobby.

1185
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,536
I was told to smile and look at her.

1186
00:50:55,036 --> 00:50:56,237
The director said, "Action!"

1187
00:50:57,436 --> 00:50:58,507
(A cramp in his face)

1188
00:50:58,507 --> 00:50:59,536
Your face started to twitch?

1189
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:01,277
Yes, like this.

1190
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:03,706
- You were too nervous.
- Yes, I was so nervous.

1191
00:51:03,706 --> 00:51:06,777
It took over ten takes, and the director said,

1192
00:51:06,777 --> 00:51:07,806
(I was so nervous that I made a mistake over ten times.)

1193
00:51:08,217 --> 00:51:10,916
"AD! Change the actor right now!"

1194
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:12,117
(The director wanted to switch him with someone else.)

1195
00:51:12,347 --> 00:51:14,047
- You lost your role?
- Yes, right away.

1196
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,086
(They changed the actor?)

1197
00:51:15,086 --> 00:51:16,987
- Well...
- So that was your first take.

1198
00:51:16,987 --> 00:51:18,186
- Yes, it was.
- Gosh.

1199
00:51:18,757 --> 00:51:19,887
But he got fired.

1200
00:51:21,157 --> 00:51:22,327
- He should've been in the video.
- I know.

1201
00:51:23,027 --> 00:51:27,027
When I was a rookie actor,

1202
00:51:27,396 --> 00:51:29,996
I was shooting a historical drama, and I fell off a horse.

1203
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:33,367
- I had a crack in my spine...
- Oh, gosh.

1204
00:51:33,367 --> 00:51:34,806
but I didn't tell anyone about it and went on with acting.

1205
00:51:35,606 --> 00:51:36,876
(Why?)

1206
00:51:38,347 --> 00:51:41,177
I was afraid that they might replace me if I told them I was injured.

1207
00:51:41,577 --> 00:51:43,016
- I see.
- I understand.

1208
00:51:43,876 --> 00:51:45,617
So I just endured the pain.

1209
00:51:46,246 --> 00:51:48,916
Because it was right before they started shooting.

1210
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:50,487
(It was right before the shoot of all times.)

1211
00:51:50,487 --> 00:51:53,027
- I was practicing and got injured.
- I see. So if they found out,

1212
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,356
- they could've replaced you.
- Yes, exactly.

1213
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:58,797
- Gosh...
- Hae In is really tenacious.

1214
00:51:58,797 --> 00:51:59,896
(As a new actor, he didn't want to lose any opportunity.)

1215
00:52:00,496 --> 00:52:04,297
(He was desperate, and he didn't spare himself.)

1216
00:52:04,737 --> 00:52:09,277
(He continued his career step by step.)

1217
00:52:09,777 --> 00:52:11,606
I think desperation is the key.

1218
00:52:11,606 --> 00:52:14,277
- I agree.
- Not only for actors. For everyone.

1219
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,746
- Not getting injured is important.
- Of course.

1220
00:52:18,746 --> 00:52:20,817
You're right. We always have to be careful.

1221
00:52:20,817 --> 00:52:23,356
It doesn't matter how nice I look in the scene.

1222
00:52:24,157 --> 00:52:26,387
From the start to the end, we shouldn't get injured.

1223
00:52:26,387 --> 00:52:28,927
- That's the most important thing.
- Absolutely.

1224
00:52:29,356 --> 00:52:32,766
(Health is the most important thing.)

1225
00:52:32,867 --> 00:52:35,237
Speaking of health,

1226
00:52:35,697 --> 00:52:39,007
why don't we go and see healthy doenjang and soy sauce?

1227
00:52:39,007 --> 00:52:40,237
- Doenjang?
- Yes, right over there.

1228
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:41,677
- Okay. Let's go.
- Yes, let's go and see doenjang.

1229
00:52:41,677 --> 00:52:43,177
(Come and see me.)

1230
00:52:44,137 --> 00:52:48,376
(Shall we go and get some fermented sauces?)

1231
00:52:49,317 --> 00:52:50,317
Here we are.

1232
00:52:50,677 --> 00:52:53,347
There are 1,000 crocks here.

1233
00:52:54,347 --> 00:52:59,126
(Inside the 1,000 crocks,)

1234
00:52:59,126 --> 00:53:03,396
(different sauces and pastes are being fermented.)

1235
00:53:05,126 --> 00:53:08,936
(He is counting to see if there are really 1,000 crocks.)

1236
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,936
My gosh, there he goes again. Suspicious Hee Won is counting them.

1237
00:53:12,206 --> 00:53:13,237
Goodness.

1238
00:53:13,237 --> 00:53:16,436
(When it comes to things like this, he is pretty meticulous.)

1239
00:53:18,106 --> 00:53:20,577
- It smells like fermented sauces.
- Yes, I can smell it too.

1240
00:53:20,577 --> 00:53:22,347
- You can smell it, right?
- Yes, totally.

1241
00:53:22,876 --> 00:53:23,876
There is the owner.

1242
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:27,016
- Hello.
- Hello.

1243
00:53:27,016 --> 00:53:28,887
(After smelling it, they are more curious about how they would taste.)

1244
00:53:28,887 --> 00:53:30,856
- Could you show us some of them?
- Sure. This way.

1245
00:53:30,856 --> 00:53:33,556
- It's new soy sauce made this year.
- New soy sauce?

1246
00:53:33,556 --> 00:53:35,197
Yes, it's also called clear soy sauce.

1247
00:53:35,197 --> 00:53:37,027
I would like you to taste it.

1248
00:53:37,027 --> 00:53:38,027
(Clear soy sauce, which was newly made this year)

1249
00:53:38,327 --> 00:53:39,467
(Staring)

1250
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:40,666
So it was made this year?

1251
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,637
That's right. We made it this year.

1252
00:53:42,836 --> 00:53:45,106
This isn't fully fermented yet.

1253
00:53:45,106 --> 00:53:48,407
- So it needs to be fermented?
- Yes. It's being fermented.

1254
00:53:48,606 --> 00:53:50,007
- That's amazing.
- Right.

1255
00:53:50,536 --> 00:53:53,077
- That's awesome.
- You can use it for soups...

1256
00:53:53,077 --> 00:53:54,717
or for seasoned vegetables.

1257
00:53:54,717 --> 00:53:56,077
- Is it like soup soy sauce?
- You use it for the lighter taste.

1258
00:53:56,077 --> 00:53:58,686
- Yes, it's used as soup soy sauce.
- Oh, okay.

1259
00:53:59,586 --> 00:54:02,387
Since it's not fully fermented, the colour is closer to brown...

1260
00:54:02,387 --> 00:54:05,257
- rather than black.
- I see.

1261
00:54:06,257 --> 00:54:08,496
(Tasting)

1262
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:09,527
I should try it.

1263
00:54:09,726 --> 00:54:16,297
(They are sipping and tasting clear soy sauce.)

1264
00:54:19,336 --> 00:54:21,777
(Sipping)

1265
00:54:23,507 --> 00:54:26,447
(My gosh.)

1266
00:54:26,646 --> 00:54:29,277
(It's salty.)

1267
00:54:29,447 --> 00:54:31,146
- As it's not fully fermented, - Yes, I can see that.

1268
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:33,586
it tastes more like salt.

1269
00:54:33,586 --> 00:54:34,646
- Yes.
- Oh, come on.

1270
00:54:35,387 --> 00:54:37,856
Did you think it was sikhye or something?

1271
00:54:38,257 --> 00:54:40,226
- He drank it like it's Sujeonggwa.
- Right.

1272
00:54:41,657 --> 00:54:44,126
Well, you're definitely not in the mood for tasting.

1273
00:54:44,456 --> 00:54:46,367
- You know what though?
- Gosh, it's so salty.

1274
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:47,726
It still tastes more like fermented soybeans.

1275
00:54:47,726 --> 00:54:49,137
- I know, right?
- Yes, fermented soybeans.

1276
00:54:49,797 --> 00:54:51,197
(Fermented soybeans?)

1277
00:54:51,197 --> 00:54:53,967
- It smells like fermented soybeans.
- Yes, it does.

1278
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:56,206
Hae In can notice differences in flavours.

1279
00:54:56,206 --> 00:54:58,407
He's right. It still tastes like fermented soybeans.

1280
00:54:58,407 --> 00:55:00,376
(Hae In is good at noticing differences in flavours.)

1281
00:55:01,246 --> 00:55:04,817
- Can we taste regular soy sauce?
- For sure.

1282
00:55:04,817 --> 00:55:06,686
- Which way should we go?
- This way, please.

1283
00:55:06,686 --> 00:55:09,056
- This is regular soy sauce, right?
- That's right.

1284
00:55:09,217 --> 00:55:11,416
How long should it be fermented in the crock to make a flavour?

1285
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:13,887
Normally, it's fermented for 3 to 5 years.

1286
00:55:13,887 --> 00:55:16,257
(Exclaiming)

1287
00:55:16,597 --> 00:55:18,297
(Middle soy sauce, which has been fermented for five years)

1288
00:55:18,297 --> 00:55:19,766
As it's more fermented,

1289
00:55:19,766 --> 00:55:22,197
it doesn't smell as much as fermented soybeans anymore.

1290
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:25,766
When it's used for dishes, it gives more savoury taste and sweetness.

1291
00:55:26,336 --> 00:55:27,407
Here.

1292
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:29,706
(A little bit)

1293
00:55:29,907 --> 00:55:31,706
(Let's see.)

1294
00:55:31,976 --> 00:55:33,507
(Tasting with his tongue)

1295
00:55:34,847 --> 00:55:38,246
(How is the taste changed as it's more fermented?)

1296
00:55:39,146 --> 00:55:41,516
(Sipping)

1297
00:55:41,987 --> 00:55:45,956
(It's salty.)

1298
00:55:46,226 --> 00:55:49,327
Whether you try it a bit or a lot, soy sauce is still salty.

1299
00:55:49,327 --> 00:55:50,327
That's right.

1300
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,166
Hee Won, you have hunched shoulders. You can relax your shoulders now.

1301
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:54,936
My gosh, it's too salty.

1302
00:55:54,936 --> 00:55:56,936
(His shoulders are hunched because of the saltiness.)

1303
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:57,936
It's salty.

1304
00:55:57,936 --> 00:55:59,666
Well, the taste remains in my mouth.

1305
00:56:00,836 --> 00:56:02,936
It's very profound. Don't you think so?

1306
00:56:03,936 --> 00:56:05,476
(Sipping)

1307
00:56:05,677 --> 00:56:09,617
(It still has a strong salty taste.)

1308
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:10,617
Okay, then.

1309
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,416
- Let me show you seed soy sauce.
- Seed soy sauce?

1310
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:15,387
- Yes, that's the most precious one.
- Okay.

1311
00:56:15,387 --> 00:56:16,786
Oh, is this the one?

1312
00:56:16,786 --> 00:56:19,056
- Yes, this is seed soy sauce.
- How long has it been fermented?

1313
00:56:19,056 --> 00:56:20,786
It's been fermented for about 30 years.

1314
00:56:21,027 --> 00:56:22,356
- For 30 years?
- That's right.

1315
00:56:22,356 --> 00:56:23,527
- That's crazy.
- Yes.

1316
00:56:23,626 --> 00:56:27,027
So for 30 years, it went through 4 different seasons every year.

1317
00:56:27,027 --> 00:56:28,597
Seed soy sauce fermented for 30 years.

1318
00:56:28,597 --> 00:56:30,036
(Opening the lid of seed soy sauce)

1319
00:56:30,036 --> 00:56:31,867
- I'll leave the lid here.
- My gosh, this is amazing.

1320
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:34,036
- Dong Il.
- It smells totally different.

1321
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:43,547
(How is it different after being fermented for 30 years?)

1322
00:56:44,476 --> 00:56:47,646
(Expectant)

1323
00:56:49,217 --> 00:56:50,617
First...

1324
00:56:50,617 --> 00:56:52,987
Look at the colour. It's so dark.

1325
00:56:53,226 --> 00:56:54,856
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

1326
00:56:55,396 --> 00:56:57,996
(Eye-opening)

1327
00:56:58,197 --> 00:56:59,666
Gosh, it's totally black.

1328
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,097
Yes. Take this, please.

1329
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:04,637
(He is shocked by how it looks.)

1330
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:06,737
- Oh, my...
- Take this, please.

1331
00:57:06,737 --> 00:57:10,177
(Pitch-black)

1332
00:57:10,706 --> 00:57:12,547
My gosh, this is extraordinary.

1333
00:57:13,206 --> 00:57:15,217
No, not like that. Just dip your spoon like this.

1334
00:57:15,217 --> 00:57:16,817
I know. Here, I got a bit on it.

1335
00:57:16,817 --> 00:57:17,876
It's still too much.

1336
00:57:17,876 --> 00:57:18,887
(How would 30-year-old seed soy sauce taste?)

1337
00:57:19,586 --> 00:57:21,117
- You tasted too much.
- I think it'll be too salty.

1338
00:57:21,117 --> 00:57:22,686
(It must be too salty.)

1339
00:57:22,887 --> 00:57:24,956
(How does it taste?)

1340
00:57:24,956 --> 00:57:25,956
It's actually not really...

1341
00:57:26,387 --> 00:57:28,927
(What?)

1342
00:57:29,657 --> 00:57:32,166
- It's actually not really...
- Dong Il. It's not salty.

1343
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,597
- What?
- But you just frowned.

1344
00:57:35,597 --> 00:57:36,666
- Did you have a cramp in your face?
- No.

1345
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:37,697
(It's soy sauce. How can it not be salty?)

1346
00:57:37,936 --> 00:57:39,637
I'm serious. I'm not joking.

1347
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:43,436
I'm telling you, it tastes a bit like starch syrup or grain syrup.

1348
00:57:43,436 --> 00:57:44,737
- Because it has the deep taste...
- It's somehow sweet.

1349
00:57:44,737 --> 00:57:45,777
(It's sweet.)

1350
00:57:45,777 --> 00:57:47,347
Seriously, it tastes like grain syrup a bit.

1351
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:50,077
It's totally different from the other ones. It's savoury.

1352
00:57:50,077 --> 00:57:51,117
You're right.

1353
00:57:52,186 --> 00:57:54,686
(Dong Il tastes it too.)

1354
00:57:54,686 --> 00:57:55,817
- It's savoury.
- Really?

1355
00:57:58,157 --> 00:58:01,056
- I mean, it's still salty. But...
- But this is different.

1356
00:58:01,056 --> 00:58:02,927
- It's really different.
- It's somehow sweet too.

1357
00:58:03,257 --> 00:58:06,097
- This is very different.
- Right.

1358
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:08,467
Somehow, it tastes a bit like red ginseng too.

1359
00:58:08,467 --> 00:58:10,367
- I totally agree.
- Right?

1360
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:11,706
He is right. It has the red ginseng taste too.

1361
00:58:11,706 --> 00:58:13,766
(It tastes less salty and has more flavours.)

1362
00:58:14,007 --> 00:58:17,137
Let me show you why it tastes less salty.

1363
00:58:17,907 --> 00:58:20,447
This is what I want to show you.

1364
00:58:20,447 --> 00:58:21,947
(Curious)

1365
00:58:21,947 --> 00:58:25,516
You can hear this rattling sound inside, right?

1366
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,686
(What is that?)

1367
00:58:28,686 --> 00:58:29,956
- What?
- What is that?

1368
00:58:30,317 --> 00:58:33,226
During the fermentation, crystals of salt called "seokjang" are created.

1369
00:58:33,856 --> 00:58:34,887
I see.

1370
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:37,056
It's made normally when soy sauce is fermented for over ten years.

1371
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,996
- Oh, it is?
- Normally, it takes...

1372
00:58:38,996 --> 00:58:42,137
about 20 years for the crystals to be big and dark like this.

1373
00:58:42,137 --> 00:58:43,896
That's amazing.

1374
00:58:44,336 --> 00:58:46,836
- That's really interesting.
- That's fascinating.

1375
00:58:47,306 --> 00:58:48,436
I've never seen anything like that before.

1376
00:58:49,376 --> 00:58:52,677
(Seokjang is a crystal of salt naturally made...)

1377
00:58:52,677 --> 00:58:55,476
(during the long fermentation of soy sauce.)

1378
00:58:55,947 --> 00:58:58,347
The crystal of salt has its savoury taste.

1379
00:58:58,347 --> 00:59:01,717
So you can crush it and use it like regular salt.

1380
00:59:02,356 --> 00:59:06,126
(Rattling)

1381
00:59:06,327 --> 00:59:08,697
(Amazed)

1382
00:59:08,956 --> 00:59:10,496
Is there gochujang as well?

1383
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:11,927
Yes, we have gochujang too.

1384
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:13,766
- Yes, we have gochujang too.
- Hae In, you like gochujang. Right?

1385
00:59:13,766 --> 00:59:14,967
- Yes, I do.
- Me too.

1386
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:16,867
- My gosh.
- Yes. I like gochujang.

1387
00:59:16,867 --> 00:59:19,306
- You do?
- Because he likes spicy food.

1388
00:59:19,907 --> 00:59:21,666
The gochujang is on this side.

1389
00:59:21,876 --> 00:59:24,177
Hae In is interested in this too.

1390
00:59:24,177 --> 00:59:26,907
- Gochujang.
- Gochujang.

1391
00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:29,677
(Exclaiming)

1392
00:59:29,677 --> 00:59:30,746
(The smell of the gochujang)

1393
00:59:31,077 --> 00:59:32,146
It's pretty.

1394
00:59:32,786 --> 00:59:37,556
(Excited)

1395
00:59:39,786 --> 00:59:46,697
(The fresh gochujang has ripened well.)

1396
00:59:47,266 --> 00:59:48,496
- Is it good?
- Try it.

1397
00:59:48,496 --> 00:59:50,036
- Is it good?
- Try it.

1398
00:59:50,036 --> 00:59:51,237
(He tastes the gochujang.)

1399
00:59:51,697 --> 00:59:52,766
(In awe)

1400
00:59:52,766 --> 00:59:53,766
Isn't it good?

1401
00:59:54,637 --> 00:59:56,476
- This is really good.
- It's very good.

1402
00:59:56,476 --> 00:59:59,077
(The gochujang satisfies the palate of the two oldest brothers.)

1403
00:59:59,947 --> 01:00:01,347
- Goodness.
- This gochujang is good.

1404
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:05,447
(Exclaiming)

1405
01:00:05,447 --> 01:00:06,746
This is really good.

1406
01:00:09,956 --> 01:00:12,387
(He acknowledges that the gochujang tastes good.)

1407
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:14,657
The gochujang is really good.

1408
01:00:14,657 --> 01:00:16,556
(He's filling the container with gochujang for tonight's dinner.)

1409
01:00:16,556 --> 01:00:17,556
This is the best.

1410
01:00:18,867 --> 01:00:20,496
I don't want what's on the outside to go to waste.

1411
01:00:20,496 --> 01:00:22,036
(There's a bit of gochujang on the outside.)

1412
01:00:22,266 --> 01:00:25,507
(He uses his spoon.)

1413
01:00:25,836 --> 01:00:29,277
(He can't let even a bit go to waste.)

1414
01:00:29,436 --> 01:00:32,306
(Hee Won, let's go home.)

1415
01:00:32,547 --> 01:00:35,547
You can tell how much care went into making this. It's so good.

1416
01:00:35,547 --> 01:00:39,186
(Since we saw the delicious gochujang...)

1417
01:00:39,447 --> 01:00:42,956
We mixed the doenjang that is 2 to 6 years old together...

1418
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:45,786
and let it ferment another year.

1419
01:00:46,056 --> 01:00:48,286
This is real homemade doenjang.

1420
01:00:48,496 --> 01:00:52,226
(Totally focused)

1421
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:55,237
(He tastes it.)

1422
01:00:55,737 --> 01:00:57,936
Oh, my. It's good.

1423
01:00:59,336 --> 01:01:00,737
It's exactly what I like.

1424
01:01:00,737 --> 01:01:01,737
(Dong Il likes the doenjang.)

1425
01:01:01,737 --> 01:01:03,336
- It's good.
- This is...

1426
01:01:03,336 --> 01:01:04,336
Totally.

1427
01:01:04,336 --> 01:01:06,146
This is what pastes should taste like.

1428
01:01:06,146 --> 01:01:08,077
This has been passed down from one generation to another.

1429
01:01:08,746 --> 01:01:10,847
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much. We'll enjoy it.

1430
01:01:10,847 --> 01:01:12,086
Thank you.

1431
01:01:12,786 --> 01:01:20,726
(They got a lot of delicious pastes from the crocks out front.)

1432
01:01:21,927 --> 01:01:26,197
(What kind of dishes will be born from the pastes they got?)

1433
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:28,166
Let's go on a walk to get snacks.

1434
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,706
Let's neutralize the saltiness with some sweets.

1435
01:01:32,706 --> 01:01:33,867
(Shall we walk around the neighbourhood to get snacks?)

1436
01:01:34,836 --> 01:01:36,036
This is so nice.

1437
01:01:36,876 --> 01:01:38,507
This is so therapeutic.

1438
01:01:38,507 --> 01:01:39,876
(This is so therapeutic.)

1439
01:01:39,876 --> 01:01:41,476
This kind of place...

1440
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:44,746
I understand what you meant now.

1441
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:47,016
I'm realizing what you meant when you said it's therapeutic.

1442
01:01:50,757 --> 01:01:52,827
- The weather is so nice.
- Right?

1443
01:01:52,827 --> 01:01:53,987
(The weather is so nice too.)

1444
01:01:54,856 --> 01:01:57,396
This is amazing.

1445
01:01:59,597 --> 01:02:01,527
(They enjoy the quiet and still leisure.)

1446
01:02:01,527 --> 01:02:03,467
This is so nice.

1447
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:08,336
I never knew there was so much to eat.

1448
01:02:08,336 --> 01:02:09,376
I'm serious.

1449
01:02:09,777 --> 01:02:10,777
It's nice.

1450
01:02:10,777 --> 01:02:13,277
(Where did they arrive while they talked and walked?)

1451
01:02:13,277 --> 01:02:16,547
- Hyomaru Traditional Hangwa.
- Hyomaru Traditional Hangwa.

1452
01:02:18,646 --> 01:02:19,686
Hello.

1453
01:02:19,847 --> 01:02:21,586
- Hello.
- Hello.

1454
01:02:21,586 --> 01:02:24,456
- We're here to buy hangwa.
- Hello.

1455
01:02:24,456 --> 01:02:26,027
I see. Welcome.

1456
01:02:26,686 --> 01:02:28,456
- Goodness.
- That looks good.

1457
01:02:28,456 --> 01:02:29,996
(This hangwa place makes their own hangwa.)

1458
01:02:30,297 --> 01:02:33,126
(Interested)

1459
01:02:33,126 --> 01:02:35,597
I've never seen the process of making this.

1460
01:02:35,697 --> 01:02:36,797
- Me neither.
- Right?

1461
01:02:37,597 --> 01:02:40,436
If you soak it in water for a week, it gets fermented.

1462
01:02:42,536 --> 01:02:45,106
- Oh, my.
- It expands, right?

1463
01:02:45,547 --> 01:02:48,447
(It gets bigger after being fried in oil.)

1464
01:02:48,447 --> 01:02:49,646
It's like puffed rice.

1465
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,916
- It's like magic.
- Right?

1466
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:55,987
Goodness. Is this grain syrup?

1467
01:02:55,987 --> 01:02:57,757
Yes. It's ginger grain syrup.

1468
01:02:57,757 --> 01:03:00,327
- I see. I can smell the ginger.
- Right?

1469
01:03:00,327 --> 01:03:01,327
(They cover the fried glutinous rice in ginger grain syrup.)

1470
01:03:01,327 --> 01:03:02,556
Like this.

1471
01:03:02,797 --> 01:03:05,097
- Goodness.
- This is...

1472
01:03:05,226 --> 01:03:06,996
After you put grain syrup on it what are you covering it with?

1473
01:03:06,996 --> 01:03:09,036
Puffed rice. We're covering it with that.

1474
01:03:09,867 --> 01:03:14,637
(Then it's hangwa that's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.)

1475
01:03:14,766 --> 01:03:17,277
(That looks good.)

1476
01:03:17,277 --> 01:03:18,476
I see.

1477
01:03:19,077 --> 01:03:20,777
We fry the rice...

1478
01:03:20,777 --> 01:03:22,677
and make it into a powder and cover it..

1479
01:03:22,677 --> 01:03:23,746
Can we each try one?

1480
01:03:24,177 --> 01:03:26,047
Go ahead. Try some.

1481
01:03:26,047 --> 01:03:27,516
Does it taste a bit like ginger?

1482
01:03:27,516 --> 01:03:29,416
- Here. Try this.
- Thank you.

1483
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:30,416
This is really good.

1484
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:32,387
(Exclaiming)

1485
01:03:33,487 --> 01:03:36,527
(He's addicted to the hangwa.)

1486
01:03:36,527 --> 01:03:38,197
(He gets another one.)

1487
01:03:38,197 --> 01:03:40,967
It'll be very good because it's fresh.

1488
01:03:40,967 --> 01:03:43,867
Everything here is handmade.

1489
01:03:43,867 --> 01:03:45,407
(Savouring)

1490
01:03:45,806 --> 01:03:47,637
This is really good.

1491
01:03:49,306 --> 01:03:50,706
(He eats it in one bite.)

1492
01:03:52,476 --> 01:03:55,717
(The youngest is happy too.)

1493
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,547
(They buy a bunch of warm hangwa that is flavoured with ginger.)

1494
01:03:57,547 --> 01:03:58,916
That's really good.

1495
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:01,086
It's good when you have it hot.

1496
01:04:01,347 --> 01:04:02,856
- Hello.
- Hello.

1497
01:04:02,856 --> 01:04:04,586
- Hello.
- Hello.

1498
01:04:04,586 --> 01:04:06,157
- Hello.
- Hello.

1499
01:04:06,527 --> 01:04:09,427
- There are fall strawberries?
- Yes.

1500
01:04:09,856 --> 01:04:14,126
(The House on Wheels 3 family is here to see strawberries.)

1501
01:04:15,766 --> 01:04:19,706
(These strawberries were grown in our neighbourhood, Yeongju.)

1502
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:25,137
(They're sweet and aromatic seolhyang strawberries.)

1503
01:04:25,777 --> 01:04:26,847
Try some.

1504
01:04:26,847 --> 01:04:27,907
(He takes a big bite.)

1505
01:04:28,476 --> 01:04:29,577
What is this?

1506
01:04:29,577 --> 01:04:30,617
(Yelling)

1507
01:04:31,646 --> 01:04:33,686
- It's really sweet too.
- It's very sweet.

1508
01:04:33,686 --> 01:04:34,686
- Right?
- Yes.

1509
01:04:34,686 --> 01:04:36,416
- See how red it is.
- Isn't it good?

1510
01:04:36,586 --> 01:04:37,916
(Taking a bite)

1511
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:39,157
- Goodness.
- How is it?

1512
01:04:39,157 --> 01:04:40,487
(Taking another bite)

1513
01:04:40,487 --> 01:04:41,527
How is it so sweet?

1514
01:04:42,197 --> 01:04:43,456
I can't eat things that are sour.

1515
01:04:43,456 --> 01:04:44,996
(He looks like he's about to eat the stem too.)

1516
01:04:44,996 --> 01:04:47,766
It gets sweeter the colder it gets.

1517
01:04:48,126 --> 01:04:49,197
Shall we go?

1518
01:04:49,197 --> 01:04:51,297
(The family gets ready to pick their own strawberries.)

1519
01:04:53,206 --> 01:04:54,336
It's so easy to pick.

1520
01:04:59,677 --> 01:05:04,976
(The youngest picks pretty strawberries.)

1521
01:05:05,317 --> 01:05:08,347
When people tell me to do this, I don't because I'm lazy.

1522
01:05:08,347 --> 01:05:09,887
But I'm excited to do this.

1523
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:13,157
These are really pretty.

1524
01:05:13,157 --> 01:05:14,786
(Dong Il has fallen head over heels for the red strawberries.)

1525
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,697
- I know.
- Right?

1526
01:05:16,697 --> 01:05:18,157
Gosh, these strawberries are...

1527
01:05:18,626 --> 01:05:21,827
Goodness. How... Look at this, Hee Won.

1528
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:24,367
Look at this. They're bright red.

1529
01:05:28,737 --> 01:05:29,806
Look at this.

1530
01:05:30,507 --> 01:05:31,836
- Dong Il.
- Yes?

1531
01:05:31,836 --> 01:05:33,447
I might get lost picking strawberries.

1532
01:05:34,376 --> 01:05:38,077
Hey. We have to pick all of these. We can't just leave.

1533
01:05:38,277 --> 01:05:39,586
But still...

1534
01:05:40,786 --> 01:05:42,856
- Don't take breaks on the way back.
- What?

1535
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,416
Don't take breaks on the way back.

1536
01:05:44,956 --> 01:05:48,027
(He's picking strawberries until the last moment.)

1537
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,527
- I wasn't tired picking them.
- Right.

1538
01:05:52,226 --> 01:05:53,867
- This is fun.
- I agree.

1539
01:05:54,467 --> 01:05:56,036
It feels nice to pick them ourselves.

1540
01:05:56,036 --> 01:05:57,036
(They got a ton of sweet, red strawberries.)

1541
01:05:57,036 --> 01:06:00,836
(They walk back as the sun sets,)

1542
01:06:01,436 --> 01:06:05,947
(and they arrive back at their cozy home in no time.)

1543
01:06:06,646 --> 01:06:08,476
Let's sit down for a bit.

1544
01:06:08,476 --> 01:06:13,916
(The family returns after their sweet walk.)

1545
01:06:14,947 --> 01:06:18,286
(Peaceful)

1546
01:06:18,387 --> 01:06:20,827
(Meanwhile, Hee Won...)

1547
01:06:21,356 --> 01:06:22,496
(is addicted to the hangwa.)

1548
01:06:22,496 --> 01:06:24,396
(Should I have some or not?)

1549
01:06:24,396 --> 01:06:26,027
(Should I have some?)

1550
01:06:26,027 --> 01:06:27,927
(Or not?)

1551
01:06:28,367 --> 01:06:30,097
I can't keep these in front of me.

1552
01:06:30,336 --> 01:06:32,306
I keep wanting to eat it.

1553
01:06:34,036 --> 01:06:35,536
Eat it. We bought them to eat.

1554
01:06:35,536 --> 01:06:38,137
I want to eat it after dinner.

1555
01:06:38,137 --> 01:06:39,806
You can have some now and more later.

1556
01:06:40,347 --> 01:06:42,246
These hangwas...

1557
01:06:42,246 --> 01:06:43,547
(His hands reach for them.)

1558
01:06:43,547 --> 01:06:45,586
(Have some.)

1559
01:06:46,186 --> 01:06:49,317
We should each have one and not eat anymore. Here.

1560
01:06:49,856 --> 01:06:52,856
Once you start, you can't stop.

1561
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:55,956
(This is hard to resist.)

1562
01:06:56,726 --> 01:06:58,527
(Nodding)

1563
01:06:58,867 --> 01:06:59,896
Isn't this so good?

1564
01:07:01,996 --> 01:07:03,896
- This is delicious.
- Right?

1565
01:07:04,137 --> 01:07:06,536
He's like a kid. He likes sweets.

1566
01:07:07,936 --> 01:07:10,637
(I want a strawberry too.)

1567
01:07:10,836 --> 01:07:12,206
(He's salivating.)

1568
01:07:13,146 --> 01:07:14,206
Do you want one too?

1569
01:07:14,206 --> 01:07:15,947
(He drops the strawberry.)

1570
01:07:16,047 --> 01:07:17,677
I can't believe I dropped this precious strawberry.

1571
01:07:18,376 --> 01:07:19,416
I'll eat this one.

1572
01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:24,717
(They each have a strawberry too.)

1573
01:07:24,717 --> 01:07:25,757
Have one too.

1574
01:07:27,956 --> 01:07:30,527
(Eating)

1575
01:07:31,027 --> 01:07:34,327
(Ecstatic)

1576
01:07:34,327 --> 01:07:35,396
You took it from me.

1577
01:07:37,096 --> 01:07:38,837
(While they enjoy their snack,)

1578
01:07:38,837 --> 01:07:40,067
- That is...
- A small one.

1579
01:07:41,636 --> 01:07:42,676
(darkness falls on their front yard.)

1580
01:07:42,676 --> 01:07:43,837
It gets dark really quickly.

1581
01:07:44,377 --> 01:07:47,247
- Shall we start getting ready?
- Okay.

1582
01:07:49,317 --> 01:07:50,346
All right.

1583
01:07:51,646 --> 01:07:52,646
Let's get started.

1584
01:07:54,287 --> 01:07:56,957
Goodness, will we get to eat...

1585
01:07:57,587 --> 01:07:58,716
Hae In's cooking?

1586
01:07:58,716 --> 01:07:59,856
(Are we going to try Hae In's cooking?)

1587
01:07:59,856 --> 01:08:00,886
His doenjang stew?

1588
01:08:01,457 --> 01:08:02,796
I'll try to make it delicious.

1589
01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:04,796
(During the day...)

1590
01:08:04,796 --> 01:08:07,367
Hae In, it sounds like you know how to cook.

1591
01:08:07,367 --> 01:08:09,936
Me? I'm not that good at cooking, but I'm good at eating.

1592
01:08:09,936 --> 01:08:11,266
(I'm not good at cooking, but I'm good at eating.)

1593
01:08:11,266 --> 01:08:13,167
(Embarrassed)

1594
01:08:13,737 --> 01:08:15,506
Right. Your kimchi Jeon was terrible.

1595
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:18,306
(Hee Won!)

1596
01:08:19,546 --> 01:08:21,077
I was scared for a moment there.

1597
01:08:22,077 --> 01:08:23,947
No. Your kimchi Jeon was good.

1598
01:08:24,646 --> 01:08:25,716
Give me another chance.

1599
01:08:26,117 --> 01:08:27,186
Really?

1600
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,157
Then make doenjang stew.

1601
01:08:29,157 --> 01:08:30,186
(Do you want to try making doenjang stew?)

1602
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:31,817
- Since we have good ingredients.
- Okay.

1603
01:08:31,817 --> 01:08:32,987
(Determined)

1604
01:08:33,487 --> 01:08:35,027
I'm excited about tonight's dinner.

1605
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:36,756
(That's how Hae In ended up in the kitchen.)

1606
01:08:37,056 --> 01:08:38,997
- I'll use this side of the kitchen.
- Okay.

1607
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:40,697
I'll keep it simple.

1608
01:08:40,697 --> 01:08:42,796
(Meanwhile, Dong Il takes his spot in the corner of the kitchen.)

1609
01:08:43,537 --> 01:08:46,237
(He takes a look in the refrigerator.)

1610
01:08:47,306 --> 01:08:50,737
(Dong Il takes out the slab of pork belly.)

1611
01:08:51,277 --> 01:08:53,676
- For spicy pork belly?
- Yes. Seasoned pork belly.

1612
01:08:54,106 --> 01:08:56,417
(What is today's dinner that is already making him salivate?)

1613
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:59,487
(Surrounding our front yard...)

1614
01:08:59,487 --> 01:09:03,516
(are a bunch of crocks filled with earthy aromas.)

1615
01:09:03,787 --> 01:09:08,056
(With the deep and rich doenjang,)

1616
01:09:08,056 --> 01:09:11,896
(Hae In will add various vegetables and boil them together...)

1617
01:09:12,197 --> 01:09:15,997
(to make his doenjang stew.)

1618
01:09:16,296 --> 01:09:19,636
(With the savoury fresh gochujang,)

1619
01:09:19,636 --> 01:09:23,806
(Dong Il will season the pork belly...)

1620
01:09:24,176 --> 01:09:30,976
(and make a sweet and spicy gochujang pork belly dish.)

1621
01:09:31,216 --> 01:09:34,846
(Today's dinner will be made with the pastes from the front yard.)

1622
01:09:35,247 --> 01:09:38,516
(Chef Sung steps up to make gochujang pork belly.)

1623
01:09:39,686 --> 01:09:42,396
- I'll cut thick slices.
- Sounds good.

1624
01:09:42,396 --> 01:09:45,766
(He cuts the pork belly into thick slices.)

1625
01:09:45,766 --> 01:09:47,926
(He's filled with excitement.)

1626
01:09:47,926 --> 01:09:50,296
Since you're here today, I'll make it a bit spicy.

1627
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:54,207
(He adds minced garlic.)

1628
01:09:54,207 --> 01:09:57,436
(He sprinkles red chilli powder.)

1629
01:09:57,806 --> 01:09:59,846
(Exclaiming)

1630
01:09:59,846 --> 01:10:01,306
This is incredible.

1631
01:10:01,306 --> 01:10:02,617
(The fresh gochujang from their front yard)

1632
01:10:02,617 --> 01:10:04,346
Hee Won. Taste this.

1633
01:10:04,346 --> 01:10:05,646
(Hee Won. Taste this.)

1634
01:10:07,417 --> 01:10:08,716
(Savouring)

1635
01:10:09,856 --> 01:10:12,287
- Doesn't the paste taste good?
- It does.

1636
01:10:13,327 --> 01:10:14,726
- It's really good.
- Isn't it?

1637
01:10:14,726 --> 01:10:15,896
(His taste buds explode after tasting the gochujang.)

1638
01:10:15,896 --> 01:10:18,096
This is really amazing.

1639
01:10:19,567 --> 01:10:21,527
(He adds a lot of fresh gochujang from their front yard.)

1640
01:10:21,527 --> 01:10:22,567
This looks good.

1641
01:10:24,966 --> 01:10:27,106
This will be good no matter what. Without a doubt.

1642
01:10:27,106 --> 01:10:29,407
(He mixes the sauce into the meat thoroughly.)

1643
01:10:30,506 --> 01:10:31,636
(The gochujang pork belly is done.)

1644
01:10:31,636 --> 01:10:32,907
That looks so good.

1645
01:10:34,046 --> 01:10:35,077
Isn't it amazing?

1646
01:10:35,877 --> 01:10:39,247
(Meanwhile, Hae In is...)

1647
01:10:40,686 --> 01:10:44,516
(He takes out the rice first.)

1648
01:10:45,556 --> 01:10:50,856
(Is he making rice instead of doenjang stew?)

1649
01:10:52,197 --> 01:10:55,667
(He rinses the rice.)

1650
01:10:55,896 --> 01:10:57,997
(Carefully)

1651
01:10:59,167 --> 01:11:02,777
(Then he puts the rice water into the pot.)

1652
01:11:03,106 --> 01:11:05,337
(To create a richer stew,)

1653
01:11:05,337 --> 01:11:06,377
(he sets aside some rice water.)

1654
01:11:06,377 --> 01:11:07,407
Oh, my.

1655
01:11:08,447 --> 01:11:12,716
(Then he begins to cut up the vegetables.)

1656
01:11:13,546 --> 01:11:15,386
(He cuts the vegetables evenly.)

1657
01:11:15,386 --> 01:11:16,556
Let's cut them well.

1658
01:11:17,287 --> 01:11:20,587
(Cutting)

1659
01:11:21,686 --> 01:11:23,096
(Peeking)

1660
01:11:23,096 --> 01:11:26,167
He's cutting the vegetables in a disciplined manner.

1661
01:11:26,296 --> 01:11:28,527
(Laughing)

1662
01:11:28,796 --> 01:11:30,266
(Peeking)

1663
01:11:30,266 --> 01:11:31,466
This is amazing.

1664
01:11:32,096 --> 01:11:34,106
- What is?
- The doenjang.

1665
01:11:34,106 --> 01:11:35,106
The doenjang? Isn't it?

1666
01:11:37,837 --> 01:11:39,077
He gave us so much.

1667
01:11:39,077 --> 01:11:47,046
(He puts in the doenjang.)

1668
01:11:47,516 --> 01:11:49,356
(Next...)

1669
01:11:50,087 --> 01:11:51,487
(He puts in the radishes which take the longest to cook.)

1670
01:11:51,487 --> 01:11:52,686
(Rolling)

1671
01:11:54,587 --> 01:11:55,657
Oh, my!

1672
01:11:56,056 --> 01:11:58,596
(He puts the fallen radish in quickly.)

1673
01:11:59,867 --> 01:12:05,596
(He stirs the pot to make sure the doenjang melts into the water.)

1674
01:12:06,067 --> 01:12:09,407
(When he got here, he ambitiously tried to cook...)

1675
01:12:09,676 --> 01:12:10,707
(It's burnt!)

1676
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:13,476
(But his kimchi Jeon got burnt.)

1677
01:12:14,146 --> 01:12:16,716
(I'm in trouble.)

1678
01:12:16,976 --> 01:12:20,317
(In order to make up for his kimchi Jeon fiasco,)

1679
01:12:20,817 --> 01:12:23,987
(he's focusing hard.)

1680
01:12:24,287 --> 01:12:26,856
(Hae In is doing his best.)

1681
01:12:27,587 --> 01:12:30,896
(He brings out the pot with the radish and doenjang in it.)

1682
01:12:31,627 --> 01:12:32,627
What are you doing?

1683
01:12:32,627 --> 01:12:33,627
(Hae In, what are you doing?)

1684
01:12:33,627 --> 01:12:35,896
I just need to boil it on high heat for about 6 to 7 minutes.

1685
01:12:38,837 --> 01:12:42,367
(He puts in on high heat, so the soup comes to a nice boil.)

1686
01:12:43,136 --> 01:12:46,377
(Then he goes back into the kitchen.)

1687
01:12:46,476 --> 01:12:48,377
(Gathering)

1688
01:12:48,846 --> 01:12:53,046
(He takes the vegetables that he cut up.)

1689
01:12:53,546 --> 01:12:54,587
And...

1690
01:12:56,817 --> 01:12:58,487
(Peeking)

1691
01:12:58,787 --> 01:12:59,987
(He stares inside the refrigerator.)

1692
01:12:59,987 --> 01:13:01,926
This is the ground beef.

1693
01:13:02,327 --> 01:13:03,327
Can I use some of this?

1694
01:13:04,027 --> 01:13:05,796
- I want to put in the stew.
- Sure.

1695
01:13:05,796 --> 01:13:06,796
(Hae In takes some ground beef to make the soup richer.)

1696
01:13:07,027 --> 01:13:08,067
And...

1697
01:13:08,067 --> 01:13:11,136
(Let me see...)

1698
01:13:11,737 --> 01:13:15,306
(He brings something else out too.)

1699
01:13:16,037 --> 01:13:17,106
What is that?

1700
01:13:18,176 --> 01:13:20,247
- It's soy sauce.
- Soy sauce?

1701
01:13:20,247 --> 01:13:21,306
(He will season it with the soy sauce.)

1702
01:13:21,577 --> 01:13:23,617
(You add soy sauce too?)

1703
01:13:24,277 --> 01:13:25,346
Here.

1704
01:13:25,346 --> 01:13:27,617
(He begins to add the ingredients he brought.)

1705
01:13:28,216 --> 01:13:29,216
Just one fistful.

1706
01:13:29,216 --> 01:13:30,386
(In order to create a richer flavour,)

1707
01:13:30,386 --> 01:13:33,587
(he adds a fistful of ground beef.)

1708
01:13:33,587 --> 01:13:35,657
- Okay.
- Put it all in at once.

1709
01:13:35,657 --> 01:13:37,027
(Careful)

1710
01:13:37,226 --> 01:13:42,667
(He puts in the vegetables carefully, so it doesn't overflow.)

1711
01:13:43,197 --> 01:13:46,806
(He adds umami with some soy sauce.)

1712
01:13:47,537 --> 01:13:50,676
(Does it taste okay?)

1713
01:13:52,947 --> 01:13:56,817
(He carefully tastes it.)

1714
01:13:56,817 --> 01:13:57,817
Okay.

1715
01:13:58,447 --> 01:14:05,087
(He adjusts the heat meticulously.)

1716
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:09,027
Why does it smell like an herbal tonic?

1717
01:14:10,127 --> 01:14:11,457
The doenjang stew is incredible.

1718
01:14:11,457 --> 01:14:14,466
(The doenjang stew is cooking well under Hae In's care.)

1719
01:14:15,966 --> 01:14:19,337
(He tastes the soup again...)

1720
01:14:19,337 --> 01:14:21,966
(to see if it tastes okay.)

1721
01:14:23,037 --> 01:14:25,306
How does it taste? Is it okay? Does it taste good?

1722
01:14:25,877 --> 01:14:26,947
Do you want to try some?

1723
01:14:27,146 --> 01:14:30,976
(Hee Won tastes it too.)

1724
01:14:31,516 --> 01:14:34,117
(How does it taste?)

1725
01:14:34,716 --> 01:14:35,886
Hey, it's really good.

1726
01:14:38,917 --> 01:14:39,957
Is it okay?

1727
01:14:39,957 --> 01:14:41,056
(Smiling)

1728
01:14:41,457 --> 01:14:44,096
- It's really good.
- I'm going to add brisket to it.

1729
01:14:44,096 --> 01:14:46,197
It's really good.

1730
01:14:46,867 --> 01:14:47,926
It's really good.

1731
01:14:48,167 --> 01:14:50,837
(He can't hide his smile upon hearing that it's good.)

1732
01:14:51,636 --> 01:14:54,037
(He takes another spoonful...)

1733
01:14:54,306 --> 01:14:55,936
(and goes to Dong Il.)

1734
01:14:55,936 --> 01:14:58,277
Can you taste this for me?

1735
01:14:58,277 --> 01:14:59,546
(Can you taste this for me?)

1736
01:14:59,907 --> 01:15:02,377
(Let's see.)

1737
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:04,747
- Hee Won?
- Yes?

1738
01:15:05,016 --> 01:15:07,546
- Let's open a restaurant with him!
- Okay.

1739
01:15:07,817 --> 01:15:08,987
(Smiling)

1740
01:15:08,987 --> 01:15:10,056
This won't do.

1741
01:15:10,556 --> 01:15:12,056
We can't just leave him be.

1742
01:15:12,056 --> 01:15:13,386
(The youngest has a taste too.)

1743
01:15:13,386 --> 01:15:14,556
- Does it taste okay?
- It tastes great.

1744
01:15:14,556 --> 01:15:16,356
- It's really good.
- It's very good.

1745
01:15:17,127 --> 01:15:18,527
Try it. Give some to Hee Won.

1746
01:15:18,527 --> 01:15:20,426
(Relieved)

1747
01:15:21,127 --> 01:15:24,096
(Does he need to add tofu now?)

1748
01:15:24,596 --> 01:15:27,266
(He grabs the tofu he took out earlier...)

1749
01:15:27,567 --> 01:15:30,436
(and cuts the corner slightly.)

1750
01:15:30,777 --> 01:15:34,546
(Pouring out the water)

1751
01:15:35,277 --> 01:15:38,016
- Hae In, I cut up the tofu for you.
- Okay.

1752
01:15:38,476 --> 01:15:39,516
Thank you.

1753
01:15:39,617 --> 01:15:40,947
You're so sensible. You took out the water too.

1754
01:15:42,317 --> 01:15:44,016
- Of course.
- "Of course."

1755
01:15:44,386 --> 01:15:45,457
Thank you.

1756
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:46,827
(They're so cute.)

1757
01:15:48,686 --> 01:15:51,896
(He adds the tofu...)

1758
01:15:51,896 --> 01:15:55,896
(that Myoung cut up for him.)

1759
01:15:59,067 --> 01:16:01,907
- Are you done?
- I'm going to add the brisket now.

1760
01:16:02,136 --> 01:16:03,176
Brisket?

1761
01:16:04,006 --> 01:16:06,306
What meat did you put in earlier? It wasn't brisket?

1762
01:16:07,176 --> 01:16:09,106
I added ground beef earlier.

1763
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:11,317
It was to add flavour to the broth.

1764
01:16:11,716 --> 01:16:14,247
(Oh, I see.)

1765
01:16:14,516 --> 01:16:16,587
I was watching Hae In,

1766
01:16:16,957 --> 01:16:19,527
and he knows how to cook. He knows the order.

1767
01:16:20,556 --> 01:16:21,587
I was watching him.

1768
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:23,657
He's not a bad cook.

1769
01:16:24,226 --> 01:16:25,926
(I should add the brisket now!)

1770
01:16:26,266 --> 01:16:29,896
(The finishing touch to Hae In's doenjang stew...)

1771
01:16:29,896 --> 01:16:33,907
(is the brisket he's adding carefully.)

1772
01:16:34,567 --> 01:16:41,506
(He puts it in one slice at a time, so they don't stick to each other.)

1773
01:16:42,006 --> 01:16:45,247
(Filled with brisket)

1774
01:16:45,247 --> 01:16:47,787
Goodness. What is all of this?

1775
01:16:48,447 --> 01:16:50,987
It looks amazing with the brisket in it.

1776
01:16:51,917 --> 01:16:54,657
(I'm glad you like it.)

1777
01:16:54,926 --> 01:16:56,457
We just need to grill this now.

1778
01:16:56,457 --> 01:16:57,497
(The well-marinated gochujang pork belly)

1779
01:16:57,497 --> 01:16:58,657
The gochujang pork belly.

1780
01:17:01,296 --> 01:17:03,867
This smells amazing. It smells so savoury.

1781
01:17:03,867 --> 01:17:06,407
(He warms up the perilla oil on the pan.)

1782
01:17:11,476 --> 01:17:12,537
It looks pretty good.

1783
01:17:12,537 --> 01:17:14,947
(He fills the pan with gochujang pork belly.)

1784
01:17:14,947 --> 01:17:17,277
This looks incredibly good.

1785
01:17:17,277 --> 01:17:18,417
(This looks incredibly good.)

1786
01:17:18,777 --> 01:17:19,787
Isn't it amazing?

1787
01:17:19,787 --> 01:17:21,747
(I know.)

1788
01:17:21,747 --> 01:17:23,087
(Swallowing)

1789
01:17:23,256 --> 01:17:24,386
Gosh, I'm salivating.

1790
01:17:24,587 --> 01:17:25,686
- You're salivating?
- Yes, I am.

1791
01:17:25,886 --> 01:17:27,787
(They're so cute.)

1792
01:17:29,027 --> 01:17:30,096
I think we can flip it now.

1793
01:17:30,096 --> 01:17:32,966
(The delicious sound of the gochujang sauce...)

1794
01:17:32,966 --> 01:17:34,627
(that stimulate our taste buds)

1795
01:17:34,627 --> 01:17:36,837
Goodness, the meat looks amazing.

1796
01:17:37,436 --> 01:17:40,837
The meat is good, but the gochujang is good too.

1797
01:17:40,837 --> 01:17:44,407
(Golden)

1798
01:17:44,737 --> 01:17:46,277
Gosh, this looks amazing.

1799
01:17:46,277 --> 01:17:49,447
(He's soothing his disappointment from the kimchi Jeon with meat.)

1800
01:17:50,777 --> 01:17:53,546
(He cuts a piece of the meat...)

1801
01:17:54,247 --> 01:17:56,046
(Is it cooked?)

1802
01:17:56,587 --> 01:17:59,527
(After he checks to see that it's cooked thoroughly,)

1803
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:05,697
(he cuts it into bite-sized pieces.)

1804
01:18:06,497 --> 01:18:11,867
(The sweet and spicy gochujang pork belly is done.)

1805
01:18:11,867 --> 01:18:13,766
- This looks amazing.
- Right?

1806
01:18:13,936 --> 01:18:15,537
(Hold on...)

1807
01:18:15,537 --> 01:18:18,136
We shouldn't just stand here. Where's the laver?

1808
01:18:19,747 --> 01:18:21,247
Put some perilla oil on it.

1809
01:18:21,247 --> 01:18:22,646
(Put some perilla oil on the raw laver.)

1810
01:18:22,646 --> 01:18:24,146
Then sprinkle some coarse salt on top.

1811
01:18:24,447 --> 01:18:28,046
(Then sprinkle it with coarse salt.)

1812
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:30,287
- I'll roast it well.
- Okay.

1813
01:18:33,657 --> 01:18:35,756
You should do that with the hand you have a glove on.

1814
01:18:35,957 --> 01:18:36,957
It's hot.

1815
01:18:37,726 --> 01:18:38,957
Gosh, it looks good.

1816
01:18:38,957 --> 01:18:41,567
The laver looks good too.

1817
01:18:41,567 --> 01:18:43,636
The laver is good too.

1818
01:18:46,636 --> 01:18:50,636
(They're done preparing the vegetables...)

1819
01:18:50,636 --> 01:18:52,707
(to eat with the meat.)

1820
01:18:53,606 --> 01:18:55,306
Gosh, this is no joke.

1821
01:18:55,306 --> 01:18:56,846
Have a seat.

1822
01:18:58,146 --> 01:19:01,487
Gosh, the brisket doenjang stew...

1823
01:19:01,846 --> 01:19:03,417
Gosh, this is amazing.

1824
01:19:03,686 --> 01:19:05,117
This is no joke.

1825
01:19:05,117 --> 01:19:06,186
(Dong Il's gochujang pork belly)

1826
01:19:06,186 --> 01:19:07,256
This is insane.

1827
01:19:07,587 --> 01:19:09,527
What are we going to do with this?

1828
01:19:09,527 --> 01:19:12,827
(Today's dinner is made with the pastes from the front yard.)

1829
01:19:13,567 --> 01:19:15,697
Jung Hae In's doenjang stew.

1830
01:19:15,697 --> 01:19:17,837
Let's try the brisket doenjang stew first.

1831
01:19:19,537 --> 01:19:20,606
Let's see.

1832
01:19:20,606 --> 01:19:22,136
(Nervous)

1833
01:19:22,636 --> 01:19:24,676
(The Dong Il takes a sip of the stew first.)

1834
01:19:24,676 --> 01:19:25,737
(Exclaiming)

1835
01:19:25,737 --> 01:19:26,947
It's very light.

1836
01:19:32,077 --> 01:19:33,117
Is it good?

1837
01:19:33,987 --> 01:19:35,886
(What is this?)

1838
01:19:36,617 --> 01:19:37,957
- Isn't it incredible?
- It is.

1839
01:19:37,957 --> 01:19:39,256
(Amazed)

1840
01:19:39,556 --> 01:19:41,957
- This doenjang stew is amazing.
- It is.

1841
01:19:42,426 --> 01:19:44,726
- Thank goodness.
- It's really good.

1842
01:19:44,726 --> 01:19:48,527
(I'm glad you like it.)

1843
01:19:49,197 --> 01:19:51,296
Did you use the doenjang we got earlier?

1844
01:19:51,296 --> 01:19:54,266
- Yes. I used some soy sauce too.
- The one we got earlier?

1845
01:19:55,837 --> 01:19:58,037
The doenjang here is good,

1846
01:19:58,676 --> 01:19:59,907
so I didn't need to do much.

1847
01:20:00,006 --> 01:20:02,747
(Enjoy it.)

1848
01:20:02,747 --> 01:20:04,877
Try the gochujang pork belly.

1849
01:20:04,877 --> 01:20:07,516
(The gochujang pork belly made with fresh gochujang)

1850
01:20:08,247 --> 01:20:10,686
Just take the whole thing. Eat it like that.

1851
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:13,827
(The youngest ones try the gochujang pork belly.)

1852
01:20:14,256 --> 01:20:18,127
The gochujang sauce is...

1853
01:20:18,657 --> 01:20:19,867
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

1854
01:20:21,796 --> 01:20:23,197
The gochujang pork belly...

1855
01:20:23,197 --> 01:20:24,436
(Dong Il's tip: Take the gochujang pork belly...)

1856
01:20:24,436 --> 01:20:26,407
tastes really good with the laver.

1857
01:20:26,436 --> 01:20:27,737
I recommend this.

1858
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:33,306
(Dong Il shows them how he eats it.)

1859
01:20:33,306 --> 01:20:34,546
Gosh, the smell of it...

1860
01:20:34,546 --> 01:20:35,777
(The gochujang smells so good.)

1861
01:20:36,846 --> 01:20:42,386
(Hee Won puts a piece of meat on the laver too.)

1862
01:20:42,386 --> 01:20:43,686
(Savouring)

1863
01:20:46,056 --> 01:20:50,756
(Dong Il's tip satisfies everyone's palates.)

1864
01:20:53,197 --> 01:20:54,367
- Don't they taste good together?
- They do.

1865
01:20:54,367 --> 01:20:55,426
Isn't it great?

1866
01:20:56,296 --> 01:21:00,037
(Hae In tries the kimchi too.)

1867
01:21:00,037 --> 01:21:02,466
The homemade kimchi smells really good.

1868
01:21:02,466 --> 01:21:03,537
This is amazing.

1869
01:21:06,476 --> 01:21:08,006
- The kimchi is really good.
- It is.

1870
01:21:08,006 --> 01:21:09,046
It is.

1871
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:12,077
- I really like kimchi.
- I see.

1872
01:21:12,447 --> 01:21:14,787
You have a traditional palate.

1873
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:16,247
(Jung Hae In, Actor, Has a traditional palate)

1874
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:18,617
- You like Korean food.
- It's my favourite.

1875
01:21:18,617 --> 01:21:19,726
Right.

1876
01:21:19,726 --> 01:21:22,426
(Taking a big bite)

1877
01:21:23,627 --> 01:21:26,096
He looks like a city boy, just like me.

1878
01:21:26,096 --> 01:21:29,167
(Hae In looks like a city boy, just like me.)

1879
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:30,337
I know.

1880
01:21:30,337 --> 01:21:31,636
- But...
- Why are you laughing?

1881
01:21:31,867 --> 01:21:33,367
- Pardon?
- Why are you laughing?

1882
01:21:33,367 --> 01:21:35,867
(Flustered)

1883
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:37,737
Did you think you were the only one who looked like a city boy?

1884
01:21:38,777 --> 01:21:39,877
Look at this guy.

1885
01:21:39,877 --> 01:21:42,046
(You're such a joker.)

1886
01:21:44,516 --> 01:21:46,145
Gosh, I can't eat anymore.

1887
01:21:47,445 --> 01:21:49,386
Put some bean sprouts in.

1888
01:21:50,456 --> 01:21:52,416
(Meanwhile,)

1889
01:21:52,586 --> 01:21:56,155
(there is one person who is still eating.)

1890
01:21:56,796 --> 01:21:58,796
(Hae In is preparing his next dish.)

1891
01:21:58,796 --> 01:22:01,166
(This guy is amazing.)

1892
01:22:01,926 --> 01:22:05,235
(He adds the remaining doenjang stew to rice.)

1893
01:22:06,035 --> 01:22:09,206
(Then he places the roasted laver on top.)

1894
01:22:09,905 --> 01:22:12,735
(Taking a big bite)

1895
01:22:13,405 --> 01:22:16,075
(This is so good.)

1896
01:22:16,815 --> 01:22:20,916
(Hae In is doing an eating show alone.)

1897
01:22:27,226 --> 01:22:28,886
Do you eat a lot normally?

1898
01:22:29,485 --> 01:22:30,895
- Yes.
- Right?

1899
01:22:30,895 --> 01:22:31,895
I do.

1900
01:22:32,056 --> 01:22:33,926
You maintain your figure and work out...

1901
01:22:33,926 --> 01:22:35,195
- because you act. Right?
- Yes.

1902
01:22:35,995 --> 01:22:38,136
I generally eat a lot, but I hold myself back.

1903
01:22:39,495 --> 01:22:41,905
(Hae In can't hold himself back today.)

1904
01:22:42,766 --> 01:22:45,676
(He bites into a big piece of napa cabbage.)

1905
01:22:45,676 --> 01:22:47,245
Hee Won, try the seasoned bracken.

1906
01:22:47,775 --> 01:22:52,046
(Eating)

1907
01:22:52,745 --> 01:22:58,016
(When it gets small enough, he makes a wrap with some meat.)

1908
01:22:58,785 --> 01:23:02,926
(He eats the gochujang pork belly wrapped in laver...)

1909

(with a piece of laver on his face.)

1910

(Smiling)

1911
01:23:10,796 --> 01:23:11,966
Try some of this.

1912
01:23:12,796 --> 01:23:14,435
Hae In is so happy right now.

1913
01:23:14,435 --> 01:23:17,306
(It was a dinner filled with happiness for Hae In.)

1914
01:23:17,876 --> 01:23:20,206
I'm so grateful that you're enjoying the dinner.

1915
01:23:20,206 --> 01:23:21,846
It's really good.

1916
01:23:21,846 --> 01:23:23,976
(It's really good!)

1917
01:23:24,716 --> 01:23:28,485
Are you interested in sponsoring House on Wheels?

1918
01:23:29,916 --> 01:23:31,216
How do I do that?

1919
01:23:31,216 --> 01:23:32,355
(Sponsor?)

1920
01:23:32,756 --> 01:23:34,855
Come on our show every season...

1921
01:23:35,626 --> 01:23:38,596
and make your brisket doenjang stew.

1922
01:23:39,726 --> 01:23:41,926
(Laughing)

1923
01:23:42,466 --> 01:23:44,865
When you go out on a walk like today,

1924
01:23:44,865 --> 01:23:46,905
- I'll drop by, make it, and go.
- You'll make it and go?

1925
01:23:47,206 --> 01:23:50,235
(Hae In is so cute.)

1926
01:23:50,636 --> 01:23:53,806
You're a very likeable person.

1927
01:23:53,806 --> 01:23:58,775
(The oldest brother likes Hae In, who is bright.)

1928
01:23:59,416 --> 01:24:01,745
Dong Il, our dessert is waiting for us.

1929
01:24:02,315 --> 01:24:04,655
Hangwa and strawberries.

1930
01:24:04,655 --> 01:24:06,416
(They've been waiting for a long time.)

1931
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:07,556
Say that again.

1932
01:24:07,956 --> 01:24:09,525
Hangwa and strawberries.

1933
01:24:09,525 --> 01:24:10,796
(He's acting cute at the thought of having strawberries.)

1934
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:11,855
Dessert.

1935
01:24:12,355 --> 01:24:14,525
(How funny.)

1936
01:24:14,525 --> 01:24:15,766
Yeongju strawberries.

1937
01:24:15,766 --> 01:24:17,136
(Let's eat hangwa and strawberries.)

1938
01:24:17,395 --> 01:24:21,035
(Everyone laughs at Hee Won's cuteness.)

1939
01:24:21,235 --> 01:24:23,006
Do you want some hot tea too?

1940
01:24:23,405 --> 01:24:25,035
- Tea sounds good.
- Tea, and what was that again?

1941
01:24:25,035 --> 01:24:26,535
Tea and hangwa.

1942
01:24:26,535 --> 01:24:28,905
And Yeongju strawberries?

1943
01:24:29,006 --> 01:24:31,046
(Hee Won and Myoung are so cute.)

1944
01:24:31,046 --> 01:24:32,145
We should eat that.

1945
01:24:32,945 --> 01:24:35,945
(After their filling dinner,)

1946
01:24:37,386 --> 01:24:39,855
(they have the delicious strawberries they picked...)

1947
01:24:40,756 --> 01:24:43,155
(and the chewy and sweet hangwa.)

1948
01:24:43,155 --> 01:24:46,865
This is the pride of our home. Buckwheat honey.

1949
01:24:50,336 --> 01:24:52,166
(He dips the hangwa in honey...)

1950
01:24:52,166 --> 01:24:54,466
(and takes a bite.)

1951
01:24:54,466 --> 01:24:57,075
(Bouncing)

1952
01:24:58,206 --> 01:25:00,275
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

1953
01:25:00,275 --> 01:25:01,476
(Yes!)

1954
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:03,775
(The sweet flavours makes him move.)

1955
01:25:03,976 --> 01:25:05,745
- Dip it in honey.
- Like this.

1956
01:25:05,745 --> 01:25:07,086
(Hee Won dips it in plenty of honey...)

1957
01:25:09,185 --> 01:25:12,315
(and takes a bite too.)

1958
01:25:13,456 --> 01:25:14,456
(Savouring)

1959
01:25:15,586 --> 01:25:17,596
It looks a bit empty over here. Move it.

1960
01:25:18,226 --> 01:25:20,025
- It's no joke.
- Is it good?

1961
01:25:20,025 --> 01:25:21,296
(He's addicted to the hangwa.)

1962
01:25:21,766 --> 01:25:23,025
(The combination of buckwheat honey and hangwa is amazing.)

1963
01:25:23,025 --> 01:25:25,735
This is no joke! I'm serious.

1964
01:25:25,735 --> 01:25:27,865
Dip the hangwa in the honey and taste it.

1965
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:30,876
You don't have to put a lot since it's already sweet.

1966
01:25:32,105 --> 01:25:34,145
Goodness. It's really good.

1967
01:25:34,145 --> 01:25:35,206
(Laughing)

1968
01:25:35,645 --> 01:25:39,016
(He can't help but laugh upon tasting it.)

1969
01:25:39,546 --> 01:25:42,516
We have the hangwa, so let's cleanse our palates with that.

1970
01:25:42,916 --> 01:25:44,586
Let's try the strawberries with the honey too.

1971
01:25:45,485 --> 01:25:48,655
The strawberries look like they're already covered in honey.

1972
01:25:48,655 --> 01:25:50,086
(Strawberries with buckwheat honey? What an interesting combination.)

1973
01:25:50,325 --> 01:25:53,056
Dip it in. Dip it in plenty of honey.

1974
01:25:53,056 --> 01:25:55,266
I've never had strawberries with honey before.

1975
01:25:58,096 --> 01:25:59,365
Try it.

1976
01:25:59,365 --> 01:26:01,136
(Exclaiming)

1977
01:26:01,136 --> 01:26:02,636
It's dripping down.

1978
01:26:02,636 --> 01:26:04,206
It's really sweet.

1979
01:26:04,206 --> 01:26:07,976
(It's really sweet.)

1980
01:26:09,006 --> 01:26:11,516
(Slurping)

1981
01:26:12,016 --> 01:26:14,586
Goodness. The taste is unprecedented.

1982
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:15,685
I know.

1983
01:26:16,185 --> 01:26:17,485
(Chewing)

1984
01:26:17,485 --> 01:26:20,825
(The refreshing taste of the strawberry explodes with the honey.)

1985
01:26:21,285 --> 01:26:22,456
(Smacking his lips)

1986
01:26:22,456 --> 01:26:25,096
- I taste flowers.
- Right? It's buckwheat flower.

1987
01:26:25,355 --> 01:26:28,426
This combination is... I should try this out...

1988
01:26:28,966 --> 01:26:31,435
on someone later.

1989
01:26:31,435 --> 01:26:32,695
Is it okay?

1990
01:26:32,695 --> 01:26:35,105
(Proud)

1991
01:26:37,336 --> 01:26:38,735
I'm beginning to wonder if this is okay.

1992
01:26:41,346 --> 01:26:43,006
(He looks at him with a suspicious look.)

1993
01:26:43,876 --> 01:26:46,645
It's been decided. Season Four with Jung Hae In.

1994
01:26:48,485 --> 01:26:50,115
(The youngest member decides on his successor.)

1995
01:26:50,115 --> 01:26:52,216
Excuse me.

1996
01:26:53,685 --> 01:26:54,785
Yes?

1997
01:26:55,726 --> 01:26:57,525
You don't have to worry about it, mister.

1998
01:26:58,126 --> 01:27:00,226
- Yes, sir.
- Why do you keep worrying?

1999
01:27:00,495 --> 01:27:02,565
Why are you worrying about that, mister?

2000
01:27:03,296 --> 01:27:05,435
Goodness. You should just stay quiet and go.

2001
01:27:05,435 --> 01:27:06,796
(Crying)

2002
01:27:07,235 --> 01:27:09,006
(Laughing)

2003
01:27:09,506 --> 01:27:11,735
(He's laughing hysterically.)

2004
01:27:13,706 --> 01:27:15,645
You want me to stay quiet and go?

2005
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:19,976
It's none of your business.

2006
01:27:19,976 --> 01:27:22,945
I'll leave with you, Hae In.

2007
01:27:24,256 --> 01:27:25,916
My goodness.

2008
01:27:28,463 --> 01:27:31,403
It's the fire gaze that Hae In wanted. Look at that flame.

2009
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:34,602
We're gazing into the fire, and we had honey.

2010
01:27:35,573 --> 01:27:37,043
We'll give you...

2011
01:27:38,472 --> 01:27:42,213
a great memory that you'll never be able to forget.

2012
01:27:42,442 --> 01:27:44,613
- How?
- It's magic.

2013
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:46,213
A fire show.

2014
01:27:47,653 --> 01:27:49,213
- A fire show?
- Yes. Stay here.

2015
01:27:49,213 --> 01:27:50,323
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

2016
01:27:50,323 --> 01:27:51,522
Let's show him.

2017
01:27:51,722 --> 01:27:54,722
Stay in your seat.

2018
01:27:54,722 --> 01:27:55,953
Keep him there, Youngest.

2019
01:27:56,963 --> 01:27:58,722
(What will it be?)

2020
01:27:58,722 --> 01:27:59,892
That's new.

2021
01:28:01,493 --> 01:28:02,562
All right.

2022
01:28:02,892 --> 01:28:05,003
(We'll take pictures.)

2023
01:28:05,003 --> 01:28:06,062
In 1, 2.

2024
01:28:06,503 --> 01:28:08,833
(In the meantime, behind the house...)

2025
01:28:09,333 --> 01:28:10,602
Okay. Take this.

2026
01:28:10,602 --> 01:28:11,703
(They seem very suspicious.)

2027
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:13,913
Put it in your hand.

2028
01:28:14,613 --> 01:28:16,842
Put it in your pocket. Look natural.

2029
01:28:16,842 --> 01:28:18,642
- Look natural?
- Yes. Let's go.

2030
01:28:19,512 --> 01:28:20,613
Okay.

2031
01:28:21,352 --> 01:28:24,283
- You're taking pictures again.
- Over there.

2032
01:28:24,982 --> 01:28:26,083
All right.

2033
01:28:27,423 --> 01:28:28,423
(Shouting)

2034
01:28:28,423 --> 01:28:30,022
(After a short shout,)

2035
01:28:30,022 --> 01:28:32,323
(he sprinkles mysterious powder.)

2036
01:28:37,203 --> 01:28:39,003
(Impressed)

2037
01:28:42,802 --> 01:28:45,503
(Green flames)

2038
01:28:45,802 --> 01:28:46,903
What is that?

2039
01:28:48,272 --> 01:28:49,442
(You've yet to be surprised.)

2040
01:28:50,512 --> 01:28:51,512
(Let's show them...)

2041
01:28:51,512 --> 01:28:52,783
(a fire show!)

2042
01:28:56,052 --> 01:28:58,222
(Changing colours again)

2043
01:28:59,453 --> 01:29:01,153
(What is that?)

2044
01:29:01,852 --> 01:29:03,692
(Amazed)

2045
01:29:03,692 --> 01:29:06,192
It's neat, isn't it? It's a different colour.

2046
01:29:06,192 --> 01:29:10,293
(A magical fire show)

2047
01:29:11,432 --> 01:29:14,403
(I have to take a picture of this.)

2048
01:29:15,232 --> 01:29:17,102
Do it again, please. He didn't take pictures.

2049
01:29:17,772 --> 01:29:18,873
Again?

2050
01:29:18,873 --> 01:29:21,142
(Again?)

2051
01:29:22,213 --> 01:29:23,213
(That's easy.)

2052
01:29:24,182 --> 01:29:26,283
(Happy)

2053
01:29:26,512 --> 01:29:28,512
(He can't hide his smile.)

2054
01:29:28,512 --> 01:29:31,783
(The video that Hae In took)

2055
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:32,953
Sprinkle it again?

2056
01:29:33,823 --> 01:29:35,052
(Can you do it one more time?)

2057
01:29:35,552 --> 01:29:38,363
(Shouting)

2058
01:29:40,592 --> 01:29:43,363
Hee Won changes the colour of the flame with a shout.

2059
01:29:44,903 --> 01:29:46,203
It was a restrained shout.

2060
01:29:46,203 --> 01:29:47,373
- It maintains the colour.
- And short.

2061
01:29:47,373 --> 01:29:48,772
Yes, short and high-pitched.

2062
01:29:48,772 --> 01:29:49,772
(Fascinated)

2063
01:29:49,772 --> 01:29:51,942
(Collecting)

2064
01:29:51,942 --> 01:29:53,203
Do you want to do it too?

2065
01:29:53,203 --> 01:29:54,772
Let's go, Myoung.

2066
01:29:56,573 --> 01:29:58,743
Yes, try it with that much. Give a shout.

2067
01:29:58,743 --> 01:30:01,253
Now... You saw how Hee Won shouted.

2068
01:30:01,982 --> 01:30:03,453
(Like Hee Won did?)

2069
01:30:03,453 --> 01:30:04,923
(He did it like this.)

2070
01:30:04,923 --> 01:30:06,123
Like this?

2071
01:30:06,823 --> 01:30:08,052
(He copies Hee Won well.)

2072
01:30:08,692 --> 01:30:10,323
(Myoung tries the fire show as well.)

2073
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:12,463
(Playful)

2074
01:30:12,463 --> 01:30:13,493
Great.

2075
01:30:13,493 --> 01:30:15,033
(Firing)

2076
01:30:15,033 --> 01:30:16,833
(Dissatisfied)

2077
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:19,203
- You need more practice.
- How did you do it?

2078
01:30:19,203 --> 01:30:20,232
(You lack energy.)

2079
01:30:20,232 --> 01:30:21,232
This is insane.

2080
01:30:21,232 --> 01:30:22,932
- Myoung.
- Yes?

2081
01:30:22,932 --> 01:30:24,203
- Come here.
- Okay.

2082
01:30:25,472 --> 01:30:27,472
(Myoung goes to receive energy.)

2083
01:30:27,472 --> 01:30:28,673
We have some left.

2084
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,942
(They're both serious about this.)

2085
01:30:30,942 --> 01:30:32,012
Goodness.

2086
01:30:33,642 --> 01:30:36,083
I didn't want to show you this, but you kept asking.

2087
01:30:36,283 --> 01:30:38,882
This is Hee Won's energy.

2088
01:30:38,882 --> 01:30:39,953
(Collecting his energy)

2089
01:30:42,222 --> 01:30:43,222
(Dancing)

2090
01:30:43,222 --> 01:30:45,722
(Shouting)

2091
01:30:46,463 --> 01:30:48,993
(Perfect showmanship)

2092
01:30:49,493 --> 01:30:51,963
(The fire magician)

2093
01:30:52,302 --> 01:30:54,772
(Touched)

2094
01:30:55,132 --> 01:30:57,802
(Hee Won is good, indeed.)

2095
01:30:57,802 --> 01:30:59,043
Yes, try it.

2096
01:30:59,573 --> 01:31:01,442
You have to look away.

2097
01:31:01,442 --> 01:31:03,113
He went like this.

2098
01:31:04,142 --> 01:31:05,182
(Go ahead.)

2099
01:31:05,182 --> 01:31:06,312
Go.

2100
01:31:06,682 --> 01:31:07,982
(Gather my energy...)

2101
01:31:07,982 --> 01:31:10,253
(and dance!)

2102
01:31:10,253 --> 01:31:11,283
(Shouting)

2103
01:31:14,222 --> 01:31:15,253
Great!

2104
01:31:15,253 --> 01:31:16,293
(Surprised)

2105
01:31:16,293 --> 01:31:17,722
Very nice.

2106
01:31:18,463 --> 01:31:21,493
(Youngest's perfect finish)

2107
01:31:21,892 --> 01:31:24,432
Great. Very nice.

2108
01:31:24,432 --> 01:31:26,203
(The night in Yeongju gets louder, thanks to the fire show.)

2109
01:31:26,203 --> 01:31:28,573
That was neat.

2110
01:31:28,573 --> 01:31:32,203
(The day in Yeongju was magical with Hae In.)

2111
01:31:33,302 --> 01:31:34,842
All right. In one...

2112
01:31:34,842 --> 01:31:35,913
(Shouting)

2113
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:38,113
In 1, 2...

2114
01:31:39,842 --> 01:31:43,923
(Leaving another photo of memories)

2115
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:46,852
(Dong Il!)

2116
01:31:46,852 --> 01:31:49,493
(Actor Ji Chang Wook visits House on Wheels 3 late at night.)

2117
01:31:49,852 --> 01:31:52,963
(The expert camper, Chang Wook, enjoys camping.)

2118
01:31:52,963 --> 01:31:55,262
(Confident)

2119
01:31:56,793 --> 01:32:00,463
(He easily builds a fire...)

2120
01:32:00,903 --> 01:32:03,632
(and is a skilful driver.)

2121
01:32:03,632 --> 01:32:05,173
(You must be good at cooking since you go camping.)

2122
01:32:05,173 --> 01:32:06,503
(Should I give it a try?)

2123
01:32:06,602 --> 01:32:08,243
- Seaweed soup?
- Sounds great.

2124
01:32:08,743 --> 01:32:10,613
(Today's meal is seaweed soup, made by an expert camper.)

2125
01:32:10,613 --> 01:32:12,283
(What if it's too delicious?)

2126
01:32:12,783 --> 01:32:14,453
(Do we put shrimp jeotgal in seaweed soup?)

2127
01:32:14,453 --> 01:32:15,852
(Or seasoned salt?)

2128
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:18,982
(The expert camper asks Youngest.)

2129
01:32:19,182 --> 01:32:20,623
(Should we add the octopus?)

2130
01:32:20,623 --> 01:32:22,192
(It's a long-legged octopus.)

2131
01:32:22,453 --> 01:32:25,323
(Chang Wook is pretty clumsy.)

2132
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:26,793
(I'm too tired.)

2133
01:32:26,793 --> 01:32:28,562
(Showing all of his clumsy side)

2134
01:32:28,562 --> 01:32:31,802
(Struggling)

2135
01:32:32,102 --> 01:32:35,003
(What are you doing, Chang Wook?)

2136
01:32:35,403 --> 01:32:37,602
(Isn't there a manual?)

2137
01:32:37,903 --> 01:32:39,642
(There's no manual?)

2138
01:32:39,972 --> 01:32:41,842
(There was a manual.)

2139
01:32:42,043 --> 01:32:43,982
(Dumbfounded)

2140
01:32:44,382 --> 01:32:46,812
(Yes. That's how you're supposed to do it.)

2141
01:32:47,043 --> 01:32:49,113
(House on Wheels 3 will be back...)

2142
01:32:49,113 --> 01:32:51,022
(with clumsy Chang Wook.)
