1
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,532
- Oh, is this buckwheat?
- Yes.

2
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:29,231
This...

3
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:32,740
- It's beautiful.
- It's really nice.

4
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,872
(Two men are impressed by the buckwheat field.)

5
00:00:35,412 --> 00:00:39,381
It does feel weird to be walking with a guy.

6
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,380
We should be holding hands.

7
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:46,421
(Who are the two guests that bitterly walk the field?)

8
00:00:48,022 --> 00:00:49,051
Try it.

9
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:50,252
For one person...

10
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:51,691
- Kwang Kyu is here.
- Hello!

11
00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:53,321
- Hello.
- Hello.

12
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:55,931
Kyu! Seung Hwan! You two came together?

13
00:00:56,262 --> 00:00:58,701
Oh, boy.

14
00:00:58,702 --> 00:01:00,101
(Shin Seung Hwan and Kim Kwang Kyu)

15
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:01,431
Royal Highness.

16
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:03,831
(He starred in the drama "Lovers of the Red Sky"...)

17
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:05,772
(with Myoung.)

18
00:01:06,342 --> 00:01:09,272
(The veteran actor with 23 years of experience, Kim Kwang Kyu)

19
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:13,681
(He asserts his presence with his great acting skills.)

20
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:18,281
(The master of facial acting, Actor Shin Seung Hwan)

21
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:20,521
- Hello.
- Hello.

22
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:21,522
Hello.

23
00:01:21,652 --> 00:01:22,991
(Doggy Myoung wagging his tail)

24
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:24,491
- Hello.
- Hello.

25
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:25,492
Hi.

26
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:27,461
- Welcome.
- Hello.

27
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,030
- Good to see you.
- Come here.

28
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:30,190
Hello, Young Ok.

29
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,262
Come on.

30
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:32,931
Hi.

31
00:01:32,932 --> 00:01:34,360
- Great to see you.
- Hi.

32
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,031
(A welcome guest during dinner preparations)

33
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:39,741
You're making dumplings with such a nice view.

34
00:01:39,742 --> 00:01:40,742
Right.

35
00:01:40,743 --> 00:01:43,411
We're going to eat them together.

36
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:44,841
Dumplings!

37
00:01:44,842 --> 00:01:46,011
(Young Ok's kimchi dumplings for everyone)

38
00:01:46,012 --> 00:01:47,182
They're huge.

39
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:50,410
It'll be some time before we eat, right?

40
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,050
- No, we're almost finished.
- Really?

41
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:54,421
- We just need to boil them.
- We just need to boil them.

42
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,821
- What took you so long?
- Sorry?

43
00:01:56,822 --> 00:01:58,551
What took you so long to get here?

44
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:05,131
We wanted to get here when the dumplings were ready.

45
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:07,030
(Getting scolded by Young Ok for playing a cheap trick)

46
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:08,631
You must be tired.

47
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:11,401
- Take an empty seat.
- Go ahead.

48
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:12,571
Can we sit?

49
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:14,901
- Yes, that's your seat.
- But...

50
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:16,072
- Is that so?
- Yes.

51
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:17,910
We don't have designated seats.

52
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:19,241
- We don't?
- Just sit.

53
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:20,411
The chairs are nice.

54
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:22,550
I loved it here.

55
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:24,682
But it's gotten all dark now.

56
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:29,352
The mountain ridge was so long.

57
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:31,221
It was reaching out so far.

58
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:34,120
And there's an open field...

59
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,931
filled with buckwheat flowers.

60
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:39,731
- It's such a nice place.
- There are no buildings at all.

61
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:41,062
Not at all.

62
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:43,001
I didn't know there was a place like this in Korea.

63
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:45,132
(Amazed)

64
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:47,340
(Kwang Kyu!)

65
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,740
Royal Highness.

66
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:49,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

67
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:52,381
- I'm Gong Myoung.
- Oh, I know who you are.

68
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:53,811
I enjoy watching his drama.

69
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:55,851
He plays Grand Prince Yangmyoung.

70
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:58,012
Is that why you said, "Royal Highness"?

71
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,681
- He was the prince.
- I see.

72
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:04,691
Should I boil the dumpling soup without adding anything?

73
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:06,191
You don't need much.

74
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:07,661
- Just some garlic?
- Would you...

75
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:09,762
like a cup of coffee?

76
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,001
You know what?

77
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:14,002
I brought...

78
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:15,532
- What is it?
- What is it?

79
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:17,102
It's...

80
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,171
Chojeong mineral water, which is famous in Cheongju.

81
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:22,071
- Chojeong mineral water?
- Chojeong mineral water.

82
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:23,472
- Is it sparkling water?
- Yes.

83
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:25,111
Young Ok.

84
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:28,312
- We have Chojeong mineral water.
- They brought mineral water.

85
00:03:28,782 --> 00:03:30,110
Goodness.

86
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:32,681
- How eager you are.
- It's for you.

87
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:36,151
- You should try a cup.
- I will.

88
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:39,491
Give her a cup of Chojeong mineral water.

89
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:41,222
- She's stepping out.
- Okay.

90
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:43,461
Okay.

91
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:47,400
- You know...
- Turn the stove on for the soup.

92
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:48,900
- Okay.
- Mother, get to work.

93
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:51,072
- We have to hurry.
- Okay.

94
00:03:52,202 --> 00:03:55,840
(His shy attitude prevents him from approaching her.)

95
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:57,740
- Do you...
- They must be hungry too.

96
00:03:57,741 --> 00:03:59,840
- Have a cup of water first.
- What?

97
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:02,351
- You should drink it first.
- I drew it myself.

98
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:04,911
- He's been following you.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

99
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,621
- Have a seat.
- I had no idea.

100
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,351
The mineral water here is...

101
00:04:09,352 --> 00:04:11,822
- Yes, I heard it was famous.
- It's famous.

102
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:14,161
King Sejong, one of the four best kings in Joseon Dynasty,

103
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:17,032
had his eye disease cured by drinking and washing with this.

104
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,431
(Sipping)

105
00:04:22,032 --> 00:04:24,702
(Does it suit your palate?)

106
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:27,740
- It's soda water.
- It's really good, right?

107
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:29,571
- It tastes weird.
- That's how it usually tastes.

108
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:32,840
(All members of the family have a sip.)

109
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:33,841
It's good, right?

110
00:04:34,382 --> 00:04:35,512
Isn't it interesting?

111
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,511
It's actual mineral water.

112
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,682
- You didn't add anything?
- No.

113
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:40,822
- Really?
- It's naturally carbonated.

114
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,851
- My stomach feels better already.
- Right?

115
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,021
- Thank you for that.
- Thank you.

116
00:04:46,461 --> 00:04:47,822
I should thank you.

117
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,191
- It's boiling.
- I don't...

118
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:52,631
- It's boiling?
- It's boiling hard.

119
00:04:52,632 --> 00:04:55,062
Take your time. It's downhill.

120
00:04:55,731 --> 00:04:57,730
(How does Young Ok's kimchi dumpling soup look?)

121
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,441
It's boiling.

122

(How does Young Ok's kimchi dumpling soup look?)

123
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:03,271
(Oh, my goodness.)

124
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,312
- The dumplings are huge, right?
- They're so big.

125
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:09,080
I don't know who made them, but they're my type.

126
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:11,711
They're floating, so it means it's finished.

127
00:05:12,122 --> 00:05:13,681
(Taking them out one at a time)

128
00:05:13,682 --> 00:05:14,781
There's more than I thought.

129
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:18,650
I won't give you too much soup. We have something else.

130
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,661
All right.

131
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:21,691
(The finishing touch with sesame seeds and laver flakes)

132
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:23,231
It looks scrumptious.

133
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,030
Oh, dear.

134
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:28,202
(A Seoul-style dumpling soup made by a mother)

135

- Let's eat.
- Okay.

136

- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

138
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:34,355
Taste the soup first.

(How does Young Ok's Seoul-style dumpling soup taste?)

140
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:36,896
Let's scoop the soup.

141

(The mother takes a bite.)

142
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:39,595
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

(The sons follow.)

144
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:43,906
(Moaning)

145
00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:48,776
- You made it so well.
- That's a relief.

146
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:51,476
This is for Kwang Kyu.

147
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:54,647
- It's seriously good.
- It is.

148
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:56,747
The dumplings are...

149
00:05:56,748 --> 00:05:57,785
(The plump dumplings are filling.)

150
00:05:57,786 --> 00:05:59,486
It's as big as three normal dumplings.

151
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:01,756
- Do you like it, Seung Hwan?
- Sorry?

152
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:03,085
- Do you like it?
- It's really good.

153
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:04,656
Right? Young Ok made...

154
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:06,756
- the stuffing really well.
- And it's neat.

155
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,697
She made the stuffing herself.

156
00:06:09,426 --> 00:06:10,596
It's delicious.

157
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:13,197
(She feels happy as they enjoy it.)

158

(It's hot!)

161
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:27,546
Are you okay?

162
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,286
Do you want me to have a dumpling if you have too many?

163
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:33,416
Sure.

164
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:36,285
Here you go. Here's a big one.

165
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:38,387
- No, that's okay.
- It's his first meal today.

166
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:40,155
Take it.

167
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:41,496
(Taking a bite)

168
00:06:41,497 --> 00:06:42,567
He eats well.

169
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:45,666
What should I do?

170
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:49,767
(Scaly hedgehog mushroom soup boiled by Dong Il)

171
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,176
I put a lot of mushrooms in it, so try it.

172
00:06:54,676 --> 00:06:56,076
(A bunch of mushroom bits)

173
00:06:56,077 --> 00:06:58,646
Try it. It's good for your health.

174
00:06:58,647 --> 00:06:59,976
(A bunch of mushroom bits)

175
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,845
I'm going to scoop it myself. You didn't have to...

176
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:05,556
- You weren't eating it.
- I was going to.

177
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:06,687
(It's just that you weren't eating it.)

178
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:10,586
Here. We have a lot.

179
00:07:11,957 --> 00:07:14,596
I didn't make this for them. It was for you.

180
00:07:14,697 --> 00:07:17,197
I didn't make this for them. It was for you.

181
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:21,036
(You know how I feel, right?)

182
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:24,506
(You seem...)

183
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:25,507
Give me a bowl.

184
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:27,207
(unfamiliar today.)

185
00:07:28,307 --> 00:07:32,916
(A bite of scaly hedgehog mushroom soup)

186
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:35,416
I like that it's got a strong scent of mushrooms.

187
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:37,585
(A happy son)

188
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:39,056
This soup is also great.

189
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:40,086
(A happy son)

190
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,986
Do you like gazing into the bonfire?

191
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:46,626
We'll bake rice cakes here.

192
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:48,025
(Appetizing bar rice cakes!)

193
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:49,026
They look delicious.

194
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:51,267
Do you want me to cut out the burnt part?

195
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:55,366
I can just use my nails. It's okay.

196
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:56,435
All right.

197
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:57,436
(All right.)

198
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:00,837
The honey isn't on it.

199
00:08:02,076 --> 00:08:04,347
The honey isn't on it. You were blocked by the spoon.

200
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:07,076
Just pour the honey with the spoon.

201
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:10,387
It's okay. Stop worrying about me.

202
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:12,586
Go ahead and eat.

203
00:08:12,587 --> 00:08:13,587
Get some more honey.

204
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:16,686
(Yelling at them first and pleased after)

205
00:08:17,426 --> 00:08:19,496
(As much as the sons care for their mother...)

206
00:08:19,497 --> 00:08:20,956
Since we got here,

207
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:23,795
we've only been talking and eating.

208
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:25,295
(Bar rice cakes with buckwheat honey are sweeter and warmer.)

209
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,367
You made...

210
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:28,366
my day really happy.

211
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,436
(My sons made my day.)

212
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:32,406
(Looking around)

213
00:08:33,977 --> 00:08:35,007
Mother.

214
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:38,346
There's a moon between the trees.

215
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:39,347
It's a full moon.

216
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:41,147
Above the buckwheat field...

217
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:43,046
It's going up fast.

218
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,086
- I see a bunny!
- There it is.

219
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:46,456
- There's a bunny.
- It's moving so fast.

220
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:49,257
(It stuck its head out over the mountain.)

221
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:53,796
(Now the full moon is way up in the night sky.)

222
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:55,196
It's a work of art.

223
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,025
- Look at that.
- How beautiful.

224
00:08:58,026 --> 00:08:59,897
It's not a completely full moon yet.

225
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:02,706
It goes so well with the buckwheat field.

226
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:04,836
- It's getting bigger.
- It's gorgeous.

227
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,706
It's getting bigger.

228
00:09:07,536 --> 00:09:10,546
(Under the bright light of the full moon,)

229
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:14,616
(the buckwheat sways and dances.)

230
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:17,246
- That was fast.
- Yes, it comes up fast.

231
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:19,256
(A gift by the autumn night...)

232
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:21,386
I can't believe I get to see a moon here.

233
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:22,786
(that makes them just watch)

234
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:24,756
Beautiful.

235
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:25,757
(It's lovely.)

236
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:30,166
I love it here.

237
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,666
The fire is as bright as the full moon.

238
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:38,336
Thank you so much for coming.

239
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:40,705
I was glad that I saw the moon with you.

240
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,276
- I hope you stay healthier.
- Sure.

241
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:45,876
Don't be too greedy, and just live a hundred more years.

242
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:46,915
(Just live a hundred more healthy years)

243
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:47,916
A healthy life.

244
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:50,116
(Satisfied)

245
00:09:50,117 --> 00:09:52,986
She likes it.

246
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:55,587
- Thank you so much.
- I wish you good health.

247
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:57,857
Thank you for coming.

248
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:03,526
The moment you leave, I become the king here.

249
00:10:04,326 --> 00:10:07,295
- A lot of them will be scolded.
- You've been the king already.

250
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:10,367
Kwang Kyu may leave with you so that he doesn't have to see it.

251
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:13,877
I'll take you home.

252
00:10:15,276 --> 00:10:16,507
When did you get so weak?

253
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:18,946
- Well...
- Get ready, everyone.

254
00:10:20,477 --> 00:10:21,545
Get ready, everyone.

255
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:23,217
(Gasping)

256
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:26,055
- Hey.
- It's 1 on 4.

257
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:27,586
- Do we start right after we eat?
- It's 1 on 4?

258
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:28,587
(How can you do this to me, Hee Won?)

259
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:31,056
Get ready once Mother leaves.

260
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:33,997
Bulletproof Boy, I believe in you.

261
00:10:34,826 --> 00:10:36,825
- Youngest, are you joining them?
- Pardon?

262
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:38,897
Are you joining Hee Won...

263
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:41,837
and his gang's revolt?

264
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:43,936
- Their treason.
- "Treason".

265
00:10:44,137 --> 00:10:46,006
(Whatever. It's a deal.)

266
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:47,575
You'd join them on their act of treason?

267
00:10:47,576 --> 00:10:48,636
Oh, no.

268
00:10:48,637 --> 00:10:50,576
(Very disappointed)

269
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:52,176
You should sleep here, Mother.

270
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:55,747
I don't think I can survive the night.

271
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:57,646
I have three children.

272
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:58,847
(Brace yourself.)

273
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:00,986
Let's take a commemorative picture.

274
00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:02,556
- We have to.
- Okay.

275
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:04,326
- In 1, 2.
- How lovely.

276
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:07,196
In 1, 2.

277
00:11:07,696 --> 00:11:09,967
Even your voice is cute.

278
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:12,467
- I hope you stay healthy.
- Please do.

279
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:13,967
Thank you.

280
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:15,097
(One autumn night in 2021 under the moonlight)

281
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:18,367
Young Ok, this is honey and what you had earlier.

282
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:20,376
- Goodness.
- Let's load them in the car first.

283
00:11:20,377 --> 00:11:21,435
(He delivers them to the car in person.)

284
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:23,675
Take them and load them in the car.

285
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:26,176
Those are apples, and this is honey.

286
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:28,877
- I'll share them with others.
- Let me help you get in.

287
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:31,646
- Thank you.
- It was nothing. Take care.

288
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:32,955
- Keep up the good work.
- Thank you.

289
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:34,386
- Have a safe trip back home.
- Take care.

290
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:36,256
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

291
00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:39,825
- Goodbye.
- Bye. Great job, everyone.

292
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:41,696
(They see Young Ok off politely.)

293
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:43,296
Good job.

294
00:11:43,627 --> 00:11:44,967
(Turning around abruptly)

295
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:51,305
Hey, what did you say to me just earlier?

296
00:11:51,306 --> 00:11:52,306
- What?
- You should...

297
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:54,176
- What did you say?
- You should...

298
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:57,106
- You should take care of this.
- What did you say to me?

299
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,016
- You're on that side now?
- Hey.

300
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:00,117
- Just like that?
- Hee Won.

301
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:02,616
- He went to that side right away.
- Well... Pardon?

302
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:04,487
I was walking and somehow ended up on this side.

303
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:07,356
- Hey.
- I didn't choose a side.

304
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:08,886
- I didn't choose a side.
- Then...

305
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:10,825
Hey! What did you say to me?

306
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:12,185
- He's a weird guy.
- What?

307
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:13,825
- You're so...
- Ms. Kim!

308
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:14,956
- He's something.
- My goodness.

309
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,466
He's the weird one.

310
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:19,166
(Will Kwang Kyu be able to spend the night safe and sound?)

311
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:22,836
Dong Il, are we going to set up a tent tonight?

312
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:24,035
No, let's all sleep inside.

313
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,736
- Right?
- Yes, let's all sleep inside.

314
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:28,506
Honestly, I always wanted to sleep on the top bunk.

315
00:12:28,507 --> 00:12:29,876
- You haven't slept on it?
- You haven't?

316
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:31,746
Hee Won and I haven't had a chance.

317
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:33,915
- Whenever the guests came, - Is that so?

318
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,445
we slept in the tent outside.

319
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:36,717
It's really nice.

320
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:42,356
(They've been sleeping outdoors for 2 years in all seasons.)

321
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:47,227
(They've been sleeping outdoors for 2 years in all seasons.)

322
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:50,796
Honestly, I've always wanted to sleep on the top bunk.

323
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:53,236
- It's so cozy.
- It's nice.

324
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:55,597
It's already hard to go up. How will I sleep here?

325
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:57,467
Gosh. This is...

326
00:12:57,767 --> 00:13:00,306
What if it falls?

327
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:02,137
- Is it sturdy enough?
- Good.

328
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:05,716
(Squirming)

329
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:07,315
When I see it from here,

330
00:13:07,316 --> 00:13:08,646
- it looks pretty big.
- My goodness.

331
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:09,747
(He bumped into the ceiling.)

332
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:13,386
I wanted to sleep here too.

333
00:13:13,387 --> 00:13:14,455
(Meanwhile, the other owner of the house, Dong Il, is...)

334
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:15,887
Gosh. How can I go up?

335
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:18,127
Even my feet won't be able to go in there.

336
00:13:18,857 --> 00:13:19,925
(Coming up)

337
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:21,896
- Seung Hwan, hold me up.
- Yes, I'm holding you up.

338
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:23,025
- From behind.
- I'm holding you up.

339
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:24,367
Watch your head.

340
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:26,497
I think you should turn around.

341
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:29,506
How is he going to come down? He can't?

342
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:30,906
(It's not easy to come up here.)

343
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:33,705
(Dong Il finally lies down on the top bunk.)

344
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:36,647
It is paradise here.

345
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:39,117
Is everything all right there?

346
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:40,517
- Here?
- Yes.

347
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:43,686
I have a feeling that it's going to be very uncomfortable.

348
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:45,446
Gosh. What's wrong with this?

349
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:48,156
I might keep bumping into this.

350
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,025
(Both worried and excited,)

351
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:52,056
Okay.

352
00:13:52,156 --> 00:13:54,096
(they turn off the light.)

353
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:57,366
We've never slept with guys like this before.

354
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:58,696
This is nice.

355
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:00,637
Goodnight, Myoung.

356
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:02,237
Okay. Goodnight.

357
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,435
Goodnight, Hee Won.

358
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:05,606
- Goodnight.
- Okay.

359
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:06,737
Goodnight.

360
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,405
My gosh. Royal Highness.

361
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:11,275
- Yes.
- My gosh.

362
00:14:11,276 --> 00:14:12,377
(I'm here too.)

363
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:17,587
(After saying goodnight fussily...)

364
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:23,055
(Under the quiet moon...)

365
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:27,097
(and many stars...)

366
00:14:28,156 --> 00:14:35,936
(Taking the whispering sound of the buckwheat field as a lullaby,)

367
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:42,337
(they wrap up the day in the House on Wheels.)

368
00:14:51,786 --> 00:14:55,216
(Deep in the mountains,)

369
00:14:55,217 --> 00:15:01,397
(it's still early in the morning.)

370
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:08,766
(The House on Wheels Family is still sleeping.)

371
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:11,467
(Myoung is sleeping like a caterpillar.)

372
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:15,706
(Rustling)

373
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:20,046
(Kwang Kyu gets up first.)

374
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:26,887
(It looks like Chief Kim had his night duty.)

375
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:33,257
(A morning at the night-duty room)

376
00:15:35,257 --> 00:15:36,726
(Staring)

377
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,196
Gosh, we're in the forest indeed.

378
00:15:39,997 --> 00:15:43,036
(Dong Il gets up in surprise.)

379
00:15:44,306 --> 00:15:49,905
(He checks outside as soon as he gets up.)

380
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:50,946
(Exclaiming)

381
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:55,676
(Surprised)

382
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:57,415
Gosh.

383
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,685
(Peeking)

384
00:15:58,686 --> 00:16:00,556
- This house has a great view.
- It's nice.

385
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:03,025
It has a great view.

386
00:16:03,026 --> 00:16:04,387
(It's full of green outside the windows.)

387
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,925
(They can enjoy the front yard view as soon as they wake up.)

388
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:08,756
Gosh, I didn't know there was a place like this in Korea.

389
00:16:08,757 --> 00:16:10,097
This is amazing.

390
00:16:11,926 --> 00:16:17,467
(It grew a lot even after a night.)

391
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:21,137
The flowers are blooming more than yesterday.

392
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:23,606
- The buckwheat flowers?
- Yes. The buckwheat flowers.

393
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,807
(The buckwheat flowers seem whiter than yesterday.)

394
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:27,576
This spot is perfect.

395
00:16:27,577 --> 00:16:28,817
Right, you can see everything.

396
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:32,086
Gosh, the ridge is...

397
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:33,215
(They enjoy the front yard relaxedly.)

398
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:35,357
The ridge is so beautiful.

399
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:36,857
What?

400
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:38,685
(You can see the layered ridges from the house.)

401
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:41,956
It's an inland area, but there's no building at all.

402
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,026
Gosh, it feels like I can see the wind.

403
00:16:45,027 --> 00:16:48,195
That was a cool comment. "It feels like I can see the wind."

404
00:16:48,196 --> 00:16:51,166
(The morning in Doennaegigol with the wind blowing through flowers)

405
00:16:52,006 --> 00:16:54,076
(Gosh, this is nice.)

406
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:55,675
Well, we need to see the sun.

407
00:16:55,676 --> 00:16:57,745
It'd be pretty if the sun shines over the field.

408
00:16:57,746 --> 00:17:00,316
- But I can't see the sun.
- Because we're in the mountains.

409
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:01,816
- Because of the mountains.
- Right.

410
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:03,587
The sun rose over there, but...

411
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:08,357
(Even after dawn...)

412
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:12,897
(You can't see the sun in Doennaegigol.)

413
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:18,225
(Because the front yard is deep in the mountains,)

414
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:22,607
(the sun hasn't risen above them yet.)

415
00:17:23,706 --> 00:17:29,706
(But when the sun rises, you can see an amazing view.)

416
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:33,077
(I hope the sun rises soon!)

417
00:17:33,246 --> 00:17:35,016
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, I did.

418
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,287
- You slept well?
- I really did.

419
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:40,655
How could five people have slept here?

420
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:42,116
- It's amazing.
- Right?

421
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:43,256
(Indeed.)

422
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:46,156
It's cozier than I thought.

423
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,725
- It's...
- Is it?

424
00:17:47,726 --> 00:17:49,156
Yes, it's amazing.

425
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:53,336
(He lies downward.)

426
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:55,796
(He lies sideways.)

427
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:58,406
(On his back)

428
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,807
(He's looking up at the 2nd floor.)

429
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:02,405
Is there a window up there?

430
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:04,847
There's a window here, so you can look outside.

431
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:06,745
There's one there too.

432
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:08,817
(Staring)

433
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:13,357
Can you lend me the house some time?

434
00:18:13,956 --> 00:18:16,126
You haven't come up here, right?

435
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:17,827
- Right.
- It's so nice here.

436
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:19,755
It's soft.

437
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,057
Up there...

438
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:22,996
- What? You want to come up here?
- Yes.

439
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,195
You won't fit up there.

440
00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:28,465
You can come up here.

441
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:29,807
(Expectant)

442
00:18:30,637 --> 00:18:32,106
- Up here...
- No.

443
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:34,107
- You can come down.
- Okay.

444
00:18:35,307 --> 00:18:37,346
- Hey.
- All right.

445
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:38,347
(What's happening?)

446
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:39,515
This side is...

447
00:18:39,516 --> 00:18:41,245
(What's going on?)

448
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,916
The female guests slept there, right?

449
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:45,216
Yes.

450
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:47,116
This side is...

451
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:48,886
(He finally goes up to the 2nd floor.)

452
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:50,256
The female guests...

453
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:52,756
Gosh, this is nice.

454
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:55,627
Try lying down.

455
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:58,866
He loves it. Look at him.

456
00:18:58,867 --> 00:18:59,896
The window is here.

457
00:18:59,897 --> 00:19:01,067
(Turning around)

458
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:04,637
(Seung Hwan is excited.)

459
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:06,436
Look at him.

460
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:09,577
Gosh, you can see the sky from here.

461
00:19:09,706 --> 00:19:11,307
You can see it right there.

462
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:13,915
(Exclaiming)

463
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,386
(He opens the window.)

464
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:17,387
What's up there?

465
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:20,817
(Peeking)

466
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:24,057
(Can you do that too?)

467
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,725
Gosh, this is fantastic.

468
00:19:25,726 --> 00:19:28,397
(He's satisfied with the 2nd floor.)

469
00:19:28,926 --> 00:19:30,725
You stay there. I'll go up too.

470
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:31,925
You can go up there too. It's spacious.

471
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:33,496
- It's spacious indeed.
- Two people can sleep up there.

472
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:35,765
(Kwang Kyu goes up to the 2nd floor too.)

473
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:37,166
You can go up.

474
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:43,946
Gosh, this place has an amazing view.

475
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:46,676
- Open that window and see outside.
- That window?

476
00:19:47,347 --> 00:19:49,216
Open the window and see.

477
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:52,185
(Chuckling)

478
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:53,356
My goodness.

479
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,356
(What are you guys doing?)

480
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:56,386
Hey!

481
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:58,526
(Friendly)

482
00:19:58,527 --> 00:20:00,725
- We can't see the sun yet.
- Hey!

483
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:05,827
(They are excited by just a window.)

484
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:08,836
(Hello.)

485
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:09,935
It's refreshing.

486
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:13,777
It's moving away. The sun is coming up.

487
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:15,436
My goodness.

488
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:17,306
The sun is coming up.

489
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:18,506
(The guests enjoy the morning while seeing the view outside.)

490
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:20,046
(The house owners missed the view as they were sleeping.)

491
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:21,946
(Myoung is still sleeping like a caterpillar.)

492
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:25,117
(Hee Won is not fully awake yet.)

493
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:30,287
(Meanwhile, Dong Il is...)

494
00:20:30,486 --> 00:20:32,386
- It's nice here.
- Right?

495
00:20:32,387 --> 00:20:33,556
(He takes out the rice container.)

496
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:35,856
My body is too big.

497
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:37,526
(He starts cooking the rice for the guests.)

498
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,726
From outside...

499
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:43,036
(Rinsing the rice)

500
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:45,867
(Peek-a-boo!)

501
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:49,705
(Myoung gets up at the sound of rinsing the rice.)

502
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,806
(He has bed hair.)

503
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:52,877
Is this it?

504
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,077
It's really big.

505
00:20:56,486 --> 00:20:57,486
(Dazed)

506
00:20:57,487 --> 00:20:58,816
- Myoung!
- Yes?

507
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:00,916
Lie down. Don't get up yet.

508
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,127
- You can lie down.
- I couldn't sleep well last night.

509
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:07,397
- Why not?
- I couldn't sleep well.

510
00:21:08,127 --> 00:21:10,026
- Why not?
- I usually sleep late.

511
00:21:10,027 --> 00:21:11,366
(Thanks to the big brother's love,)

512
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:12,425
You can lie down.

513
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:14,397
(he falls asleep again.)

514
00:21:15,097 --> 00:21:18,235
(In the meantime, Dong Il finishes rinsing the rice.)

515
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,266
Okay.

516
00:21:19,307 --> 00:21:22,946
(Unpacking)

517
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:27,116
(Today's special ingredient)

518
00:21:27,117 --> 00:21:28,476
Gosh, this scaly hedgehog mushroom is really big.

519
00:21:29,716 --> 00:21:32,817
(The scaly hedgehog mushroom is huge.)

520
00:21:33,016 --> 00:21:35,016
I should make rice with scaly hedgehog mushrooms.

521
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:40,357
(What? Scaly hedgehog mushrooms?)

522
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:43,127
- So that's how it looks like.
- Right.

523
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:48,236
(They bought a generous amount of mushrooms for Young Ok yesterday.)

524
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:49,935
Gosh, it's really big.

525
00:21:49,936 --> 00:21:53,637
(He picks up a large mushroom which is generous like Dong Il.)

526
00:21:54,936 --> 00:21:58,406
It's really big. I've never seen one as a whole before.

527
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:00,077
Goodness.

528
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:01,915
(He cuts it into big pieces.)

529
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:02,916
Let's go down.

530
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,786
- He cuts it so well.
- Of course.

531
00:22:04,787 --> 00:22:06,087
(The mushrooms look like meat.)

532
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:08,915
(He puts a generous amount...)

533
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,756
(of precious ingredients for the precious guests.)

534
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:13,097
(They are being absorbed in.)

535
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:16,867
(How will the rice with scaly hedgehog mushrooms taste like?)

536
00:22:17,196 --> 00:22:20,466
(Wriggling)

537
00:22:22,097 --> 00:22:24,137
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, I did.

538
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:27,307
(Bumping)

539
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:30,106
I hear you bumping again.

540
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:32,777
(He's used to this.)

541
00:22:33,547 --> 00:22:35,245
He's still doing that.

542
00:22:35,246 --> 00:22:36,916
(Hee Won's bed)

543
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,086
(Bumping)

544
00:22:39,087 --> 00:22:41,287
- Gosh.
- I hear you bumping again.

545
00:22:41,387 --> 00:22:43,287
(He bumps his knee for the 2nd time.)

546
00:22:43,756 --> 00:22:44,985
(What's this noise?)

547
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:46,695
- He's up.
- Goodness.

548
00:22:46,696 --> 00:22:47,996
Hee Won will ache all over.

549
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:50,725
(Gosh, I got aches all over my body.)

550
00:22:50,726 --> 00:22:53,567
- Where was it? Your knees?
- Yes. Gosh, it hurts.

551
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:56,567
How many times will you bump your knees like that?

552
00:22:57,466 --> 00:22:58,905
(Hee Won's sleep talking)

553
00:22:58,906 --> 00:23:01,777
(Groaning)

554
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:03,877
(Turning over)

555
00:23:04,246 --> 00:23:07,347
(He can't keep still while sleeping.)

556
00:23:07,877 --> 00:23:08,915
(It wasn't spacious enough for Hee Won.)

557
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:10,186
(Bumping)

558
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:11,817
(Groaning)

559
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:12,916
(Bumping)

560
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:15,287
(Roaring)

561
00:23:16,117 --> 00:23:18,225
(I knew I had pains all over my body.)

562
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:21,357
(Is he stretching?)

563
00:23:22,196 --> 00:23:25,226
- Hee Won.
- I think I bumped into everywhere.

564
00:23:25,897 --> 00:23:26,935
(Hee Won will sleep on the 1st floor from now on.)

565
00:23:26,936 --> 00:23:29,397
You should sleep down here from now on.

566
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:32,566
(The youngest wakes up from a sound sleep.)

567
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:34,205
This couch turns into a bed if you spread it like this.

568
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:35,236
That's right.

569
00:23:36,137 --> 00:23:38,046
(As soon as he wakes up,)

570
00:23:38,047 --> 00:23:39,876
(he picks up yugwa.)

571
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,377
Myoung is going to eat it again.

572
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:47,656
I also saw it, but I couldn't eat it on an empty stomach.

573
00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:49,316
I felt sorry for my stomach.

574
00:23:49,317 --> 00:23:50,356
(The youngest feels hungry as soon as he wakes up.)

575
00:23:50,357 --> 00:23:52,586
- Why am I so hungry today?
- I know.

576
00:23:52,587 --> 00:23:53,656
(Eating)

577
00:23:54,656 --> 00:23:56,796
Ramyeon with scaly hedgehog mushrooms in it...

578
00:23:56,797 --> 00:23:59,166
would be good for breakfast.

579
00:24:00,236 --> 00:24:02,067
- Do we have ramyeon?
- Ramyeon?

580
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,806
But I crave meat.

581
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:05,837
(He wants to eat meat first thing in the morning.)

582
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:07,637
Some chuck flap tail.

583
00:24:09,077 --> 00:24:11,146
What was that?

584
00:24:11,147 --> 00:24:14,147
If we're going to have meat, we should prepare the charcoal fast.

585
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:15,715
Goodness.

586
00:24:15,716 --> 00:24:18,415
Why are you talking about meat at seven in the morning?

587
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,486
Should I make a fire?

588
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:22,887
(The two brought a lot yesterday.)

589
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:26,756
(Kwang Kyu brought beef to have with the family.)

590
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:28,556
(They forgot about the beef while eating dumpling soup.)

591
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:30,527
(Jong Suk sent them for us.)

592
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:31,627
(Actor Lee Jong Suk)

593
00:24:31,628 --> 00:24:35,236
(Kwang Kyu brought a lot to share with the precious friends.)

594
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:37,466
(Exclaiming)

595
00:24:37,706 --> 00:24:40,206
(He's so excited.)

596
00:24:41,037 --> 00:24:43,877
(He wants to have beef.)

597
00:24:44,176 --> 00:24:45,377
(Kwang Kyu's gift)

598
00:24:45,946 --> 00:24:48,476
Then shall we eat inside?

599
00:24:48,877 --> 00:24:50,347
We'll cook some meat.

600
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:53,887
Guys. As we're here together like this...

601
00:24:54,317 --> 00:24:55,416
It reminds me of the time...

602
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:58,985
when I was in high school or theaters.

603
00:24:58,986 --> 00:25:01,226
Like we gathered at a friend's house.

604
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:04,225
- This would be more than enough.
- We'd gather around every day.

605
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:05,966
Of course. We won't go home.

606
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:07,435
Like we're on a school trip.

607
00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:09,765
(The place feels like a friend's house.)

608
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:10,965
So this is the fun of it.

609
00:25:10,966 --> 00:25:12,666
(Perfect teamwork)

610
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:14,475
(He puts the sheets on the bed.)

611
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:16,476
You remind me of Lee Dae Geun.

612
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:19,847
- With all those sheets.
- You remind me of him.

613
00:25:22,377 --> 00:25:24,186
Gosh, the sun is up now.

614
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:26,316
Look at that ridge over there.

615
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,587
(The sun starts to shine over the front yard.)

616
00:25:29,587 --> 00:25:31,455
- It's so cold outside.
- Right, it's cold outside.

617
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:34,296
- It's windy today.
- The wind is really strong.

618
00:25:34,297 --> 00:25:36,867
(Hee Won takes the table right away.)

619
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:40,495
Because of its width...

620
00:25:40,496 --> 00:25:41,496
(You need to use your feet for this.)

621
00:25:41,497 --> 00:25:43,566
- Because of its width...
- This is...

622
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:46,037
- This will do.
- I see. Okay.

623
00:25:46,706 --> 00:25:48,235
- We have the stone plate too.
- That'd be great.

624
00:25:48,236 --> 00:25:49,236
- That's good.
- Good.

625
00:25:49,237 --> 00:25:50,277
- Really?
- Yes.

626
00:25:50,577 --> 00:25:52,706
Which side is the right way?

627
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:54,076
I think this is the front side.

628
00:25:54,077 --> 00:25:56,486
- We grill them on here, right?
- That's right.

629
00:25:57,446 --> 00:25:58,586
Let's see.

630
00:25:58,587 --> 00:25:59,985
So you have a stone plate too.

631
00:25:59,986 --> 00:26:01,486
(Amazed)

632
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,016
Guys.

633
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:06,327
Let's check out the beef Kwang Kyu brought. Who sent this?

634
00:26:06,627 --> 00:26:07,956
It's from Jong Suk.

635
00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:10,527
- Jong Suk sent this.
- Let's see.

636
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:12,367
The beef looks great.

637
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:13,596
(He can't take his eyes off of it.)

638
00:26:13,597 --> 00:26:16,396
Thanks to Kwang Kyu who brought this,

639
00:26:16,397 --> 00:26:17,966
we get to eat this nice beef.

640
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:20,577
It's a lot to eat by myself.

641
00:26:21,006 --> 00:26:22,036
It looks nice.

642
00:26:22,037 --> 00:26:24,176
(Staring)

643
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:26,616
(Dong Il does his best to show his gratitude.)

644
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:28,175
Since he's putting them out like that,

645
00:26:28,176 --> 00:26:29,445
it feels like we're at a restaurant.

646
00:26:29,446 --> 00:26:31,186
(Dong Il does his best to show his gratitude.)

647
00:26:32,246 --> 00:26:35,056
(Hee Won suddenly opens the fridge.)

648
00:26:35,057 --> 00:26:37,857
- Where is it?
- Where did I put it? Isn't that it?

649
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:40,897
- That's right.
- Yes, you can take that.

650
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,066
You take that. You should put them nicely.

651
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:46,067
All right.

652
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:49,367
(What's that?)

653
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:52,866
I've never seen pickled pine mushrooms.

654
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:53,877
Gosh, okay.

655
00:26:54,537 --> 00:26:56,746
- Pickled pine mushrooms?
- He brought them.

656
00:26:57,406 --> 00:26:58,777
- It's...
- This is from...

657
00:26:59,246 --> 00:27:00,847
- his manager's mother.
- Right.

658
00:27:01,347 --> 00:27:03,416
She made it herself.

659
00:27:03,787 --> 00:27:06,787
- So it's really pine mushrooms?
- That's right.

660
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:08,616
- The expensive pine mushrooms?
- Yes.

661
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:11,587
You make pickled pine mushrooms when it's that expensive?

662
00:27:12,387 --> 00:27:14,326
- The pickled pine mushrooms.
- I wonder how it tastes.

663
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:16,126
I've never heard of...

664
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:17,627
- The pine mushrooms are...
- pickled pine mushrooms.

665
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:20,236
We also have pickled scaly hedgehog mushrooms.

666
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:22,036
I can smell the mushroom.

667
00:27:22,037 --> 00:27:23,037
(Pickled scaly hedgehog mushrooms that smell like a forest)

668
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:24,366
This is amazing.

669
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:25,637
(Amazed)

670
00:27:26,137 --> 00:27:29,137
Scaly hedgehog mushroom rice and pickled scaly hedgehog mushrooms?

671
00:27:29,877 --> 00:27:30,877
Put it here.

672
00:27:30,878 --> 00:27:32,676
(The breakfast is getting ready.)

673
00:27:33,107 --> 00:27:35,246
(Exclaiming)

674
00:27:36,016 --> 00:27:37,586
I wanted you guys to eat this.

675
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:39,715
It's from Daejeon.

676
00:27:39,716 --> 00:27:42,186
It's going to stimulate...

677
00:27:42,587 --> 00:27:43,827
your appetite.

678
00:27:44,226 --> 00:27:45,627
That kimchi looks so good.

679
00:27:46,156 --> 00:27:47,225
That's amazing.

680
00:27:47,226 --> 00:27:49,357
(Gulping)

681
00:27:50,027 --> 00:27:51,665
(The youngest suddenly bursts into laughter.)

682
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:54,166
- Dong Il, I'll grill...
- Right.

683
00:27:54,936 --> 00:27:57,867
the Vienna sausages that Myoung brought for me.

684
00:27:58,607 --> 00:27:59,836
(He brought sausages for Hee Won.)

685
00:27:59,837 --> 00:28:01,976
(Shy)

686
00:28:02,577 --> 00:28:06,176
(Did you bring this for me?)

687
00:28:06,716 --> 00:28:10,647
(He's very touched.)

688
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:14,755
(Hee Won has been thinking about it all along.)

689
00:28:14,756 --> 00:28:15,786
Right, you should.

690
00:28:15,787 --> 00:28:17,726
(Chuckling)

691
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:19,326
You also like it, right?

692
00:28:19,327 --> 00:28:20,495
(Score the sausages before grilling them.)

693
00:28:20,496 --> 00:28:21,996
- It's going to be delicious.
- Right.

694
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:24,925
(The table is filled with dishes they prepared with great care.)

695
00:28:24,926 --> 00:28:27,137
We're done. We just need to wait for the rice to be done.

696
00:28:28,897 --> 00:28:29,965
I'm hungry.

697
00:28:29,966 --> 00:28:31,867
(It stimulates their appetite.)

698
00:28:32,607 --> 00:28:33,735
But I ate a lot yesterday.

699
00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:35,577
(It's strange.)

700
00:28:36,337 --> 00:28:38,077
How come I got hungry as soon as I got up?

701
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:40,915
(Rummaging in the fridge)

702
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:41,945
Here it is.

703
00:28:41,946 --> 00:28:43,346
(Here it is.)

704
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,647
Apples...

705
00:28:46,047 --> 00:28:47,316
Do you want to have an apple?

706
00:28:47,317 --> 00:28:50,086
- That'd be great.
- Give them some apples.

707
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:51,986
- These are golden apples.
- Yes.

708
00:28:52,256 --> 00:28:54,327
These are golden apples. These are really delicious.

709
00:28:54,456 --> 00:28:56,056
- That's right.
- Seriously.

710
00:28:56,057 --> 00:28:57,666
We picked these ourselves yesterday.

711
00:28:58,297 --> 00:29:00,567
We've set aside those three for you.

712
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:04,936
- Golden apples. These are so good.
- Right.

713
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:06,837
These are not ordinary apples.

714
00:29:08,537 --> 00:29:10,806
(Which one is the sourest?)

715
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:12,647
(The sourest one)

716
00:29:13,176 --> 00:29:17,186
(They all take a bite to see how it tastes.)

717
00:29:17,587 --> 00:29:19,916
(It's very sour!)

718
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,357
(Extremely sour)

719
00:29:22,857 --> 00:29:25,985
(Fruits for the guests are ready.)

720
00:29:25,986 --> 00:29:27,597
(Remember these.)

721
00:29:28,426 --> 00:29:29,995
Give them some apples.

722
00:29:29,996 --> 00:29:32,966
These are golden apples. Have you heard of it?

723
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:36,067
- No.
- These are golden apples.

724
00:29:36,736 --> 00:29:38,706
These are golden apples, not ordinary apples.

725
00:29:39,307 --> 00:29:40,406
(Approaching)

726
00:29:41,077 --> 00:29:42,736
The sour apples.

727
00:29:43,946 --> 00:29:45,946
That's right. Give them.

728
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:48,647
We've set aside the three for you.

729
00:29:49,647 --> 00:29:51,046
This one is prettier.

730
00:29:51,047 --> 00:29:53,686
- Are you going to share it?
- No, we'll have one each.

731
00:29:55,287 --> 00:29:56,486
You can share it.

732
00:29:56,827 --> 00:29:58,426
You can eat one each, or you can share it.

733
00:29:58,627 --> 00:29:59,627
(Disappointed)

734
00:29:59,628 --> 00:30:01,856
We'll share this one then. Could you cut it?

735
00:30:01,857 --> 00:30:03,797
- Split it.
- I can't split it.

736
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:06,836
You can't split this apple.

737
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:08,496
- Hee Won split it yesterday.
- You can split it.

738
00:30:09,897 --> 00:30:11,965
(Looking down)

739
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:13,107
I heard it crack.

740
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:15,705
- Goodness.
- Seung Hwan will do it easily.

741
00:30:15,706 --> 00:30:17,005
(At ease)

742
00:30:17,006 --> 00:30:18,307
He's going to crush it.

743
00:30:20,617 --> 00:30:21,647
Sure thing.

744
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:23,986
Goodness.

745
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:25,685
(He was watching him.)

746
00:30:25,686 --> 00:30:27,155
My gosh. It splattered.

747
00:30:27,156 --> 00:30:28,456
It went into his eyes.

748
00:30:29,557 --> 00:30:31,225
(His eyes must be sore.)

749
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:32,686
- You act so well, Kwang Kyu.
- Seriously.

750
00:30:32,986 --> 00:30:35,857
- Have a bigger one.
- It really went into my eyes.

751
00:30:36,656 --> 00:30:40,236
(Finally taking a bite)

752
00:30:41,196 --> 00:30:42,235
Golden apples.

753
00:30:42,236 --> 00:30:44,537
(Let me take a bite too.)

754
00:30:45,307 --> 00:30:47,475
(Glancing)

755
00:30:47,476 --> 00:30:49,377
(Did they eat it?)

756
00:30:49,976 --> 00:30:53,107
(He can't watch them.)

757
00:30:54,176 --> 00:30:56,316
(Gulping)

758
00:30:56,317 --> 00:30:58,946
It's sour. It has a sweet aftertaste.

759
00:30:59,087 --> 00:31:02,186
(Peaceful)

760
00:31:02,557 --> 00:31:03,626
It's really good.

761
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:06,327
(It's not supposed to be like this.)

762
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:14,166
(Hee Won...)

763
00:31:14,236 --> 00:31:16,166
What's up?

764
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:18,066
Why did you laugh?

765
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:19,607
(Bursting into laughter)

766
00:31:20,676 --> 00:31:21,706
(Confused)

767
00:31:22,037 --> 00:31:24,277
- Hey.
- Why did you laugh? You punk.

768
00:31:25,277 --> 00:31:26,706
Why did you?

769
00:31:27,647 --> 00:31:28,976
- What?
- Why did he laugh?

770
00:31:29,777 --> 00:31:31,847
I'm serious.

771
00:31:31,946 --> 00:31:33,985
- It's good.
- It is good.

772
00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:35,286
- It's good.
- Why did he laugh?

773
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:36,486
Is it not sour?

774
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:38,426
- It's so good.
- Really?

775
00:31:39,256 --> 00:31:41,597
We gave those apples to Mother to take home yesterday.

776
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:43,726
I should give that.

777
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:45,966
I gave them the sour ones, but they're enjoyoing it.

778
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:48,696
- They ate this?
- Yes.

779
00:31:49,897 --> 00:31:52,736
- It's really good.
- It's extraordinary.

780
00:31:53,476 --> 00:31:55,705
- It really is good.
- They're weird.

781
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,807
(They're weird.)

782
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:00,077
It's good.

783
00:32:01,246 --> 00:32:03,616
(Beeping)

784
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:05,985
- I guess it's sour.
- I think the rice is ready.

785
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:07,087
You need to stir it.

786
00:32:07,956 --> 00:32:10,455
Look at the color of the rice.

787
00:32:10,456 --> 00:32:12,026
- Look at this.
- It's good, right?

788
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:13,597
It has the color of the scaly hedgehog mushrooms.

789
00:32:14,357 --> 00:32:16,995
For breakfast, we're eating beef...

790
00:32:16,996 --> 00:32:18,296
and rice with scaly hedgehog mushrooms.

791
00:32:18,297 --> 00:32:19,626
(A bowl with plenty of scaly hedgehog mushroom)

792
00:32:19,627 --> 00:32:20,766
The mushroom smells great.

793
00:32:21,337 --> 00:32:22,396
It's nice and sticky.

794
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:24,836
- It's not watery.
- This is luxurious.

795
00:32:24,837 --> 00:32:26,006
It's rice with scaly hedgehog mushroom.

796
00:32:27,037 --> 00:32:29,337
(The scaly hedgehog mushroom smells great.)

797
00:32:30,006 --> 00:32:31,546
(Impressed)

798
00:32:31,547 --> 00:32:33,676
- Do we have Cheongyang chili?
- Why?

799
00:32:34,347 --> 00:32:36,317
I want to make a sauce for it.

800
00:32:37,047 --> 00:32:39,185
You are using the big scallion.

801
00:32:39,186 --> 00:32:42,287
I see that you're mincing it.

802
00:32:43,287 --> 00:32:44,686
I should learn how to make a sauce.

803
00:32:45,127 --> 00:32:46,726
(Putting in great care)

804
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:50,397
- I didn't know you need onion.
- It's refreshing that way.

805
00:32:51,027 --> 00:32:53,495
(Using only his senses to measure)

806
00:32:53,496 --> 00:32:55,665
You don't add that much soy sauce.

807
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:57,406
Only enough to make it watery.

808
00:32:57,766 --> 00:33:00,036
If you add too much soy sauce, it will taste salty.

809
00:33:00,037 --> 00:33:01,107
(The master is done making the sauce.)

810
00:33:03,006 --> 00:33:04,077
(Impressed)

811
00:33:04,706 --> 00:33:05,976
It has sesame oil in it, right?

812
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:07,445
I added a bit of it.

813
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,176
- A bit of sesame oil.
- Yes.

814
00:33:10,317 --> 00:33:13,286
(A sausage master)

815
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:14,316
(Sitting right next to Hee Won)

816
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:16,486
We're having such a big breakfast.

817
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:18,527
We just need to cook the beef.

818
00:33:18,986 --> 00:33:20,597
Heat up the pan.

819
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:26,397
(It's 8:00am.)

820
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,765
(They are eating as soon as they got up.)

821
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:32,407
(Zoning out)

822
00:33:33,306 --> 00:33:35,376
(Korean beef breakfast)

823
00:33:35,377 --> 00:33:37,047
That's the best ever.

824
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:38,906
Let's eat it now

825
00:33:38,907 --> 00:33:40,446
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

826
00:33:40,447 --> 00:33:41,476
- Seung Hwan.
- Yes, Dong Il.

827
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:43,245
- Go ahead.
- Should I put it on?

828
00:33:43,246 --> 00:33:45,317
- Yes, do that.
- I'll put it on the pan.

829
00:33:46,956 --> 00:33:48,216
(A piece of meat goes on the pre-heated pan!)

830
00:33:48,217 --> 00:33:50,357
Have a seat.

831
00:33:51,357 --> 00:33:53,627
There we go.

832
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:56,496
(Gulping)

833
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:58,595
(Impressed)

834
00:33:58,596 --> 00:33:59,627
This is the best.

835
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:01,666
The meat is nicely cooked.

836
00:34:02,496 --> 00:34:04,136
The meat is of really high quality.

837
00:34:04,237 --> 00:34:06,636
Once you see the blood oozing out, you should eat it right away.

838
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:08,877
In the meantime, you can chop these up and eat them.

839
00:34:09,806 --> 00:34:11,805
Who likes it medium-rare?

840
00:34:11,806 --> 00:34:13,147
I'm fine with any beef.

841
00:34:13,547 --> 00:34:15,047
This is ready right now.

842
00:34:15,246 --> 00:34:16,446
The one right here?

843
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:17,516
Give it a try.

844
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:19,386
Don't we need to dip it in salt?

845
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,317
Try it as it is first. It's already seasoned.

846
00:34:23,056 --> 00:34:26,487
(Trying it as the chef recommends)

847
00:34:26,826 --> 00:34:27,896
It's good.

848
00:34:27,897 --> 00:34:30,157
It has salt on it already.

849
00:34:30,496 --> 00:34:31,665
Just a bit.

850
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:33,666
(Exclaiming)

851
00:34:34,266 --> 00:34:35,336
It's good.

852
00:34:35,337 --> 00:34:37,935
(The beef got cooked to perfection.)

853
00:34:37,936 --> 00:34:38,936
Seung Hwan, eat up.

854
00:34:38,937 --> 00:34:40,006
(The chef tries a bite too.)

855
00:34:40,007 --> 00:34:41,777
(Yum)

856
00:34:42,076 --> 00:34:43,305
(Beef is delicious even when you eat it for breakfast.)

857
00:34:43,306 --> 00:34:45,046
It's good.

858
00:34:45,047 --> 00:34:46,107
(Beef is delicious even when you eat it for breakfast.)

859
00:34:46,846 --> 00:34:49,046
I'm glad Kwang Kyu brought beef.

860
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,047
It's so good.

861
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:52,717
I'm so glad he brought it. Thanks to you,

862
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:55,016
I'm having a really nice breakfast.

863
00:34:55,556 --> 00:34:57,056
If I grill it at home by myself,

864
00:34:57,857 --> 00:34:58,927
it feels awkward, you know?

865
00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:01,926
Myoung brought these sausages for me.

866
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:02,955
(Myoung brought these sausages for me.)

867
00:35:02,956 --> 00:35:03,995
Where?

868
00:35:03,996 --> 00:35:06,366
(Smiling)

869
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:08,237
(All in one bite)

870
00:35:09,136 --> 00:35:12,107
(It's too hot.)

871
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:14,575
(Trying a sausage as well.)

872
00:35:14,576 --> 00:35:17,246
(It's too hot.)

873
00:35:17,846 --> 00:35:19,046
(It's really hot.)

874
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:20,277
- It's good.
- It is, right?

875
00:35:21,616 --> 00:35:23,146
(Checking the watch)

876
00:35:23,147 --> 00:35:26,986
No one eats beef at 8:15am.

877
00:35:26,987 --> 00:35:28,086
(A barbecue party at eight in the morning)

878
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:30,487
(Puffy)

879
00:35:30,786 --> 00:35:31,987
It's nice.

880
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:35,896
Add some soy sauce.

881
00:35:35,897 --> 00:35:38,566
This is a feast.

882
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:39,567
Help yourself.

883
00:35:39,897 --> 00:35:42,737
(Taking a spoonful)

884
00:35:42,837 --> 00:35:44,206
(The mushroom aroma)

885
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:45,666
It smells really nice.

886
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:47,376
(The mushroom rice is full of the forest-like aroma.)

887
00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:48,407
I love this rice.

888
00:35:49,737 --> 00:35:52,776
I heard scaly hedgehog mushroom is good for you.

889
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:54,047
Eat a lot of it.

890
00:35:54,576 --> 00:35:57,686
Scaly hedgehog mushroom's texture is better than that of pine mushrooms.

891
00:35:58,186 --> 00:35:59,846
It tastes a bit like meat.

892
00:36:00,556 --> 00:36:02,786
- It's really chewy.
- It really is.

893
00:36:03,826 --> 00:36:05,555
(Suddenly remembered something)

894
00:36:05,556 --> 00:36:06,627
I should try this.

895
00:36:06,886 --> 00:36:09,256
(On top of the beef)

896
00:36:09,257 --> 00:36:10,927
One spoon of rice.

897
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:13,366
I'll top it all of with this.

898
00:36:14,536 --> 00:36:16,165
(A new flavor combination is born.)

899
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,467
I'm fine.

900
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:18,907
It wasn't for you anyway.

901
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:21,507
(Exclaiming)

902
00:36:22,036 --> 00:36:24,547
- That's a delicacy.
- This is the best.

903
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:26,245
(Topping it off with pickled mushroom)

904
00:36:26,246 --> 00:36:27,276
Seriously.

905
00:36:27,277 --> 00:36:28,746
(Taking a big bite)

906
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:29,916
(Exclaiming)

907
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:32,586
(Trying the beef and mushroom together this time)

908
00:36:32,587 --> 00:36:33,616
(Exclaiming)

909
00:36:34,386 --> 00:36:35,656
(Just having the mushroom now)

910
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:36,686
(Exclaiming)

911
00:36:37,686 --> 00:36:39,527
(Very impressed)

912
00:36:39,857 --> 00:36:42,156
(Each bite is precious.)

913
00:36:42,157 --> 00:36:43,226
(Exclaiming)

914
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:47,397
(Empty plate)

915
00:36:47,797 --> 00:36:50,806
The flavor of the mushroom got oozed out into the soy sauce.

916
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:51,907
That's right.

917
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:54,176
(Finishing up the mushroom rice with pickled mushroom)

918
00:36:54,177 --> 00:36:55,206
(Exclaiming)

919
00:36:56,976 --> 00:37:00,177
(He is really enjoying it!)

920
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:03,916
(Myoung is very quiet.)

921
00:37:05,186 --> 00:37:06,246
The kimchi...

922
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:08,217
What's wrong?

923
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,026
(It's the spicy kimchi that awakens all your senses.)

924
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:12,086
It's super spicy, right?

925
00:37:12,087 --> 00:37:13,186
(It's the spicy kimchi that awakens all your senses.)

926
00:37:13,657 --> 00:37:15,256
The kimchi is super spicy.

927
00:37:15,257 --> 00:37:16,396
It's so spicy.

928
00:37:16,397 --> 00:37:17,595
(He said it's too spicy.)

929
00:37:17,596 --> 00:37:18,666
But it's addicting.

930
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:23,466
It's so spicy.

931
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:24,866
(Everyone is going crazy.)

932
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:26,736
(Someone save me.)

933
00:37:26,737 --> 00:37:27,737
(Exhaling)

934
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:31,205
- But it's addicting.
- It's spicy, but I want more.

935
00:37:31,206 --> 00:37:32,907
Myoung eats it so well.

936
00:37:34,076 --> 00:37:36,646
I like spicy food.

937
00:37:36,647 --> 00:37:38,015
(Suffering)

938
00:37:38,016 --> 00:37:39,087
He keeps eating it.

939
00:37:40,616 --> 00:37:41,656
(While everyone is feeling dizzy because of the kimchi...)

940
00:37:41,657 --> 00:37:43,116
The beef is so good.

941
00:37:44,757 --> 00:37:46,356
(Seung Hwan is minding his own business.)

942
00:37:46,357 --> 00:37:50,397
(Peaceful)

943
00:37:50,897 --> 00:37:54,666
(Unbeatable appetite)

944
00:37:54,996 --> 00:37:58,266
(Seung Hwan is the best.)

945
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:01,237
It's the best.

946
00:38:02,177 --> 00:38:03,907
I can't believe we're having beef this early in the morning.

947
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:05,676
I won't be able to forget it.

948
00:38:05,677 --> 00:38:07,047
(It was a bountiful breakfast made with ingredients they brought.)

949
00:38:07,547 --> 00:38:09,647
While looking out over at that mountain ridge,

950
00:38:10,686 --> 00:38:13,047
we're having beef for breakfast.

951
00:38:14,456 --> 00:38:17,087
I've never imagined I'd be eating like this.

952
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:19,656
(A big breakfast shared with close friends)

953
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:21,757
- It's so good.
- I ate it like crazy.

954
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:25,896
It's interesting how once the sun came up,

955
00:38:25,897 --> 00:38:27,966
- the wind stopped blowing.
- Right?

956
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:28,967
It's really cool.

957
00:38:29,737 --> 00:38:33,106
It's really pretty.

958
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:34,476
(Feeling sentimental)

959
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:39,746
(The sun finally goes over the mountain.)

960
00:38:40,677 --> 00:38:44,147
(The sun shines on the buckwheat flowers.)

961
00:38:45,016 --> 00:38:47,185
(Even the strong wind...)

962
00:38:47,186 --> 00:38:50,317
(turns into a gentle breeze.)

963
00:38:51,427 --> 00:38:53,555
- Thank you, Dong Il.
- Thank you.

964
00:38:53,556 --> 00:38:54,596
(Shall we now enjoy the beautiful view?)

965
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:58,366
- It's so nice.
- It feels really nice now, right?

966
00:38:58,766 --> 00:39:02,665
It was really nice yesterday in the daytime.

967
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:04,237
In the daytime, it was really nice too.

968
00:39:05,206 --> 00:39:06,305
It's so refreshing and nice.

969
00:39:06,306 --> 00:39:08,407
(It's so refreshing and nice.)

970
00:39:09,206 --> 00:39:13,306
(With the gentle breeze,)

971
00:39:14,177 --> 00:39:17,916
(the buckwheat flowers dance swiftly side to side.)

972
00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:20,316
(They just enjoy the view.)

973
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:22,256
Where is the honey? I want honey with it.

974
00:39:22,257 --> 00:39:23,456
It's right here.

975
00:39:23,886 --> 00:39:28,027
Seung Hwan, since yesterday, you've had about 70 dollars worth of honey.

976
00:39:28,226 --> 00:39:31,266
(I love honey.)

977
00:39:31,797 --> 00:39:34,197
(He is really enjoying it.)

978
00:39:36,797 --> 00:39:41,237
(The buckwheat flower honey is so good.)

979
00:39:41,306 --> 00:39:46,346
(Excited for the honey)

980
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:50,015
(Taking a big spoon)

981
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,147
(Two spoons)

982
00:39:52,786 --> 00:39:56,616
(Three spoons)

983
00:39:56,757 --> 00:39:57,856
Try this.

984
00:39:57,857 --> 00:39:58,857
(Holding the buckwheat flower honey in his hand)

985
00:39:58,857 --> 00:39:59,857
Sure.

986
00:40:00,056 --> 00:40:02,056
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

987
00:40:02,257 --> 00:40:06,366
(Trying yugwa and buckwheat flower honey together)

988
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:07,966
This is all we have.

989
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:10,766
(I've got to try more.)

990
00:40:12,337 --> 00:40:14,736
- I bet the honey is incredible.
- It really is.

991
00:40:14,737 --> 00:40:16,475
(He can't stop eating the buckwheat flower honey.)

992
00:40:16,476 --> 00:40:18,706
(Happy)

993
00:40:19,147 --> 00:40:23,016
(It's buckwheat flower honey collected by the neighbors.)

994
00:40:23,576 --> 00:40:25,916
(Is it that good?)

995
00:40:26,516 --> 00:40:28,816
(Dong Il takes a bite.)

996
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:31,627
(Myoung tries it too.)

997
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:33,257
(Impressed)

998
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:37,926
(They're eating so well.)

999
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:40,737
Wouldn't it taste great on apples?

1000
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,336
- Honeyed apples.
- Honeyed apples.

1001
00:40:42,337 --> 00:40:43,635
(Yes, Hee Won.)

1002
00:40:43,636 --> 00:40:44,666
That sounds so good.

1003
00:40:45,837 --> 00:40:47,165
Did we...

1004
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:48,376
(The golden apples appeared!)

1005
00:40:48,377 --> 00:40:49,935
We picked these yesterday.

1006
00:40:49,936 --> 00:40:52,046
We went to the farm ourselves.

1007
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:53,106
(Staring)

1008
00:40:53,107 --> 00:40:54,677
We picked these ourselves.

1009
00:40:55,277 --> 00:40:58,886
Actually, I picked these myself to feed them to you.

1010
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,686
I wanted to test how good you are with sour food.

1011
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:03,856
- That's ripe.
- It was still good.

1012
00:41:03,857 --> 00:41:05,986
- It tasted a bit like jujubes.
- It did, right?

1013
00:41:05,987 --> 00:41:07,056
(Confessing)

1014
00:41:07,456 --> 00:41:09,657
- That looks even better.
- That is much better.

1015
00:41:10,027 --> 00:41:12,495
If that's the better one how good must it be?

1016
00:41:12,496 --> 00:41:14,936
(How good must it be?)

1017
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:20,306
(I'm going to let you taste real golden apples.)

1018
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:23,236
(Very carefully...)

1019
00:41:23,237 --> 00:41:24,907
(making a cut)

1020
00:41:25,377 --> 00:41:31,587
(He is peeling the apple exquisitely and neatly like a machine.)

1021
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,086
(Pursing his lips)

1022
00:41:33,087 --> 00:41:37,786
(With his lips pursed, he is cutting the apple.)

1023
00:41:38,157 --> 00:41:41,596
(Preparing the golden apples is done.)

1024
00:41:43,257 --> 00:41:46,725
(He is going to add the honey that Seung Hwan loves.)

1025
00:41:46,726 --> 00:41:48,165
(Honey...)

1026
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:50,467
(Honey!)

1027
00:41:51,036 --> 00:41:55,136
(Using all his strength)

1028
00:41:56,177 --> 00:42:00,677
(On top of the sour apples that Kwang Kyu enjoyed,)

1029
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:05,547
(he is adding plenty of honey that Seung Hwan loves.)

1030
00:42:05,786 --> 00:42:06,845
It's splendid.

1031
00:42:06,846 --> 00:42:09,015
(There is honey left on the spoon. I can't waste it.)

1032
00:42:09,016 --> 00:42:10,487
(Sucking on the spoon one more time)

1033
00:42:10,826 --> 00:42:12,586
(While he is preparing honeyed apples...)

1034
00:42:12,587 --> 00:42:13,657
It's so nice.

1035
00:42:15,027 --> 00:42:17,865
Look how the buckwheat flowers are swaying.

1036
00:42:17,866 --> 00:42:20,397
- The backyard must be amazing.
- Go see how nice it is.

1037
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:23,697
The buckwheat flowers are swaying in the breeze.

1038
00:42:24,136 --> 00:42:27,936
(The buckwheat flowers in the back yard are...)

1039
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:32,277
(swaying in the breeze.)

1040
00:42:32,576 --> 00:42:34,546
This is indeed a wonderful view.

1041
00:42:34,547 --> 00:42:36,076
- Yes, it is a beautiful view.
- My gosh.

1042
00:42:37,076 --> 00:42:38,586
(It is nice to gaze at the buckwheat flowers in the front yard.)

1043
00:42:38,587 --> 00:42:39,647
This is very relaxing.

1044
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,086
When Hee Won comes back,

1045
00:42:42,087 --> 00:42:44,456
let's go to the gazebo with coffee.

1046
00:42:45,186 --> 00:42:47,756
Because we can look down the scenery from the gazebo.

1047
00:42:47,757 --> 00:42:48,826
I heard that it is amazing.

1048
00:42:49,897 --> 00:42:54,236
(As they go up the slope behind the house,)

1049
00:42:54,237 --> 00:42:59,636
(the gazebo appears.)

1050
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:01,776
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1051
00:43:01,777 --> 00:43:04,506
(How great would the view be from the gazebo?)

1052
00:43:04,507 --> 00:43:06,806
Now I get to walk on the buckwheat field.

1053
00:43:07,246 --> 00:43:10,447
(Holding coffee and apples in their hands)

1054
00:43:10,947 --> 00:43:12,615
(Everyone is going up following Dong Il.)

1055
00:43:12,616 --> 00:43:13,616
- You can see everything from there.
- Gosh, seriously.

1056
00:43:13,617 --> 00:43:15,157
(Everyone is going up following Dong Il.)

1057
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:20,526
Compared to yesterday, more flowers bloomed. They are in full bloom.

1058
00:43:20,527 --> 00:43:21,696
(Nodding)

1059
00:43:21,697 --> 00:43:23,257
- Don't you think so?
- Yes, you're right.

1060
00:43:23,927 --> 00:43:27,837
(As they go up, the flowers are keeping them company.)

1061
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,095
(The tiny flower bud is...)

1062
00:43:30,096 --> 00:43:33,507
(taking the sunlight and blooming.)

1063
00:43:33,806 --> 00:43:36,476
(Blooming)

1064
00:43:37,007 --> 00:43:40,806
(The field was green yesterday,)

1065
00:43:41,647 --> 00:43:44,886
(but today, it looks white as if white popcorns are scattered.)

1066
00:43:45,616 --> 00:43:46,915
- Gosh.
- Seriously...

1067
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:49,817
The buckwheat field looks different from up here.

1068
00:43:50,757 --> 00:43:52,626
- I agree.
- It's totally different, isn't it?

1069
00:43:52,627 --> 00:43:53,657
Yes, it is.

1070
00:43:54,157 --> 00:43:56,595
(The buckwheat flowers are eye-catching.)

1071
00:43:56,596 --> 00:43:57,897
Gosh, the sound of the wind.

1072
00:43:59,297 --> 00:44:02,067
I get to feel everything. The wind and the sound of the wind.

1073
00:44:02,596 --> 00:44:03,596
Seriously.

1074
00:44:04,636 --> 00:44:06,936
- Gosh, the wind is cool.
- Listen to the sounds.

1075
00:44:07,636 --> 00:44:09,877
- It's so cool.
- I love it.

1076
00:44:10,337 --> 00:44:11,576
We came up pretty high.

1077
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:14,575
We walked just for a short while and see how high we came up.

1078
00:44:14,576 --> 00:44:15,576
Right.

1079
00:44:15,877 --> 00:44:17,686
I only walked up a bit, and how come I'm already out of breath?

1080
00:44:19,286 --> 00:44:20,686
Dong Il.

1081
00:44:21,357 --> 00:44:23,456
- Dong Il, can you slow down a bit?
- What?

1082
00:44:23,757 --> 00:44:24,987
Gosh, I'm short of breath.

1083
00:44:27,726 --> 00:44:28,726
(The uphill road is longer and steeper than expected.)

1084
00:44:28,727 --> 00:44:31,365
Going up and down on this road would be a great workout.

1085
00:44:31,366 --> 00:44:32,366
I know.

1086
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:36,396
(Turning around)

1087
00:44:36,397 --> 00:44:38,436
Gosh. Turn around, everyone.

1088
00:44:38,766 --> 00:44:40,907
No. Don't turn around until you go up to the top.

1089
00:44:41,436 --> 00:44:43,475
I want to save the best for later.

1090
00:44:43,476 --> 00:44:45,846
(I want to save the best for later.)

1091
00:44:46,246 --> 00:44:51,647
(What magnificent view does he want them to see?)

1092
00:44:52,947 --> 00:44:56,916
(There is a gazebo on top of the hill.)

1093
00:44:57,516 --> 00:44:58,856
(Catching his breath)

1094
00:44:58,857 --> 00:44:59,927
We're here.

1095
00:45:00,226 --> 00:45:04,366
- My gosh.
- Even the mountain looks different.

1096
00:45:05,197 --> 00:45:06,225
It's amazing.

1097
00:45:06,226 --> 00:45:09,296
Gosh, it's perfect here.

1098
00:45:09,297 --> 00:45:10,865
(How good is the scenery that everyone is admiring?)

1099
00:45:10,866 --> 00:45:12,237
This is seriously...

1100
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:17,706
(This is the scenery from the gazebo.)

1101
00:45:17,947 --> 00:45:21,947
(The valley is full of buckwheat flowers,)

1102
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:26,147
(and it can be seen better from the gazebo.)

1103
00:45:26,547 --> 00:45:29,916
I can clearly see the flowers swaying in the wind.

1104
00:45:30,357 --> 00:45:32,325
I know, right? Because we can look down from here.

1105
00:45:32,326 --> 00:45:33,856
(They can have a wider view of the scenery.)

1106
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:34,857
It's wonderful.

1107
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:38,126
I can feel that I am high up here.

1108
00:45:38,127 --> 00:45:39,697
I love the shape of the mountains.

1109
00:45:40,596 --> 00:45:43,135
(The mountain ridges are overlapping,)

1110
00:45:43,136 --> 00:45:47,507
(and they can see the ridges at their eye level.)

1111
00:45:48,877 --> 00:45:55,377
(Shall we enjoy this view at the gazebo in the valley?)

1112
00:45:56,976 --> 00:45:59,217
How come the wind is cooler?

1113
00:46:00,217 --> 00:46:01,357
It's much cooler here.

1114
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,856
We are not really far up from the house,

1115
00:46:03,857 --> 00:46:06,725
but the wind is colder up here.

1116
00:46:06,726 --> 00:46:09,527
- Maybe because we're in the shade.
- I see.

1117
00:46:10,096 --> 00:46:12,796
If I lie down here for a while, I think I would feel pretty cold.

1118
00:46:12,797 --> 00:46:13,897
Right.

1119
00:46:15,697 --> 00:46:17,736
The apple absorbed the honey on our way here.

1120
00:46:17,737 --> 00:46:18,935
(Let's have the honeyed apple that Hee Won prepared.)

1121
00:46:18,936 --> 00:46:20,306
Thank you for the food.

1122
00:46:20,536 --> 00:46:22,177
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

1123
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:24,676
Look how juicy the apple is.

1124
00:46:24,677 --> 00:46:27,446
(There's honey on the golden apple when it's already sweet?)

1125
00:46:27,447 --> 00:46:31,116
(Savoring it with his eyes closed)

1126
00:46:32,087 --> 00:46:34,816
You'll find the apple sweeter as you are sitting between the two of us.

1127
00:46:34,817 --> 00:46:37,386
(So this is the real golden apple?)

1128
00:46:37,857 --> 00:46:40,026
- This apple is so...
- It's so good.

1129
00:46:40,027 --> 00:46:41,027
Is it?

1130
00:46:41,028 --> 00:46:43,197
(After a bite of delicious apple, he looks at the scenery once.)

1131
00:46:44,826 --> 00:46:46,496
It's tastier than the apple we had earlier.

1132
00:46:48,496 --> 00:46:50,596
Gosh, this apple is seriously...

1133
00:46:51,036 --> 00:46:54,936
The texture of it is seriously so juicy.

1134
00:46:55,576 --> 00:46:59,345
I added just a bit of honey so you can still taste the apple.

1135
00:46:59,346 --> 00:47:00,475
(I added the perfect amount to make it taste both honey and apple.)

1136
00:47:00,476 --> 00:47:03,076
(Feeling proud)

1137
00:47:03,476 --> 00:47:04,515
(Tapping)

1138
00:47:04,516 --> 00:47:05,615
Myoung, you should have one more.

1139
00:47:05,616 --> 00:47:07,047
(Myoung, you should have one more.)

1140
00:47:07,317 --> 00:47:09,986
(Thank you, Hee Won.)

1141
00:47:09,987 --> 00:47:11,056
Isn't it good?

1142
00:47:12,286 --> 00:47:14,495
(The meaningful time they're sharing...)

1143
00:47:14,496 --> 00:47:17,726
(as they have honeyed apples enjoy the view)

1144
00:47:19,427 --> 00:47:20,427
- Seung Hwan.
- Yes?

1145
00:47:20,428 --> 00:47:22,935
Could you play a song that goes well with this moment?

1146
00:47:22,936 --> 00:47:24,737
(Feeling sentimental)

1147
00:47:25,737 --> 00:47:28,035
I brought the speaker because you told me to, but...

1148
00:47:28,036 --> 00:47:29,336
But you didn't bring it here, right?

1149
00:47:29,337 --> 00:47:31,107
- We will use it later at home.
- Okay.

1150
00:47:32,277 --> 00:47:34,046
The house is right there. You can go and bring it.

1151
00:47:34,047 --> 00:47:36,245
(The house is right there. Why don't you go now?)

1152
00:47:36,246 --> 00:47:37,646
(Come on.)

1153
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:40,515
Look. The house is literally right there.

1154
00:47:40,516 --> 00:47:42,356
It's very close.

1155
00:47:42,357 --> 00:47:44,626
No, it's not that close.

1156
00:47:44,627 --> 00:47:45,956
(You two are cute.)

1157
00:47:46,726 --> 00:47:47,796
(Meanwhile, Seung Hwan picked a song.)

1158
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:49,027
Which song are you going to play?

1159
00:47:50,226 --> 00:47:52,225
("Where the Wind Blows From" by Kim Kwang Seok)

1160
00:47:52,226 --> 00:47:53,266
It's a good one.

1161
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:56,196
You picked this song? It's good.

1162
00:47:56,197 --> 00:47:57,236
(The wind blew just in time.)

1163
00:47:57,237 --> 00:47:58,266
Isn't it great?

1164
00:47:59,107 --> 00:48:03,206
(Like the lyrics, he is swaying as the wind guides him.)

1165
00:48:03,476 --> 00:48:07,346
(The precious moment that they share together)

1166
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:12,147
(In the deep mountain, there are just the five of them.)

1167
00:48:12,487 --> 00:48:16,416
(While looking at the buckwheat flowers in full bloom,)

1168
00:48:17,157 --> 00:48:21,496
(they appreciate the moment in the front yard...)

1169
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:25,995
(as they are deeply touched.)

1170
00:48:25,996 --> 00:48:27,797
Gosh, the wind is refreshing.

1171
00:48:30,067 --> 00:48:32,706
Actually, I want to ask you guys something.

1172
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:37,536
You went through a lot and became well-known actors.

1173
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,706
So do you get to choose the role you'd like to play?

1174
00:48:39,947 --> 00:48:42,877
I try my best not to lose any opportunity.

1175
00:48:43,377 --> 00:48:44,986
I just love to be on set,

1176
00:48:44,987 --> 00:48:46,586
like Mother said yesterday.

1177
00:48:46,587 --> 00:48:48,157
She also said that she loves to be on set.

1178
00:48:49,056 --> 00:48:51,886
I hope I can continue working as an actor, if possible.

1179
00:48:52,527 --> 00:48:55,825
Seung Hwan, tell us how long you think you will work as an actor.

1180
00:48:55,826 --> 00:48:58,127
Well, I really want to continue acting, but...

1181
00:48:59,697 --> 00:49:01,396
I guess I will have to try my best...

1182
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,066
(I will have to try my best to continue working as an actor.)

1183
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:05,306
to keep acting because I can work only when I am given a role.

1184
00:49:06,266 --> 00:49:07,337
What about you?

1185
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:11,006
Nowadays, I am a bit confused.

1186
00:49:11,007 --> 00:49:12,047
What do you mean?

1187
00:49:13,177 --> 00:49:14,546
(Well...)

1188
00:49:14,547 --> 00:49:15,677
I feel thrilled.

1189
00:49:15,976 --> 00:49:17,845
I mean, I continue to act because it makes me feel thrilled.

1190
00:49:17,846 --> 00:49:19,046
- Okay.
- Yes.

1191
00:49:19,047 --> 00:49:21,817
If a different job thrills me more, I would probably follow my heart.

1192
00:49:21,956 --> 00:49:22,956
Really?

1193
00:49:22,957 --> 00:49:25,885
Acting is what I really wanted to do,

1194
00:49:25,886 --> 00:49:27,527
and I still find it very exciting.

1195
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:31,055
But I've focused too much on my work so far,

1196
00:49:31,056 --> 00:49:34,165
and I think I've been working like a taxi driver.

1197
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:36,865
I'm working so much like I'm being chased.

1198
00:49:36,866 --> 00:49:38,337
- Okay.
- I feel like that.

1199
00:49:40,266 --> 00:49:44,035
How important do you think marriage is...

1200
00:49:44,036 --> 00:49:46,006
in your life?

1201
00:49:46,007 --> 00:49:47,276
Of course, it is important.

1202
00:49:47,277 --> 00:49:48,376
- Is that right?
- It would be nice to be married.

1203
00:49:48,377 --> 00:49:50,076
- Okay.
- It would be really nice, but...

1204
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:52,415
I think I should let it go a bit and see how things go with it.

1205
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:54,217
- With marriage?
- Yes.

1206
00:49:54,817 --> 00:49:57,555
I feel like it wasn't a long ago that I finished the army service,

1207
00:49:57,556 --> 00:50:02,756
but now I feel actually pressured because of my age.

1208
00:50:02,757 --> 00:50:05,027
No, Kwang Kyu. I have a different opinion on this.

1209
00:50:05,366 --> 00:50:06,426
It's not that you should let it go.

1210
00:50:06,427 --> 00:50:08,765
I thought about what is considered as "young".

1211
00:50:08,766 --> 00:50:10,595
- About youth.
- Okay.

1212
00:50:10,596 --> 00:50:14,507
As an actor, we always try to be in-demand and trendy.

1213
00:50:14,737 --> 00:50:16,705
- At least we try to be like that.
- Okay.

1214
00:50:16,706 --> 00:50:17,806
Yes, we do. Right?

1215
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:21,415
So I constantly thought about this idea of being young.

1216
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:22,516
And I concluded that...

1217
00:50:23,877 --> 00:50:28,087
being young is to constantly make yourself unstable and insecure.

1218
00:50:28,357 --> 00:50:29,716
- Okay.
- Well, it makes sense.

1219
00:50:29,717 --> 00:50:30,885
An unstable life.

1220
00:50:30,886 --> 00:50:33,157
So making yourself unstable and insecure...

1221
00:50:33,527 --> 00:50:35,397
means you are continuously trying something.

1222
00:50:35,797 --> 00:50:37,526
Because when you try something, you feel unstable and insecure,

1223
00:50:37,527 --> 00:50:38,926
as you don't know if you will succeed or fail.

1224
00:50:38,927 --> 00:50:41,967
Once you define yourself as, "This is what I should do,"

1225
00:50:42,136 --> 00:50:44,096
or "I'm just like that,"

1226
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:48,806
I feel that now you have no choice but to follow your definition.

1227
00:50:49,206 --> 00:50:51,075
I know I'm younger to lecture you, but that was my conclusion.

1228
00:50:51,076 --> 00:50:52,076
As for me...

1229
00:50:55,476 --> 00:50:56,947
I love it here.

1230
00:50:57,677 --> 00:50:59,846
Even the wind isn't blowing as we're talking about something serious.

1231
00:51:00,846 --> 00:51:02,015
- Yes, that's true.
- I was talking quietly,

1232
00:51:02,016 --> 00:51:04,056
and it's quieter because the wind isn't blowing at all.

1233
00:51:04,516 --> 00:51:05,626
That's incredible.

1234
00:51:05,627 --> 00:51:08,426
(It was windy just a while ago.)

1235
00:51:08,427 --> 00:51:11,796
(No wind)

1236
00:51:11,797 --> 00:51:13,796
- Tell a joke or something.
- Yes.

1237
00:51:13,797 --> 00:51:15,635
- Maybe it will be windy again.
- Yes, tell a joke.

1238
00:51:15,636 --> 00:51:17,365
If you tell a joke,

1239
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:19,705
- And if the wind blows...
- Then it means it's funny.

1240
00:51:19,706 --> 00:51:21,575
If the wind doesn't blow, that means what you said is serious.

1241
00:51:21,576 --> 00:51:23,177
Okay, now tell a joke.

1242
00:51:24,007 --> 00:51:25,906
- Okay, anyone. Say anything.
- Okay, Myoung. You go.

1243
00:51:25,907 --> 00:51:28,046
How long do you think you will work as an actor?

1244
00:51:28,047 --> 00:51:29,047
- Me?
- Yes.

1245
00:51:29,346 --> 00:51:31,845
(Well, I think...)

1246
00:51:31,846 --> 00:51:33,046
See? The wind isn't blowing.

1247
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:34,756
(The wind isn't blowing because he is serious.)

1248
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:36,757
No, it's blowing. Tell us now.

1249
00:51:37,416 --> 00:51:41,186
It's difficult to say these things in front of you all, but if I may...

1250
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:45,265
I think of my occupation as running a marathon.

1251
00:51:45,266 --> 00:51:46,396
Gosh, that's a brilliant thought.

1252
00:51:46,397 --> 00:51:48,467
Because I really hope I can run for a long time.

1253
00:51:48,737 --> 00:51:51,095
It would be nicer if I could be a successful actor,

1254
00:51:51,096 --> 00:51:54,107
but even if I don't make it, I'd still like to continue to act.

1255
00:51:54,706 --> 00:51:57,336
That is the idea that makes me keep going.

1256
00:51:57,337 --> 00:51:59,946
- Even in the future...
- Well, you...

1257
00:51:59,947 --> 00:52:02,476
- Come on, you're telling a joke.
- Look, suddenly it's breezy.

1258
00:52:03,016 --> 00:52:04,376
(When he's talking,)

1259
00:52:04,377 --> 00:52:07,286
(the wind suddenly blows.)

1260
00:52:07,547 --> 00:52:10,256
- How come it's breezy?
- So you're a sprinter, right?

1261
00:52:10,257 --> 00:52:11,257
This is so strange.

1262
00:52:11,487 --> 00:52:13,256
(A sprinter, who can run faster than anyone)

1263
00:52:13,257 --> 00:52:15,595
- So you weren't serious, right?
- You already made it as an actor.

1264
00:52:15,596 --> 00:52:17,656
How much more successful do you want to be?

1265
00:52:17,657 --> 00:52:19,926
The wind was blowing because you were telling a joke.

1266
00:52:19,927 --> 00:52:22,336
You brat. How dare you...

1267
00:52:22,337 --> 00:52:26,205
- How could you lie to us?
- Tell him what you told Jin Goo.

1268
00:52:26,206 --> 00:52:27,967
What kind of adult do you think you will become when you grow up?

1269
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:30,075
- Seriously...
- "When you grow up"?

1270
00:52:30,076 --> 00:52:32,475
- Okay, continue.
- Yes.

1271
00:52:32,476 --> 00:52:35,015
Yesterday, we met...

1272
00:52:35,016 --> 00:52:37,576
- Ms. Kim Young Ok.
- Right.

1273
00:52:38,047 --> 00:52:41,816
I hope I can work as an actor for a long time like she's doing.

1274
00:52:41,817 --> 00:52:43,116
That's my hope for now.

1275
00:52:43,456 --> 00:52:44,956
That's what I am focusing on...

1276
00:52:45,157 --> 00:52:46,226
Gosh, the wind...

1277
00:52:46,386 --> 00:52:48,325
How come the wind is blowing again?

1278
00:52:48,326 --> 00:52:49,857
It's breezy now.

1279
00:52:50,056 --> 00:52:53,526
- Gosh, how nice.
- How come it's...

1280
00:52:53,527 --> 00:52:54,566
- It's pretty windy.
- Gosh.

1281
00:52:54,567 --> 00:52:56,296
- It's suddenly cooler here.
- What's this?

1282
00:52:56,297 --> 00:52:58,236
I'm telling you, this is the shelter that tells the truth.

1283
00:52:58,237 --> 00:52:59,306
(An unpredictable and mysterious gazebo)

1284
00:52:59,737 --> 00:53:02,877
So the wind will decide if it's true or false.

1285
00:53:03,237 --> 00:53:05,447
- Shall we do an experiment?
- Yes, let's do that.

1286
00:53:06,476 --> 00:53:08,276
What is the biggest obstacle of your life right now, Myoung?

1287
00:53:08,277 --> 00:53:09,345
(Myoung's biggest obstacle in life)

1288
00:53:09,346 --> 00:53:10,516
- Excuse me?
- Is it Sung Dong Il?

1289
00:53:11,246 --> 00:53:14,046
Tell us the truth. Say yes now because the wind isn't blowing.

1290
00:53:14,047 --> 00:53:16,116
Answer now. Quickly.

1291
00:53:16,516 --> 00:53:18,756
- Pardon me?
- Come on, the biggest obstacle.

1292
00:53:18,757 --> 00:53:20,426
No, it's definitely not him.

1293
00:53:20,427 --> 00:53:21,956
- He isn't your obstacle?
- No, not at all.

1294
00:53:23,027 --> 00:53:24,027
One...

1295
00:53:24,028 --> 00:53:25,127
(Moment of truth)

1296
00:53:25,366 --> 00:53:26,427
Two...

1297
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:28,196
- Three...
- Three...

1298
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:29,696
(He is also getting nervous.)

1299
00:53:29,697 --> 00:53:30,766
- Four...
- Four...

1300
00:53:32,206 --> 00:53:34,205
- And five.
- Gosh, it's not windy at all.

1301
00:53:34,206 --> 00:53:36,407
He must be serious now. It's not windy at all.

1302
00:53:38,607 --> 00:53:42,446
Then what I said earlier becomes a joke.

1303
00:53:42,447 --> 00:53:44,216
No, it doesn't. It's okay.

1304
00:53:44,217 --> 00:53:47,046
- This is a very mysterious place.
- Yes, indeed.

1305
00:53:47,047 --> 00:53:48,586
Is this the valley of truth?

1306
00:53:48,587 --> 00:53:50,955
- It's the shelter of truth.
- Yes, the shelter of truth.

1307
00:53:50,956 --> 00:53:52,286
- Gosh.
- Yes, the shelter of truth.

1308
00:53:52,927 --> 00:53:54,926
If you tell a lie, the wind will blow, okay?

1309
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:56,826
(Finding Myoung's truth)

1310
00:53:57,527 --> 00:54:00,826
- Do you guys want to ride a bike?
- It's a great idea.

1311
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:03,896
Yes, of course. It's going to be nice to ride a bike here.

1312
00:54:03,897 --> 00:54:05,906
(Five minutes away from the house,)

1313
00:54:05,907 --> 00:54:08,636
(there is a town.)

1314
00:54:09,076 --> 00:54:10,236
(And there is a path for bikes right next to the town.)

1315
00:54:10,237 --> 00:54:13,346
- The bike path is really beautiful.
- Okay.

1316
00:54:14,047 --> 00:54:16,646
We can enjoy the autumn breeze while riding a bike.

1317
00:54:16,647 --> 00:54:17,746
I'd like that.

1318
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:21,987
(This is a place where they can enjoy relaxation.)

1319
00:54:22,386 --> 00:54:24,825
- Gosh, the breeze...
- I love that it's breezy.

1320
00:54:24,826 --> 00:54:26,886
(They are on their way to rent bikes.)

1321
00:54:27,527 --> 00:54:30,927
Dong Il, you have a dragonfly on your cap.

1322
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,696
It's because I know how to live with nature.

1323
00:54:33,697 --> 00:54:34,896
(Dong Il, who is chosen by the dragonfly)

1324
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:36,837
I have a dragonfly on my head.

1325
00:54:37,096 --> 00:54:38,266
It's looking at me.

1326
00:54:39,306 --> 00:54:40,736
(Taking pictures)

1327
00:54:40,737 --> 00:54:42,407
- Don't scare it away.
- What is that?

1328
00:54:42,806 --> 00:54:44,377
Seriously, it's sitting right in the middle.

1329
00:54:44,607 --> 00:54:46,346
Your cap is like its home. It's stuck on your cap.

1330
00:54:47,007 --> 00:54:48,276
Kwang Kyu, did you see?

1331
00:54:48,277 --> 00:54:50,546
This shows how close I am with nature.

1332
00:54:50,547 --> 00:54:51,746
I think the dragonfly is just tired.

1333
00:54:52,817 --> 00:54:53,987
It doesn't want to fly away.

1334
00:54:54,447 --> 00:54:57,285
Dong Il, I think we could take a walk instead of riding a bike.

1335
00:54:57,286 --> 00:54:59,225
- What a nice path.
- Right.

1336
00:54:59,226 --> 00:55:01,225
(The way to ride a bike is shady thanks to the trees.)

1337
00:55:01,226 --> 00:55:03,857
It's a beautiful path with the shade.

1338
00:55:06,027 --> 00:55:10,067
(Taking a walk in the fall)

1339
00:55:10,967 --> 00:55:12,165
We are here.

1340
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:13,805
- Hello.
- Hello.

1341
00:55:13,806 --> 00:55:15,776
- Hello.
- Hello.

1342
00:55:15,777 --> 00:55:17,406
We'd like to rent bikes, please.

1343
00:55:17,407 --> 00:55:19,075
Sure, how many?

1344
00:55:19,076 --> 00:55:20,846
Let's see. Five bikes, please.

1345
00:55:21,346 --> 00:55:23,515
- No, I want a tandem bike.
- Me too.

1346
00:55:23,516 --> 00:55:26,047
Okay, then two tandem bikes for the four of us. You should ride it.

1347
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:27,516
Okay. Let's go.

1348
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:29,657
- Shall we go?
- Are you ready?

1349
00:55:30,157 --> 00:55:31,157
Okay, let's go.

1350
00:55:31,158 --> 00:55:33,426
(Myoung is taking the lead.)

1351
00:55:33,427 --> 00:55:34,656
(Hee Won and Myoung)

1352
00:55:34,657 --> 00:55:36,927
- Seung Hwan, are you all right?
- Yes, Dong Il.

1353
00:55:37,757 --> 00:55:39,397
This is so smooth.

1354
00:55:39,866 --> 00:55:42,837
- I don't think you need to pedal.
- I agree.

1355
00:55:43,237 --> 00:55:44,737
Seriously, it's so smooth.

1356
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:46,606
Come on, Kwang Kyu. Go faster.

1357
00:55:46,607 --> 00:55:48,136
- You're too slow.
- No, they are too slow in front.

1358
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,606
- What?
- Hey, Myoung.

1359
00:55:50,607 --> 00:55:52,047
(Myoung, can you go faster?)

1360
00:55:52,576 --> 00:55:55,015
Gosh, I love the breeze.

1361
00:55:55,016 --> 00:55:56,217
(Myoung is enjoying the breeze.)

1362
00:55:57,076 --> 00:55:59,845
- Gosh, this is great.
- Yes, this is awesome.

1363
00:55:59,846 --> 00:56:00,886
(This bike is nice.)

1364
00:56:01,516 --> 00:56:03,487
Great. Go faster, everyone.

1365
00:56:03,956 --> 00:56:05,127
Yes, go faster.

1366
00:56:07,386 --> 00:56:10,297
- Where the wind blows from - Let's go!

1367
00:56:11,357 --> 00:56:12,927
- Gosh, what is this place?
- It's so beautiful here.

1368
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,165
It's sweet, but it's like snot.

1369
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:17,336
(A tunnel of clematis berries)

1370
00:56:17,337 --> 00:56:18,407
It's like snot.

1371
00:56:20,866 --> 00:56:23,206
(Hooray!)

1372
00:56:23,436 --> 00:56:24,777
(Hooray!)

1373
00:56:25,447 --> 00:56:27,147
Kwang Kyu, I'm coming to get you.

1374
00:56:27,507 --> 00:56:29,975
- I'm coming to get you.
- Don't ride it too fast.

1375
00:56:29,976 --> 00:56:31,745
- Okay.
- Leave him alone.

1376
00:56:31,746 --> 00:56:33,047
(Kwang Kyu, I'm coming to get you.)

1377
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,986
I'm trying not to be outrun.

1378
00:56:35,987 --> 00:56:37,055
Let him go alone.

1379
00:56:37,056 --> 00:56:39,087
(Kwang Kyu feels free as he is a single rider.)

1380
00:56:40,056 --> 00:56:41,697
Ducks.

1381
00:56:42,456 --> 00:56:43,596
Ducks.

1382
00:56:43,996 --> 00:56:47,496
(Seeing the ducks enjoying the sunlight)

1383
00:56:48,027 --> 00:56:51,866
(Singing)

1384
00:56:52,306 --> 00:56:55,177
Gosh, this is great. It's so cool.

1385
00:56:56,377 --> 00:56:58,946
- This is a beautiful path.
- Yes, it is really beautiful.

1386
00:56:58,947 --> 00:57:01,547
- I love the shade as well.
- Yes, I agree.

1387
00:57:01,947 --> 00:57:03,475
I love the wind too.

1388
00:57:03,476 --> 00:57:06,486
(Fully enjoying the autumn breeze)

1389
00:57:06,487 --> 00:57:09,616
(Enjoying the autumn vibe to the fullest)

1390
00:57:10,686 --> 00:57:12,526
This bike is good for a person in my age.

1391
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:14,286
- This is awesome.
- Yes.

1392
00:57:15,596 --> 00:57:19,026
Somehow, he seems like a young bachelor.

1393
00:57:19,027 --> 00:57:20,426
- I think so.
- I know, right?

1394
00:57:20,427 --> 00:57:23,535
(Hee Won and Myoung hasn't passed by yet.)

1395
00:57:23,536 --> 00:57:24,596
I don't think they can keep up with us.

1396
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:29,606
Seriously...

1397
00:57:29,607 --> 00:57:32,706
(Hee Won and Myoung are coming from far behind.)

1398
00:57:33,177 --> 00:57:34,776
(Groaning)

1399
00:57:34,777 --> 00:57:37,975
It's relaxing.

1400
00:57:37,976 --> 00:57:39,586
(Hee Won and Myoung were at the head when they left.)

1401
00:57:39,587 --> 00:57:41,246
My legs are wide open.

1402
00:57:41,857 --> 00:57:44,756
- I can't keep my legs together.
- How come...

1403
00:57:44,757 --> 00:57:45,825
This is how you're riding?

1404
00:57:45,826 --> 00:57:46,926
(Wide open legs)

1405
00:57:46,927 --> 00:57:48,656
Yes, because...

1406
00:57:48,657 --> 00:57:51,966
the handlebar is too low. It hits my knees.

1407
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:53,095
(Hee Won can't keep his legs close together because of the handlebar.)

1408
00:57:53,096 --> 00:57:54,666
This is driving me crazy.

1409
00:57:56,297 --> 00:57:58,196
We're riding in a car on our way back, right?

1410
00:57:58,197 --> 00:57:59,766
(Wide open legs)

1411
00:58:02,306 --> 00:58:05,947
I feel like I'm not riding a bike. I feel like I'm doing stretching.

1412
00:58:06,547 --> 00:58:07,647
I'm serious.

1413
00:58:08,206 --> 00:58:10,016
It's very uncomfortable to ride this bike.

1414
00:58:10,547 --> 00:58:12,547
You don't need to pedal then.

1415
00:58:14,047 --> 00:58:15,415
(The three of them arrived at the turning point first.)

1416
00:58:15,416 --> 00:58:17,516
- Turn around. The path ends here.
- Okay, stop.

1417
00:58:18,456 --> 00:58:20,087
(Squeaking)

1418
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:22,826
- Dong Il, listen to me.
- Okay.

1419
00:58:23,326 --> 00:58:25,626
- Your knees touch the handlebar?
- Do you want me to adjust it?

1420
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,527
I see. You should adjust the seat.

1421
00:58:28,096 --> 00:58:30,766
Hee Won, you take my bike. I'll ride yours with him.

1422
00:58:31,067 --> 00:58:32,166
Okay, you guys can switch.

1423
00:58:32,536 --> 00:58:34,035
I think it's going to be the same with this bike.

1424
00:58:34,036 --> 00:58:35,836
- No, you'll be okay with this bike.
- Or you take the front seat.

1425
00:58:35,837 --> 00:58:37,177
You can adjust this one.

1426
00:58:37,737 --> 00:58:39,647
- It doesn't touch my knees.
- Yes, I told you.

1427
00:58:39,877 --> 00:58:41,606
- Can you sit on it?
- You go ahead and sit on it.

1428
00:58:41,607 --> 00:58:42,976
Adjust the seat if you need.

1429
00:58:43,377 --> 00:58:45,216
Seung Hwan, thank you.

1430
00:58:45,217 --> 00:58:46,386
I'll figure it out somehow.

1431
00:58:47,217 --> 00:58:49,186
Yes, this is ridable.

1432
00:58:49,717 --> 00:58:50,786
Let's go.

1433
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:53,285
- Hold on.
- Okay, go.

1434
00:58:53,286 --> 00:58:54,385
Hold on.

1435
00:58:54,386 --> 00:58:55,955
(This time, Dong Il is riding alone and taking the lead.)

1436
00:58:55,956 --> 00:58:57,757
- Okay, ready?
- Gosh, it touches my knees.

1437
00:58:57,897 --> 00:58:59,765
- Yes, true.
- See? I told you.

1438
00:58:59,766 --> 00:59:00,896
It was okay with the other bike.

1439
00:59:00,897 --> 00:59:02,836
- Let's go.
- Come on, it is...

1440
00:59:02,837 --> 00:59:03,967
Gosh, this is really...

1441
00:59:04,297 --> 00:59:06,165
Finally I feel like I'm riding a bike.

1442
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:08,206
- This is awesome.
- I know.

1443
00:59:08,976 --> 00:59:10,006
(Kwang Kyu and Seung Hwan left the last.)

1444
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:11,536
- Hey, you...
- I don't think I can ride it.

1445
00:59:12,246 --> 00:59:13,876
(Seung Hwan can't even pedal.)

1446
00:59:13,877 --> 00:59:15,717
- You sit in the front then.
- No, you keep going.

1447
00:59:16,217 --> 00:59:18,745
- So I am pedaling alone?
- Good luck.

1448
00:59:18,746 --> 00:59:20,616
This is a very bad bike.

1449
00:59:21,786 --> 00:59:24,157
- Come on...
- Kwang Kyu, keep pedaling.

1450
00:59:24,357 --> 00:59:26,157
- Gosh.
- Speed up.

1451
00:59:26,786 --> 00:59:29,126
This is a problematic bike.

1452
00:59:29,127 --> 00:59:31,866
This is a very bad bike.

1453
00:59:33,397 --> 00:59:35,095
Finally, I can enjoy it now.

1454
00:59:35,096 --> 00:59:36,896
(Laughing)

1455
00:59:36,897 --> 00:59:40,067
Gosh, this is so annoying. I shouldn't have switched it.

1456
00:59:41,067 --> 00:59:46,047
(Groaning)

1457
00:59:46,407 --> 00:59:47,547
I can't take it anymore.

1458
00:59:49,317 --> 00:59:52,147
Dong Il, can we stop after the bridge? He's almost crying.

1459
00:59:52,647 --> 00:59:53,786
Stop.

1460
00:59:54,317 --> 00:59:55,516
Okay, stop.

1461
00:59:55,757 --> 00:59:57,386
He is almost crying.

1462
00:59:58,087 --> 00:59:59,126
I think it's too hard for him.

1463
00:59:59,127 --> 01:00:01,927
- It's really difficult to ride it.
- Switch. You go sit in the back.

1464
01:00:02,127 --> 01:00:04,826
- Seung Hwan, you ride this bike.
- Yes, he should.

1465
01:00:05,266 --> 01:00:06,626
Yes, you go and ride that bike.

1466
01:00:06,627 --> 01:00:07,696
(Hee won sits in the front of the problematic bike.)

1467
01:00:07,697 --> 01:00:08,737
- Okay.
- Yes.

1468
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:10,897
Seung Hwan. Just sit and don't pedal, okay?

1469
01:00:11,297 --> 01:00:13,135
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1470
01:00:13,136 --> 01:00:14,966
- We're leaving.
- Okay.

1471
01:00:14,967 --> 01:00:17,406
Okay. Gosh, wait.

1472
01:00:17,407 --> 01:00:18,407
(Leaving again after switching seats)

1473
01:00:18,408 --> 01:00:20,205
Hey, gosh.

1474
01:00:20,206 --> 01:00:21,706
(Hey, gosh.)

1475
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:25,116
- I don't think it will work.
- You don't know how to ride a bike?

1476
01:00:25,447 --> 01:00:28,346
Hold on. What's wrong with this?

1477
01:00:29,056 --> 01:00:32,857
- This is a dangerous bike.
- I don't think we can ride it.

1478
01:00:33,726 --> 01:00:34,856
My gosh, I feel comfortable now.

1479
01:00:34,857 --> 01:00:38,056
(The three of them are going ahead.)

1480
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,996
I can't hear their voices.

1481
01:00:41,627 --> 01:00:42,796
(Glancing)

1482
01:00:42,797 --> 01:00:44,096
They're not coming.

1483
01:00:44,596 --> 01:00:45,706
- Really?
- Yes.

1484
01:00:46,737 --> 01:00:48,506
Shall we wait for them?

1485
01:00:48,507 --> 01:00:50,805
(They decide to wait for them.)

1486
01:00:50,806 --> 01:00:53,106
(Where are they?)

1487
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,147
Let's go.

1488
01:00:54,746 --> 01:00:56,147
I think Kwang Kyu is walking back.

1489
01:00:56,817 --> 01:00:57,947
Did we come a long way?

1490
01:00:58,846 --> 01:00:59,915
We did, right?

1491
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:01,586
- Yes, we did.
- Over there.

1492
01:01:01,587 --> 01:01:02,615
(The two dropouts are walking.)

1493
01:01:02,616 --> 01:01:04,016
There's a tunnel over there.

1494
01:01:05,527 --> 01:01:06,987
Let's just walk like this.

1495
01:01:08,357 --> 01:01:11,297
(Trudging)

1496
01:01:11,726 --> 01:01:13,096
Why did we rent...

1497
01:01:13,797 --> 01:01:16,237
- two of these bicycles?
- No idea.

1498
01:01:18,337 --> 01:01:19,407
Are they not coming?

1499
01:01:19,607 --> 01:01:21,336
They probably can't ride it. They must be walking.

1500
01:01:21,337 --> 01:01:22,406
(They're waiting endlessly for them.)

1501
01:01:22,407 --> 01:01:23,876
They're really walking.

1502
01:01:23,877 --> 01:01:25,476
They are. You can't ride that.

1503
01:01:26,806 --> 01:01:28,076
Seung Hwan, are you okay?

1504
01:01:28,407 --> 01:01:29,575
(Laughing)

1505
01:01:29,576 --> 01:01:31,115
Dong Il says you guys are frustrating,

1506
01:01:31,116 --> 01:01:32,615
so he wants to ride in the back.

1507
01:01:32,616 --> 01:01:33,885
- Oh, really?
- Here.

1508
01:01:33,886 --> 01:01:35,185
This is really hard.

1509
01:01:35,186 --> 01:01:37,286
- Okay.
- Are you really going to try?

1510
01:01:37,817 --> 01:01:40,386
- Okay.
- Don't get mad at us.

1511
01:01:41,157 --> 01:01:43,095
- I'll take the lead.
- Okay.

1512
01:01:43,096 --> 01:01:45,927
(Will Dong Il be able to endure it?)

1513
01:01:46,596 --> 01:01:48,496
(He checks the distance.)

1514
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,766
Dong Il's legs seem comfortable.

1515
01:01:52,306 --> 01:01:53,607
Your legs don't touch it?

1516
01:01:54,467 --> 01:01:56,976
(Dong Il is peddling with stability.)

1517
01:01:57,136 --> 01:01:59,406
You have to move it back like me.

1518
01:01:59,407 --> 01:02:00,806
- Gosh, Dong Il.
- It's going just fine.

1519
01:02:01,047 --> 01:02:02,647
Dong Il, you're amazing.

1520
01:02:03,116 --> 01:02:04,546
How did you do it?

1521
01:02:04,547 --> 01:02:05,987
- I'm doing just fine.
- You are.

1522
01:02:06,246 --> 01:02:08,717
- Your knees aren't touching?
- They're not.

1523
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:12,126
This is why everyone always says good things...

1524
01:02:12,127 --> 01:02:14,026
- about Sung Dong Il.
- about Sung Dong Il.

1525
01:02:14,027 --> 01:02:16,197
(This is why everyone always says good things about Sung Dong Il.)

1526
01:02:17,326 --> 01:02:19,365
(Thanks to the stability created by Dong Il...)

1527
01:02:19,366 --> 01:02:20,826
We're gaining speed.

1528
01:02:23,766 --> 01:02:29,576
(Everyone is having a fun time.)

1529
01:02:31,076 --> 01:02:32,975
This place is so picturesque.

1530
01:02:32,976 --> 01:02:35,317
(They go through the tunnel of clematis berries...)

1531
01:02:35,476 --> 01:02:36,745
(and get greeted by the blue skies.)

1532
01:02:36,746 --> 01:02:38,915
- We're going downhill now.
- Downhill.

1533
01:02:38,916 --> 01:02:41,015
- Downhill.
- Go down comfortably.

1534
01:02:41,016 --> 01:02:42,356
(Their bicycle trip is coming to an end.)

1535
01:02:42,357 --> 01:02:44,186
Go down comfortably.

1536
01:02:45,286 --> 01:02:46,956
Is the market close to here?

1537
01:02:47,857 --> 01:02:50,095
Let's buy some twisted donuts for Seung Hwan and go.

1538
01:02:50,096 --> 01:02:51,556
(They go into town to get snacks to fill their hungry stomachs.)

1539
01:02:51,956 --> 01:02:53,526
Can you put a little bit of sugar on the plain ones?

1540
01:02:53,527 --> 01:02:55,897
- Give us six donuts with sugar...
- Okay.

1541
01:02:56,366 --> 01:02:57,636
and six corn dogs.

1542
01:02:58,266 --> 01:03:00,967
Can you also give us two vegetable croquettes?

1543
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:04,075
It's hot. It just came out.

1544
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:06,407
- Where? Oh, those are donuts.
- Right.

1545
01:03:06,846 --> 01:03:08,946
Here. Thank you.

1546
01:03:08,947 --> 01:03:10,317
- Enjoy.
- We will.

1547
01:03:11,947 --> 01:03:14,316
Let's have the twisted donuts as an appetizer...

1548
01:03:14,317 --> 01:03:16,317
- and eat our meal after.
- Okay.

1549
01:03:16,686 --> 01:03:18,285
Do you want to dip the twisted donuts in the honey?

1550
01:03:18,286 --> 01:03:19,656
I was thinking that.

1551
01:03:19,657 --> 01:03:22,296
I didn't say anything because I was afraid you'd say something.

1552
01:03:22,297 --> 01:03:23,796
You came here...

1553
01:03:23,797 --> 01:03:25,896
and ate an entire pot of honey during the past two days.

1554
01:03:25,897 --> 01:03:29,067
(The special buckwheat honey made by their neighbors, the honeybees.)

1555
01:03:29,697 --> 01:03:30,836
(He brings out a bowl of honey.)

1556
01:03:30,837 --> 01:03:32,907
Let's try this.

1557
01:03:33,467 --> 01:03:36,237
We had breakfast really early, so...

1558
01:03:36,507 --> 01:03:42,776
(Dong Il puts a lot of buckwheat honey on it.)

1559
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,547
Try it with and without the honey.

1560
01:03:45,147 --> 01:03:46,416
This is really good.

1561
01:03:47,947 --> 01:03:50,456
Try it with and without the honey.

1562
01:03:51,116 --> 01:03:52,686
- It's really good.
- But...

1563
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:56,157
This honey is a delicacy.

1564
01:03:56,257 --> 01:03:57,556
- Now that I've had it.
- Isn't it?

1565
01:03:58,056 --> 01:04:02,536
(He puts on a lot of the delicacy.)

1566
01:04:03,467 --> 01:04:04,567
(Exclaiming)

1567
01:04:06,866 --> 01:04:08,067
Gosh, this is good.

1568
01:04:10,476 --> 01:04:11,736
I keep going back for it.

1569
01:04:11,737 --> 01:04:13,406
Gosh, this is good.

1570
01:04:13,407 --> 01:04:15,377
(They can't stop eating the snacks from the market and honey.)

1571
01:04:15,846 --> 01:04:16,947
It's really good.

1572
01:04:17,217 --> 01:04:18,515
(Seung Hwan puts some ketchup on the corn dog and takes a bite.)

1573
01:04:18,516 --> 01:04:21,386
Gosh, you are an aggressive eater.

1574
01:04:23,616 --> 01:04:26,326
(He takes two big bites.)

1575
01:04:27,157 --> 01:04:29,927
(He finished the whole thing in three bites.)

1576
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:36,765
(A black hole where food goes in endlessly.)

1577
01:04:36,766 --> 01:04:38,136
(Amazed)

1578
01:04:38,467 --> 01:04:39,706
How many meals do you eat in a day?

1579
01:04:40,607 --> 01:04:42,067
I eat 2 meals, no 3.

1580
01:04:42,507 --> 01:04:44,135
I eat three meals for breakfast.

1581
01:04:44,136 --> 01:04:45,406
(He has three meals for breakfast.)

1582
01:04:45,407 --> 01:04:46,446
(Laughing)

1583
01:04:46,447 --> 01:04:47,447
Right.

1584
01:04:47,947 --> 01:04:50,547
(Smiling innocently)

1585
01:04:51,317 --> 01:04:52,746
Oh, my. It's a tornado.

1586
01:04:54,947 --> 01:04:57,087
(Exclaiming)

1587
01:04:58,416 --> 01:04:59,427
Okay.

1588
01:05:00,286 --> 01:05:02,956
I must've looked pathetic. Let's do it again.

1589
01:05:03,496 --> 01:05:04,956
- Do it again.
- Say "It's a tornado" again.

1590
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:07,526
Oh, my. It's a tornado.

1591
01:05:07,527 --> 01:05:08,527
(Acting dignified)

1592
01:05:09,067 --> 01:05:11,196
(He just ended up teasing the youngest member.)

1593
01:05:11,197 --> 01:05:13,607
That was good. That one was good.

1594
01:05:14,237 --> 01:05:15,936
(Laughing)

1595
01:05:16,677 --> 01:05:18,805
How does it get windy and cold...

1596
01:05:18,806 --> 01:05:21,046
and then really hot again?

1597
01:05:21,047 --> 01:05:23,746
(In autumn, they say even horses get fat.)

1598
01:05:24,346 --> 01:05:26,146
Let's start moving.

1599
01:05:26,147 --> 01:05:27,246
(Since they've increased their appetites with the donuts...)

1600
01:05:27,987 --> 01:05:29,016
Right, then.

1601
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:31,087
So what are you going to make, Seung Hwan?

1602
01:05:32,226 --> 01:05:33,326
Buckwheat noodles with soy sauce and perilla oil.

1603
01:05:33,587 --> 01:05:34,685
- Buckwheat noodles?
- Yes.

1604
01:05:34,686 --> 01:05:35,995
(Chewing)

1605
01:05:35,996 --> 01:05:38,095
You're supposed to roast the perilla seeds before making oil,

1606
01:05:38,096 --> 01:05:40,665
but because I like perilla oil, my mother-in-law harvests it...

1607
01:05:40,666 --> 01:05:43,595
and makes non-roasted perilla oil. I brought it with me.

1608
01:05:43,596 --> 01:05:45,066
I heard the buckwheat is good here,

1609
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:46,935
- Gosh.
- so let's have...

1610
01:05:46,936 --> 01:05:49,976
buckwheat noodles with soy sauce and perilla oil for lunch.

1611
01:05:51,306 --> 01:05:53,476
Buckwheat noodles with soy sauce and perilla oil.

1612
01:05:54,647 --> 01:05:57,576
(To the fragrant and chewy buckwheat noodles,)

1613
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:01,147
(he's going to add savoriness with raw perilla oil.)

1614
01:06:01,746 --> 01:06:05,087
(How delicious will the noodles with soy sauce and perilla oil be?)

1615
01:06:06,027 --> 01:06:07,555
(Hold on. I can't stay still either.)

1616
01:06:07,556 --> 01:06:08,627
Wait.

1617
01:06:09,596 --> 01:06:11,595
What are you doing to do?

1618
01:06:11,596 --> 01:06:15,426
I'm going to make some seasoned deodeok.

1619
01:06:15,427 --> 01:06:16,966
Gosh, that sounds good.

1620
01:06:16,967 --> 01:06:19,205
(Buckwheat noodles with soy sauce and perilla oil, seasoned deodeok)

1621
01:06:19,206 --> 01:06:20,765
It won't take long to make.

1622
01:06:20,766 --> 01:06:22,066
- Oh, really?
- It'll take about 15 minutes.

1623
01:06:22,067 --> 01:06:23,135
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1624
01:06:23,136 --> 01:06:24,676
But you have to cook the noodles too.

1625
01:06:24,677 --> 01:06:27,746
Including the time to cook the noodles andante.

1626
01:06:29,047 --> 01:06:30,216
(It's not andante. It's al dente.)

1627
01:06:30,217 --> 01:06:31,816
What does andante mean?

1628
01:06:31,817 --> 01:06:35,685
It's when you cook it to make it a bit chewy...

1629
01:06:35,686 --> 01:06:37,555
so that it seems like it's a bit raw.

1630
01:06:37,556 --> 01:06:41,356
Is "andante" fast or slow?

1631
01:06:41,357 --> 01:06:42,696
What was andante again?

1632
01:06:42,697 --> 01:06:45,225
(Andante is a little slow)

1633
01:06:45,226 --> 01:06:46,296
Is it a little slow?

1634
01:06:46,297 --> 01:06:48,096
(Largo and allegro is)

1635
01:06:48,226 --> 01:06:49,397
- What is this?
- Get faster

1636
01:06:49,697 --> 01:06:51,967
Oh, right. That's andante.

1637
01:06:52,666 --> 01:06:54,106
(He seems entranced as he sings the song that helped him memorize it.)

1638
01:06:54,107 --> 01:06:55,407
- Get faster - Is that how you memorized it?

1639
01:06:56,076 --> 01:06:57,806
You remember things like this longer.

1640
01:06:58,576 --> 01:07:01,147
- When you memorize it as a song.
- Right. That's why to this day...

1641
01:07:01,547 --> 01:07:02,745
I remember...

1642
01:07:02,746 --> 01:07:04,245
(Fruit fly)

1643
01:07:04,246 --> 01:07:07,086
Must you steal everyone's attention when your senior is talking?

1644
01:07:07,087 --> 01:07:08,716
- Goodness.
- I was afraid you'd get bit.

1645
01:07:08,717 --> 01:07:10,056
Goodness.

1646
01:07:10,286 --> 01:07:12,786
(How cute. Thanks a lot.)

1647
01:07:13,857 --> 01:07:15,456
I'll get out of the way while you cook...

1648
01:07:16,556 --> 01:07:17,596
and go pick chestnuts.

1649
01:07:18,027 --> 01:07:19,897
Be careful around the bees.

1650
01:07:21,027 --> 01:07:22,067
Let's go.

1651
01:07:23,967 --> 01:07:28,106
(We shouldn't get stung by a bee)

1652
01:07:28,107 --> 01:07:29,975
(Chestnut)

1653
01:07:29,976 --> 01:07:32,647
(Chestnut)

1654
01:07:33,277 --> 01:07:35,917
(Why do these guys keep singing such weird songs?)

1655
01:07:36,876 --> 01:07:39,246
(They arrive at the bottom of the chestnut tree...)

1656
01:07:39,247 --> 01:07:41,247
(while singing a weird song.)

1657
01:07:41,987 --> 01:07:43,416
Seung Hwan, let's get started.

1658
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:44,457
Shall we?

1659
01:07:45,957 --> 01:07:49,096
Gosh, you guys have everything.

1660
01:07:50,027 --> 01:07:51,456
What do you need?

1661
01:07:51,457 --> 01:07:53,766
This is where I put everything I brought.

1662
01:07:54,726 --> 01:07:57,667
(Let's see.)

1663
01:07:59,306 --> 01:08:02,167
(First he adds plenty of soy sauce.)

1664
01:08:03,336 --> 01:08:07,107
I brought some really delicious soy sauce.

1665
01:08:07,747 --> 01:08:11,016
It goes really well with rice.

1666
01:08:11,846 --> 01:08:15,216
(Next...)

1667
01:08:16,157 --> 01:08:18,056
It would be good with some sugar or oligosaccharide.

1668
01:08:18,256 --> 01:08:19,456
- Add some honey.
- Should I add some honey?

1669
01:08:19,457 --> 01:08:20,555
You should add some honey.

1670
01:08:20,556 --> 01:08:23,126
- Gosh, today...
- You should add honey.

1671
01:08:23,497 --> 01:08:25,156
Gosh, this is going to be really good.

1672
01:08:25,157 --> 01:08:26,567
(He adjusts the balance of sweet and salty with buckwheat honey.)

1673
01:08:27,197 --> 01:08:29,766
(Exclaiming)

1674
01:08:30,336 --> 01:08:32,835
(He adds raw perilla oil which is extremely savory,)

1675
01:08:32,836 --> 01:08:35,306
(a magical special soy sauce,)

1676
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:38,476
(and buckwheat honey.)

1677
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:40,247
Nice. That's right.

1678
01:08:40,876 --> 01:08:41,947
This is perfect.

1679
01:08:42,947 --> 01:08:46,016
(All he needs to do is boil the noodles now.)

1680
01:08:46,716 --> 01:08:49,317
Do you have to hammer the deodeok?

1681
01:08:49,756 --> 01:08:51,486
Yes, a little bit.

1682
01:08:51,487 --> 01:08:54,287
Bring the deodeok and the cutting board.

1683
01:08:54,556 --> 01:08:55,957
Where is deodeok?

1684
01:08:57,827 --> 01:08:58,856
Take it right out.

1685
01:08:58,857 --> 01:09:00,295
(Looking)

1686
01:09:00,296 --> 01:09:01,366
Take it right out.

1687
01:09:01,367 --> 01:09:02,595
Deodeok.

1688
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:03,965
(He takes out the deodeok as well.)

1689
01:09:03,966 --> 01:09:06,737
Do you know where the wooden rolling pin we used yesterday went?

1690
01:09:08,037 --> 01:09:09,107
Over here.

1691
01:09:09,636 --> 01:09:11,636
- Here it is.
- Everything's here.

1692
01:09:13,077 --> 01:09:15,147
Do we have to flatten the deodeok?

1693
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:18,046
- Just hit it slightly.
- Okay.

1694
01:09:18,747 --> 01:09:21,846
(Okay. I'll try it.)

1695
01:09:22,556 --> 01:09:25,857
(Hit it slightly. Make it flat.)

1696
01:09:27,926 --> 01:09:30,457
(Is this right?)

1697
01:09:31,157 --> 01:09:34,327
(He makes it flat so that it gets seasoned well.)

1698
01:09:37,067 --> 01:09:39,067
(A meticulous retouch)

1699
01:09:40,737 --> 01:09:42,435
- Gosh. Yes, put it in.
- This...

1700
01:09:42,436 --> 01:09:45,206
- I can't hate you, my brother.
- Did I do a good job?

1701
01:09:45,207 --> 01:09:47,147
(Giggling)

1702
01:09:47,907 --> 01:09:50,976
(He gains confidence after the compliment and hits it hard.)

1703
01:09:51,516 --> 01:09:55,516
(He sounds happy as he hammers it.)

1704
01:09:56,256 --> 01:09:58,657
(He brings over a big piece of deodeok.)

1705
01:09:59,226 --> 01:10:02,256
(What should I do about this?)

1706
01:10:03,126 --> 01:10:06,126
(He begins hitting it.)

1707
01:10:06,796 --> 01:10:09,766
(It's too thick to get flat.)

1708
01:10:10,067 --> 01:10:12,567
(What? Look at this guy.)

1709
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:16,577
(Let's see who ends up winning.)

1710
01:10:17,577 --> 01:10:20,607
(Aren't you going to get flat?)

1711
01:10:20,806 --> 01:10:23,016
(What the...)

1712
01:10:23,417 --> 01:10:26,716
(The deodeok is smashed into pieces.)

1713
01:10:27,917 --> 01:10:30,487
(Ragged)

1714
01:10:32,556 --> 01:10:34,255
Were you thinking about me while doing it?

1715
01:10:34,256 --> 01:10:35,896
You beat it to a pulp.

1716
01:10:35,897 --> 01:10:36,957
No, it's not that...

1717
01:10:38,256 --> 01:10:40,765
(I should hit it more softly.)

1718
01:10:40,766 --> 01:10:43,095
I'll get out of your way in a second.

1719
01:10:43,096 --> 01:10:44,836
(Chef Sung begins making the gochuchang sauce for the deodeok.)

1720
01:10:47,067 --> 01:10:49,737
(I need to make it delicious.)

1721
01:10:50,506 --> 01:10:54,077
(He cuts up the scallions, onions, and peppers.)

1722
01:10:55,546 --> 01:10:57,015
(He uses the skills of an expert to chop it up finely.)

1723
01:10:57,016 --> 01:10:58,317
Gosh, that's no joke.

1724
01:10:59,787 --> 01:11:02,287
(Amazed)

1725
01:11:03,016 --> 01:11:05,756
(He adds a spoonful of minced garlic.)

1726
01:11:07,857 --> 01:11:09,725
It's really about the touch.

1727
01:11:09,726 --> 01:11:11,255
You're just doing everything with your hands.

1728
01:11:11,256 --> 01:11:13,966
What's the point of measuring it all out?

1729
01:11:14,266 --> 01:11:15,595
You just do it.

1730
01:11:15,596 --> 01:11:17,136
(House on Wheels is all about the touch!)

1731
01:11:17,266 --> 01:11:18,737
I'm using soy sauce for soup for this.

1732
01:11:18,936 --> 01:11:20,167
Soy sauce for soup

1733
01:11:21,107 --> 01:11:22,736
Gosh, this is...

1734
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,435
- We have to add some honey.
- The honey steals the show.

1735
01:11:24,436 --> 01:11:27,606
Right? Doesn't it?

1736
01:11:27,607 --> 01:11:29,976
(He adds some gochujang made with Korean rice.)

1737
01:11:31,077 --> 01:11:34,617
(Chef Sung finishes making his seasoning.)

1738
01:11:34,716 --> 01:11:36,685
You made it so easily.

1739
01:11:36,686 --> 01:11:37,686
(He's amazed.)

1740
01:11:38,556 --> 01:11:39,556
Me?

1741
01:11:39,726 --> 01:11:41,225
You were a chef in Bupyeong.

1742
01:11:41,226 --> 01:11:43,226
(The dignity of a former owner of a cart bar)

1743
01:11:43,457 --> 01:11:44,926
I need to finish before my customers leave.

1744
01:11:45,697 --> 01:11:47,196
It's almost ready!

1745
01:11:47,197 --> 01:11:49,635
Hold on! I'm grilling it right now!

1746
01:11:49,636 --> 01:11:51,336
It's almost ready!

1747
01:11:52,436 --> 01:11:53,806
- When you're making the sauce.
- Exactly.

1748
01:11:54,067 --> 01:11:55,606
Hold on! It's almost ready!

1749
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:56,607
(Chef Sung's business secret was his speed and acting.)

1750
01:11:56,608 --> 01:11:58,875
You could have another drink as you wait.

1751
01:11:58,876 --> 01:12:00,346
(Gosh, I almost fell for it.)

1752
01:12:01,806 --> 01:12:02,947
We're back.

1753
01:12:03,976 --> 01:12:05,675
Are you done already?

1754
01:12:05,676 --> 01:12:07,287
(They return after picking a bunch of chestnuts.)

1755
01:12:07,886 --> 01:12:11,556
(We're back.)

1756
01:12:11,857 --> 01:12:14,657
(Can you give me a compliment?)

1757
01:12:16,296 --> 01:12:18,125
- What?
- Sorry?

1758
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:19,197
What?

1759
01:12:19,726 --> 01:12:21,866
- Want to do this?
- What?

1760
01:12:21,867 --> 01:12:23,567
(Cynical)

1761
01:12:23,697 --> 01:12:25,435
- Don't you have anything to do?
- No, I...

1762
01:12:25,436 --> 01:12:26,737
(No, never mind.)

1763
01:12:28,436 --> 01:12:32,647
(He finishes beating the deodeok in a cynical way.)

1764
01:12:33,647 --> 01:12:36,747
(Chef Sung goes out with a bottle of sesame oil.)

1765
01:12:37,476 --> 01:12:38,617
Come here, my brother.

1766
01:12:39,546 --> 01:12:41,446
Put some of this on it.

1767
01:12:41,447 --> 01:12:43,386
(Meticulous)

1768
01:12:43,787 --> 01:12:45,715
You usually grill it with sesame oil first,

1769
01:12:45,716 --> 01:12:47,585
- then put the gochujang sauce on?
- If you grill it once like that,

1770
01:12:47,586 --> 01:12:49,396
it's savory and delicious.

1771
01:12:49,397 --> 01:12:50,626
(You can prevent from burning and increase the savoriness.)

1772
01:12:51,256 --> 01:12:54,067
(He pours some sesame oil.)

1773
01:12:55,497 --> 01:12:58,935
(He puts some sesame oil onto the heated wok.)

1774
01:12:58,936 --> 01:13:00,805
It's nice to have such a big pan.

1775
01:13:00,806 --> 01:13:02,005
We can grill all of them at once.

1776
01:13:02,006 --> 01:13:04,806
Doesn't it smell amazing?

1777
01:13:06,176 --> 01:13:07,875
It's the smell of grilled deodeok.

1778
01:13:07,876 --> 01:13:09,647
(He begins drooling over the smell of the deodeok and sesame oil.)

1779
01:13:09,846 --> 01:13:13,446
Make it nice and golden.

1780
01:13:13,447 --> 01:13:15,546
Yes, we're grilling it slightly.

1781
01:13:16,556 --> 01:13:18,055
The grilled deodeok looks delicious.

1782
01:13:18,056 --> 01:13:19,186
(Drooling)

1783
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:21,726
Gosh, Dong Il is an incredible cook.

1784
01:13:22,487 --> 01:13:23,656
He's fast too.

1785
01:13:23,657 --> 01:13:25,357
(He is.)

1786
01:13:25,897 --> 01:13:27,595
Let's put the sauce on it and grill it all at once.

1787
01:13:27,596 --> 01:13:29,296
- Where?
- Gosh, my back.

1788
01:13:30,867 --> 01:13:31,896
If you put the sauce on...

1789
01:13:31,897 --> 01:13:32,936
(It's time to put on the gochujang sauce.)

1790
01:13:33,466 --> 01:13:37,237
(The visual and the sound are both perfect.)

1791
01:13:38,476 --> 01:13:40,606
We only need to cook it slightly since we already grilled it once.

1792
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,046
(We only need to cook it slightly since we already grilled it once.)

1793
01:13:42,647 --> 01:13:46,186
(It's cooking as he's putting on the sauce.)

1794
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,317
Flip it. The two of you need to flip it now.

1795
01:13:51,817 --> 01:13:55,326
(They add a smokey flavor as they flip it over.)

1796
01:13:55,327 --> 01:13:57,856
The color of this...

1797
01:13:57,857 --> 01:13:59,666
already looks delicious.

1798
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:00,697
Right?

1799
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:03,396
- Nice.
- It's ready now.

1800
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:04,796
(It's cooked to perfection.)

1801
01:14:05,237 --> 01:14:08,306
(The grilled deodeok is nice and spicy with Chef Sung's sauce.)

1802
01:14:08,907 --> 01:14:11,207
(They're almost done.)

1803
01:14:11,707 --> 01:14:14,247
Shall I boil the noodles?

1804
01:14:18,546 --> 01:14:21,287
(The pot is extremely quiet.)

1805
01:14:21,647 --> 01:14:24,487
(I put it on the stove ages ago, so why won't it boil?)

1806
01:14:24,686 --> 01:14:26,787
(It can even be touched with his bare hands.)

1807
01:14:27,426 --> 01:14:29,857
(What's the problem?)

1808
01:14:30,126 --> 01:14:32,926
(The problem is the weak fire.)

1809
01:14:33,726 --> 01:14:36,766
(How much longer will the grilled deodeok take?)

1810
01:14:37,197 --> 01:14:38,696
Are we almost done?

1811
01:14:38,697 --> 01:14:40,907
- Yes. It's done.
- Right. It's done.

1812
01:14:41,107 --> 01:14:43,335
It's game over now.

1813
01:14:43,336 --> 01:14:44,707
(The grilled gochujang deodeok is done.)

1814
01:14:45,006 --> 01:14:47,006
Gosh, they're almost done. I'm in trouble.

1815
01:14:48,407 --> 01:14:51,046
(Please start boiling.)

1816
01:14:51,516 --> 01:14:53,786
(Laughing)

1817
01:14:53,787 --> 01:14:54,947
Gosh, it won't boil.

1818
01:14:58,086 --> 01:14:59,586
What's the problem?

1819
01:15:00,657 --> 01:15:03,956
(Can I take a look?)

1820
01:15:03,957 --> 01:15:05,027
Is something wrong with this?

1821
01:15:05,556 --> 01:15:08,725
Maybe it's running out of gas.

1822
01:15:08,726 --> 01:15:10,335
It looks like the fire's weak.

1823
01:15:10,336 --> 01:15:12,135
I'll try turning this one on.

1824
01:15:12,136 --> 01:15:13,166
(Fire)

1825
01:15:13,167 --> 01:15:15,107
It should look like this, but the sound of that...

1826
01:15:16,407 --> 01:15:18,436
- You're right.
- The fire is weak.

1827
01:15:18,876 --> 01:15:21,277
(You're really...)

1828
01:15:21,476 --> 01:15:23,875
- Thank you! I knew it!
- Okay.

1829
01:15:23,876 --> 01:15:26,686
This is why everyone always says how great Gong Myoung is.

1830
01:15:28,117 --> 01:15:31,015
If it weren't for you, we wouldn't get to eat.

1831
01:15:31,016 --> 01:15:32,256
We would've waited forever.

1832
01:15:33,027 --> 01:15:35,555
(Boil.)

1833
01:15:35,556 --> 01:15:37,626
There's no lid. My goodness.

1834
01:15:38,027 --> 01:15:40,126
- We should have a lid.
- I didn't see one.

1835
01:15:41,397 --> 01:15:44,636
No way. Who took our lid?

1836
01:15:45,537 --> 01:15:47,436
(I didn't see it.)

1837
01:15:47,707 --> 01:15:49,305
- It's right here.
- It is? Where?

1838
01:15:49,306 --> 01:15:50,676
(He finds it right away.)

1839
01:15:51,407 --> 01:15:52,737
My gosh.

1840
01:15:53,947 --> 01:15:56,247
You're really...

1841
01:15:56,716 --> 01:15:58,715
Thank you. You saved me.

1842
01:15:58,716 --> 01:16:01,487
This is why everyone always says how great Gong Myoung is.

1843
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:04,225
Put it in!

1844
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,596
(He finally adds the noodles with the help of the youngest.)

1845
01:16:06,325 --> 01:16:10,796
(He adds two fistfuls of noodles so that there's plenty.)

1846
01:16:11,936 --> 01:16:13,865
(Boiling)

1847
01:16:14,506 --> 01:16:17,235
(It should be cooked now.)

1848
01:16:19,105 --> 01:16:22,405
Nice. That's right.

1849
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:27,046
(He makes it nice and chewy by rinsing it in cold water.)

1850
01:16:28,445 --> 01:16:29,485
What?

1851
01:16:30,016 --> 01:16:31,484
(Exclaiming)

1852
01:16:31,485 --> 01:16:32,516
There's no more water.

1853
01:16:34,325 --> 01:16:35,725
(What should I do?)

1854
01:16:35,726 --> 01:16:38,255
(I need to save it somehow.)

1855
01:16:38,256 --> 01:16:40,365
Youngest! Can you come here...

1856
01:16:42,466 --> 01:16:44,336
It will taste great with some rice.

1857
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:45,596
We have no choice.

1858
01:16:46,966 --> 01:16:48,204
That's enough.

1859
01:16:48,205 --> 01:16:49,265
(The youngest saves the buckwheat noodles with his wits.)

1860
01:16:49,266 --> 01:16:50,506
You're so smart.

1861
01:16:52,205 --> 01:16:54,146
(He even adds ice.)

1862
01:16:54,546 --> 01:16:56,575
(Gosh, my hands are cold.)

1863
01:16:57,976 --> 01:17:00,846
(Plenty)

1864
01:17:01,315 --> 01:17:02,744
I just need to mix it now.

1865
01:17:02,745 --> 01:17:03,955
(He adds the sauce.)

1866
01:17:04,915 --> 01:17:08,126
(He mixes it with one hand.)

1867
01:17:09,056 --> 01:17:12,495
(He mixes it with two hands.)

1868
01:17:13,726 --> 01:17:15,125
(He hands him some bowls.)

1869
01:17:15,126 --> 01:17:16,195
Thank you.

1870
01:17:17,865 --> 01:17:20,766
Goodness. We're almost done.

1871
01:17:22,165 --> 01:17:23,404
We can go out and eat now.

1872
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:25,575
(He gets the special ingredient last.)

1873
01:17:26,546 --> 01:17:29,444
- Before you eat it...
- Is there a special way to eat it?

1874
01:17:29,445 --> 01:17:31,274
No. I need to do a performance with the perilla oil.

1875
01:17:31,275 --> 01:17:32,345
(It's time for the raw perilla oil to go in.)

1876
01:17:32,346 --> 01:17:34,484
You just need to add a spoonful of this.

1877
01:17:34,485 --> 01:17:37,114
(A special ingredient that Seung Hwan prepared for the family)

1878
01:17:37,115 --> 01:17:38,614
It was harvested by my mother-in-law,

1879
01:17:38,615 --> 01:17:40,126
and it wasn't roasted.

1880
01:17:40,485 --> 01:17:41,654
- It's really good.
- Your mother?

1881
01:17:41,655 --> 01:17:43,395
- My mother-in-law made it herself.
- Your mother-in-law.

1882
01:17:43,396 --> 01:17:44,655
(It's very precious.)

1883
01:17:45,195 --> 01:17:46,766
Gosh, the smell of it...

1884
01:17:47,165 --> 01:17:48,665
It smells amazing.

1885
01:17:49,025 --> 01:17:50,836
It's amazing.

1886
01:17:51,065 --> 01:17:52,095
It looks really good.

1887
01:17:52,096 --> 01:17:53,405
(It looks good.)

1888
01:17:53,705 --> 01:17:56,164
It looks amazing.

1889
01:17:56,165 --> 01:17:57,176
(You're adding that much?)

1890
01:17:57,735 --> 01:17:59,436
What should we do about that?

1891
01:18:00,205 --> 01:18:02,075
Goodness.

1892
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:04,546
- It looks really good.
- It really does.

1893
01:18:05,516 --> 01:18:07,215
Gosh, the grilled deodeok looks amazing.

1894
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:08,516
(The grilled deodeok made by the brothers...)

1895
01:18:09,115 --> 01:18:12,354
(completes the menu for their savory lunch.)

1896
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:14,025
Gosh, that looks delicious.

1897
01:18:15,655 --> 01:18:17,825
Have a seat.

1898
01:18:18,325 --> 01:18:19,395
Thank you for the food!

1899
01:18:19,396 --> 01:18:20,396
(Everyone gathers at the smell of the perilla oil.)

1900
01:18:20,397 --> 01:18:23,095
Seung Hwan's mother-in-law gave us this...

1901
01:18:23,096 --> 01:18:25,335
- Perilla oil and buckwheat noodles.
- Perilla oil.

1902
01:18:25,336 --> 01:18:27,636
- This is good.
- It is.

1903
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:31,635
He rinsed it well in ice water, so it'll be nice and chewy.

1904
01:18:31,636 --> 01:18:32,905
(Exclaiming)

1905
01:18:33,245 --> 01:18:36,715
If you like perilla oil and you want more, you can add it.

1906
01:18:36,716 --> 01:18:37,744
Okay.

1907
01:18:37,745 --> 01:18:41,645
(He takes a big bite of noodles.)

1908
01:18:41,646 --> 01:18:42,646
(Exclaiming)

1909
01:18:44,115 --> 01:18:46,784
(The youngest also takes a big bite.)

1910
01:18:46,785 --> 01:18:47,855
(Exclaiming)

1911
01:18:48,226 --> 01:18:51,025
(The savoriness fills his mouth in one bite.)

1912
01:18:52,155 --> 01:18:56,735
(Seung Hwan inhales the noodles.)

1913
01:18:58,865 --> 01:19:00,005
(My mother-in-law's perilla oil is the best.)

1914
01:19:00,006 --> 01:19:01,905
You don't need any side dishes.

1915
01:19:04,476 --> 01:19:05,476
(Hee Won takes a small bite.)

1916
01:19:05,477 --> 01:19:07,405
Doesn't the deodeok look really good?

1917
01:19:10,376 --> 01:19:13,686
(He looks around.)

1918
01:19:13,945 --> 01:19:15,715
(Chewing)

1919
01:19:15,716 --> 01:19:18,355
(Tilting)

1920
01:19:18,716 --> 01:19:22,985
(Why? Does it taste bad?)

1921
01:19:24,495 --> 01:19:28,466
(He takes another bite.)

1922
01:19:31,136 --> 01:19:32,735
This is really good.

1923
01:19:33,035 --> 01:19:35,865
Gosh, this is really good.

1924
01:19:36,436 --> 01:19:39,074
I thought it would taste oily because of all the perilla oil.

1925
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:40,145
- Isn't it really savory?
- It is.

1926
01:19:40,146 --> 01:19:41,475
- It's really savory.
- It's really savory.

1927
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:42,845
How can it be so savory without being roasted?

1928
01:19:42,846 --> 01:19:44,716
- I know.
- The perilla oil...

1929
01:19:45,216 --> 01:19:46,314
It's good.

1930
01:19:46,315 --> 01:19:48,346
The taste of the perilla oil...

1931
01:19:48,445 --> 01:19:50,585
(The savory flavors that spread as you chew is amazing.)

1932
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:52,085
It's amazing.

1933
01:19:52,086 --> 01:19:54,285
- How is it so savory?
- I know.

1934
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:55,626
This perilla oil...

1935
01:19:56,086 --> 01:19:58,725
She harvested it herself, got the seeds,

1936
01:19:58,726 --> 01:19:59,766
and squeezed them.

1937
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:02,494
It tastes very savory.

1938
01:20:02,495 --> 01:20:04,836
It's very subtle. It's not overpowering.

1939
01:20:05,466 --> 01:20:06,864
- It's different from other ones.
- It is.

1940
01:20:06,865 --> 01:20:08,265
I can't eat the store-bought ones now.

1941
01:20:08,266 --> 01:20:09,774
How much is a bottle of this?

1942
01:20:09,775 --> 01:20:10,775
(So how much is a bottle of this?)

1943
01:20:10,836 --> 01:20:11,975
(He completely fell in love with it.)

1944
01:20:11,976 --> 01:20:13,805
- Do you want to buy some?
- This is really good.

1945
01:20:13,806 --> 01:20:15,075
Should we get some of this?

1946
01:20:15,405 --> 01:20:17,015
This perilla oil is really good.

1947
01:20:17,016 --> 01:20:18,346
- It's good.
- It is.

1948
01:20:18,976 --> 01:20:21,346
(I'm glad I brought the perilla oil.)

1949
01:20:21,686 --> 01:20:24,454
(It's amazing.)

1950
01:20:24,455 --> 01:20:26,086
My gosh.

1951
01:20:27,825 --> 01:20:28,984
You can sell...

1952
01:20:28,985 --> 01:20:30,494
(It's so good that you can sell it.)

1953
01:20:30,495 --> 01:20:31,694
- It's really good, isn't it?
- It's so good.

1954
01:20:31,695 --> 01:20:32,726
Is it?

1955
01:20:32,896 --> 01:20:34,694
Adding ice was the key.

1956
01:20:34,695 --> 01:20:35,824
You have to add ice.

1957
01:20:35,825 --> 01:20:37,194
- Andante.
- Andante.

1958
01:20:37,195 --> 01:20:39,395
- The inside is nice and chewy.
- Right.

1959
01:20:39,396 --> 01:20:41,265
- It's perfect.
- It's good.

1960
01:20:41,266 --> 01:20:42,335
It's really good.

1961
01:20:42,336 --> 01:20:43,806
(The buckwheat noodles are nice and chewy thanks to the ice water.)

1962
01:20:44,636 --> 01:20:46,976
(Slurping)

1963
01:20:47,205 --> 01:20:49,444
(It's a relay...)

1964
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:52,075
(of noodle slurping.)

1965
01:20:52,315 --> 01:20:54,846
(Myoung is really enjoying it.)

1966
01:20:55,386 --> 01:20:58,055
(The sound of Myoung slurping the noodles)

1967
01:20:58,056 --> 01:20:59,185
It's bound to be good.

1968
01:20:59,186 --> 01:21:01,955
(Giving his noodles to Myoung)

1969
01:21:02,726 --> 01:21:05,695
(Thank you.)

1970
01:21:09,896 --> 01:21:12,096
(Proud)

1971
01:21:12,724 --> 01:21:18,165
(They're surrounded by a field of buckwheat flowers.)

1972
01:21:18,925 --> 01:21:21,063
(They are eating buckwheat noodles...)

1973
01:21:21,064 --> 01:21:24,764
(as they look at the field of buckwheat flowers.)

1974
01:21:24,865 --> 01:21:29,234
(It's a special meal that can only be enjoyed on House on Wheels.)

1975
01:21:29,405 --> 01:21:30,803
- Youngest.
- Isn't it good?

1976
01:21:30,804 --> 01:21:32,444
Eat it with this.

1977
01:21:33,415 --> 01:21:34,944
Eat it with a big piece.

1978
01:21:36,075 --> 01:21:40,715
(Sweet and spicy grilled deodeok made by Dong Il)

1979
01:21:41,014 --> 01:21:42,053
Eat a big one.

1980
01:21:42,054 --> 01:21:44,155
Wrap the noodles with it like you would do with meat.

1981
01:21:44,585 --> 01:21:46,254
- I know.
- Goodness.

1982
01:21:46,255 --> 01:21:47,693
(He wraps the buckwheat noodles with a piece of grilled deodeok.)

1983
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:48,723
(Taking a bite)

1984
01:21:48,724 --> 01:21:52,365
(Slurping)

1985
01:21:53,634 --> 01:21:57,705
(A big piece of grilled deodeok and buckwheat noodles go in at once.)

1986
01:21:58,434 --> 01:22:03,274
(What is this? This combination is amazing!)

1987
01:22:03,444 --> 01:22:05,843
(How does it taste?)

1988
01:22:05,844 --> 01:22:07,674
It tastes so good together.

1989
01:22:07,675 --> 01:22:09,273
Try it with some of the grilled deodeok.

1990
01:22:09,274 --> 01:22:11,084
This is really good.

1991
01:22:11,085 --> 01:22:13,584
I said, "Hey, try it with the deodeok,"

1992
01:22:13,585 --> 01:22:14,853
but he was already eating it.

1993
01:22:14,854 --> 01:22:16,314
(I'm already eating it.)

1994
01:22:16,724 --> 01:22:17,754
(Should I try some too?)

1995
01:22:17,755 --> 01:22:18,825
This is so good.

1996
01:22:22,155 --> 01:22:25,224
(With Hee Won's dedicated touch,)

1997
01:22:25,365 --> 01:22:26,494
(the deodeok transformed deliciously.)

1998
01:22:26,495 --> 01:22:29,894
(There are a few exceptions.)

1999
01:22:30,434 --> 01:22:34,005
(The deodeok covered in sesame oil was grilled to be golden brown.)

2000
01:22:34,505 --> 01:22:38,005
(Then they added Chef Sung's sauce to add spiciness to it.)

2001
01:22:38,844 --> 01:22:40,914
(The crunchy texture added to the soft noodles...)

2002
01:22:40,915 --> 01:22:43,074
(creates the perfect combination of flavors.)

2003
01:22:43,075 --> 01:22:44,914
Eat it with a big one.

2004
01:22:44,915 --> 01:22:46,954
- It's so good.
- Isn't it?

2005
01:22:46,955 --> 01:22:48,884
(After eating a big piece of grilled deodeok,)

2006
01:22:50,425 --> 01:22:55,325
(the spicy and bitter flavors fill your mouth.)

2007
01:22:56,425 --> 01:22:57,464
- Gosh.
- It's so good.

2008
01:22:57,465 --> 01:22:59,624
(The flavor of the deodeok gets stronger the more you chew.)

2009
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:01,593
- The grilled deodeok could be sold!
- I agree.

2010
01:23:01,594 --> 01:23:03,165
(The grilled deodeok is so good too.)

2011
01:23:03,365 --> 01:23:06,434
Hee Won did a great job hitting the deodeok.

2012
01:23:06,604 --> 01:23:07,604
I agree.

2013
01:23:07,605 --> 01:23:09,634
Who hit the deodeok?

2014
01:23:12,175 --> 01:23:16,075
(The older glutton's appetite is getting stronger.)

2015
01:23:16,344 --> 01:23:19,484
(The younger glutton's appetite is just as strong.)

2016
01:23:20,554 --> 01:23:24,455
It will taste good if we mix some rice with it later.

2017
01:23:26,484 --> 01:23:28,994
(His cheeks are filled.)

2018
01:23:28,995 --> 01:23:30,094
(His mouth moves without rest.)

2019
01:23:30,825 --> 01:23:32,563
(They both...)

2020
01:23:32,564 --> 01:23:34,864
(finish their bowls in an instant.)

2021
01:23:34,865 --> 01:23:37,535
- I want some too.
- I want some rice.

2022
01:23:37,865 --> 01:23:39,433
- Go have some rice.
- Over there.

2023
01:23:39,434 --> 01:23:40,704
- I can't help myself.
- Over there.

2024
01:23:40,705 --> 01:23:43,474
(The precious perilla oil that he brought)

2025
01:23:44,905 --> 01:23:45,905
(He adds savoriness.)

2026
01:23:48,344 --> 01:23:52,215
(He mixes the perilla oil with some hot rice.)

2027
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,954
Eat it with some of that.

2028
01:23:54,955 --> 01:23:56,115
(Seung Hwan gives some to the younger glutton first.)

2029
01:23:56,255 --> 01:23:58,884
(He places a deodeok on top.)

2030
01:23:59,425 --> 01:24:01,625
(It's rice.)

2031
01:24:02,755 --> 01:24:05,893
(He takes a big bite.)

2032
01:24:05,894 --> 01:24:08,995
The food we had yesterday and today went well together.

2033
01:24:09,865 --> 01:24:12,764
(The older glutton eats a big spoonful in an instant.)

2034
01:24:14,005 --> 01:24:16,174
(He even eats a big piece of deodeok.)

2035
01:24:16,175 --> 01:24:17,375
(Exclaiming)

2036
01:24:19,144 --> 01:24:20,514
Doesn't it taste better with rice?

2037
01:24:21,715 --> 01:24:23,074
- It's really good.
- It is, isn't it?

2038
01:24:23,075 --> 01:24:24,114
(It is perfect with rice.)

2039
01:24:24,115 --> 01:24:26,383
This helps increase your appetite.

2040
01:24:26,384 --> 01:24:27,854
- Even when you don't have one.
- Right.

2041
01:24:28,484 --> 01:24:30,425
- I'm going to gain weight.
- What?

2042
01:24:30,684 --> 01:24:34,094
I gain 1.5kg after each trip.

2043
01:24:34,724 --> 01:24:36,024
I should exercise.

2044
01:24:36,425 --> 01:24:38,424
(Starting tomorrow.)

2045
01:24:38,425 --> 01:24:40,834
If it's good even when you're full, that means it's really good.

2046
01:24:40,835 --> 01:24:41,835
Right.

2047
01:24:42,965 --> 01:24:45,103
I had a corn dog an hour ago.

2048
01:24:45,104 --> 01:24:46,934
(Laughing)

2049
01:24:47,134 --> 01:24:49,074
I shouldn't have had the last twisted donut.

2050
01:24:49,075 --> 01:24:50,745
I think I ate 1,500 calories.

2051
01:24:51,745 --> 01:24:53,944
(We really ate a lot.)

2052
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:56,074
I ate like crazy.

2053
01:24:56,075 --> 01:24:57,814
The food went well together.

2054
01:24:59,944 --> 01:25:03,655
(After they enjoyed a big meal...)

2055
01:25:04,255 --> 01:25:06,554
- The breeze is nice.
- Isn't it?

2056
01:25:07,925 --> 01:25:10,763
The field of buckwheat flowers is amazing.

2057
01:25:10,764 --> 01:25:12,165
It's really pretty.

2058
01:25:13,535 --> 01:25:14,733
(Their minds and bodies feel purified by looking at it.)

2059
01:25:14,734 --> 01:25:16,434
My eyes are getting clearer.

2060
01:25:17,835 --> 01:25:20,063
(This is paradise.)

2061
01:25:20,064 --> 01:25:21,075
How nice.

2062
01:25:22,335 --> 01:25:24,473
Thank you for taking the time to come out here.

2063
01:25:24,474 --> 01:25:25,843
- Thank you.
- I'm sure you didn't have...

2064
01:25:25,844 --> 01:25:27,245
anything better to do anyway.

2065
01:25:28,215 --> 01:25:29,215
It's true.

2066
01:25:29,215 --> 01:25:30,215
Isn't it?

2067
01:25:30,216 --> 01:25:31,244
(Giving up)

2068
01:25:31,245 --> 01:25:33,585
How does it feel to see such old seniors?

2069
01:25:35,085 --> 01:25:36,513
It's okay. Say what's on your mind.

2070
01:25:36,514 --> 01:25:38,054
(Dazed Myoung)

2071
01:25:38,325 --> 01:25:40,124
(He's curious about his answer.)

2072
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:42,724
- How was it?
- It was really nice.

2073
01:25:43,354 --> 01:25:44,665
The wind is blowing hard.

2074
01:25:46,425 --> 01:25:47,494
(Flapping)

2075
01:25:47,495 --> 01:25:49,994
The wind suddenly got strong.

2076
01:25:49,995 --> 01:25:52,835
- What do you think?
- I was in a drama with Kwang Kyu,

2077
01:25:53,535 --> 01:25:56,774
but I only saw him when we were filming.

2078
01:25:57,045 --> 01:25:58,443
We filmed the drama for nearly a year,

2079
01:25:58,444 --> 01:25:59,803
- but we never got to eat together.
- I know.

2080
01:25:59,804 --> 01:26:01,013
- You filmed for nearly a year?
- Yes.

2081
01:26:01,014 --> 01:26:02,174
That's how things are these days.

2082
01:26:02,175 --> 01:26:03,473
So you ate together the most while you were here.

2083
01:26:03,474 --> 01:26:04,513
- Right.
- Right.

2084
01:26:04,514 --> 01:26:06,183
You had three meals together.

2085
01:26:06,184 --> 01:26:07,614
(That's why it was more meaningful.)

2086
01:26:07,615 --> 01:26:08,915
Thank you for coming.

2087
01:26:09,655 --> 01:26:10,655
Thank you.

2088
01:26:11,384 --> 01:26:12,424
- Can you see it?
- Yes.

2089
01:26:12,425 --> 01:26:14,124
One, two, three.

2090
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:15,393
(I hope you remember this moment for a long time.)

2091
01:26:15,394 --> 01:26:17,164
We really ate so well.

2092
01:26:17,165 --> 01:26:18,425
It was really nice.

2093
01:26:21,434 --> 01:26:23,965
(The fourth trip on House on Wheels 3)

2094
01:26:24,165 --> 01:26:25,233
Oh, my gosh!

2095
01:26:25,234 --> 01:26:29,005
(Our front yard is sparkling with emerald-colored water.)

2096
01:26:29,234 --> 01:26:31,505
(Who's the guest that is joining them in this peaceful place?)

2097
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:34,273
(Oh Na Ra visits them again!)

2098
01:26:34,274 --> 01:26:35,944
(I missed the house.)

2099
01:26:36,814 --> 01:26:38,844
(She's as comfortable as she is at home.)

2100
01:26:39,014 --> 01:26:41,255
(How do I get down?)

2101
01:26:41,484 --> 01:26:42,513
(Hitting)

2102
01:26:42,514 --> 01:26:43,854
(What are you doing in there alone?)

2103
01:26:44,285 --> 01:26:46,223
(Actress Oh is still the same.)

2104
01:26:46,224 --> 01:26:48,394
(Cheerful, Exhilarating)

2105
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:51,023
(Heave-ho!)

2106
01:26:51,024 --> 01:26:52,593
(Why won't it go in?)

2107
01:26:52,594 --> 01:26:53,665
Hey!

2108
01:26:54,594 --> 01:26:56,835
(The family has become even closer.)

2109
01:26:57,505 --> 01:26:59,904
(Another guest will join them and Na Ra.)

2110
01:26:59,905 --> 01:27:01,575
(A lot of luggage)

2111
01:27:01,804 --> 01:27:03,944
(What is all of this?)

2112
01:27:04,705 --> 01:27:07,514
(We've never had a guest like this before!)

2113
01:27:08,144 --> 01:27:11,614
(He's even cuter than...)

2114
01:27:11,615 --> 01:27:13,984
(Cutie Gong Myoung.)

2115
01:27:14,054 --> 01:27:16,715
(Give me an allowance!)

2116
01:27:17,155 --> 01:27:18,625
(Bugak)

2117
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:20,755
(Laughing)

2118
01:27:21,155 --> 01:27:23,524
(Fresh shrimp is here!)

2119
01:27:24,125 --> 01:27:25,564
(He's so cute.)

2120
01:27:26,224 --> 01:27:28,034
(He's in charge of making the family laugh.)

2121
01:27:28,035 --> 01:27:30,094
(That's Seung Ryong's charm.)

2122
01:27:30,764 --> 01:27:32,704
(He does house chores...)

2123
01:27:32,705 --> 01:27:36,974
(more passionately than most.)

2124
01:27:37,175 --> 01:27:38,175
(Be careful.)

2125
01:27:38,176 --> 01:27:40,175
(His heart skips a beat.)

2126
01:27:40,844 --> 01:27:43,814
(He has completely fallen for the sweet voice...)

2127
01:27:44,045 --> 01:27:46,144
(that fills the lake.)

2128
01:27:46,514 --> 01:27:49,215
(They paddle together as their bromance grows.)

2129
01:27:50,384 --> 01:27:54,094
(This is fate.)

2130
01:27:54,524 --> 01:27:57,094
(He prepared a tea ceremony for the family.)

2131
01:27:57,825 --> 01:27:59,495
(She's filled with enthusiasm.)

2132
01:28:00,064 --> 01:28:02,494
(Tea shouldn't be hard.)

2133
01:28:02,495 --> 01:28:04,234
(It should be comfortable.)

2134
01:28:04,335 --> 01:28:05,433
Since we're familiar with it...

2135
01:28:05,434 --> 01:28:07,705
(Falter)

2136
01:28:08,304 --> 01:28:09,934
(Why are you spilling it and wasting it?)

2137
01:28:10,304 --> 01:28:12,245
(Spilling)

2138
01:28:12,944 --> 01:28:13,973
(It's hot.)

2139
01:28:13,974 --> 01:28:15,474
(Laughing)

2140
01:28:16,045 --> 01:28:18,585
(Tea ceremonies aren't hard.)

2141
01:28:19,215 --> 01:28:21,285
(He came as a guest,)

2142
01:28:21,884 --> 01:28:26,724
(but the family is getting treated to a delicious meal.)

2143
01:28:27,054 --> 01:28:29,425
(He's the best guest!)

2144
01:28:30,094 --> 01:28:31,624
(How nice.)

2145
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:33,965
(Like a cup of hot tea on a cold day,)

2146
01:28:34,064 --> 01:28:37,005
(they are happy and warm because they're together.)

2147
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:40,064
(House on Wheels 3 with no time to be bored is coming soon.)
