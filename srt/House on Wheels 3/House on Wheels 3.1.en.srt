1
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:26,280
(Filmed after all members of the cast and staff were...)

2
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,519
(either vaccinated or tested negative for COVID-19...)

3
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,760
(in compliance with the health authorities' guidelines)

4
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,900
(The fast flow of the Geum River)

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,630
(A secluded riverside in Yeongdong, North Chungcheong Province)

6
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,030
How long has it been?

7
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,870
It's been six months, right?

8
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,969
(House on Wheels 3 is back.)

9
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,009
(Looking around)

10
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,450
(Rummaging through)

11
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:57,749
(Hee Won distractedly goes through the kitchen.)

12
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:01,050
(What's he doing?)

13
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,389
(What?)

14
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:04,789
How does this work?

15
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,560
You already forgot?

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,759
(He can't remember how to open the cupboard.)

17
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,590
They moved the furniture.

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,929
No, they're the same.

19
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,230
No, I think they moved them.

20
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,439
They're the same.

21
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:21,409
Whose house did you go to?

22
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:22,439
(What is he looking for?)

23
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:25,840
The gloves that Dong Wook gave us.

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,879
I see.

25
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,420
(Where are my cool gloves?)

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,590
(Dong Il is frustrated and goes to help.)

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,189
The gloves are...

28
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,859
Here they are.

29
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:40,120
Oh, there they are.

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,889
When you can't find something,

31
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,799
Kwang Soo, Ha Neul, or Sang Woo lost it.

32
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:51,400
(Lee Kwang Soo, Kang Ha Neul, and Han Hyo Joo rented the house.)

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,840
(Reading the owner's letter)

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,439
("Use the yellow cart from IU instead of a plastic bag.")

35
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,680
(I'm a fan of IU.)

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,379
(Let's steal it when we go home.)

37
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:02,980
(Were they a family of thieves?)

38
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,650
- We should count the spoons.
- They're all there, right?

39
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:10,389
You look like you're checking to see if they stole it.

40
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,420
I am.

41
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:16,159
(Thoroughly checking if they stole anything)

42
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,159
They're all there.

43
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,729
They stole everything in the refrigerator.

44
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:19,999
- Is it empty?
- Yes.

45
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,300
- Gosh. They stole all of them.
- It's all gone.

46
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,870
Kwang Soo has sticky fingers.

47
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:29,969
(Checking the valuables)

48
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:31,409
Check them.

49
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:35,409
(The cups that Doo Na gifted are there.)

50
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,650
What else?

51
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:39,520
The apron that Hyo Jin gave us.

52
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:44,159
Yes. The shopping basket from IU is in the car.

53
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:48,259
What I cared about the most this time was...

54
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,629
raising the roof.

55
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,229
I made them raise the roof to the height of those windows.

56
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,669
That way, you can sleep with both your legs straight up there.

57
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:59,740
(The 2nd-floor bed was a bit stuffy...)

58
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,909
(due to the low ceiling.)

59
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,479
(He was always worried about the guests feeling uncomfortable.)

60
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,180
(The house is larger with the higher ceiling.)

61
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,009
The house definitely seems more spacious.

62
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:12,680
It's because it's higher now.

63
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,789
(The view from the window is a bonus.)

64
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:17,860
It feels more open because of the windows.

65
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,759
- I know.
- And the ceiling is higher.

66
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,090
The fact that they put windows when they raised the roof...

67
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,259
is amazing.

68
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,129
It's so nice to just sit here.

69
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,469
- The house feels nice, right?
- Yes.

70
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:31,169
(How will the autumn trips go in the new house?)

71
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,270
When is the youngest getting here?

72
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,539
- We should talk...
- Shouldn't we call him?

73
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:40,009
Yes. We should try talking to him.

74
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:43,150
I've never been on the same show with him.

75
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,580
Me neither.

76
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,580
- Neither have you?
- No.

77
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,650
I've never even met him.

78
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,289
(The youngest members of the House on Wheels series)

79
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,360
(The 1st youngest member, Yeo Jin Goo)

80
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,830
(The former father and son hug each other first.)

81
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,740
(The 2nd youngest member, Im Si Wan)

82
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,610
(This one joined on the recommendation of Hee Won.)

83
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:13,039
I've never met him before.

84
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,509
I hear he's really nice.

85
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:19,080
Well, people also say that I'm nice.

86
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,520
But do you think I'm nice?

87
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,990
(Speechless)

88
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,419
No one even asks about you.

89
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:31,530
What if he's like a cocky transfer?

90
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,200
"I'm here, guys." What if he's like that?

91
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,270
I know.

92
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,530
(That would be difficult for us.)

93
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,840
What if we get into a fight?

94
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:40,909
You know, when we meet.

95
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:43,609
(They're excited and worried about the new one.)

96
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:47,609
Let's walk energetically

97
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,119
(He's walking toward them with energetic steps.)

98
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,390
(Getting nervous all of a sudden)

99
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,489
They're already here.

100
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,659
(He approaches them with a nervous heart.)

101
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:02,229
(Panting)

102
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:04,159
(Panting)

103
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:07,630
(His heart palpitating)

104
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:10,869
Doesn't it feel like autumn?

105
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:12,070
It is autumn.

106
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,570
No, I mean that it's definitely autumn now.

107
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,809
Just sitting here comfortably makes me realize it.

108
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:18,809
That's right.

109
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,080
(Calm down, my heart.)

110
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,349
Look, you can even see the dragonflies flying around.

111
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,820
It's like a quiz show.

112
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:28,527
Just sitting here comfortably makes me realize it.

113
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:29,575
That's right.

114
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:30,846
(Calm down, my heart.)

115
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:34,145
Look, you can even see the dragonflies flying around.

116
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:37,416
It's like a quiz show.

117
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:40,755
- He's here, Dong Il.
- Hello.

118
00:05:41,116 --> 00:05:42,116
Hello.

119
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:43,755
Come on in.

120
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:44,755
(Bowing 3 times in case they didn't see it)

121
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:47,895
Oh, it's you. Come on in. The sun is hot.

122
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,726
- Come inside.
- Come on.

123
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:52,695
(Who's the new youngest member on House on Wheels 3?)

124
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:57,505
(The youngest detective on "Extreme Job")

125
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:02,676
(The new youngest member, Gong Myoung)

126
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:05,575
(He's played various characters in both films and dramas.)

127
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:09,575
(The popular actor who's approved by his acting skills)

128
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,546
(Nice to meet you.)

129
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:13,885
(I'm the owner of House on Wheels,)

130
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:17,786
(Gong Myoung.)

131
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:20,085
- Hello.
- Hi.

132
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:21,526
- Watch your head.
- Watch out.

133
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:23,556
(Bowing twice as soon as he enters)

134
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,226
It's a pleasure.

135
00:06:25,226 --> 00:06:27,166
(They're still awkward as it's their first time.)

136
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,166
Hello.

137
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,466
(Let's see.)

138
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:33,135
You came empty-handed.

139
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:35,075
(Joking)

140
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:38,205
- I brought my sincerity.
- We don't accept sincerity.

141
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:39,745
Come here.

142
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:41,846
Have a seat.

143
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:43,046
- You can sit anywhere.
- I'll sit on the floor.

144
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:45,046
(Awkward)

145
00:06:46,216 --> 00:06:48,056
- This is our first time meeting.
- Yes, it is.

146
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:51,685
I once said hello to him at a preview.

147
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:52,825
- To Hee Won?
- Yes.

148
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:55,526
I also said hello when I went to watch "My Punch-Drunk Boxer".

149
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:57,726
You went because of Um Tae Goo, right?

150
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,596
It was because of Hye Ri.

151
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:01,995
Hye Ri? How do you know my daughter?

152
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:05,806
We acted in a TV series once.

153
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:09,106
I see. Then were you the one that Hye Ri was talking about?

154
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:12,575
(She talked about me?)

155
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:14,145
Her boyfriend?

156
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:15,616
(Playing along)

157
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:19,416
(We're just close friends.)

158
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:23,416
You look like a good guy.

159
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:25,125
Have you always looked like that?

160
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:26,255
- Me?
- Yes.

161
00:07:27,455 --> 00:07:28,495
I'm sorry?

162
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:32,565
(He tends to laugh it out when he doesn't know what to do.)

163
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:34,835
He looks the most gentle among the ones we've had.

164
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:38,906
I like your gentle appearance. It's comfortable.

165
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:40,806
But you haven't passed yet, so...

166
00:07:41,236 --> 00:07:42,306
Excuse me?

167
00:07:42,835 --> 00:07:44,776
- You need to audition for this.
- You should.

168
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:46,776
The others even sang to get in here.

169
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:48,815
(Is this a prank show?)

170
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:51,146
Thank you so much for coming.

171
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:53,445
Do you like to go camping?

172
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:56,656
I recently got into camping.

173
00:07:56,855 --> 00:07:58,386
I like going to bed early,

174
00:07:58,386 --> 00:08:00,825
waking up early, and going for a walk in the morning.

175
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:02,725
- And you've gone camping alone?
- Yes.

176
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:03,725
(He's easy to talk to when it's about camping.)

177
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:08,266
(Gong Myoung has been camping for 10 months.)

178
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:10,906
(He knows how to enjoy the romance in nature.)

179
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:13,435
(The perfect youngest member for House on Wheels 3)

180
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,176
Just make yourself at home. But when the guests are here,

181
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:19,906
we have a motto that we live by.

182
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:21,416
"The guests don't do any work."

183
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:24,016
The moment a guest arrives,

184
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:26,286
- you're one of the owners.
- Okay.

185
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:28,855
So enjoy your 30 minutes before they get here.

186
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:30,855
When they do, we can start...

187
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:32,526
- making good memories.
- Okay.

188
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:35,996
But Hee Won has a bit of a temper.

189
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:37,626
What now?

190
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:38,666
(What is he talking about now?)

191
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:40,225
Once in a while,

192
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:42,435
he brings the youngest member behind the house...

193
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:44,166
for a talk.

194
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:46,266
You have to bear with those moments a few times.

195
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:48,536
You're a good fighter, right?

196
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:49,975
(Shaking his head)

197
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:51,046
No, I'm not.

198
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:52,845
I'm the one usually getting beaten up.

199
00:08:55,016 --> 00:08:56,016
So it's all right.

200
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,916
(Don't be nervous.)

201
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,585
- Are you guys hungry?
- Yes.

202
00:08:59,585 --> 00:09:00,615
I made a call...

203
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:03,985
and ordered some food for our new member.

204
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:06,426
I hope it gets here soon. I'm starving.

205
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:10,256
Hey, there. Thank you.

206
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:12,796
- All right.
- Look.

207
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:16,465
I can't let you starve when you're here.

208
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:17,865
(What's the food he ordered for the new member?)

209
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,166
That's it.

210
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:21,036
Ta-da.

211
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:24,246
(What's their first meal?)

212
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:25,575
It's called muksabal.

213
00:09:26,205 --> 00:09:28,715
They turned acorn jelly into a snack.

214
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:32,085
It's chopped acorn jelly in naengmyeon-like broth.

215
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:35,656
It's a simple substitute for a meal.

216
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:38,626
You add the sauce first and mix it.

217
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:39,926
(Adding plenty)

218
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:42,526
Look at our youngest member go.

219
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:44,766
Hey, you're supposed to add the sauce as you eat.

220
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:46,195
Are you going to wash it if it's too salty?

221
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:51,136
- It's all right. Once it's mixed...
- Is that so?

222
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,605
Try mixing them, Gong Myoung.

223
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:55,335
You won't be...

224
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:56,605
(Careful)

225
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:58,306
treated nicely as a guest soon.

226
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,445
(He's not really mixing it.)

227
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:03,046
Should I mix the whole bowl?

228
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:05,485
(He spoke in a strange dialect as he was flustered.)

229
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:07,386
- Where are you from?
- Me?

230
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,886
From Gyeonggi Province.

231
00:10:08,886 --> 00:10:11,526
You spoke in a dialect all of a sudden.

232
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:12,955
(His dialect bursts out when he's taken aback.)

233
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:15,095
- Let's just dip it in.
- Sure.

234
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:17,026
Try it. The youngest should go first.

235
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:20,065
Do this and eat it.

236
00:10:20,065 --> 00:10:21,166
- Thank you.
- Go ahead.

237
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,896
(Will he like this type of food?)

238
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:25,205
- Thank you.
- Go ahead.

239
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:27,365
The acorn jelly is...

240
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:29,705
a bit bland and cool.

241
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:33,246
What do you think?

242
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:34,746
(Curious)

243
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:35,776
Do you like it?

244
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:37,546
(I give it a thumb-up.)

245
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:38,615
Try this one.

246
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:41,256
Didn't I tell you it'd be good?

247
00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:43,916
(Hee Won takes a bite of the seasoned acorn jelly.)

248
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,455
(It tastes good to Hee Won who has a child's palate.)

249
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:46,926
- It's good.
- It's tasty, right?

250
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:48,796
- It's pretty good, right?
- Yes.

251
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:52,996
(He tries the muksabal now.)

252
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:59,435
- So you grind the acorns.
- Yes.

253
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:00,876
Then what do you do?

254
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:02,335
- They grind the acorns.
- Yes?

255
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:04,906
(Drinking it from a bowl)

256
00:11:04,906 --> 00:11:06,345
It's like making tofu.

257
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:09,746
(Unlike their worries, it seems to suit his palate as well.)

258
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:12,546
He eats the food deliciously. And he's not picky.

259
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:14,455
Do you go on a diet?

260
00:11:15,886 --> 00:11:18,426
- Not really.
- You just eat tasty food.

261
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:19,426
Yes.

262
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:21,225
See? He's so particular.

263
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:22,325
(He hasn't even touched the muksabal.)

264
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:23,325
Look at him.

265
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:26,996
To be honest,

266
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:29,835
- I rarely eat breakfast.
- I know that.

267
00:11:30,435 --> 00:11:35,876
(It's a little uncomfortable, but he keeps eating it.)

268
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:41,776
Gong Myoung practically washes the bowl as he eats.

269
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:42,916
It's clean.

270
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,386
(Embarrassed)

271
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:48,215
Hey, take it easy.

272
00:11:49,115 --> 00:11:52,386
(Pretending to eat it)

273
00:11:53,585 --> 00:11:56,325
(I see you're trying hard.)

274
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:02,195
So...

275
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:04,605
I heard the youngest invited...

276
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:06,906
- Yes.
- a close friend of his.

277
00:12:07,636 --> 00:12:09,506
It's our first time dressing up.

278
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:11,306
I'm even wearing a shirt...

279
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:13,046
for the special guest.

280
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:14,676
This is the best outfit I own.

281
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:16,746
(All dressed up)

282
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:19,085
I can't wait to meet her.

283
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:20,786
How is the guest's personality?

284
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,656
She's easygoing.

285
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:24,455
- She's perfect for us.
- Yes.

286
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:26,126
How easygoing is she?

287
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:28,996
She forgets that I'm there...

288
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:31,666
and changes her clothes.

289
00:12:32,095 --> 00:12:33,896
- She's very easygoing.
- Yes.

290
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:35,266
That's what she's like.

291
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:37,235
Give her a call.

292
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:38,865
- Should I?
- Tell her that we're here,

293
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:41,406
and ask if she's coming safely.

294
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:43,435
I can't wait to listen to her voice.

295
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:46,246
- Hello?
- Myoung!

296
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:48,916
(She answered!)

297
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,715
Are you getting here safely?

298
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:52,485
Yes.

299
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:54,985
(Laughing)

300
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:58,526
It's a woman, right? I can't tell from her voice.

301
00:12:58,526 --> 00:13:01,695
You're on speaker. Say hello to the others.

302
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:02,955
Hello, sir!

303
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:05,626
- Hello.
- Hello.

304
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:07,296
- It's nice to talk to you.
- Hello.

305
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:09,136
Sure. I'm already...

306
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:11,065
happy to meet you when I haven't even met you.

307
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:15,575
You sound like a general.

308
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:18,575
- You sound very easygoing.
- Yes, I'm a general material.

309
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:21,115
(Who's the guest with the easygoing voice?)

310
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:25,485
(The actress that acted with Gong Myoung in "Extreme Job")

311
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:28,556
(Gong Myoung's close friend, actress Lee Ha Nee)

312
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:32,626
(She's got the looks of the winner of Miss Korea,)

313
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:37,426
(and she acted in Vietnamese in a recent TV series.)

314
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,296
(With her exceptional ability to pull off her character,)

315
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:43,095
Gosh!

316
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:47,636
(she takes over the whole show.)

317
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:51,705
(Ha Nee and Gong Myoung are like siblings.)

318
00:13:51,975 --> 00:13:55,876
(Ha Nee is coming to support her little brother.)

319
00:13:56,945 --> 00:13:59,215
You gathered early.

320
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:00,685
Yes.

321
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:03,916
We're the owners, so we have to set up the house.

322
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:05,955
Do you need anything?

323
00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:08,296
All Hee Won and I need...

324
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:11,026
since our first birthday is money.

325
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:15,095
Then I'll withdraw some cash.

326
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:17,465
Yes, please stop by the bank on the way.

327
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:19,636
Drive safely. We'll see you soon.

328
00:14:19,636 --> 00:14:22,205
- Sure. I'll see you soon.
- Bye.

329
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:23,235
(Very amicable)

330
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:26,075
We'll move the house safely and set it up,

331
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:28,215
- so get here safely.
- I will.

332
00:14:28,445 --> 00:14:31,246
- All right. I love you.
- Okay. See you.

333
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,886
- See you.
- I'll see you soon, Dong Il!

334
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:34,955
- Sure.
- Bye.

335
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:38,426
Is she talking in a cave or what?

336
00:14:39,426 --> 00:14:40,585
How is her voice so...

337
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:43,455
It sounds like she's been performing plays for 70 years.

338
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:45,465
I'm looking forward to this trip.

339
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,565
We should hit the road before it gets any hotter.

340
00:14:49,865 --> 00:14:50,865
Let's go.

341
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,036
- We have to close all the windows.
- Right.

342
00:14:54,575 --> 00:14:55,605
I got it.

343
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:58,676
(Close all the windows for safety!)

344
00:15:00,945 --> 00:15:02,445
(On their way to the first trip with the new member)

345
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:04,315
Our youngest is finally going.

346
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:06,916
(On their way to the first trip with the new member)

347
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:11,426
I feel like it's been so long.

348
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:15,996
(A trip on House on Wheels 3 after a while)

349
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:19,296
(Even the weather is clear.)

350
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,235
It's really...

351
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:23,636
- autumn.
- Yes.

352
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:27,536
(Watching the view out the window,)

353
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:35,046
(the cool breeze from the river and the high sky...)

354
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:41,585
(make them realize that it's autumn.)

355
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:47,185
Autumn is certainly the best of four seasons to go on a trip.

356
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:49,556
I personally like autumn the most.

357
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:50,695
- Me too.
- All of you?

358
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:55,136
When the autumn foliage starts to show...

359
00:15:55,136 --> 00:15:57,636
- How is the river so pretty here?
- I know, right?

360
00:15:57,835 --> 00:16:00,205
- It's gorgeous.
- It's like a painting.

361
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:01,575
- It is like a painting.
- Yes.

362
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:02,705
(There are no autumn colors, but it's still beautiful.)

363
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:03,735
It's a work of art.

364
00:16:04,776 --> 00:16:05,776
(The Geum River and the cliff meet to make a landscape painting.)

365
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:07,276
The cliff makes it...

366
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:09,376
- fantastic.
- It sure does.

367
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:10,546
(The Geum River and the cliff meet to make a landscape painting.)

368
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:17,155
(Today's destination, Yeongdong, North Chungcheong Province)

369
00:16:17,385 --> 00:16:20,256
(Thanks to the warm and shining climate,)

370
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:23,956
(you can find sweet fruits in season here.)

371
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:27,565
(What kind of front yard will they see in Yeongdong?)

372
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:30,395
The weather is so good.

373
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:32,966
- It's amazing.
- Yes, it's been a while.

374
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,135
Is Gong Myoung your real name?

375
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:39,506
No. My real name is Kim Dong Hyun.

376
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:40,875
- Kim Dong Hyun?
- Right.

377
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,046
Dong Hyun is a good name.

378
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:44,046
People with "Dong" in their names are generally good.

379
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:46,385
- What...
- It's better than "Hee".

380
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:47,615
What does your "Dong" mean?

381
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,756
- Mostly, it means "east".
- It means "east".

382
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:52,226
It's "east" most of the time? I see.

383
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:55,155
- Does "Hyun" mean "wise"?
- No, it means "glow".

384
00:16:55,155 --> 00:16:56,325
- It means "glow"?
- That's right.

385
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:58,365
Hey, "Hee" in my name means "glow" too.

386
00:16:58,365 --> 00:16:59,466
- Is that so?
- Right.

387
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:01,536
- "Hee" in my name means "glow".
- Goodness.

388
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:03,335
(He finally found something in common with the youngest.)

389
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:05,206
It's a sociable name.

390
00:17:05,206 --> 00:17:07,105
(The new youngest member, Gong Myoung, has a sociable name.)

391
00:17:07,165 --> 00:17:08,436
It's a pretty name, Dong Hyun.

392
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:09,476
(A stage name...)

393
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:12,476
Should I make my stage name, Hee Won?

394
00:17:12,476 --> 00:17:14,875
Instead of a stage name,

395
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:16,976
you might as well make a nickname.

396
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:21,016
- Something like "Geobong".
- "Geobong"?

397
00:17:21,986 --> 00:17:23,456
How about "Cheongomabi"?

398
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:25,686
- Your nickname?
- Right.

399
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:26,825
("Cheongomabi" as your nickname?)

400
00:17:27,186 --> 00:17:30,125
I'll be "Cheongo", and you'll be "Mabi".

401
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,296
(Cheongo Dong Il and Mabi Hee Won)

402
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:32,895
Yours means a high sky.

403
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:35,095
- I'm "Mabi" as in paralyzed.
- You're paralyzed.

404
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:39,335
(The perfect duo that suits autumn, Cheongo and Mabi)

405
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:42,075
Gosh, this is... We're almost there.

406
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:45,905
- There is...
- Right?

407
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:48,575
- This place is so cool.
- Seriously.

408
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:50,516
(Making a left in the direction of the front yard)

409
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:54,885
Gosh, this place is... Look at the mountains. How nice.

410
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:56,516
- Right.
- It's really beautiful.

411
00:17:57,585 --> 00:18:02,226
(Amazed)

412
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:04,595
Goodness, Dong Il. Look how clear the water is.

413
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:06,625
The water is...

414
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,865
If we had a ferryboat or something...

415
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:12,135
Right. If we could dip our feet in that water...

416
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:16,476
Well, I... My goodness.

417
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:19,506
You can count on me, Hee Won.

418
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:22,216
Gosh, Dong Il. That gazebo is beautiful, right?

419
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:23,915
Gosh, this place is...

420
00:18:23,915 --> 00:18:25,915
(As they get closer to the front yard,)

421
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:28,056
(they can feel a unique atmosphere.)

422
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:29,855
This is so cool.

423
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:37,355
- Gosh, this place is really...
- Seriously.

424
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:38,496
(Exclaiming)

425
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:41,125
Gosh, you guys.

426
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,996
Why are you guys so surprised? That's tacky.

427
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:45,706
Don't be like that.

428
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:54,206
(What's the 1st front yard of House on Wheels 3?)

- I picked this place carefully.
- Right, this is great.

- Where should the house go?

485
00:21:38,746 --> 00:21:40,006
The house...

486
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:42,446
Should we move this way a little?

487
00:21:42,446 --> 00:21:43,546
Should we move the car?

488
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:46,415
The view looks like a screen from here.

489
00:21:46,615 --> 00:21:48,786
- Let's move it here.
- Here?

490
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:50,315
We can take in the whole view from here.

491
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:53,226
If we go here, we can't see that part.

492
00:21:53,226 --> 00:21:54,526
- Like this?
- Like this.

493
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:55,696
(They have become one.)

494
00:21:55,696 --> 00:21:58,026
- Like this.
- Got it. I'll bring the car here.

495
00:21:58,796 --> 00:22:01,665
(Let me see.)

496
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:05,036
(When the second eldest moves the house,)

497
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:07,806
(the eldest spreads out his arms to show the location.)

498
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,976
(Glancing)

499
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:14,506
(Copying)

500
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:17,046
(Two scarecrows standing in a row)

501
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:18,186
Come behind me.

502
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:19,315
(When he turns the house in the direction of the scarecrows,)

503
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:20,385
Come behind me.

504
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:24,615
(the view rotates in 360°.)

505
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:25,625
Stop.

506
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,186
(They've moved easily in no time.)

507
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:29,226
Hee Won is a good driver indeed.

508
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:31,565
- He's the best driver.
- Of course.

509
00:22:31,565 --> 00:22:33,026
It's not a big deal.

510
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:34,226
(This is a piece of cake.)

511
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,496
Okay, now...

512
00:22:37,865 --> 00:22:40,405
Sung Kyoung brought these hats last time.

513
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:44,706
She said we could wear them when we work.

514
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:48,575
We should teach the youngest how to set up the house now.

515
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:51,145
- There's a prop there.
- Right.

516
00:22:51,145 --> 00:22:53,345
- You know how to drill, right?
- I do.

517
00:22:53,345 --> 00:22:54,746
Make sure you hold this while you drill.

518
00:22:54,746 --> 00:22:56,556
- It'll spin like this if you don't.
- Okay.

519
00:22:56,556 --> 00:22:57,615
Look, here.

520
00:22:57,615 --> 00:22:58,786
(The skilled head of the house gives a demonstration.)

521
00:22:58,786 --> 00:23:01,085
- Here.
- Yes.

522
00:23:01,085 --> 00:23:02,125
(Drilling)

523
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:03,355
Yes.

524
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:04,425
(Going wrong)

525
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,125
And then...

526
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,526
(You just twisted your wrist.)

527
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:09,496
(Embarrassed)

528
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:11,905
- It's done for now.
- That's right.

529
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:14,266
Did you get it? All of them. Go ahead and do it yourself.

530
00:23:14,905 --> 00:23:16,306
Watch your head.

531
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:21,276
(He lowers the prop calmly under the protection.)

532
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:23,946
- He's good at this.
- I know.

533
00:23:25,016 --> 00:23:28,046
He's like us. He's born to do chores.

534
00:23:28,046 --> 00:23:29,056
Right.

535
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:30,056
(Agreeing)

536
00:23:30,355 --> 00:23:33,986
Now, we have to set up the tarp.

537
00:23:35,325 --> 00:23:37,625
(They need to hang the tarp on the hooks.)

538
00:23:38,196 --> 00:23:40,026
You're tall, Myoung.

539
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:41,766
- Here?
- Right.

540
00:23:41,936 --> 00:23:43,466
Gosh, he's tall.

541
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:46,236
(He hangs it easily.)

542
00:23:46,506 --> 00:23:48,635
(Struggling)

543
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:50,276
I'll hold it.

544
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:52,875
(Easily holding it)

545
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:53,875
Goodness.

546
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,746
(Surprised)

547
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,786
He hangs it so easily because he's tall.

548
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:02,016
There's another one in the middle. There it is.

549
00:24:02,016 --> 00:24:03,016
Right, okay.

550
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:05,956
Gosh, it's one of the advantages of being tall.

551
00:24:05,956 --> 00:24:06,986
Here.

552
00:24:07,026 --> 00:24:09,196
(When the eldest hammers the nail,)

553
00:24:09,496 --> 00:24:12,026
(the youngest observes...)

554
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:15,065
(and copies him right away.)

555
00:24:18,605 --> 00:24:20,436
(The eldest passes him a tarp strap.)

556
00:24:22,936 --> 00:24:25,645
(The youngest takes after the eldest.)

557
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,716
(The eldest goes first,)

558
00:24:29,046 --> 00:24:31,716
(and the youngest wraps it up.)

559
00:24:31,986 --> 00:24:34,716
- That's right.
- Goodness, our youngest.

560
00:24:34,885 --> 00:24:37,155
Where have you been so far?

561
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:39,125
(Thanks to the youngest, they've set up the tarp fast.)

562
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,425
- Done!
- It's done.

563
00:24:40,585 --> 00:24:42,425
- Gosh.
- Let's take a breather.

564
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:43,726
Take a seat, Myoung.

565
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:46,026
How was it?

566
00:24:46,595 --> 00:24:48,796
It seems so relaxing when you watch us on TV.

567
00:24:48,796 --> 00:24:51,536
But it's killing us. We have to do all the hard work.

568
00:24:51,665 --> 00:24:54,065
(His hair shows how hard the work is.)

569
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:57,175
What do you think? You've become the owner of the house.

570
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,145
You came here and set up the tarp and everything.

571
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:02,046
Still, I like being here and watching it in real life.

572
00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:03,145
- Really?
- Yes.

573
00:25:03,145 --> 00:25:05,186
- Because I'm here.
- Because you're here.

574
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:06,885
Gosh, he's cool.

575
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:09,016
- You're naturally good at this.
- You're naturally good at this.

576
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:10,716
That's right.

577
00:25:11,186 --> 00:25:13,825
What's your favorite weather when you go on a trip? A sunny day?

578
00:25:14,155 --> 00:25:16,296
When you can't tell if it's going to rain or not?

579
00:25:16,296 --> 00:25:17,456
Or a rainy day?

580
00:25:17,456 --> 00:25:18,595
(Thinking)

581
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:23,365
As for me, I like gentle rain like spring rain.

582
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:25,105
Me too. I like cloudy days.

583
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:26,865
Gosh, he likes that too. How about you?

584
00:25:26,865 --> 00:25:29,135
I also like when it drizzles.

585
00:25:29,135 --> 00:25:31,375
Is this something actors have in common? We're sensitive.

586
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,446
You'll be in big trouble if you say something different.

587
00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:37,845
(He learns the lesson from the second eldest.)

588
00:25:37,845 --> 00:25:39,645
Agree with him no matter what.

589
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:47,385
Gosh, there's a dragonfly here.

590
00:25:47,385 --> 00:25:49,125
This is so nice.

591
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:52,196
- Shall I make you some coffee?
- No, it's okay.

592
00:25:52,766 --> 00:25:53,996
Do you know how to grind beans?

593
00:25:53,996 --> 00:25:57,395
Sure, I can grind beans and pour hot water...

594
00:25:57,635 --> 00:25:59,706
- Right.
- He's positive.

595
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:01,036
And you're going to sit back and do nothing?

596
00:26:01,036 --> 00:26:02,776
Oh, right.

597
00:26:03,675 --> 00:26:05,345
Hey, you already know what to do.

598
00:26:05,345 --> 00:26:06,806
(Don't you know what I mean?)

599
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:09,075
(He hurriedly goes into the house.)

600
00:26:09,075 --> 00:26:10,375
He knows how to do it.

601
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:14,615
(He pours coffee beans into the grinder.)

602
00:26:15,716 --> 00:26:18,256
(He grinds coffee beans vigorously.)

603
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:21,256
(Glancing)

604
00:26:22,355 --> 00:26:23,925
(Glancing again)

605
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:28,436
(Why is the youngest being so nervous?)

606
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:29,895
This is it.

607
00:26:29,895 --> 00:26:32,036
(Gong Myoung practiced brewing coffee the day before.)

608
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:36,536
(Grinding leisurely while enjoying the view)

609
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:40,546
(Is it done already?)

610
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:44,145
(What? They haven't been ground at all.)

611
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:47,645
(Zoned out)

612
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:52,186
(Will he be able to succeed today?)

613
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:54,355
- Okay, Hee Won.
- Yes?

614
00:26:54,355 --> 00:26:56,155
- While the youngest makes coffee...
- Right.

615
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:58,665
Well, I really wanted to do this...

616
00:26:58,966 --> 00:27:00,425
when I go on a trip.

617
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,236
- Let's make use of the car.
- Yes.

618
00:27:03,236 --> 00:27:05,466
(It's...)

619
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:08,675
(an iron rod?)

620
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:10,575
This is it.

621
00:27:10,575 --> 00:27:15,115
(What's this used for?)

622
00:27:16,476 --> 00:27:19,415
(What Dong Il wanted is a hammock.)

623
00:27:19,585 --> 00:27:22,915
(Why does he keep preparing things?)

624
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:27,085
(Usually, they hang a hammock like this.)

625
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:31,925
(What's the heavy iron rod for?)

626
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:34,496
This is it.

627
00:27:34,496 --> 00:27:35,665
(It is...)

628
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:38,665
(He's going to use it as a pole to fix a hammock to the house.)

629
00:27:39,065 --> 00:27:41,665
(A new hole in the connecting part of the House on Wheels)

630
00:27:42,175 --> 00:27:46,506
(Put the hammock pole in the hole.)

631
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:49,546
(Screw it down tightly.)

632
00:27:50,615 --> 00:27:54,345
(The one and only hammock pole is ready.)

633
00:27:54,986 --> 00:27:56,815
- All right. Now...
- That's right.

634
00:27:57,415 --> 00:27:58,486
That's right.

635
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:01,825
(Revealing the hammock, the dream of the head of the house)

636
00:28:02,395 --> 00:28:03,825
Okay, let's hang it here first.

637
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:08,365
(Hang the one end on the pole that is connected to the house.)

638
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:09,766
- There's a hole here.
- Right.

639
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:11,266
- It's done.
- Okay.

640
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:15,375
(Fix the legs with pegs.)

641
00:28:16,776 --> 00:28:19,276
- But I think we need rope.
- No, we don't.

642
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:21,546
We don't need it at all.

643
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:23,815
(Distrust)

644
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:25,716
You're suspecting me again, right?

645
00:28:26,986 --> 00:28:28,615
No, I'm not suspecting you.

646
00:28:29,986 --> 00:28:31,056
Okay, lie down on it.

647
00:28:32,786 --> 00:28:34,925
(Suspicious)

648
00:28:35,395 --> 00:28:37,956
Just trust me and lie down. You're not going to fall.

649
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:40,796
(He sits on it reluctantly.)

650
00:28:43,436 --> 00:28:44,496
(Swaying)

651
00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:46,536
(Overreacting)

652
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:49,175
Dong Il, I can't keep my balance.

653
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,175
Why is it swaying like this?

654
00:28:51,175 --> 00:28:52,976
- It's supposed to sway like that.
- Hold on.

655
00:28:53,946 --> 00:28:55,006
Is it okay?

656
00:28:57,145 --> 00:28:59,746
(Shaking)

657
00:28:59,845 --> 00:29:02,155
(An unfortunate disaster)

658
00:29:02,756 --> 00:29:03,885
- Gosh.
- Are you okay?

659
00:29:06,256 --> 00:29:09,256
(Hee Won, I'm sorry. Let me laugh a little bit.)

660
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:12,925
(Grunting)

661
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:17,565
(Glancing)

662
00:29:18,736 --> 00:29:20,405
I told you so. It's not going to work.

663
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:21,536
(I said we should tie it with rope.)

664
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:24,375
(Gosh, my head.)

665
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:26,476
Hey, I didn't do this on purpose.

666
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:29,175
Don't you think it's a relief that you got hurt instead of our guests?

667
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:31,415
What are you talking about? Gosh, it hurts.

668
00:29:31,415 --> 00:29:32,486
Where does it hurt?

669
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:34,415
- Goodness.
- I'm sorry.

670
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:36,085
You said I was suspecting you.

671
00:29:37,256 --> 00:29:39,456
- I'll tie it with rope.
- I told you so.

672
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,526
Okay, I got it.

673
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:42,956
- I'm sorry, Hee Won.
- It's okay.

674
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:45,796
- You understand me, right?
- I do.

675
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:48,526
You told me not to suspect you.

676
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:50,196
(Holding a grudge)

677
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:53,736
We have to use 2 ropes, not 1.

678
00:29:53,736 --> 00:29:54,806
Okay.

679
00:29:54,936 --> 00:29:57,306
- After seeing you falling...
- Right.

680
00:29:58,575 --> 00:30:01,246
(Hold on a second...)

681
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:05,486
Let's make Gong Myoung lie down this time.

682
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:07,615
Okay.

683
00:30:07,615 --> 00:30:08,686
(He wants to make sure the youngest feels the thrill too.)

684
00:30:08,686 --> 00:30:10,756
Okay. Gong Myoung...

685
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:12,885
He went back inside after suspecting for a while.

686
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:14,056
He doesn't know about this.

687
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:18,256
(He's still grinding.)

688
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:21,825
(He gives it his all with his lips firmly closed.)

689
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:25,736
(It's exhausting.)

690
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:28,036
(No, get a grip!)

691
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:31,276
(Without knowing the fate that awaits him,)

692
00:30:31,635 --> 00:30:33,946
(he does his best for the members.)

693
00:30:34,546 --> 00:30:37,075
(Are they ground well today?)

694
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:40,115
(The coffee beans are finely ground today.)

695
00:30:40,546 --> 00:30:43,655
(It's a relief.)

696
00:30:44,186 --> 00:30:46,526
(Pouring water)

697
00:30:48,726 --> 00:30:51,595
(He's going to have a muscle cramp while grinding coffee beans.)

698
00:30:52,196 --> 00:30:55,966
(But his first coffee makes him feel proud.)

699
00:30:56,966 --> 00:30:59,665
(Grinning)

700
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:04,835
(He brings his precious first coffee to the members.)

701
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:07,976
- Sorry, I'm late.
- No, it's okay.

702
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:10,615
Thank you.

703
00:31:12,115 --> 00:31:14,585
- Gong Myoung, why don't you...
- Yes?

704
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:16,915
- Me?
- sit there?

705
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:17,915
- Sure.
- Right.

706
00:31:19,256 --> 00:31:20,256
Go up there.

707
00:31:20,256 --> 00:31:22,456
(He carefully goes up.)

708
00:31:23,155 --> 00:31:24,226
Good.

709
00:31:24,325 --> 00:31:25,526
(He lies down on it successfully.)

710
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:26,825
- Goodness.
- Good. We made it.

711
00:31:27,865 --> 00:31:29,936
(Swinging gently)

712
00:31:30,536 --> 00:31:32,105
- Gosh, this feels so good.
- Right?

713
00:31:32,905 --> 00:31:35,206
- Hee Won, try it again.
- No, I don't want to.

714
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:37,905
- It's really safe.
- Go ahead and try it.

715
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,746
Gong Myoung. You two can sit together.

716
00:31:41,506 --> 00:31:42,575
Come on, sit down.

717
00:31:42,575 --> 00:31:43,845
(The two of them at a time?)

718
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:47,085
(Nervous, bright)

719
00:31:47,516 --> 00:31:48,546
- Is it okay?
- Good.

720
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:49,786
(It's sturdy enough to hold two adults.)

721
00:31:51,655 --> 00:31:52,686
(It's okay, right? Isn't it comfortable?)

722
00:31:53,726 --> 00:31:54,825
It's okay, right? Isn't it comfortable?

723
00:31:56,196 --> 00:31:59,095
Well, I don't feel comfortable though.

724
00:31:59,296 --> 00:32:01,226
- It's sturdy.
- It is indeed.

725
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:02,595
- This is sturdy. It's fine.
- Right.

726
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:05,806
(We're ready to have a guest now.)

727
00:32:05,806 --> 00:32:06,865
- Great work.
- Good.

728
00:32:06,865 --> 00:32:07,905
Now let's enjoy...

729
00:32:07,905 --> 00:32:09,575
- Right, have some coffee.
- your iced coffee, Gong Myoung.

730
00:32:09,575 --> 00:32:11,436
(They completed setting up the hammock only for their house.)

731
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:14,546
This feeling after finishing all the work.

732
00:32:15,306 --> 00:32:16,875
"Finishing all the work"?

733
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:18,915
Hey, this is just the beginning.

734
00:32:21,046 --> 00:32:23,286
After setting up the tent and all...

735
00:32:23,286 --> 00:32:26,155
When you have cold water or coffee after that,

736
00:32:26,155 --> 00:32:27,385
that really gives a genuine pleasure.

737
00:32:27,385 --> 00:32:29,825
- Right.
- Right? The genuine pleasure.

738
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:35,595
(Having cold coffee in the shade after the hard work)

739
00:32:37,065 --> 00:32:39,806
(The youngest drinks his coffee politely.)

740
00:32:41,306 --> 00:32:43,776
(Cold coffee that cools them down...)

741
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:46,246
(and the scenery that refreshes their eyes)

742
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:51,216
This reminds me of that acorn jelly.

743
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:52,345
- The seasoned acorn jelly.
- The cold one, right?

744
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,786
Right. Something like naengmyeon too.

745
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:56,986
Do you think Ha Nee will bring something to eat?

746
00:32:56,986 --> 00:33:00,125
What do you think? Would she bring something to eat or not?

747
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:04,056
I'm sure she'll bring something.

748
00:33:04,855 --> 00:33:06,966
Let's say this if she brings a lot of things to eat.

749
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:11,065
"Well, we're not that hungry." We have our pride, you know.

750
00:33:11,266 --> 00:33:13,165
"We're not that hungry, but you brought so much food."

751
00:33:13,766 --> 00:33:15,135
I said she'll bring something,

752
00:33:15,135 --> 00:33:17,476
but what if she comes empty-handed?

753
00:33:18,006 --> 00:33:20,775
(Meanwhile)

754
00:33:21,275 --> 00:33:23,175
Gosh, look at those flowers. They're so pretty.

755
00:33:24,215 --> 00:33:25,316
The purple flowers.

756
00:33:27,186 --> 00:33:29,485
Gosh, look at those butterflies. Are those bats or butterflies?

757
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:31,516
Gosh.

758
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:32,626
(She approaches the House on Wheels while enjoying the front yard.)

759
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:33,985
This place is amazing.

760
00:33:34,086 --> 00:33:37,325
(Today's guest, Lee Ha Nee)

761
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:38,965
- Gosh.
- Well, I think...

762
00:33:40,095 --> 00:33:42,695
- I think she's here.
- Goodness.

763
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:44,695
- She's here.
- Right? I think she's here.

764
00:33:44,695 --> 00:33:46,865
- She's here. Let's move the chairs.
- Why?

765
00:33:46,865 --> 00:33:49,036
- Move this one and...
- What about moving it to here?

766
00:33:49,036 --> 00:33:50,336
- Maybe it should go there?
- The guest should be...

767
00:33:50,806 --> 00:33:52,806
(Singing)

768
00:33:54,246 --> 00:33:56,316
- Right.
- Ask her to sit here.

769
00:33:56,316 --> 00:33:59,385
- That's...
- I will go and help her.

770
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:00,945
We're in the shade, so...

771
00:34:00,945 --> 00:34:01,945
(Do I look okay?)

772
00:34:01,945 --> 00:34:03,155
My goodness.

773
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:04,186
(It's Ha Nee.)

774
00:34:04,186 --> 00:34:06,226
- Gong Myoung!
- Yes!

775
00:34:06,226 --> 00:34:07,385
(She's happy to see him.)

776
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:10,695
(He runs out to greet her like a puppy.)

777
00:34:10,956 --> 00:34:13,626
My goodness.

778
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:15,365
- Let me carry it.
- It's heavy.

779
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:18,735
(I guess they really are close.)

780
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:20,936
I don't see any food.

781
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:24,206
- You've become prettier.
- I've put on some makeup.

782
00:34:24,206 --> 00:34:26,275
(Saying it in a cool manner)

783
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:29,246
- Hi, Dong Il.
- Gosh.

784
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:31,775
- Well...
- Hello.

785
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,246
This place is really something.

786
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:35,985
- Have a seat.
- Welcome.

787
00:34:35,985 --> 00:34:37,856
- You've come all the way here.
- Dong Il, I think...

788
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:39,856
we don't need to do anything here.

789
00:34:39,856 --> 00:34:42,056
(She came with hearty laughter.)

790
00:34:43,356 --> 00:34:46,996
(What will happen with today's guest?)

791
00:34:48,325 --> 00:34:49,635
You can sit in your seats.

792
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:51,595
- The guests sit in the middle.
- Sit here.

793
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:54,066
- The guests are the main here.
- That's what we do here.

794
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:55,166
My goodness.

795
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:57,405
(Gosh, this place is amazing.)

796
00:34:57,405 --> 00:34:58,976
And especially...

797
00:34:59,405 --> 00:35:01,905
if someone brings some food, we treat him like a king.

798
00:35:03,146 --> 00:35:04,215
You wanted something to eat?

799
00:35:04,215 --> 00:35:05,215
Well, that's...

800
00:35:06,086 --> 00:35:07,985
That one covered with a silver pack...

801
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:09,956
Why would you say that when she's just arrived?

802
00:35:10,956 --> 00:35:13,456
- The silver pack?
- Right, that one.

803
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:16,825
I was going to have it with tea later.

804
00:35:17,155 --> 00:35:18,496
It's jelly.

805
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:19,726
I really love jelly.

806
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:22,336
You do? I brought really delicious ones.

807
00:35:22,766 --> 00:35:24,666
Goodness, you brought something unexpected.

808
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,666
Gosh, it looks fancy. It looks...

809
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,666
It's pretty, right?

810
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:29,135
(Impressed)

811
00:35:29,936 --> 00:35:32,775
- There are many flavors.
- That's right.

812
00:35:32,945 --> 00:35:34,405
This one is pumpkin jelly.

813
00:35:34,405 --> 00:35:37,146
- Milk tea, pistachio...
- Pistachio.

814
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:39,016
- There's ssanghwacha jelly too.
- Ssanghwacha jelly.

815
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:43,385
- Put them in the fridge.
- It's from Seoul.

816
00:35:43,385 --> 00:35:45,485
- Of course, Dong Il.
- She brought this all the way here.

817
00:35:45,485 --> 00:35:47,255
Of course. I carried it all the way to here.

818
00:35:47,255 --> 00:35:48,485
(Well done, Ha Nee.)

819
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:51,025
- Now, bring what you've prepared.
- You have some coffee?

820
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:52,896
- Right, we have coffee.
- Make her some cold one.

821
00:35:53,595 --> 00:35:55,295
- I will...
- No, please sit.

822
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:58,266
No, it's okay. I have my decaffeinated coffee here.

823
00:35:58,266 --> 00:36:00,965
- My goodness. She has this.
- I can't take in caffeine.

824
00:36:00,965 --> 00:36:02,936
- I see.
- That's right.

825
00:36:02,936 --> 00:36:04,675
- All right.
- Are you okay with caffeine?

826
00:36:04,675 --> 00:36:06,545
- I'm fine with...
- You have no problem.

827
00:36:06,545 --> 00:36:08,405
- What about you, Hee Won?
- I don't drink coffee.

828
00:36:08,405 --> 00:36:12,016
You don't? What about tea? Is caffeine okay for you?

829
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:15,286
- I don't really know about it.
- You're sensitive to it?

830
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:17,255
Well, right. Caffeine is...

831
00:36:17,255 --> 00:36:19,025
I don't drink coffee because of the diuretic effect.

832
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:20,155
The diuretic effect? I see.

833
00:36:20,155 --> 00:36:22,556
- I think caffeine affects that.
- That's right.

834
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:23,556
So you're sensitive.

835
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:26,865
There are no additives.

836
00:36:27,095 --> 00:36:28,396
You need to eat them fast.

837
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:29,695
You know, this is...

838
00:36:29,965 --> 00:36:31,965
It's healthy food.

839
00:36:31,965 --> 00:36:33,365
- Hey.
- What?

840
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:37,536
She brought this for us. You need to say thank you.

841
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:39,775
- It's fine.
- I only wanted to see it.

842
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:43,345
This is how the pumpkin jelly looks.

843
00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:44,715
It has real pumpkin inside.

844
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:49,755
You should pick one that looks profound.

845
00:36:49,956 --> 00:36:51,016
The one with a lot of whole red beans.

846
00:36:51,385 --> 00:36:53,255
- A lot of red beans!
- Get one with a lot of red beans!

847
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:55,925
- That's perfect for him.
- The one with a lot of red beans.

848
00:36:56,356 --> 00:36:57,996
- Myoung, you want milk-tea flavor?
- Yes.

849
00:36:58,755 --> 00:36:59,996
(Gong Myoung gets a milk-tea flavored jelly.)

850
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:01,396
That suits his image.

851
00:37:01,396 --> 00:37:02,795
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

852
00:37:02,795 --> 00:37:03,865
(Taking a bite)

853
00:37:05,566 --> 00:37:06,566
It's so good.

854
00:37:06,566 --> 00:37:09,206
Most of these jellies are usually super sweet...

855
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:11,106
and too sticky.

856
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:13,445
- But this is like real pumpkin.
- It does taste like milk tea.

857
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:14,445
- Right?
- Yes.

858
00:37:14,945 --> 00:37:16,646
By the way, this place is...

859
00:37:17,246 --> 00:37:19,086
like paradise.

860
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:24,286
(A lovely front yard to be enjoyed with guests)

861
00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:26,556
But seriously...

862
00:37:26,655 --> 00:37:27,726
(Wollyu Peak is so picturesque.)

863
00:37:27,726 --> 00:37:29,456
How did they find such a nice place?

864
00:37:29,996 --> 00:37:31,295
Did you eat?

865
00:37:31,295 --> 00:37:33,626
I did on the way here.

866
00:37:34,195 --> 00:37:37,235
- What's your favorite food?
- Favorite food?

867
00:37:37,235 --> 00:37:39,436
- I like everything.
- Do you like jeotgal?

868
00:37:39,436 --> 00:37:40,465
I do.

869
00:37:40,566 --> 00:37:43,706
I grew up with my grandma.

870
00:37:43,706 --> 00:37:45,575
So I used to make jeotgal at home.

871
00:37:46,075 --> 00:37:48,306
When I was in elementary school, I hated it so much.

872
00:37:49,115 --> 00:37:51,246
I hated how it smelled so much at home.

873
00:37:51,246 --> 00:37:54,186
- I bet.
- I hated making it at home.

874
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:57,086
- But the flavor is different.
- I bet.

875
00:37:57,086 --> 00:37:58,115
You can't find it anywhere else.

876
00:37:58,456 --> 00:38:01,086
Yeongdong is also famous...

877
00:38:01,086 --> 00:38:02,255
for cave jeotgal.

878
00:38:03,025 --> 00:38:04,295
(Impressed)

879
00:38:04,396 --> 00:38:06,566
The temperature stays the same inside a cave, right?

880
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:08,166
So that's where they keep the jeotgal.

881
00:38:08,295 --> 00:38:10,936
- For fermenting it?
- That's right.

882
00:38:11,695 --> 00:38:14,235
Jeotgal tastes great with bossam, right?

883
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:15,566
(Impressed)

884
00:38:16,405 --> 00:38:19,246
Imagine having some jeotgal...

885
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:22,376
with vegetables and freshly cooked rice.

886
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,275
(Excited for dinner)

887
00:38:25,615 --> 00:38:29,556
(The cave looks impressive.)

888
00:38:30,215 --> 00:38:31,786
(Amazed)

889
00:38:32,215 --> 00:38:35,655
(It's open.)

890
00:38:36,695 --> 00:38:40,496
(Jeotgal that put everyone in awe)

891
00:38:41,726 --> 00:38:44,865
(They find it interesting.)

892
00:38:46,465 --> 00:38:49,505
(How does jeotgal taste like this?)

893
00:38:50,235 --> 00:38:53,545
(They will be eating cave jeotgal for dinner.)

894
00:38:54,175 --> 00:39:00,615
(How good will cave jeotgal taste?)

895
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:02,655
It has the best of all the flavors here.

896
00:39:02,655 --> 00:39:04,086
- I'm glad you are enjoying it.
- Me too.

897
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,525
I was so happy to find out...

898
00:39:08,525 --> 00:39:09,925
that Myoung would join the show.

899
00:39:09,925 --> 00:39:12,795
I am a huge fan of the show.

900
00:39:13,126 --> 00:39:15,365
I really wished that...

901
00:39:15,365 --> 00:39:18,235
this show would last a long time.

902
00:39:18,235 --> 00:39:19,266
Then, I heard Myoung...

903
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:21,436
would be joining the show.

904
00:39:21,436 --> 00:39:22,436
(Ha Nee was so happy to hear Myoung joining them.)

905
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:24,675
He likes camping.

906
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:26,646
We go scuba diving together.

907
00:39:26,646 --> 00:39:28,646
(He likes camping and underwater diving.)

908
00:39:28,845 --> 00:39:31,215
(Ha Nee tells Myoung's hobbies.)

909
00:39:32,345 --> 00:39:36,186
(He sure likes camping out in his car.)

910
00:39:37,215 --> 00:39:41,286
(He also does underwater diving.)

911
00:39:41,885 --> 00:39:45,126
(Myoung has so many hobbies.)

912
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:48,126
Did you know that he used to be an athlete?

913
00:39:48,695 --> 00:39:49,965
He used to be an athlete.

914
00:39:51,195 --> 00:39:52,336
For which sport?

915
00:39:52,836 --> 00:39:54,405
I used to do many sports.

916
00:39:55,135 --> 00:39:56,235
- He's an athlete.
- Taekwondo?

917
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:58,735
That, and he played soccer too.

918
00:39:59,345 --> 00:40:00,445
- Soccer too.
- That's when I was young.

919
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:03,675
You almost got kicked by him real hard.

920
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:04,746
(I did?)

921
00:40:06,146 --> 00:40:08,115
I was an athlete too!

922
00:40:09,045 --> 00:40:11,155
(Hee Won gets upset in a cute manner.)

923
00:40:11,155 --> 00:40:13,325
Before you got here,

924
00:40:14,155 --> 00:40:16,956
Myoung said you're very easygoing.

925
00:40:17,255 --> 00:40:18,295
- He did?
- He did.

926
00:40:18,556 --> 00:40:20,896
I think you really are easygoing.

927
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:22,025
She doesn't put people under pressure.

928
00:40:22,025 --> 00:40:25,336
But I really can't tell what easygoing means.

929
00:40:25,336 --> 00:40:27,836
The reason I felt that you are easygoing is...

930
00:40:28,266 --> 00:40:30,775
For that device over there,

931
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:33,675
you said just drop everything in it and boil it.

932
00:40:33,675 --> 00:40:35,106
I could tell from the way you speak.

933
00:40:35,106 --> 00:40:38,816
People tell me numerous times that I'm easygoing.

934
00:40:39,345 --> 00:40:42,086
But one day, I came to think, "What does easygoing mean?"

935
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:44,215
(Let us tell you what it means.)

936
00:40:44,586 --> 00:40:47,385
(My gosh! This is picturesque!)

937
00:40:48,286 --> 00:40:49,356
(This place is really something.)

938
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:51,456
(You can dump them all in and boil it.)

939
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:55,496
(She won't get shy with her choice of words.)

940
00:40:56,295 --> 00:40:57,336
(Laughing)

941
00:40:57,766 --> 00:40:59,066
(Laughing)

942
00:40:59,306 --> 00:41:01,965
(She laughs heartily.)

943
00:41:02,206 --> 00:41:03,376
(Impressed)

944
00:41:04,235 --> 00:41:05,275
(More impressed)

945
00:41:06,146 --> 00:41:08,476
(She makes candid reactions.)

946
00:41:08,476 --> 00:41:12,476
(You've got to eat that with a drizzle of sesame oil.)

947
00:41:12,476 --> 00:41:14,115
You don't need anything else.

948
00:41:14,115 --> 00:41:18,215
(Only Ha Nee doesn't know how easygoing she is.)

949
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:21,086
(Am I really that free-spirited?)

950
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:25,996
- What's your blood type?
- It's the same as his.

951
00:41:25,996 --> 00:41:27,295
- Is it A?
- Yes, for both of us.

952
00:41:27,295 --> 00:41:29,965
Your blood type is A, but you must pretend it's not.

953
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:31,436
I hope I'm not being rude but where are you from?

954
00:41:31,766 --> 00:41:33,135
- It's Incheon.
- Pardon?

955
00:41:33,135 --> 00:41:34,135
It's Incheon.

956
00:41:34,566 --> 00:41:36,936
As long as we get paid, we can do all accents,

957
00:41:36,936 --> 00:41:39,235
including Jelloa, Gyeongsang, and Chungcheong Province.

958
00:41:39,235 --> 00:41:42,575
But have you been to every province in Korea?

959
00:41:43,345 --> 00:41:44,945
We all met in Seoul Station...

960
00:41:45,876 --> 00:41:48,246
- back when we did theater.
- Really?

961
00:41:48,246 --> 00:41:49,316
Of course.

962
00:41:49,856 --> 00:41:54,286
(This is really delicious.)

963
00:41:54,885 --> 00:41:57,226
(It's so good.)

964
00:41:58,295 --> 00:41:59,295
At this age...

965
00:42:01,525 --> 00:42:03,465
By the way,

966
00:42:03,465 --> 00:42:06,566
I don't think anyone would want this ssanghwa jelly.

967
00:42:07,036 --> 00:42:09,106
- How many did you eat?
- One.

968
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:10,106
One?

969
00:42:10,436 --> 00:42:11,436
I ate one.

970
00:42:11,706 --> 00:42:13,575
(Everyone except Hee Won had only one jelly each.)

971
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:15,146
I usually don't eat jellies.

972
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:20,246
But this is really good. I'm not joking.

973
00:42:21,516 --> 00:42:24,056
It's fine that you like it.

974
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:25,956
But could you...

975
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:27,626
- I ate four.
- Oh, my goodness!

976
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:29,456
I had four jellies.

977
00:42:29,556 --> 00:42:32,095
- Nut jelly.
- I wish there were no laws.

978
00:42:34,025 --> 00:42:36,436
If there were no laws, you would've died already.

979
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:38,336
I will say it before you say it.

980
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:39,536
(Bursting into laughter)

981
00:42:39,865 --> 00:42:41,066
They are true friends.

982
00:42:42,365 --> 00:42:45,405
It's hot. It's good that you are wearing short sleeves.

983
00:42:45,405 --> 00:42:47,376
- Isn't it so hot?
- It is.

984
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:50,175
- This is amazing.
- Yes.

985
00:42:50,175 --> 00:42:51,246
Oh, my goodness.

986
00:42:52,675 --> 00:42:53,786
What's here? Let's see.

987
00:42:54,746 --> 00:42:56,255
- Wait, I know this.
- It's...

988
00:42:56,255 --> 00:42:57,485
- Didn't Hyo Jin bring this?
- Right.

989
00:42:57,485 --> 00:42:59,286
(She found her close friend's gift.)

990
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:00,985
- Look at this.
- She even wrote their names.

991
00:43:00,985 --> 00:43:04,095
This is so precious.

992
00:43:05,695 --> 00:43:07,666
- What's this?
- It opens if you push it.

993
00:43:08,195 --> 00:43:10,036
- There are plates.
- What's in here?

994
00:43:12,195 --> 00:43:13,306
You need these things.

995
00:43:13,306 --> 00:43:16,235
You need it to prevent them from falling off in a camping car.

996
00:43:16,336 --> 00:43:17,806
Have you driven this yet?

997
00:43:18,336 --> 00:43:20,405
- I only practiced driving it today.
- I see.

998
00:43:22,045 --> 00:43:23,045
(Impressed)

999
00:43:23,275 --> 00:43:25,945
(She doesn't know what easygoing means, but...)

1000
00:43:25,945 --> 00:43:27,045
(Impressed)

1001
00:43:27,786 --> 00:43:29,786
You need to hang these up carefully.

1002
00:43:29,786 --> 00:43:31,655
Otherwise, things will get crazy in here, right?

1003
00:43:32,286 --> 00:43:35,786
Cooking oil, olive oil, perilla oil, sesame oil, chili oil.

1004
00:43:36,595 --> 00:43:37,655
(Feeling at home)

1005
00:43:37,655 --> 00:43:40,795
Look at this thing right here.

1006
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:43,735
This stuff is awesome.

1007
00:43:43,735 --> 00:43:44,766
(Ha Nee loves the House on Wheels.)

1008
00:43:45,566 --> 00:43:48,865
Myoung, isn't it also your first time here?

1009
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:50,336
- Did you master it already?
- I did.

1010
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,905
- Please explain everything to me.
- Okay.

1011
00:43:51,905 --> 00:43:53,905
- This is the bed.
- Okay, that's the bed.

1012
00:43:54,646 --> 00:43:55,905
I like the bed.

1013
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,646
There is another bed here.

1014
00:43:59,246 --> 00:44:01,286
- Over there?
- That's...

1015
00:44:01,286 --> 00:44:04,016
- It's really nice.
- I love the pictures here.

1016
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,425
I agree. This must be it.

1017
00:44:06,626 --> 00:44:08,626
(Taking a look at the pictures next to each other)

1018
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:09,626
So pretty.

1019
00:44:11,356 --> 00:44:12,695
- That's Hae Jin.
- Yes.

1020
00:44:12,695 --> 00:44:13,766
Yes.

1021
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:16,266
- That's Hyo Jin!
- Where?

1022
00:44:16,266 --> 00:44:18,436
- They look so cute.
- There's more here.

1023
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:21,166
(They got to see the memories made on the show.)

1024
00:44:21,306 --> 00:44:22,666
This place suits you so well.

1025
00:44:23,476 --> 00:44:25,936
- I love it here.
- So what did you do?

1026
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:29,845
On my way here from my car,

1027
00:44:29,845 --> 00:44:31,275
I didn't even notice the cameras.

1028
00:44:32,345 --> 00:44:34,786
It's because Dong Il and Won Hee...

1029
00:44:34,786 --> 00:44:36,985
just kept talking like that.

1030
00:44:38,586 --> 00:44:39,586
"Are we here..."

1031
00:44:40,155 --> 00:44:42,425
"to film or just..."

1032
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:45,456
- "to play?" - It feels like a vacation, right?

1033
00:44:45,456 --> 00:44:46,896
Did you do some hard labor yet?

1034
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:48,896
I didn't do anything.

1035
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:50,396
Doing that was a bit...

1036
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,396
(He's got used to this already.)

1037
00:44:51,396 --> 00:44:52,936
- Putting things on and stuff?
- Yes.

1038
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:55,766
- Myoung, take good care of them.
- Yes.

1039
00:44:59,106 --> 00:45:00,306
(Plopping down)

1040
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:02,345
I filmed until late yesterday.

1041
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,016
It's really intense.

1042
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:07,885
I'm so out of it that I don't even know what day it is.

1043
00:45:08,586 --> 00:45:09,655
I'm serious.

1044
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:12,516
It's a start of a new week.

1045
00:45:12,615 --> 00:45:14,655
- Oh, my goodness.
- It's a butterfly.

1046
00:45:14,856 --> 00:45:18,595
(A butterfly has flown inside the House on Wheels.)

1047
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:21,695
Hey!

1048
00:45:21,695 --> 00:45:22,695
It just left.

1049
00:45:23,235 --> 00:45:24,235
Oh, my goodness.

1050
00:45:24,235 --> 00:45:25,436
(Myoung was startled.)

1051
00:45:25,735 --> 00:45:27,635
(He was so surprised.)

1052
00:45:27,905 --> 00:45:29,706
(She finds him cute.)

1053
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:32,106
What are you doing?

1054
00:45:32,505 --> 00:45:35,445
(Taking a picture of pretty Ha Nee)

1055
00:45:35,445 --> 00:45:36,445
(What?)

1056
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:37,445
(Smile)

1057
00:45:38,476 --> 00:45:41,686
(Myoung makes Ha Nee smile with just one picture.)

1058
00:45:42,186 --> 00:45:45,985
(Ha Nee joins him to help him out for his new beginning.)

1059
00:45:46,186 --> 00:45:50,126
(They really are like a brother and sister.)

1060
00:45:51,726 --> 00:45:55,695
(These are Myoung's new older brothers.)

1061
00:45:57,095 --> 00:46:00,735
(He gets to relax for the first time in a while.)

1062
00:46:02,536 --> 00:46:04,005
It's so nice.

1063
00:46:06,036 --> 00:46:07,675
- Ha Nee has a great personality.
- I agree.

1064
00:46:07,675 --> 00:46:08,845
She's very nice.

1065
00:46:10,775 --> 00:46:13,045
If it's too hot, we can turn on the air conditioner.

1066
00:46:13,045 --> 00:46:14,746
- This is just perfect.
- Really?

1067
00:46:14,945 --> 00:46:18,586
Since it's hot, let's go on an adventure to a cave.

1068
00:46:18,586 --> 00:46:19,655
Shall we?

1069
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,856
- You should all try some jeotgal.
- Seriously.

1070
00:46:21,856 --> 00:46:23,356
- I'm so excited.
- You can pack some home.

1071
00:46:23,356 --> 00:46:24,655
- I'll bring some home too.
- A cave?

1072
00:46:25,556 --> 00:46:27,066
- Will you drive?
- Sure.

1073
00:46:27,066 --> 00:46:29,635
I'll drive. Are you fine with driving?

1074
00:46:30,066 --> 00:46:31,396
Be careful with the floor.

1075
00:46:31,396 --> 00:46:32,936
(It's a new driver for the show.)

1076
00:46:33,106 --> 00:46:34,336
(Hee Won took the backseat for the first time.)

1077
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:36,036
It's my first time sitting in the back.

1078
00:46:36,135 --> 00:46:37,235
Look at this.

1079
00:46:37,575 --> 00:46:39,646
- What's that?
- A grasshopper.

1080
00:46:39,646 --> 00:46:41,075
- A grasshopper?
- Yes.

1081
00:46:41,545 --> 00:46:44,215
(Perfect age to like insects)

1082
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:46,075
Hee Won, open your mouth.

1083
00:46:46,615 --> 00:46:48,885
- Say, "Ah." - Throw it away outside.

1084
00:46:49,115 --> 00:46:51,086
(Laughing)

1085
00:46:51,086 --> 00:46:53,885
- It's cute.
- It's so cute. Here, let me.

1086
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:55,325
Be careful.

1087
00:46:55,325 --> 00:46:56,655
- So cute.
- That's a long-headed grasshopper.

1088
00:46:56,655 --> 00:46:57,726
Nice!

1089
00:46:57,925 --> 00:47:00,066
(Startled)

1090
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:02,195
- Let's let it out.
- It seems like a grasshopper.

1091
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:04,965
- Because we're in a car...
- Let it out right now.

1092
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:08,905
(Hey, grasshopper. Go ahead and fly away.)

1093
00:47:08,905 --> 00:47:11,976
- Myoung is very detailed.
- Blow it.

1094
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:13,005
He really is.

1095
00:47:13,005 --> 00:47:15,476
As one more blood type A person is here, it seems we're all careful.

1096
00:47:16,345 --> 00:47:19,416
(Carefully dropping it off at the front yard)

1097
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:20,485
- Gosh.
- Seriously.

1098
00:47:21,615 --> 00:47:23,856
It's going to be really beautiful when the sun sets.

1099
00:47:23,856 --> 00:47:24,885
Totally.

1100
00:47:26,525 --> 00:47:28,655
- The weather's great today.
- Yes.

1101
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:30,825
Did you see it, Dong Il?

1102
00:47:31,095 --> 00:47:33,066
The stepping stones!

1103
00:47:33,066 --> 00:47:34,365
(The bluish river flowing under the Wollyu Peak is welcoming them.)

1104
00:47:34,365 --> 00:47:37,235
That gazebo is really amazing!

1105
00:47:37,235 --> 00:47:38,566
(Ha Nee is seeing the scenery for the first time today.)

1106
00:47:38,865 --> 00:47:40,106
Did you see this, Ha Nee?

1107
00:47:40,836 --> 00:47:42,606
- It's awesome!
- Gosh, the stepping stones.

1108
00:47:43,135 --> 00:47:45,306
Look at the gazebo standing alone.

1109
00:47:45,675 --> 00:47:46,706
- The gazebo.
- Great.

1110
00:47:46,706 --> 00:47:49,376
That gazebo is really something.

1111
00:47:49,376 --> 00:47:50,376
True!

1112
00:47:52,215 --> 00:47:54,086
It's so beautiful here.

1113
00:47:55,045 --> 00:47:56,456
- Seriously...
- Great.

1114
00:47:57,056 --> 00:47:58,416
Imagine how nice a life the scholar officials...

1115
00:47:58,416 --> 00:47:59,786
must have had in the old days.

1116
00:47:59,786 --> 00:48:01,155
No doubt.

1117
00:48:01,525 --> 00:48:03,325
I remember my life was easier at that time.

1118
00:48:03,325 --> 00:48:05,856
(Flashing back his previous life)

1119
00:48:06,295 --> 00:48:08,766
For your information, Dong Il was actually born in 1838.

1120
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:10,066
(Laughing)

1121
00:48:10,066 --> 00:48:11,266
Seriously.

1122
00:48:11,365 --> 00:48:13,566
(The car is filled with laughter.)

1123
00:48:14,306 --> 00:48:15,566
Dong Il, look at that.

1124
00:48:16,036 --> 00:48:17,675
It says the region of Korean traditional music and fruits.

1125
00:48:17,806 --> 00:48:19,536
(Rainbow Yeongdong, the region of Korean traditional music and fruits)

1126
00:48:19,536 --> 00:48:23,416
Yeongdong is actually very famous for its Nangye Festival,

1127
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:26,146
as it's also a famous place for Korean traditional music.

1128
00:48:26,146 --> 00:48:28,086
(Is that right?)

1129
00:48:28,086 --> 00:48:29,646
You know, I majored in Korean traditional music, Dong Il.

1130
00:48:29,646 --> 00:48:30,755
- Yes, I know that.
- Right.

1131
00:48:30,755 --> 00:48:33,086
What was your major specifically?

1132
00:48:33,586 --> 00:48:34,856
I majored in gayageum.

1133
00:48:34,856 --> 00:48:35,925
- Gayaguem.
- Yes.

1134
00:48:36,856 --> 00:48:39,726
In fact, my mother plays gayaguem, so does my older sister.

1135
00:48:39,726 --> 00:48:41,425
- My younger brother plays daegeum.
- The whole family...

1136
00:48:41,425 --> 00:48:44,365
We can form an ensemble, actually.

1137
00:48:44,365 --> 00:48:45,996
(Impressed)

1138
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:49,336
So your mother played gayageum for a long time?

1139
00:48:49,536 --> 00:48:52,106
- She's a Living National Treasure.
- Amazing.

1140
00:48:52,505 --> 00:48:56,146
Besides, my older sister was the youngest winner of everything.

1141
00:48:56,146 --> 00:48:59,615
She was the youngest to receive a presidential award as well.

1142
00:48:59,945 --> 00:49:03,115
(Ha Nee's family are excellent at playing gayageum.)

1143
00:49:03,586 --> 00:49:06,316
(Her sister, a presidential award winner)

1144
00:49:06,316 --> 00:49:09,556
(Her mom, a Living National Treasure)

1145
00:49:09,956 --> 00:49:12,925
(And just... Lee Ha Nee)

1146
00:49:12,925 --> 00:49:14,726
So when I was younger,

1147
00:49:14,726 --> 00:49:17,295
I really didn't like that.

1148
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:19,135
No matter how hard I try,

1149
00:49:19,135 --> 00:49:21,735
- I can't be compared to my mom.
- I understand.

1150
00:49:21,735 --> 00:49:23,706
- Of course, she's like a treasure.
- That's what I mean.

1151
00:49:23,706 --> 00:49:25,936
I was so stressed out about it.

1152
00:49:25,936 --> 00:49:28,606
I felt like I would fail anyway no matter how I tried.

1153
00:49:29,646 --> 00:49:33,545
Sometimes, I had my days and nights mixed up.

1154
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:36,345
But my father started to play the danso in the early morning.

1155
00:49:37,086 --> 00:49:38,385
Around 5am.

1156
00:49:41,155 --> 00:49:43,755
(Dad, please stop...)

1157
00:49:43,956 --> 00:49:45,195
Around 5am.

1158
00:49:45,195 --> 00:49:47,295
(This is the family of Korean traditional music.)

1159
00:49:47,325 --> 00:49:50,436
(It's still funny to this day.)

1160
00:49:50,595 --> 00:49:53,436
(Ha Nee, it must have been hard for you.)

1161
00:49:54,066 --> 00:49:56,876
(Today's guest is perfect for Yeongdong.)

1162
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,976
(They have arrived at where the cave is.)

1163
00:49:59,976 --> 00:50:01,476
- We're here.
- The jeotgal must be really good.

1164
00:50:02,976 --> 00:50:03,976
(Is it here?)

1165
00:50:03,976 --> 00:50:05,275
- It's here?
- It must be good.

1166
00:50:07,345 --> 00:50:08,646
Is there a cave here?

1167
00:50:09,016 --> 00:50:10,485
Do we walk from here?

1168
00:50:10,715 --> 00:50:13,086
(Is there a cave here?)

1169
00:50:13,556 --> 00:50:15,985
(It's Dong Il's first time to visit as well.)

1170
00:50:16,255 --> 00:50:18,556
Dong Il, are we going into the mountain?

1171
00:50:18,556 --> 00:50:19,755
Seriously? Into the mountain again?

1172
00:50:20,595 --> 00:50:23,436
- I mean, it doesn't seem like...
- Definitely not.

1173
00:50:23,436 --> 00:50:24,996
(It's hard to believe there's jeotgal in a place like this.)

1174
00:50:25,266 --> 00:50:26,766
- It's an inland area.
- Exactly.

1175
00:50:26,766 --> 00:50:28,306
And there's jeotgal here?

1176
00:50:30,675 --> 00:50:32,606
- This must be it.
- I think so.

1177
00:50:32,635 --> 00:50:34,675
- This is it.
- Yes.

1178
00:50:34,675 --> 00:50:36,675
- This is it.
- Yes.

1179
00:50:39,675 --> 00:50:40,786
What is this place?

1180
00:50:40,786 --> 00:50:43,286
(They spotted a suspicious door in the bush.)

1181
00:50:43,286 --> 00:50:45,485
- This is cave storage.
- Yes, that's right.

1182
00:50:46,686 --> 00:50:50,295
(Dong Il takes the lead, and the rest is curious.)

1183
00:50:50,726 --> 00:50:52,525
(What kind of cave is it?)

1184
00:50:52,525 --> 00:50:55,066
Is someone here? Hello!

1185
00:50:56,536 --> 00:50:59,635
(Exclaiming)

1186
00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:04,376
(Eyes wide open)

1187
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:05,706
Seriously?

1188
00:51:06,845 --> 00:51:11,016
(As the door opens, they're amazed by the peculiar view before them.)

1189
00:51:11,175 --> 00:51:13,746
(It seems the dark and deep tunnel never ends.)

1190
00:51:14,286 --> 00:51:17,516
(What's buried in the cave for a long time are...)

1191
00:51:18,816 --> 00:51:22,425
(the extraordinary-looking jars.)

1192
00:51:22,755 --> 00:51:25,155
- How deep is the cave?
- It's 30m.

1193
00:51:25,155 --> 00:51:26,925
(The length is 30m.)

1194
00:51:27,695 --> 00:51:31,166
- The height is around 3.5m to 4m.
- It's high.

1195
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:33,095
This is crazy!

1196
00:51:33,536 --> 00:51:35,766
- Is the AC on?
- Of course not.

1197
00:51:35,766 --> 00:51:37,336
I feel cold.

1198
00:51:38,135 --> 00:51:40,845
(Unlike the outside in the autumn sunshine,)

1199
00:51:41,876 --> 00:51:44,976
(it's much cooler in the cave.)

1200
00:51:45,175 --> 00:51:47,146
Look how low the temperature is.

1201
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:49,186
- Now it is...
- It's 13℃.

1202
00:51:49,186 --> 00:51:52,115
(It's 13℃ in the cave.)

1203
00:51:52,115 --> 00:51:53,956
- Is it 13℃ in the winter?
- Yes, it is.

1204
00:51:53,956 --> 00:51:56,286
So it's cooler in the summer, and warmer in the winter.

1205
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:57,695
- I see.
- He's right.

1206
00:51:57,695 --> 00:51:59,025
(The cave jeotgal is aged better as the cool temperature is maintained.)

1207
00:51:59,025 --> 00:52:02,726
Actually, this place has a sad history.

1208
00:52:03,066 --> 00:52:05,195
It was originally used for an armory.

1209
00:52:05,195 --> 00:52:06,965
- Really?
- Is that right?

1210
00:52:06,965 --> 00:52:08,106
During the Japanese colonial rule?

1211
00:52:08,106 --> 00:52:11,275
Yes, our grandparents dug it during the Japanese colonial period.

1212
00:52:11,735 --> 00:52:13,905
They were forced to dig it by hand.

1213
00:52:13,905 --> 00:52:15,845
- When you look at the history...
- By hand?

1214
00:52:15,845 --> 00:52:19,746
That's why there are marks of pickaxes and rakes.

1215
00:52:19,746 --> 00:52:20,816
Yes, that's right.

1216
00:52:21,286 --> 00:52:25,115
(The traces of poignant history)

1217
00:52:26,786 --> 00:52:28,126
What kind of jeotgal is this?

1218
00:52:28,126 --> 00:52:30,025
- It is shrimp jeotgal.
- Shrimp jeotgal.

1219
00:52:30,425 --> 00:52:32,056
How fermented is this shrimp jeotgal?

1220
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:35,126
- It's aged for eight years.
- Pardon me?

1221
00:52:35,126 --> 00:52:36,735
(Aged for eight years)

1222
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,695
- For eight years?
- Yes.

1223
00:52:39,195 --> 00:52:40,266
My goodness.

1224
00:52:40,865 --> 00:52:43,635
There isn't a big age gap between the jeotgal and Gong Myoung.

1225
00:52:43,635 --> 00:52:44,976
(Giggling)

1226
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:49,905
(The eight-year-old shrimp jeotgal is preciously tied up.)

1227
00:52:49,905 --> 00:52:50,916
Gosh.

1228
00:52:50,916 --> 00:52:53,916
(Eye-catching)

1229
00:52:54,746 --> 00:52:56,445
(For the first time in their lives,)

1230
00:52:56,445 --> 00:52:58,615
(they get to see the eight-year-old shrimp jeotgal.)

1231
00:52:58,615 --> 00:53:01,425
(Coming soon)

1232
00:53:01,956 --> 00:53:03,056
(The shrimp jeotgal fermented for eight years)

1233
00:53:03,056 --> 00:53:04,126
Look at that.

1234
00:53:06,126 --> 00:53:08,925
- The color is really...
- It's creamy.

1235
00:53:08,925 --> 00:53:09,965
- Yes, it is.
- Gosh.

1236
00:53:10,365 --> 00:53:11,666
(It seems like a rice porridge.)

1237
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:12,996
I can smell it.

1238
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,336
It's hard to tell the shape of shrimps, isn't it?

1239
00:53:15,336 --> 00:53:16,336
(The shape of shrimps disappeared as it's been aged for a long time.)

1240
00:53:16,336 --> 00:53:18,005
- It's really shocking.
- I agree.

1241
00:53:18,005 --> 00:53:20,075
Would you like to try one shrimp each?

1242
00:53:20,706 --> 00:53:22,476
- I think it'll be too salty.
- No, come on.

1243
00:53:22,476 --> 00:53:23,976
- It will be salty.
- Give me one, please.

1244
00:53:24,215 --> 00:53:27,345
- Please give me just one.
- Come on, just one?

1245
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,246
Dong Il, it's salty.

1246
00:53:30,255 --> 00:53:36,286
(How's the taste of shrimp jeotgal aged for eight years?)

1247
00:53:37,155 --> 00:53:39,456
It tastes somehow like doenjang. Homemade doenjang.

1248
00:53:40,865 --> 00:53:42,266
(Licking)

1249
00:53:44,566 --> 00:53:45,595
It tastes just like that!

1250
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:48,436
- True!
- It tastes like homemade doenjang.

1251
00:53:48,436 --> 00:53:50,206
It's really savory.

1252
00:53:50,635 --> 00:53:51,836
The smell, too.

1253
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:54,476
Seriously, I can say that...

1254
00:53:54,706 --> 00:53:57,976
- the deep taste is different.
- Totally.

1255
00:53:58,376 --> 00:54:00,316
(As the jeotgal is aged longer, the taste gets deeper.)

1256
00:54:00,316 --> 00:54:01,985
(Aged for 1 year, aged for 8 years)

1257
00:54:02,885 --> 00:54:04,885
Seriously, it tastes like homemade doenjang.

1258
00:54:04,885 --> 00:54:07,226
- You're right, Dong Il.
- I feel numb in my mouth.

1259
00:54:08,025 --> 00:54:09,126
Is it salty?

1260
00:54:09,126 --> 00:54:11,695
It's a bit numbing like after having a sesame leaf.

1261
00:54:12,396 --> 00:54:14,126
- Aren't you going to try it?
- Sorry?

1262
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,396
- Aren't you going to try it?
- Well...

1263
00:54:15,396 --> 00:54:16,936
(Hee Won is still thinking.)

1264
00:54:16,936 --> 00:54:19,635
- This is really...
- It's really eye-opening.

1265
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:21,135
(Go ahead and try me.)

1266
00:54:21,436 --> 00:54:23,876
(Hesitating)

1267
00:54:25,206 --> 00:54:26,675
Maybe with rice,

1268
00:54:26,675 --> 00:54:28,275
but not just as it is.

1269
00:54:28,275 --> 00:54:29,675
(I think I need something else with it.)

1270
00:54:29,675 --> 00:54:31,715
(Taking a bite)

1271
00:54:32,215 --> 00:54:33,945
- This is tiny shrimp jeotgal.
- It's the real deal.

1272
00:54:34,715 --> 00:54:36,646
I knew it. It's too salty.

1273
00:54:36,646 --> 00:54:38,186
Of course it's salty.

1274
00:54:38,186 --> 00:54:40,556
It can be left until December to make kimchi.

1275
00:54:40,755 --> 00:54:43,356
The shrimp is pretty small and soft.

1276
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,795
This is tiny shrimp jeotgal. The taste stays the same...

1277
00:54:45,795 --> 00:54:46,795
(Somehow, it's addictive.)

1278
00:54:46,795 --> 00:54:47,896
Taste it.

1279
00:54:49,595 --> 00:54:50,635
It's the real deal.

1280
00:54:50,635 --> 00:54:53,965
(In the end, he licks it.)

1281
00:54:55,365 --> 00:54:57,675
- Well, I've never...
- I never had something like this.

1282
00:54:57,675 --> 00:54:59,405
- Me neither.
- It's actually really good.

1283
00:54:59,405 --> 00:55:00,876
The eight-year-old one is really shocking.

1284
00:55:00,876 --> 00:55:02,206
Actually, I like food that kids like.

1285
00:55:02,206 --> 00:55:04,516
Normally, I don't enjoy something like this.

1286
00:55:05,075 --> 00:55:06,316
I don't even go near them.

1287
00:55:06,316 --> 00:55:08,385
- Really?
- Yes, true. I know that.

1288
00:55:08,385 --> 00:55:11,385
Somehow it's really tasty.

1289
00:55:11,385 --> 00:55:13,155
(The addictive eight-year-old jeotgal captured Hee Won's palate.)

1290
00:55:13,556 --> 00:55:14,726
What is that now?

1291
00:55:14,726 --> 00:55:16,155
(What's the next jeotgal that will captivate them?)

1292
00:55:16,155 --> 00:55:17,726
This is medium shrimp jeotgal.

1293
00:55:17,726 --> 00:55:19,925
(Medium shrimp?)

1294
00:55:19,925 --> 00:55:23,166
(I've never heard of it before.)

1295
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:25,195
- You know jumbo shrimp, right?
- Yes, jumbo shrimp.

1296
00:55:25,195 --> 00:55:29,806
This is made of shrimp smaller than that size.

1297
00:55:30,505 --> 00:55:31,635
- By looking...
- My goodness.

1298
00:55:31,635 --> 00:55:32,936
(Exclaiming)

1299
00:55:32,936 --> 00:55:35,306
It doesn't really change much.

1300
00:55:35,306 --> 00:55:36,976
(Interested)

1301
00:55:37,316 --> 00:55:38,845
(Medium shrimp jeotgal)

1302
00:55:38,845 --> 00:55:40,885
So it's the similar shrimp...

1303
00:55:40,885 --> 00:55:43,086
as the ones used for soy sauce marinated shrimps.

1304
00:55:43,086 --> 00:55:44,416
- It's about the same size.
- Yes, that's right.

1305
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:48,356
I'll peel it so that you can taste it.

1306
00:55:49,056 --> 00:55:51,525
Gosh, look. Look at the size of the shrimp eggs.

1307
00:55:51,525 --> 00:55:52,896
Look how big it is, Dong Il.

1308
00:55:54,226 --> 00:56:00,706
(Let's see.)

1309
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,306
- It's chewy.
- Yes.

1310
00:56:04,175 --> 00:56:06,735
The aged medium shrimp jeotgal like this is hard to find.

1311
00:56:06,735 --> 00:56:08,806
(Being shy)

1312
00:56:09,306 --> 00:56:12,916
(Tasting it in a rush)

1313
00:56:13,146 --> 00:56:14,246
My goodness.

1314
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,545
(Amazed)

1315
00:56:15,545 --> 00:56:18,255
- You know, people say yukjeot...
- Yes.

1316
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:23,425
(They love its chewy meat.)

1317
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:25,356
(It's the best.)

1318
00:56:26,556 --> 00:56:28,795
Whenever he closes the lid after letting us taste it, I feel sad.

1319
00:56:29,795 --> 00:56:30,795
It's a bit tantalizing.

1320
00:56:30,795 --> 00:56:32,896
- I guess we can grab...
- Yes.

1321
00:56:32,896 --> 00:56:34,806
This one is...

1322
00:56:35,066 --> 00:56:36,536
Gosh!

1323
00:56:36,536 --> 00:56:38,635
(The next jeotgal that will satisfy their taste buds)

1324
00:56:38,635 --> 00:56:40,376
(What on earth...)

1325
00:56:40,376 --> 00:56:42,345
(is this?)

1326
00:56:42,505 --> 00:56:43,876
It's hairtail jeotgal.

1327
00:56:43,876 --> 00:56:45,945
(The hairtail jeotgal looks a little shocking.)

1328
00:56:46,045 --> 00:56:48,646
It's different from the one we know.

1329
00:56:48,916 --> 00:56:51,186
It doesn't look as fermented as the normal one.

1330
00:56:51,186 --> 00:56:52,655
They seem just half-dried.

1331
00:56:52,655 --> 00:56:55,755
It looks different. They seem more real.

1332
00:56:55,755 --> 00:56:58,726
- They still have eyes too.
- Yes.

1333
00:56:58,856 --> 00:57:00,825
This is how you should taste it.

1334
00:57:00,825 --> 00:57:02,295
- Like this?
- Yes, that's right.

1335
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:03,695
(It's the sauce that has the deepest taste of hairtail jeotgal.)

1336
00:57:03,695 --> 00:57:05,235
(Sipping)

1337
00:57:05,235 --> 00:57:06,295
Sorry, watch out, Hee Won.

1338
00:57:07,336 --> 00:57:09,005
(Exclaiming)

1339
00:57:09,706 --> 00:57:10,775
(Exclaiming)

1340
00:57:12,106 --> 00:57:14,606
- This is just...
- Yes, I agree.

1341
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,615
With the chopped Cheongyang chili...

1342
00:57:17,945 --> 00:57:20,845
- It's perfect with the chili.
- It needs to be chopped.

1343
00:57:20,945 --> 00:57:22,686
(Let me try it.)

1344
00:57:22,686 --> 00:57:24,356
- It's really good.
- Is it?

1345
00:57:24,356 --> 00:57:27,556
I really love hairtail jeotgal.

1346
00:57:27,556 --> 00:57:29,856
I had it a lot with my grandmother. Isn't it great?

1347
00:57:29,856 --> 00:57:32,626
- This is just different.
- It's incredible.

1348
00:57:34,425 --> 00:57:36,626
(Myoung is awakened of the taste of jeotgal.)

1349
00:57:36,626 --> 00:57:38,436
(Exclaiming)

1350
00:57:39,965 --> 00:57:41,606
(Licking)

1351
00:57:41,606 --> 00:57:43,936
(Exclaiming)

1352
00:57:43,936 --> 00:57:46,635
Aren't you too young to enjoy jeotgal like that?

1353
00:57:46,635 --> 00:57:47,775
That's what I'm saying.

1354
00:57:47,905 --> 00:57:50,675
The eight-year-old shrimp jeotgal and...

1355
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,345
(Going into a trance)

1356
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:53,845
It's really delicious.

1357
00:57:55,286 --> 00:57:58,786
Can you please give Myoung a little more?

1358
00:57:58,786 --> 00:57:59,856
Look, he's licking.

1359
00:57:59,856 --> 00:58:01,786
- Look how he's licking.
- No, I'm all right.

1360
00:58:01,786 --> 00:58:03,325
It's perfect.

1361
00:58:03,325 --> 00:58:05,356
It tastes much better with food.

1362
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,525
It's really tasty.

1363
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,266
I really want rice now.

1364
00:58:09,965 --> 00:58:11,336
By any chance, do you have rice here?

1365
00:58:11,336 --> 00:58:13,436
(Dong Il is looking for rice in the cave.)

1366
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:17,175
(After tasting the fish doenjang which goes well with rice,)

1367
00:58:17,376 --> 00:58:20,345
(they feel hungrier than before.)

1368
00:58:20,646 --> 00:58:23,106
We should get like 3kg of pork for bossam.

1369
00:58:23,106 --> 00:58:25,646
We'll need more if we're having it with jeotgal this good.

1370
00:58:25,845 --> 00:58:29,115
I really want to go back now and have it with rice.

1371
00:58:29,115 --> 00:58:30,246
Yes, it tastes really good.

1372
00:58:30,246 --> 00:58:33,615
(The table will be filled with the jeotgal from the cave.)

1373
00:58:33,615 --> 00:58:34,925
(They are doing grocery shopping at the market.)

1374
00:58:34,925 --> 00:58:36,956
Since I was born and raised only in Seoul,

1375
00:58:36,956 --> 00:58:40,795
I love to go to traditional markets in other regions.

1376
00:58:40,795 --> 00:58:42,925
- Is that so?
- It's famous for dried persimmon.

1377
00:58:42,925 --> 00:58:44,266
- Really?
- Yes.

1378
00:58:44,436 --> 00:58:47,936
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1379
00:58:48,436 --> 00:58:49,465
It's huge.

1380
00:58:49,865 --> 00:58:51,405
- Come on, Dong Il.
- How come you can't do that?

1381
00:58:51,976 --> 00:58:53,175
Thank you.

1382
00:58:53,536 --> 00:58:55,545
- Have a great day.
- Have a great day.

1383
00:58:56,075 --> 00:58:57,445
Grape rice cake?

1384
00:58:57,445 --> 00:59:00,215
This was the first store to make it. It says it doesn't harden.

1385
00:59:00,816 --> 00:59:02,686
Isn't this area also famous for grapes?

1386
00:59:02,686 --> 00:59:04,056
(Surprised)

1387
00:59:04,456 --> 00:59:07,226
(With the juice from the sweet grapes in Yeongdong,)

1388
00:59:07,226 --> 00:59:10,856
(the rice cake is chewier.)

1389
00:59:10,856 --> 00:59:13,325
(Grape rice cake)

1390
00:59:13,325 --> 00:59:15,465
(Fruity)

1391
00:59:15,825 --> 00:59:17,036
(One bite for Myoung)

1392
00:59:17,036 --> 00:59:18,135
There's just one.

1393
00:59:18,865 --> 00:59:21,606
(One bite for Ha Nee)

1394
00:59:21,606 --> 00:59:23,036
(Chewy)

1395
00:59:23,036 --> 00:59:24,436
In the freezer.

1396
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,635
- We already bought four, so...
- Okay.

1397
00:59:26,635 --> 00:59:28,545
Thank you so much. Have a great day.

1398
00:59:28,545 --> 00:59:29,806
Ha Nee, let me.

1399
00:59:30,976 --> 00:59:32,115
I'm so hungry.

1400
00:59:32,115 --> 00:59:34,086
(Let's go home quickly.)

1401
00:59:34,416 --> 00:59:37,186
We should stay a few more days. Not just 1 night and 2 days.

1402
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:41,286
Let's try the dried persimmon.

1403
00:59:41,825 --> 00:59:43,126
I'm not eating dried persimmon.

1404
00:59:43,126 --> 00:59:45,295
- Why not?
- I don't want it.

1405
00:59:45,295 --> 00:59:47,166
- You don't like it?
- I rarely eat it.

1406
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,195
Is that right?

1407
00:59:48,396 --> 00:59:50,436
Myoung, are you sure? You can see how good it looks.

1408
00:59:52,266 --> 00:59:55,706
(Taking a bite)

1409
00:59:55,706 --> 00:59:59,175
(Are you sure you don't want to try?)

1410
01:00:00,445 --> 01:00:03,675
(Are you really sure?)

1411
01:00:04,275 --> 01:00:05,316
(Try it.)

1412
01:00:05,316 --> 01:00:06,675
(Cute tantrum)

1413
01:00:07,345 --> 01:00:08,385
It's really good, though.

1414
01:00:08,816 --> 01:00:10,246
Normally, young people don't like dried persimmon, you know.

1415
01:00:10,246 --> 01:00:12,215
I didn't like it when I was younger.

1416
01:00:12,755 --> 01:00:15,286
Come on.

1417
01:00:15,286 --> 01:00:17,755
You can only say those things when I'm the only one around.

1418
01:00:18,456 --> 01:00:21,066
I can't say these things when they get in the car.

1419
01:00:21,066 --> 01:00:23,766
(Smiling)

1420
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:25,996
I'm starving.

1421
01:00:25,996 --> 01:00:27,336
(Having expectations in the jeotgal from the cave)

1422
01:00:27,965 --> 01:00:30,936
(As they go along the Geum River,)

1423
01:00:31,735 --> 01:00:34,545
(the Wollyu gazebo shows that they're almost home.)

1424
01:00:35,746 --> 01:00:39,376
(What kind of dinner would be ready on the Wollyu Peak?)

1425
01:00:39,615 --> 01:00:40,945
Gosh, when we get off...

1426
01:00:40,945 --> 01:00:44,056
- I think he's your...
- Yes, he's here.

1427
01:00:45,155 --> 01:00:47,626
I can tell from far behind that he's very charismatic.

1428
01:00:47,626 --> 01:00:49,456
Is he a statue or something?

1429
01:00:49,456 --> 01:00:50,456
Why is he standing like that?

1430
01:00:50,456 --> 01:00:52,255
- He's standing so still.
- Why is he like that?

1431
01:00:52,255 --> 01:00:53,865
What's with the posture?

1432
01:00:55,365 --> 01:00:59,436
(Maybe he's nervous. He's standing still.)

1433
01:01:00,465 --> 01:01:01,505
Hey, it's me.

1434
01:01:02,635 --> 01:01:04,306
What's the matter? Are you angry at something?

1435
01:01:04,306 --> 01:01:07,275
You came all the way to see me, and why do you look angry?

1436
01:01:08,405 --> 01:01:09,405
Hey, it's me.

1437
01:01:09,405 --> 01:01:10,445
Gosh.

1438
01:01:11,246 --> 01:01:15,186
(He finally moves as soon as he hears Dong Il's voice.)

1439
01:01:15,186 --> 01:01:17,516
I've waited for so long to see you.

1440
01:01:17,786 --> 01:01:19,356
We were doing grocery shopping.

1441
01:01:20,925 --> 01:01:24,825
I got some information from my friend yesterday...

1442
01:01:25,695 --> 01:01:28,166
that this region is famous for mushrooms.

1443
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:29,496
- Mushrooms?
- Yes.

1444
01:01:30,266 --> 01:01:31,496
(So I prepared something.)

1445
01:01:31,496 --> 01:01:32,536
We'll get...

1446
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:34,706
the first harvest of pine mushrooms

1447
01:01:34,706 --> 01:01:35,706
(We'll get the first harvest of pine mushrooms later today.)

1448
01:01:35,706 --> 01:01:38,135
Isn't the pine mushroom pretty rare?

1449
01:01:38,135 --> 01:01:39,675
Of course it is.

1450
01:01:40,806 --> 01:01:44,445
(Among the rare pine mushrooms,)

1451
01:01:44,445 --> 01:01:45,845
(the first harvest of pine mushrooms are rarer.)

1452
01:01:45,845 --> 01:01:47,016
I asked him for it especially for today.

1453
01:01:48,016 --> 01:01:49,445
(Calling his friend whom he asked a favor)

1454
01:01:49,445 --> 01:01:52,856
You know, I imitate him to speak in the dialect.

1455
01:01:52,856 --> 01:01:54,755
(I imitate him to speak in the Chungcheong dialect.)

1456
01:01:55,425 --> 01:01:56,726
- Hello?
- Hello, it's me.

1457
01:01:57,086 --> 01:01:58,525
- Hi.
- Are you feeding?

1458
01:01:59,095 --> 01:02:00,095
I'm done feeding.

1459
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:01,496
You're already done? Well...

1460
01:02:02,095 --> 01:02:04,036
Are you going to bring things here today?

1461
01:02:04,036 --> 01:02:06,795
Zucchini and so on...

1462
01:02:07,405 --> 01:02:08,766
Yes, I will.

1463
01:02:09,235 --> 01:02:10,706
- Okay.
- Some Cheongyang chilies.

1464
01:02:11,206 --> 01:02:13,735
- Onions, scallions, and cinnamon.
- Yes.

1465
01:02:13,735 --> 01:02:14,945
Two chickens.

1466
01:02:14,945 --> 01:02:17,715
Don't forget the pine mushrooms too.

1467
01:02:18,775 --> 01:02:19,845
Okay.

1468
01:02:20,345 --> 01:02:22,316
Do you want me to prepare them a little bit?

1469
01:02:22,586 --> 01:02:24,456
Watch your pronunciation.

1470
01:02:25,755 --> 01:02:26,755
Seriously.

1471
01:02:26,755 --> 01:02:28,686
Just bring them as they are. With earth on them.

1472
01:02:30,255 --> 01:02:31,856
I didn't know you had these shoes.

1473
01:02:31,856 --> 01:02:33,025
Yes, I have all different kinds.

1474
01:02:33,025 --> 01:02:34,095
- Hello.
- Hello.

1475
01:02:35,025 --> 01:02:36,396
- Hello.
- Hello.

1476
01:02:36,396 --> 01:02:38,496
- He's with us in this season.
- Hello.

1477
01:02:38,865 --> 01:02:41,365
- Let's have a look.
- The pine mushrooms.

1478
01:02:41,365 --> 01:02:42,606
Come more to this side.

1479
01:02:42,606 --> 01:02:43,666
These are...

1480
01:02:43,666 --> 01:02:45,905
the first harvest of pine mushrooms I was talking about.

1481
01:02:46,775 --> 01:02:48,945
It's even harder to find the wild ones.

1482
01:02:48,945 --> 01:02:51,016
(They're preciously wrapped in a newspaper.)

1483
01:02:51,615 --> 01:02:53,985
(Eye-catching)

1484
01:02:54,586 --> 01:02:55,686
There are just two.

1485
01:02:55,945 --> 01:02:56,985
(Dong Il's friend harvested them himself.)

1486
01:02:56,985 --> 01:02:59,115
- We need to smell it.
- Yes, go ahead.

1487
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:02,825
(Ha Nee smells the first harvest of pine mushrooms.)

1488
01:03:02,825 --> 01:03:06,095
My gosh. This is unbelievable.

1489
01:03:06,095 --> 01:03:07,595
How is it?

1490
01:03:07,595 --> 01:03:09,726
- This is for...
- For suyuk.

1491
01:03:09,726 --> 01:03:11,295
- It tastes better with apples.
- That one...

1492
01:03:11,635 --> 01:03:12,896
Should I put all of the onions?

1493
01:03:13,295 --> 01:03:15,206
- Yes, just cut them in half, and...
- Okay.

1494
01:03:15,566 --> 01:03:17,876
- Your favorite.
- Cheongyang chilies.

1495
01:03:17,876 --> 01:03:19,075
- He knows what I like.
- Of course.

1496
01:03:19,306 --> 01:03:21,746
- I grew all of them.
- Amazing.

1497
01:03:21,746 --> 01:03:22,775
(He's surprised that Dong Il's friend is so generous.)

1498
01:03:23,005 --> 01:03:25,775
You two can talk. We'll start washing these.

1499
01:03:25,775 --> 01:03:26,845
Really?

1500
01:03:26,976 --> 01:03:28,545
- Here...
- Hee Won, you can sit here.

1501
01:03:28,545 --> 01:03:30,786
We can do this. Don't worry about it.

1502
01:03:31,255 --> 01:03:33,885
Ha Nee, leave the rice cake there.

1503
01:03:34,325 --> 01:03:36,425
- We just need to...
- I'll leave some outside for now.

1504
01:03:36,425 --> 01:03:38,595
- We can just keep them outside.
- I think so.

1505
01:03:38,595 --> 01:03:39,956
- Is that so?
- Because tomorrow...

1506
01:03:39,956 --> 01:03:42,195
Then we can put one in the freezer, and leave one outside.

1507
01:03:42,195 --> 01:03:43,726
- Just one...
- There's no space for it.

1508
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,365
- In the freezer?
- The freezer is...

1509
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:47,865
- Here.
- Okay.

1510
01:03:49,505 --> 01:03:51,436
Hee Won, you can go sit there. We can do this.

1511
01:03:51,436 --> 01:03:52,806
I don't know him, actually.

1512
01:03:53,635 --> 01:03:54,706
Why are you doing this to me?

1513
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:55,746
(I don't know him!)

1514
01:03:56,976 --> 01:03:59,445
(Hee Won...)

1515
01:04:02,086 --> 01:04:03,086
Come on, Hee Won.

1516
01:04:03,845 --> 01:04:05,115
(Feeling nervous)

1517
01:04:05,115 --> 01:04:06,755
- Hee Won.
- I feel awkward too.

1518
01:04:07,356 --> 01:04:08,356
I feel awkward.

1519
01:04:08,525 --> 01:04:10,155
That was why...

1520
01:04:10,155 --> 01:04:11,155
(He feels lost.)

1521
01:04:11,155 --> 01:04:12,795
Why did you keep...

1522
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:14,666
So you came inside to put this in the freezer.

1523
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:16,325
Why did you make me feel like I have nowhere to go?

1524
01:04:16,325 --> 01:04:18,496
(Why did you keep pushing me away?)

1525
01:04:18,496 --> 01:04:21,266
I mean, I appreciate that he brought everything for us, but...

1526
01:04:21,266 --> 01:04:23,905
(He's so funny.)

1527
01:04:25,235 --> 01:04:27,275
Gosh, this is so funny.

1528
01:04:27,275 --> 01:04:29,905
(Now that he has something to do inside, he feels relieved.)

1529
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:32,445
(Myoung is manning the sink.)

1530
01:04:32,445 --> 01:04:34,345
How long will it take?

1531
01:04:35,686 --> 01:04:38,715
(He pulls out the ingredients Dong Il's friend gave.)

1532
01:04:41,356 --> 01:04:45,056
(He starts to wash them right away.)

1533
01:04:46,126 --> 01:04:47,865
Myoung, can you wash this as well?

1534
01:04:47,865 --> 01:04:49,066
- It needs to be washed?
- Yes, please.

1535
01:04:49,066 --> 01:04:50,066
Okay!

1536
01:04:51,595 --> 01:04:54,036
You seem like you've been already here many times.

1537
01:04:54,936 --> 01:04:57,266
- Me?
- You adapted to this place so fast.

1538
01:04:57,266 --> 01:04:58,775
- He's fast.
- Yes.

1539
01:04:59,936 --> 01:05:01,345
Everyone, he's leaving.

1540
01:05:01,345 --> 01:05:03,845
You stay there and just say bye.

1541
01:05:03,845 --> 01:05:06,575
- Have a good one.
- Thank you.

1542
01:05:06,575 --> 01:05:08,385
- Thank you, take care.
- Thanks.

1543
01:05:08,385 --> 01:05:10,215
(Thank you for the ingredients!)

1544
01:05:10,485 --> 01:05:13,186
(While they're seeing him off...)

1545
01:05:14,485 --> 01:05:17,325
- We should cut them in half.
- Yes, let's cut them in half.

1546
01:05:17,325 --> 01:05:18,396
(Ha Nee's prepping the ingredients with Myoung.)

1547
01:05:19,825 --> 01:05:22,025
You can turn up the water.

1548
01:05:22,025 --> 01:05:23,396
Water? It's not running.

1549
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:26,836
It was okay a while ago.

1550
01:05:26,836 --> 01:05:28,066
(Confused)

1551
01:05:28,436 --> 01:05:29,436
Maybe...

1552
01:05:29,436 --> 01:05:31,235
(It seems he remembers something.)

1553
01:05:33,775 --> 01:05:35,275
Wait. Is this right?

1554
01:05:35,275 --> 01:05:37,005
(Ha Nee, just a moment!)

1555
01:05:37,945 --> 01:05:41,615
(He's filling the water for the first time after the practice.)

1556
01:05:42,286 --> 01:05:43,545
Ha Nee, did you leave the water on?

1557
01:05:43,545 --> 01:05:44,786
(Is the water running now?)

1558
01:05:44,786 --> 01:05:45,786
Is the water on now?

1559
01:05:46,286 --> 01:05:47,786
Yes. Gosh!

1560
01:05:49,126 --> 01:05:51,195
(Exclaiming)

1561
01:05:51,396 --> 01:05:52,556
It's good now.

1562
01:05:52,956 --> 01:05:55,066
The water pressure's great now.

1563
01:05:55,566 --> 01:05:56,996
- Good. It's pouring.
- Yes.

1564
01:05:56,996 --> 01:05:59,066
(Pouring)

1565
01:05:59,436 --> 01:06:00,666
You're the best, Myoung.

1566
01:06:01,365 --> 01:06:03,235
The water! Gosh, you learn so fast.

1567
01:06:03,235 --> 01:06:04,675
(Dong Il and Hee won are back.)

1568
01:06:04,936 --> 01:06:06,005
Yes, you got that right.

1569
01:06:06,005 --> 01:06:07,876
(Smiling)

1570
01:06:08,905 --> 01:06:12,275
(Now he starts to prepare for dinner.)

1571
01:06:12,275 --> 01:06:13,575
- Dong Il.
- Yes?

1572
01:06:13,575 --> 01:06:15,586
It needs to be cut for later,

1573
01:06:15,586 --> 01:06:16,646
- and this...
- This.

1574
01:06:16,885 --> 01:06:19,155
- Do we need this to boil the meat?
- Yes, right.

1575
01:06:19,155 --> 01:06:23,525
(Today's dinner, Pork suyuk with jeotgal from the cave)

1576
01:06:23,885 --> 01:06:24,956
- Put them here.
- Here...

1577
01:06:24,956 --> 01:06:26,226
- Here?
- Yes, go ahead.

1578
01:06:26,356 --> 01:06:27,666
You should cut the onions in half.

1579
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:28,965
- I already did.
- Great.

1580
01:06:30,226 --> 01:06:33,735
(Apples can be cut in many pieces.)

1581
01:06:34,266 --> 01:06:35,706
I should cut them smaller.

1582
01:06:35,706 --> 01:06:37,876
Yes, so that more juices come out.

1583
01:06:37,876 --> 01:06:39,135
(Meticulous)

1584
01:06:39,976 --> 01:06:43,075
- I see. Yes.
- Put this in there.

1585
01:06:43,075 --> 01:06:44,816
(She cuts all the scallions at once.)

1586
01:06:44,816 --> 01:06:45,845
Then...

1587
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:48,086
(In awe)

1588
01:06:48,086 --> 01:06:49,715
She must be good at cooking.

1589
01:06:49,715 --> 01:06:51,255
How does she do everything so easily?

1590
01:06:51,586 --> 01:06:54,155
- Me? I like to cook.
- Yes.

1591
01:06:54,425 --> 01:06:55,956
Hold on. With this...

1592
01:06:56,456 --> 01:06:57,856
Are we going to use these two tomorrow?

1593
01:06:57,856 --> 01:06:58,856
Let's just use these two.

1594
01:07:00,025 --> 01:07:02,896
(Chef Sung steps in.)

1595
01:07:02,896 --> 01:07:06,235
Let's put some doenjang in so that the pork doesn't smell.

1596
01:07:08,806 --> 01:07:12,976
(He adds bay leaves to get rid of any odors.)

1597
01:07:13,306 --> 01:07:15,405
(He even adds licorice.)

1598
01:07:15,405 --> 01:07:18,775
The boiled meat will taste incredibly unique.

1599
01:07:18,775 --> 01:07:20,775
It's incredible.

1600
01:07:21,885 --> 01:07:23,916
- It's incredible.
- She's more easygoing than me.

1601
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:25,615
No. I'm not, sir.

1602
01:07:26,856 --> 01:07:30,356
(While the special broth is boiling...)

1603
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:32,495
Dong Il, look how pretty these peaches are.

1604
01:07:32,495 --> 01:07:33,955
(Look how pretty these peaches are.)

1605
01:07:33,955 --> 01:07:36,396
- Are these the ones we bought?
- Yes. Do you want some?

1606
01:07:36,866 --> 01:07:39,295
- Is this glutinous rice?
- Yes.

1607
01:07:39,295 --> 01:07:40,696
(Dong Il takes a bite.)

1608
01:07:40,696 --> 01:07:42,965
(Hee Won takes a bite.)

1609
01:07:44,035 --> 01:07:45,276
(They take some time to eat peaches.)

1610
01:07:45,276 --> 01:07:48,306
(I'll take a bite too.)

1611
01:07:49,646 --> 01:07:51,845
Gosh, this is good.

1612
01:07:54,415 --> 01:07:56,345
They're autumn peaches.

1613
01:07:56,345 --> 01:07:58,255
(They satiate their hunger with autumn peaches.)

1614
01:07:58,255 --> 01:07:59,415
- It's good.
- It is.

1615
01:08:01,056 --> 01:08:03,585
(Why won't this open?)

1616
01:08:04,656 --> 01:08:07,196
(The top for the rice is sealed tightly.)

1617
01:08:07,665 --> 01:08:09,396
(Give it to me.)

1618
01:08:09,766 --> 01:08:11,035
(He opens it right away.)

1619
01:08:11,035 --> 01:08:13,035
Gosh, I would've been in trouble if it weren't for you.

1620
01:08:13,665 --> 01:08:15,766
It would've been dull if it were just me and Hee Won.

1621
01:08:16,806 --> 01:08:18,276
You made it better. Don't you think?

1622
01:08:18,276 --> 01:08:20,406
(Is he talking about me?)

1623
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,745
- I'll wash it.
- No, it's okay.

1624
01:08:24,476 --> 01:08:25,745
We don't let our guests do any work.

1625
01:08:26,316 --> 01:08:27,316
What?

1626
01:08:27,715 --> 01:08:29,245
We don't let our guests do any work. Sorry.

1627
01:08:29,646 --> 01:08:31,816
- You've been doing all the work.
- It's okay.

1628
01:08:32,986 --> 01:08:34,726
There's something nice about doing work.

1629
01:08:34,726 --> 01:08:35,856
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

1630
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:38,095
We sanitized the area.

1631
01:08:40,255 --> 01:08:41,625
If there are too many mosquitoes, we'll come back in.

1632
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:42,896
(Biting)

1633
01:08:42,896 --> 01:08:43,925
Coarse salt.

1634
01:08:44,226 --> 01:08:47,705
(This is the happiness one feels from feeding their family.)

1635
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:49,606
- Take the fruit out and eat.
- Okay.

1636
01:08:49,936 --> 01:08:51,005
Go have a seat. We're almost done.

1637
01:08:51,005 --> 01:08:52,005
Have a seat.

1638
01:08:52,005 --> 01:08:53,535
- We're done.
- We just need to cook the rice.

1639
01:08:53,535 --> 01:08:55,146
- Go take a seat.
- Okay.

1640
01:08:55,146 --> 01:08:56,745
Hey, Hee Won. Entertain our guest.

1641
01:08:57,406 --> 01:08:58,875
- Hee Won.
- Come here.

1642
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:00,076
Okay.

1643
01:09:00,616 --> 01:09:02,285
You just need to come here.

1644
01:09:02,285 --> 01:09:03,345
He's entertaining the guest.

1645
01:09:03,345 --> 01:09:04,656
(Kim Hee Won, In charge of entertaining guests)

1646
01:09:04,816 --> 01:09:07,356
(I'll be right out.)

1647
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:10,955
(She was planning on going right out,)

1648
01:09:11,495 --> 01:09:14,366
(but she can't seem to walk away.)

1649
01:09:14,366 --> 01:09:16,066
Should I wash the vegetables?

1650
01:09:16,066 --> 01:09:17,165
- No, it's okay.
- For the wraps.

1651
01:09:17,965 --> 01:09:18,965
I'll wash this.

1652
01:09:20,066 --> 01:09:21,436
Should I plate the jeotgal?

1653
01:09:22,465 --> 01:09:24,976
I'm going to put the ingredients for the baeksuk in the refrigerator.

1654
01:09:24,976 --> 01:09:25,976
(She keeps looking for things to do.)

1655
01:09:26,635 --> 01:09:28,606
I told you to make sure the guest doesn't work. Hee Won.

1656
01:09:28,606 --> 01:09:29,606
Yes?

1657
01:09:30,505 --> 01:09:32,215
What can I do? It's not like I can tie her down.

1658
01:09:32,215 --> 01:09:33,845
We have Cheongyang chilis too.

1659
01:09:33,845 --> 01:09:34,885
It's not like I can tie her down.

1660
01:09:34,885 --> 01:09:36,986
We have Cheongyang chilis too.

1661
01:09:36,986 --> 01:09:38,516
- But this...
- Do you want a different type?

1662
01:09:38,516 --> 01:09:41,955
Crispy green chilis and green chili chilis are different.

1663
01:09:42,385 --> 01:09:44,656
- Then...
- He said you should rest.

1664
01:09:44,656 --> 01:09:45,925
You're putting me in a tight spot.

1665
01:09:45,925 --> 01:09:46,995
(If you keep working, I'll be in a tight spot.)

1666
01:09:46,995 --> 01:09:48,526
- What?
- If you keep working,

1667
01:09:48,826 --> 01:09:50,266
I'll be put in a tight spot.

1668
01:09:50,266 --> 01:09:52,366
(She's the type who can't sit still.)

1669
01:09:52,366 --> 01:09:53,736
I'm almost done.

1670
01:09:53,835 --> 01:09:56,266
What are you doing? You're putting us in a tight spot.

1671
01:09:56,366 --> 01:09:58,076
I'll do it. Give it to me.

1672
01:09:58,406 --> 01:09:59,476
The trash goes here.

1673
01:09:59,476 --> 01:10:00,576
(The guest finally leaves the kitchen.)

1674
01:10:01,045 --> 01:10:03,005
We didn't take the ice box out of the car yet. Right?

1675
01:10:03,505 --> 01:10:05,345
- The ice box?
- Yes, we have to take it out.

1676
01:10:05,345 --> 01:10:07,045
Bring the ice box. The meat is in there.

1677
01:10:07,816 --> 01:10:09,446
- Is this for us?
- Yes.

1678
01:10:11,715 --> 01:10:13,156
I made a special order for this.

1679
01:10:13,156 --> 01:10:14,356
(The pork that Dong Il put in a special order for)

1680
01:10:14,885 --> 01:10:16,026
(Curious)

1681
01:10:16,026 --> 01:10:17,156
What is that?

1682
01:10:17,726 --> 01:10:18,896
He said it's the meat.

1683
01:10:18,896 --> 01:10:20,226
(He opens the box of meat.)

1684
01:10:20,226 --> 01:10:22,066
(What is this?)

1685
01:10:22,925 --> 01:10:25,066
- What is this? This is seaweed.
- Seaweed?

1686
01:10:25,066 --> 01:10:26,236
Seaweed.

1687
01:10:26,995 --> 01:10:28,705
(It's not seaweed. It's kelp.)

1688
01:10:28,705 --> 01:10:31,276
For when we eat wraps. We can eat it with the doenjang we got.

1689
01:10:31,705 --> 01:10:34,776
We can cut this up and eat it with the meat later.

1690
01:10:35,545 --> 01:10:37,745
- Is this for wraps?
- Yes, it is.

1691
01:10:38,076 --> 01:10:40,516
- This is really good.
- Gosh, look at this.

1692
01:10:40,516 --> 01:10:42,986
- It's my favorite.
- Is that why we don't have cabbage?

1693
01:10:43,816 --> 01:10:44,885
Give me the meat.

1694
01:10:44,885 --> 01:10:47,656
Gosh, the ingredients are incredible.

1695
01:10:48,226 --> 01:10:50,285
Nose ridge? This is incredible.

1696
01:10:50,285 --> 01:10:52,125
(There are cuts that are unfamiliar.)

1697
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:53,826
They sent us a variety of cuts.

1698
01:10:56,095 --> 01:11:01,205
(Among the various cuts of pork,)

1699
01:11:02,005 --> 01:11:04,535
(there are special cuts that are so good...)

1700
01:11:04,535 --> 01:11:07,076
(you'd hide them from others.)

1701
01:11:07,076 --> 01:11:09,576
(Pork head, cheek)

1702
01:11:09,845 --> 01:11:12,375
(Spare rib roast)

1703
01:11:12,675 --> 01:11:15,516
(The cuts of the back meat have a variety of charms.)

1704
01:11:16,415 --> 01:11:20,785
(You can stir-fry it with a spicy sauce.)

1705
01:11:22,085 --> 01:11:28,396
(It also tastes good when you boil it.)

1706
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:32,595
It says that butchers used to sneak this out back...

1707
01:11:32,595 --> 01:11:34,965
- because it was so good.
- This?

1708
01:11:34,965 --> 01:11:36,965
- Yes.
- That's what we got.

1709
01:11:37,406 --> 01:11:38,736
- They would eat it themselves.
- Gosh.

1710
01:11:38,736 --> 01:11:42,005
We usually only use one cut of meat for bossam,

1711
01:11:42,005 --> 01:11:44,946
but we're going to use different cuts and try everything.

1712
01:11:44,946 --> 01:11:46,845
I've never had this kind of bossam before.

1713
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:48,116
Right? Me neither.

1714
01:11:49,486 --> 01:11:51,186
- It's a delicacy.
- Right.

1715
01:11:51,186 --> 01:11:54,215
(Whole collar meat)

1716
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:58,326
- Pork head.
- Pork head.

1717
01:11:58,795 --> 01:12:00,755
- Don't you usually grill that?
- You can.

1718
01:12:01,795 --> 01:12:03,595
Since these are special cuts...

1719
01:12:04,066 --> 01:12:05,635
The nose ridge looks really good.

1720
01:12:05,635 --> 01:12:06,835
(Nose ridge)

1721
01:12:10,566 --> 01:12:11,906
(Spare rib roast)

1722
01:12:11,906 --> 01:12:13,035
Spare rib roast.

1723
01:12:13,035 --> 01:12:14,505
This is insane.

1724
01:12:14,505 --> 01:12:16,406
Let's take this outside.

1725
01:12:16,646 --> 01:12:19,045
Give it to me.

1726
01:12:19,045 --> 01:12:20,946
- Guests shouldn't work. Don't move.
- Give it to me.

1727
01:12:20,946 --> 01:12:22,345
- Give it to me.
- Gosh, my back.

1728
01:12:22,345 --> 01:12:24,385
(There are exceptions sometimes.)

1729
01:12:26,356 --> 01:12:28,486
(Safely filmed with permission from the owner and the local government)

1730
01:12:28,486 --> 01:12:30,526
Is it coming out?

1731
01:12:30,755 --> 01:12:32,125
I need to wash the kelp.

1732
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:33,295
Should we leave this?

1733
01:12:33,425 --> 01:12:34,965
Where should I put the kelp after I wash it?

1734
01:12:34,965 --> 01:12:35,995
Should I do it?

1735
01:12:36,366 --> 01:12:39,165
(She rinses it to get rid of some of the saltiness.)

1736
01:12:39,566 --> 01:12:40,835
I'll squeeze the water out before I give it to you.

1737
01:12:40,835 --> 01:12:42,736
- You're going to squeeze it?
- And you can cut it over there.

1738
01:12:43,266 --> 01:12:44,465
- Cut it?
- Of course.

1739
01:12:46,175 --> 01:12:47,875
- Hey.
- Yes?

1740
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:50,406
Can you give me a sheet of paper towel?

1741
01:12:50,406 --> 01:12:51,476
"Chicken towel"?

1742
01:12:51,946 --> 01:12:53,016
("Chicken towel"?)

1743
01:12:53,016 --> 01:12:54,045
Okay.

1744
01:12:55,085 --> 01:12:56,745
- I'm sweating.
- What did you say?

1745
01:12:56,745 --> 01:12:57,816
What?

1746
01:12:58,486 --> 01:12:59,516
(Hold on. What did you say?)

1747
01:12:59,516 --> 01:13:01,116
- "Chicken towel"?
- What?

1748
01:13:01,116 --> 01:13:02,885
Did you say chicken towel instead of kitchen towel?

1749
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:04,755
(Embarrassed)

1750
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:06,125
- I said chicken.
- Hey.

1751
01:13:06,755 --> 01:13:07,826
Hey.

1752
01:13:08,196 --> 01:13:09,326
What are you saying to the guest?

1753
01:13:09,326 --> 01:13:11,995
- I'm sorry.
- When we were young,

1754
01:13:11,995 --> 01:13:15,035
- we all called it chicken towel.
- Hee Won. He's teasing me!

1755
01:13:15,035 --> 01:13:16,465
- What?
- We all said that.

1756
01:13:16,465 --> 01:13:18,806
- We called it chicken towel.
- He's teasing me!

1757
01:13:18,806 --> 01:13:20,135
(What's going on?)

1758
01:13:20,135 --> 01:13:21,875
- He's teasing me!
- No!

1759
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:22,976
Hee Won!

1760
01:13:23,946 --> 01:13:25,375
- He...
- Hee Won.

1761
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:27,375
said something to her about calling it chicken towel.

1762
01:13:27,375 --> 01:13:29,585
I told him we all used to call it that back in the day.

1763
01:13:29,585 --> 01:13:31,016
Hee Won!

1764
01:13:31,215 --> 01:13:33,915
- Gosh, you don't change.
- It's not true.

1765
01:13:33,915 --> 01:13:36,486
Is this how it's going to be?

1766
01:13:36,785 --> 01:13:38,056
Why are they so funny?

1767
01:13:38,056 --> 01:13:39,226
(They're so funny.)

1768
01:13:40,255 --> 01:13:41,396
Should we cut this in half?

1769
01:13:42,366 --> 01:13:43,495
No, it's okay. I'll do it.

1770
01:13:43,495 --> 01:13:46,936
(She doesn't hesitate and rips it with her hands.)

1771
01:13:47,665 --> 01:13:49,135
You're so good!

1772
01:13:49,135 --> 01:13:50,705
(As expected.)

1773
01:13:51,406 --> 01:13:52,835
- Cut it like this.
- Okay.

1774
01:13:52,835 --> 01:13:54,076
(Cut it like this.)

1775
01:13:56,675 --> 01:13:57,776
(He cuts it.)

1776
01:13:57,776 --> 01:14:00,875
(She pushes it.)

1777
01:14:01,785 --> 01:14:04,545
- It's like a factory.
- I was thinking the same thing.

1778
01:14:04,545 --> 01:14:06,656
(I was thinking the same thing.)

1779
01:14:09,656 --> 01:14:13,156
(They have perfect chemistry.)

1780
01:14:13,755 --> 01:14:15,965
(Hold on.)

1781
01:14:16,925 --> 01:14:18,035
I knew you would eat it.

1782
01:14:18,696 --> 01:14:19,766
I knew it.

1783
01:14:19,766 --> 01:14:22,535
(I knew you would eat it.)

1784
01:14:22,766 --> 01:14:24,936
As soon as you grabbed it,

1785
01:14:25,205 --> 01:14:26,705
I figured you would eat it.

1786
01:14:26,705 --> 01:14:28,505
(He knows what she'll do because they're close.)

1787
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:31,415
Hey. It tastes like the ocean. Taste it.

1788
01:14:31,516 --> 01:14:34,276
(Gong Myoung follows Ha Nee's lead and tastes it too.)

1789
01:14:34,276 --> 01:14:35,316
Right?

1790
01:14:35,715 --> 01:14:36,785
It's nice and salty.

1791
01:14:37,016 --> 01:14:38,715
- I want to eat it with rice.
- I know.

1792
01:14:38,715 --> 01:14:40,116
(They work together.)

1793
01:14:40,116 --> 01:14:42,455
This will be really good for our stomachs.

1794
01:14:45,396 --> 01:14:49,495
(Should I check to see if the meat is boiling well?)

1795
01:14:51,366 --> 01:14:53,295
(Exclaiming)

1796
01:14:53,665 --> 01:14:54,665
Gosh, it's hot!

1797
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:58,106
(The suyuk is boiling.)

1798
01:14:59,175 --> 01:15:00,505
Should I plate the jeotgal?

1799
01:15:02,976 --> 01:15:06,276
(She plates it with a reverent heart.)

1800
01:15:07,175 --> 01:15:09,885
(The doenjang from the cave)

1801
01:15:11,455 --> 01:15:12,785
(Today's main dish, cave jeotgal)

1802
01:15:12,785 --> 01:15:14,215
Today's main dish is the jeotgal.

1803
01:15:15,856 --> 01:15:19,026
(He is drooling.)

1804
01:15:19,396 --> 01:15:23,226
Plus, the shrimp jeotgal we have has been fermenting for eight years.

1805
01:15:23,226 --> 01:15:27,095
(We have shrimp jeotgal that has been fermenting for eight years.)

1806
01:15:28,505 --> 01:15:31,675
- Gosh, the jeotgal looks good.
- I know.

1807
01:15:34,106 --> 01:15:35,306
(Once they cut up the first harvest of pine mushrooms,)

1808
01:15:35,306 --> 01:15:36,306
How precious.

1809
01:15:38,345 --> 01:15:39,345
(All that's left is the meat.)

1810
01:15:39,345 --> 01:15:41,116
(Let me see.)

1811
01:15:41,845 --> 01:15:45,116
(The meat might take a bit longer.)

1812
01:15:45,455 --> 01:15:48,085
Everyone gather around. Hey. Where's our youngest member?

1813
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:50,356
The meat is going to take a little bit longer,

1814
01:15:50,356 --> 01:15:51,795
so let's go pick some pumpkin leaves.

1815
01:15:51,795 --> 01:15:52,795
(While the suyuk cooks, let's pick pumpkin leaves.)

1816
01:15:52,795 --> 01:15:54,425
- You want to pick pumpkin leaves?
- We have to pick them?

1817
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,495
(What?)

1818
01:15:56,726 --> 01:15:59,066
It's right out back. Behind the house. Come on.

1819
01:16:00,095 --> 01:16:02,835
(Really?)

1820
01:16:03,135 --> 01:16:04,776
- I want to see.
- Who likes pumpkin leaves?

1821
01:16:04,776 --> 01:16:06,135
- Me!
- Me!

1822
01:16:06,135 --> 01:16:07,535
I like pumpkin leaves too.

1823
01:16:07,535 --> 01:16:09,175
- Really? What about you?
- I do too!

1824
01:16:09,175 --> 01:16:11,446
- It's prickly but soft.
- Me too.

1825
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:12,476
I love it.

1826
01:16:12,476 --> 01:16:15,245
If we eat it with the hairtail jeotgal... It's the perfect match.

1827
01:16:15,245 --> 01:16:16,316
- Gosh.
- There are pumpkin leaves there?

1828
01:16:17,415 --> 01:16:18,455
Over there.

1829
01:16:19,285 --> 01:16:22,125
- Oh, my.
- It's back here like this?

1830
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:23,925
- There's a little garden.
- Oh, my.

1831
01:16:23,925 --> 01:16:26,196
(Shall we pick some pumpkin leaves?)

1832
01:16:26,196 --> 01:16:28,896
- The leaves are big.
- Pumpkin leaves

1833
01:16:29,495 --> 01:16:31,835
- Pumpkin leaves.
- Okay.

1834
01:16:33,236 --> 01:16:34,295
The ones here are fresh.

1835
01:16:34,335 --> 01:16:36,035
- The pumpkin leaves?
- Over here.

1836
01:16:36,035 --> 01:16:38,005
- The green leaves.
- How do you pick these?

1837
01:16:38,005 --> 01:16:39,236
Just pick them with your hands.

1838
01:16:39,906 --> 01:16:40,976
Just with my hands?

1839
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:43,345
- What part?
- Pick this part.

1840
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:44,816
- This?
- Yes, there.

1841
01:16:44,816 --> 01:16:46,316
You can just cut it off with your fingernails.

1842
01:16:46,316 --> 01:16:47,576
(Just pick it at the stem.)

1843
01:16:47,576 --> 01:16:49,316
It's prickly,

1844
01:16:49,316 --> 01:16:51,186
- You have to be careful. Let's...
- so don't do it without gloves.

1845
01:16:51,186 --> 01:16:53,986
- Let's share gloves.
- Okay.

1846
01:16:54,556 --> 01:16:56,556
I'll just pick them myself.

1847
01:16:56,556 --> 01:16:57,925
I can pick them.

1848
01:16:58,095 --> 01:16:59,095
Really?

1849
01:16:59,425 --> 01:17:02,566
Hee Won. Don't pick the ones that are as big as your face.

1850
01:17:02,925 --> 01:17:05,196
Pick the ones that are as big as the palm of your mom's hand.

1851
01:17:05,766 --> 01:17:07,795
- Over here.
- Ones as big as my mom's hand?

1852
01:17:09,205 --> 01:17:11,035
The ones that are as big as an adult hand are good.

1853
01:17:11,035 --> 01:17:12,705
They're not too tough, and they're soft.

1854
01:17:12,705 --> 01:17:14,535
- Not the big ones.
- Not the big ones.

1855
01:17:14,535 --> 01:17:15,946
Something about this big?

1856
01:17:15,946 --> 01:17:18,476
- Yes.
- About this big. The young ones.

1857
01:17:18,476 --> 01:17:19,476
You're good indeed.

1858
01:17:20,616 --> 01:17:23,045
(They have a big pile.)

1859
01:17:23,516 --> 01:17:25,016
That's enough, Mom. Not "Mom".

1860
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:26,755
He called her "Mom".

1861
01:17:27,516 --> 01:17:29,056
That's enough, Mom. Not "Mom".

1862
01:17:29,056 --> 01:17:30,785
He called her "Mom".

1863
01:17:31,186 --> 01:17:33,526
- Is this enough?
- Did you just hear him?

1864
01:17:33,526 --> 01:17:34,526
(He called her "Mom" by accident.)

1865
01:17:34,925 --> 01:17:35,965
- Right.
- My position...

1866
01:17:35,965 --> 01:17:38,566
- Enough!
- Enough!

1867
01:17:38,965 --> 01:17:40,436
- Hey, Youngest.
- Yes?

1868
01:17:40,436 --> 01:17:41,505
Let me...

1869
01:17:42,106 --> 01:17:44,035
and Hee Won just say one thing.

1870
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:47,505
(Me too?)

1871
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:49,476
Who would you want as your father?

1872
01:17:49,476 --> 01:17:50,906
Just say it comfortably. It's okay.

1873
01:17:51,406 --> 01:17:52,745
Who would you want to be your father?

1874
01:17:52,745 --> 01:17:53,816
(Who would you choose as your father?)

1875
01:17:54,016 --> 01:17:56,345
- Don't answer.
- You have to be the mom.

1876
01:17:56,345 --> 01:17:59,156
- It's as hard as "Do you like..." - Don't answer.

1877
01:17:59,156 --> 01:18:00,415
- "your mom or your dad?" - It's just...

1878
01:18:00,415 --> 01:18:02,726
Come back. Listen to his answer. I think I have a chance.

1879
01:18:03,486 --> 01:18:06,125
- I'm afraid you might get hurt.
- I think I have a chance.

1880
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:07,125
Come here.

1881
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:09,396
- Come here.
- Dong Il.

1882
01:18:09,396 --> 01:18:10,965
- I'm afraid you'll get hurt.
- It's okay.

1883
01:18:11,165 --> 01:18:12,665
Based on our image...

1884
01:18:12,665 --> 01:18:14,766
in movies and dramas,

1885
01:18:15,035 --> 01:18:16,665
which one would you want as a dad?

1886
01:18:16,665 --> 01:18:18,335
Do you want a dad who swings metal pipes?

1887
01:18:18,335 --> 01:18:21,106
Or do you want a dad who can cry with his kid?

1888
01:18:21,106 --> 01:18:23,076
You can choose. It's okay.

1889
01:18:23,675 --> 01:18:25,845
We're comfortable people. Let's accept any result,

1890
01:18:25,845 --> 01:18:27,675
okay?

1891
01:18:28,186 --> 01:18:29,516
(Let's accept any result.)

1892
01:18:29,516 --> 01:18:31,486
(Of course.)

1893
01:18:32,585 --> 01:18:33,656
I choose...

1894
01:18:35,186 --> 01:18:38,026
(I'm sure he'd choose me.)

1895
01:18:38,326 --> 01:18:41,156
(Dong Il is going to get hurt.)

1896
01:18:41,156 --> 01:18:42,226
Yes?

1897
01:18:42,226 --> 01:18:43,896
I choose Hee Won.

1898
01:18:43,995 --> 01:18:46,266
(Turning)

1899
01:18:49,665 --> 01:18:52,476
(Disappointed)

1900
01:18:52,476 --> 01:18:53,976
I choose Hee Won.

1901
01:18:55,106 --> 01:18:58,816
(He's trying to keep a straight face.)

1902
01:18:58,816 --> 01:18:59,915
I'll carry this for you.

1903
01:18:59,915 --> 01:19:02,986
- Oh, my. Honey.
- It's heavy, right? I'll carry it.

1904
01:19:03,245 --> 01:19:04,245
I'll carry this for you.

1905
01:19:04,245 --> 01:19:06,255
(Laughing)

1906
01:19:06,255 --> 01:19:07,455
- I'll carry it.
- Honey.

1907
01:19:07,486 --> 01:19:08,526
- Let's go.
- Be careful.

1908
01:19:08,526 --> 01:19:09,755
- Be careful, honey.
- Honey.

1909
01:19:09,755 --> 01:19:11,955
The grass is very dangerous.

1910
01:19:12,226 --> 01:19:13,625
The grass is...

1911
01:19:13,925 --> 01:19:16,965
I hope my wife and kids don't see this.

1912
01:19:16,965 --> 01:19:18,125
(Laughing)

1913
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:19,135
Okay.

1914
01:19:19,135 --> 01:19:20,396
(Bitter)

1915
01:19:20,396 --> 01:19:22,306
The more I look around, the nicer this place gets.

1916
01:19:22,306 --> 01:19:24,665
- I agree.
- It's really nice.

1917
01:19:25,736 --> 01:19:28,175
Look at the sunset.

1918
01:19:29,545 --> 01:19:32,816
(The sun begins to go down,)

1919
01:19:32,816 --> 01:19:37,215
(and the sunset paints the sky.)

1920
01:19:37,385 --> 01:19:38,686
What I'm excited about is...

1921
01:19:38,686 --> 01:19:42,455
There isn't a cloud in the sky, so I'm excited to see...

1922
01:19:42,455 --> 01:19:44,385
if the moon really shines between the mountains.

1923
01:19:44,385 --> 01:19:45,495
(Since there are no clouds, will we see the moon between the mountains?)

1924
01:19:45,495 --> 01:19:48,665
Will the moon shine between the mountains here?

1925
01:19:49,226 --> 01:19:52,635
If we can't see the moon, we can just get closer.

1926
01:19:53,165 --> 01:19:54,465
We can stand in a place where the moon shines in between.

1927
01:19:54,766 --> 01:19:56,465
- Right.
- We can do that.

1928
01:19:56,465 --> 01:19:58,165
- He's gotten really smart.
- We can do that.

1929
01:19:58,165 --> 01:20:00,276
- We can move until we see it.
- Sounds good.

1930
01:20:00,276 --> 01:20:02,705
- We could move to see it.
- Until it's between them.

1931
01:20:04,606 --> 01:20:05,646
Sounds good.

1932
01:20:05,646 --> 01:20:07,516
(Will they be able to see the moon on Wollyu Peak?)

1933
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:09,116
We have to boil these.

1934
01:20:09,285 --> 01:20:11,516
- Should I wash it first?
- Yes, you should.

1935
01:20:11,516 --> 01:20:13,016
(The father is in charge of washing the pumpkin leaves.)

1936
01:20:13,056 --> 01:20:14,455
This looks pretty good.

1937
01:20:15,085 --> 01:20:18,925
(After rinsing them well in running water,)

1938
01:20:19,795 --> 01:20:25,066
(he cuts off the stem so they're easier to eat.)

1939
01:20:26,736 --> 01:20:30,835
(Meanwhile, Dong Il checks on the suyuk.)

1940
01:20:31,005 --> 01:20:32,875
This looks incredible.

1941
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:33,875
(The broth is nice and white.)

1942
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:34,875
This is nice.

1943
01:20:35,306 --> 01:20:37,375
(Should I take the meat out now?)

1944
01:20:37,675 --> 01:20:39,476
- I'll take it out, Dong Il.
- No, it's okay.

1945
01:20:39,915 --> 01:20:41,715
Hold on. Our guests aren't supposed to work.

1946
01:20:41,715 --> 01:20:43,345
- Gosh, Dong Il.
- No.

1947
01:20:43,345 --> 01:20:45,255
- No.
- Gosh, I said it was okay.

1948
01:20:45,255 --> 01:20:47,616
- Give it back.
- No, it's okay.

1949
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,425
- My gosh.
- I'll take it out.

1950
01:20:49,425 --> 01:20:51,226
Go do something more important.

1951
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:53,026
- Go ahead.
- There's nothing to do. Hold on.

1952
01:20:54,696 --> 01:20:55,995
This looks really good.

1953
01:20:55,995 --> 01:20:57,925
This must be a delicacy.

1954
01:20:57,925 --> 01:21:00,366
You don't eat special cuts like this.

1955
01:21:01,066 --> 01:21:02,366
- Where?
- There it is.

1956
01:21:02,366 --> 01:21:03,766
(Exclaiming)

1957
01:21:04,835 --> 01:21:06,276
(The meat is cooked nice and well.)

1958
01:21:06,276 --> 01:21:07,705
My goodness.

1959
01:21:07,705 --> 01:21:09,906
- This is incredible.
- I know.

1960
01:21:11,406 --> 01:21:12,816
Dong Il, try some of this.

1961
01:21:12,816 --> 01:21:14,076
(Dong Il, try some of this.)

1962
01:21:14,616 --> 01:21:15,686
It's hot.

1963
01:21:16,816 --> 01:21:19,116
(Let me see.)

1964
01:21:19,785 --> 01:21:20,785
(In awe)

1965
01:21:20,785 --> 01:21:21,856
What do you think?

1966
01:21:22,486 --> 01:21:25,955
- Is it amazing?
- It's good by itself.

1967
01:21:26,226 --> 01:21:28,566
It's nice and chewy since it has the rind on it.

1968
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:31,196
You're right.

1969
01:21:31,465 --> 01:21:33,635
(Her forehead tells how good it is.)

1970
01:21:33,635 --> 01:21:36,505
- This is amazingly boiled.
- It is.

1971
01:21:36,505 --> 01:21:37,736
(Chewy)

1972
01:21:38,236 --> 01:21:40,335
We boiled this.

1973
01:21:40,335 --> 01:21:43,045
- I think we need a bigger one.
- Here, try some.

1974
01:21:43,545 --> 01:21:45,215
It's hot. Try it.

1975
01:21:46,146 --> 01:21:48,215
We didn't season it separately. We just boiled it in the pot.

1976
01:21:48,215 --> 01:21:49,285
Right.

1977
01:21:50,885 --> 01:21:53,516
- It's not greasy. It's really good.
- It's really good.

1978
01:21:53,516 --> 01:21:54,785
- Isn't it really good?
- Yes.

1979
01:21:55,486 --> 01:21:57,785
- It's incredible, Dong Il.
- Isn't it?

1980
01:21:58,595 --> 01:22:00,295
(Gulping)

1981
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:03,366
- Let's put this aside.
- There you go.

1982
01:22:03,366 --> 01:22:05,766
- Okay, that's good. There's more.
- Okay.

1983
01:22:07,436 --> 01:22:08,736
This looks really good.

1984
01:22:08,736 --> 01:22:10,736
- I think it'll be delicious.
- This is...

1985
01:22:10,736 --> 01:22:13,205
- Nobody eats these like this.
- Since we boiled it...

1986
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:14,936
Nobody really eats them like this.

1987
01:22:15,276 --> 01:22:17,705
We should plate each cut separately.

1988
01:22:17,705 --> 01:22:19,175
We have everything that you need.

1989
01:22:19,175 --> 01:22:20,175
(I knew it.)

1990
01:22:20,175 --> 01:22:21,245
We have everything.

1991
01:22:21,245 --> 01:22:22,845
This is amazing.

1992
01:22:22,845 --> 01:22:23,885
(They get along really well.)

1993
01:22:24,915 --> 01:22:25,915
This is pork jowl meat.

1994
01:22:26,255 --> 01:22:28,255
I've never had pork jowl meat boiled.

1995
01:22:28,255 --> 01:22:30,255
- Me neither.
- My goodness.

1996
01:22:30,255 --> 01:22:32,556
- This is incredible.
- I know.

1997
01:22:32,925 --> 01:22:34,726
Look at this.

1998
01:22:34,726 --> 01:22:35,866
(You can tell how chewy it is by looking at it.)

1999
01:22:35,925 --> 01:22:37,566
Look at this.

2000
01:22:37,566 --> 01:22:38,665
That looks amazing.

2001
01:22:38,665 --> 01:22:39,736
(He can't take his eyes off.)

2002
01:22:39,736 --> 01:22:42,035
- Put it here.
- If we eat this with the jeotgal...

2003
01:22:42,035 --> 01:22:43,236
- That's right.
- My gosh.

2004
01:22:43,236 --> 01:22:44,465
- What more is there to say?
- Seriously.

2005
01:22:44,465 --> 01:22:46,375
- They're perfect together.
- Right.

2006
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:47,535
This looks so good.

2007
01:22:47,535 --> 01:22:49,505
(She plates it by each cut so that it's easy to eat.)

2008
01:22:49,505 --> 01:22:52,316
Each cut is amazing.

2009
01:22:52,316 --> 01:22:54,245
- Special cuts like these...
- But you can't taste...

2010
01:22:54,245 --> 01:22:56,816
- are hard to find. Right.
- these flavors if you grill them.

2011
01:22:56,816 --> 01:22:59,585
- You only taste the grease.
- Exactly. Since it's a special cut.

2012
01:22:59,585 --> 01:23:01,116
(The grease has been removed, and it explodes with savoriness.)

2013
01:23:02,486 --> 01:23:03,986
(The finishing touch to the plating is...)

2014
01:23:03,986 --> 01:23:05,595
It's being finished with some chilis.

2015
01:23:06,856 --> 01:23:10,165
Gosh, this table full of food...

2016
01:23:10,425 --> 01:23:12,535
(Careful)

2017
01:23:14,035 --> 01:23:15,665
This is surprising.

2018
01:23:15,665 --> 01:23:17,705
(The special cuts suyuk is done.)

2019
01:23:19,076 --> 01:23:22,745
(The pumpkin leaves are finished cooking in time.)

2020
01:23:25,415 --> 01:23:26,415
(After a rinse in cold water, they're ready to eat.)

2021
01:23:26,415 --> 01:23:28,316
It's hot. Rinse it in cold water.

2022
01:23:30,316 --> 01:23:33,715
My grandma used to make this all the time for me.

2023
01:23:34,215 --> 01:23:36,425
I guess you keep liking the foods you ate as a kid.

2024
01:23:36,425 --> 01:23:37,955
- Right.
- The things you ate as a kid.

2025
01:23:37,955 --> 01:23:41,295
That's why we say we have our mother's palate.

2026
01:23:41,526 --> 01:23:42,526
That's what it means.

2027
01:23:43,495 --> 01:23:45,635
How pretty. It's cooked perfectly.

2028
01:23:45,635 --> 01:23:46,835
(Soft)

2029
01:23:46,835 --> 01:23:48,095
Take this.

2030
01:23:48,095 --> 01:23:50,165
Okay. That's right.

2031
01:23:50,165 --> 01:23:51,835
- Are we done? Let's go.
- Gosh.

2032
01:23:51,835 --> 01:23:54,576
(Everyone pitched in to make tonight's dinner.)

2033
01:23:54,576 --> 01:23:56,606
- Take a seat.
- Okay.

2034
01:23:56,606 --> 01:23:57,705
(A dinner made with ingredients that are hard to come by)

2035
01:23:57,705 --> 01:24:00,215
Gosh. Before we eat...

2036
01:24:00,215 --> 01:24:01,245
- Yes?
- Yes?

2037
01:24:02,345 --> 01:24:04,316
- Hurry up and sit down.
- The food is going to get cold.

2038
01:24:04,316 --> 01:24:05,715
Okay. Before we eat,

2039
01:24:05,715 --> 01:24:07,715
Ha Nee should come here and turn on the lights.

2040
01:24:07,715 --> 01:24:09,255
(It's our first trip, so we have to have a lighting ceremony.)

2041
01:24:09,255 --> 01:24:10,486
We have to have a lighting ceremony.

2042
01:24:10,486 --> 01:24:13,196
- For Season Three.
- Let's have a lighting ceremony.

2043
01:24:13,995 --> 01:24:17,665
(Myoung takes out his camera to capture this moment.)

2044
01:24:17,665 --> 01:24:18,736
- Come here.
- Okay.

2045
01:24:18,736 --> 01:24:20,635
Come over here for the House on Wheels lighting ceremony.

2046
01:24:21,095 --> 01:24:23,266
(The youngest member is getting ready to take photos.)

2047
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:24,705
Look, Youngest is taking pictures.

2048
01:24:24,705 --> 01:24:27,375
(Since Myoung is holding a camera...)

2049
01:24:27,535 --> 01:24:29,146
(Cheese)

2050
01:24:29,675 --> 01:24:32,476
(Oh, my. I need a photo of this!)

2051
01:24:33,476 --> 01:24:34,545
Okay.

2052
01:24:34,976 --> 01:24:36,845
Myoung. Come in.

2053
01:24:38,415 --> 01:24:39,415
You...

2054
01:24:39,415 --> 01:24:40,755
(The first lighting should be done by the family.)

2055
01:24:40,755 --> 01:24:41,955
We didn't turn on the light.

2056
01:24:42,056 --> 01:24:45,186
(Ha Nee is a passionate photographer.)

2057
01:24:45,186 --> 01:24:46,196
A shot of the ceremony.

2058
01:24:46,196 --> 01:24:47,625
- Take a family photo.
- Okay.

2059
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:49,026
- Turn on the light.
- My gosh.

2060
01:24:49,026 --> 01:24:50,396
- Turn on the light.
- Let's do it.

2061
01:24:50,396 --> 01:24:51,526
- Myoung.
- Get in the middle.

2062
01:24:51,526 --> 01:24:53,035
Two, three.

2063
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:55,665
(We are brothers who get along well.)

2064
01:24:55,665 --> 01:24:56,736
Another one. One.

2065
01:24:57,366 --> 01:24:58,465
Another one?

2066
01:24:58,465 --> 01:24:59,606
- Hee Won.
- Look here.

2067
01:25:00,175 --> 01:25:01,505
It turned off, Hee Won!

2068
01:25:01,505 --> 01:25:04,946
(Gosh. What a lovely sight.)

2069
01:25:05,316 --> 01:25:07,016
(The monumental moment of the first lighting...)

2070
01:25:07,016 --> 01:25:08,745
(and our first family photo)

2071
01:25:09,686 --> 01:25:11,186
That's good. Let's eat.

2072
01:25:11,316 --> 01:25:13,116
- The lighting ceremony.
- Gosh.

2073
01:25:13,116 --> 01:25:14,116
Okay. Good.

2074
01:25:14,116 --> 01:25:15,156
Let's eat now.

2075
01:25:15,156 --> 01:25:16,186
(Shall we fill our stomachs now?)

2076
01:25:16,186 --> 01:25:18,455
- Finally.
- Finally. This looks good.

2077
01:25:18,455 --> 01:25:20,826
- This looks delicious.
- It does.

2078
01:25:21,526 --> 01:25:22,566
(Exclaiming)

2079
01:25:23,495 --> 01:25:24,726
This is unbelievable.

2080
01:25:24,726 --> 01:25:26,736
Okay. Let's eat.

2081
01:25:27,465 --> 01:25:30,205
Where should we start?

2082
01:25:30,665 --> 01:25:32,675
- I think this will be amazing.
- This will be really...

2083
01:25:32,675 --> 01:25:35,135
- We don't eat them like this.
- Since we boiled it...

2084
01:25:36,505 --> 01:25:38,446
- This is unbelievable.
- Yes.

2085
01:25:38,976 --> 01:25:41,045
- Dong Il, this...
- Jeotgal!

2086
01:25:41,045 --> 01:25:42,785
- Jeotgal!
- Before we eat,

2087
01:25:42,785 --> 01:25:45,016
- we should have pine mushrooms.
- That's right.

2088
01:25:45,016 --> 01:25:47,616
You just need some salt and sesame oil.

2089
01:25:47,616 --> 01:25:49,056
Let's try it.

2090
01:25:49,056 --> 01:25:50,856
Okay. Have some.

2091
01:25:50,986 --> 01:25:53,095
Our guests always eat first.

2092
01:25:53,595 --> 01:25:55,595
- Youngest, come here.
- Okay!

2093
01:25:55,866 --> 01:25:57,566
You're partially a guest today.

2094
01:25:57,566 --> 01:25:58,566
(Our youngest member is partially a guest today.)

2095
01:25:59,066 --> 01:26:00,995
Have a taste. Don't worry about us.

2096
01:26:02,205 --> 01:26:04,965
(Reaching)

2097
01:26:05,135 --> 01:26:07,005
They say that we should give precedence to our elders.

2098
01:26:07,005 --> 01:26:09,345
- No, that doesn't apply today.
- How can we eat first?

2099
01:26:09,345 --> 01:26:11,745
- Hurry. Don't do that.
- Dong Il.

2100
01:26:11,745 --> 01:26:13,845
We eat this really often in my house.

2101
01:26:13,845 --> 01:26:15,245
Go ahead and have it.

2102
01:26:15,446 --> 01:26:18,345
I can't do that, especially with pine mushrooms.

2103
01:26:18,785 --> 01:26:20,486
I'll give everyone a piece.

2104
01:26:21,085 --> 01:26:22,726
Hee Won gets the smallest piece.

2105
01:26:23,326 --> 01:26:24,556
Thank you.

2106
01:26:24,556 --> 01:26:25,925
Our guest gets the biggest piece.

2107
01:26:25,925 --> 01:26:27,826
I don't eat wild pine mushrooms.

2108
01:26:27,826 --> 01:26:28,866
(The guest and youngest member get the biggest pieces.)

2109
01:26:28,866 --> 01:26:30,826
- Here.
- Thank you.

2110
01:26:30,826 --> 01:26:31,896
Let's try it.

2111
01:26:32,135 --> 01:26:33,896
Dae Young, thank you! We'll enjoy it!

2112
01:26:33,936 --> 01:26:35,665
Thank you for the meal!

2113
01:26:36,906 --> 01:26:39,476
- Smell it first.
- I've never had this before.

2114
01:26:39,476 --> 01:26:40,635
(How to enjoy wild pine mushrooms)

2115
01:26:40,635 --> 01:26:41,875
(1. Dip it in sesame oil and take a bite.)

2116
01:26:41,875 --> 01:26:44,175
(2. Savor the aroma.)

2117
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:47,675
(Chewing)

2118
01:26:48,116 --> 01:26:50,016
(He's the type to eat things he doesn't normally eat well.)

2119
01:26:50,016 --> 01:26:52,316
- You're eating the aroma.
- Yes. The aroma...

2120
01:26:52,316 --> 01:26:54,255
If Italy has truffles,

2121
01:26:54,255 --> 01:26:56,125
- we have these.
- Right. Pine mushrooms.

2122
01:26:56,125 --> 01:26:57,425
Right. We have pine mushrooms.

2123
01:26:57,785 --> 01:26:59,196
(Ha Nee knows her food.)

2124
01:26:59,196 --> 01:27:00,226
What do you think?

2125
01:27:01,125 --> 01:27:03,026
There's dirt on it since it's wild pine mushrooms.

2126
01:27:03,896 --> 01:27:05,995
That might be because I didn't wash it well.

2127
01:27:05,995 --> 01:27:07,766
There was dirt on my piece too.

2128
01:27:07,766 --> 01:27:09,665
I know. It's so wild.

2129
01:27:09,665 --> 01:27:11,366
I couldn't cut off the bottom...

2130
01:27:11,705 --> 01:27:13,406
- It's okay.
- because I didn't want to waste it.

2131
01:27:13,406 --> 01:27:15,946
You're supposed to eat wild ginseng with the dirt.

2132
01:27:16,076 --> 01:27:18,045
It's true. When you have wild ginseng...

2133
01:27:18,045 --> 01:27:20,375
- You can eat the dirt.
- This has a lot of B12.

2134
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:21,616
I know.

2135
01:27:21,616 --> 01:27:24,245
- It's okay to eat the dirt.
- This is...

2136
01:27:25,045 --> 01:27:29,656
After you fill your mouth with the aroma of pine mushroom,

2137
01:27:30,026 --> 01:27:32,556
you can eat your meal. Okay.

2138
01:27:33,056 --> 01:27:35,056
(Oh, right!)

2139
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:37,169
(Oh, right!)

2140
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:38,210
I'm sorry for cutting you off.

2141
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:41,610
The oyster jeotgal with hot peppers from my town.

2142
01:27:41,610 --> 01:27:42,910
(I forgot about the oyster jeotgal with hot peppers I bought.)

2143
01:27:43,009 --> 01:27:48,019
There's a really famous bossam place in my town.

2144
01:27:48,019 --> 01:27:49,290
(He bought it from the famous bossam place in his town.)

2145
01:27:49,290 --> 01:27:51,190
I bought the oyster jeotgal with hot peppers from there.

2146
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:53,219
Oyster jeotgal with hot peppers.

2147
01:27:53,219 --> 01:27:55,929
- So... Honestly...
- With some sesame oil...

2148
01:27:55,929 --> 01:27:57,729
Yes, but I couldn't do...

2149
01:27:57,729 --> 01:27:59,629
- anything about that.
- I just need that.

2150
01:27:59,629 --> 01:28:02,530
I couldn't do anything about it, so I bought it from that restaurant.

2151
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:06,540
I asked the owner and bought it.

2152
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,469
Let's take some of this out.

2153
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:11,809
- This is incredible.
- But...

2154
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:14,839
(They're so ecstatic that they're at a loss for words.)

2155
01:28:14,839 --> 01:28:17,879
- That looks really good.
- The color is amazing.

2156
01:28:17,879 --> 01:28:20,849
- The oysters are big.
- I could tell.

2157
01:28:20,849 --> 01:28:22,790
- Right. It's not small.
- Try it.

2158
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:24,089
Try some of it.

2159
01:28:24,089 --> 01:28:25,150
Look.

2160
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:26,620
- Try it.
- Have you seen any this big?

2161
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:28,690
(A huge oyster appears.)

2162
01:28:28,690 --> 01:28:29,759
Try it.

2163
01:28:30,629 --> 01:28:33,500
(The siblings try it at the same time.)

2164
01:28:33,799 --> 01:28:35,900
(Oh, my...)

2165
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:38,870
(The delicious flavor gives her a headache.)

2166
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:42,540
Now we're going to eat this with the meat.

2167
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:44,710
(Imagine how good it must be with the meat.)

2168
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,509
Take some meat.

2169
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,110
Thank you for the food!

2170
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:49,580
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food!

2171
01:28:50,379 --> 01:28:52,049
Hee Won, you've never been to this restaurant, right?

2172
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:54,320
- Try it like this.
- Like this?

2173
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,349
- Try it.
- Okay.

2174
01:28:56,519 --> 01:28:57,549
It's really...

2175
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,120
Here.

2176
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:02,089
Youngest, try this meat right here.

2177
01:29:03,389 --> 01:29:04,790
(He takes the meat Dong Il gave him and puts an oyster on top.)

2178
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:06,229
Here. This is good.

2179
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,500
It has the rind and the meat.

2180
01:29:09,269 --> 01:29:10,469
- It's very good.
- My goodness.

2181
01:29:10,469 --> 01:29:11,500
Try it.

2182
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,339
It doesn't need much. Just some meat and...

2183
01:29:16,339 --> 01:29:18,339
- Should I eat it with the meat?
- Eat it with the meat.

2184
01:29:19,710 --> 01:29:21,639
- What do you think?
- It's really good.

2185
01:29:21,639 --> 01:29:23,910
Isn't this amazing?

2186
01:29:24,509 --> 01:29:27,219
(I should try some now.)

2187
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,160
It's really good.

2188
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:36,089
The oyster jeotgal with hot peppers is really...

2189
01:29:36,089 --> 01:29:38,330
- The oyster jeotgal? Isn't it good?
- It's very good.

2190
01:29:38,330 --> 01:29:41,200
(It's so good that she's tongue-tied.)

2191
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:43,469
I fell in love with this, so I go to this restaurant often.

2192
01:29:43,469 --> 01:29:44,700
(He's happy that they like it.)

2193
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:45,969
It's really good, so I go there often.

2194
01:29:45,969 --> 01:29:48,040
- The oysters are so plump.
- I know.

2195
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,509
(Ha Nee's favorite is the oyster jeotgal with hot peppers.)

2196
01:29:50,809 --> 01:29:53,879
(Their dinner is so good that they're at a loss for words.)

2197
01:29:54,379 --> 01:29:55,979
I'm going to try to pumpkin leaves that you cooked for us.

2198
01:29:55,979 --> 01:29:57,679
- Should we try this?
- Let me try it.

2199
01:29:57,679 --> 01:29:58,679
Like this.

2200
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:01,580
Do you want some too?

2201
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:03,490
(He rips the leaf in half and shares it with Dong Il.)

2202
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:06,320
Take this and put it on the pumpkin leaf.

2203
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,059
(He makes a delicious wrap...)

2204
01:30:08,059 --> 01:30:11,460
(to taste the delicate flavors of the pumpkin leaf.)

2205
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:15,969
(Taking a bite)

2206
01:30:17,129 --> 01:30:19,200
Which jeotgal is this?

2207
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,000
- I think it's the hairtail jeotgal.
- Is it?

2208
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:24,940
Big wraps taste better.

2209
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:27,940
- Making them big?
- Yes, I'm serious.

2210
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:29,679
(Like this?)

2211
01:30:29,950 --> 01:30:33,549
(I'm going to take a big bite too.)

2212
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:38,860
Is this the doenjang from earlier?

2213
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:41,089
- The jeotgal ssamjang.
- It's the jeotgal ssamjang?

2214
01:30:41,719 --> 01:30:42,929
It's really good.

2215
01:30:42,929 --> 01:30:45,629
(I like the jeotgal ssamjang the best.)

2216
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:50,599
(Thanks to the cave jeotgal, the suyuk tastes even better.)

2217
01:30:50,830 --> 01:30:52,440
The eight-year-old shrimp jeotgal is really interesting.

2218
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:55,669
- It tastes like doenjang.
- It really does.

2219
01:30:55,669 --> 01:30:57,669
(The 8-year-old shrimp jeotgal is as savory as doenjang.)

2220
01:30:58,110 --> 01:31:01,080
(It goes perfectly with the pork back meat.)

2221
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:04,410
I never knew jeotgal could make such a great side dish.

2222
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:06,519
- I know. It's unbelievable.
- It's so good.

2223
01:31:06,519 --> 01:31:07,519
Right.

2224
01:31:10,419 --> 01:31:12,519
The rice is perfect too!

2225
01:31:12,919 --> 01:31:16,360
- The meat is so fresh.
- Right.

2226
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,059
It's so good.

2227
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:21,530
(A boiled vegetable wrap is a great way to enjoy vegetables.)

2228
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:23,969
It's really good.

2229
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,570
I feel like all the best flavors are gathered here.

2230
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:28,200
- I agree.
- Right?

2231
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:29,669
(Sucking in)

2232
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:32,169
The Cheongyang chilis are really good.

2233
01:31:33,309 --> 01:31:34,979
- Do you like spicy foods?
- Yes.

2234
01:31:34,979 --> 01:31:36,979
He's great in every way.

2235
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:38,849
He and I have the same preferences.

2236
01:31:38,849 --> 01:31:41,780
(You and I like the same kinds of food.)

2237
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:43,349
This is nice.

2238
01:31:43,349 --> 01:31:46,419
(I love how you like spicy food.)

2239
01:31:47,059 --> 01:31:50,660
(A delicious meal that makes you hum)

2240
01:31:51,490 --> 01:31:52,929
(Exclaiming)

2241
01:31:52,929 --> 01:31:55,629
Where's the moon?

2242
01:31:56,405 --> 01:31:58,036
Where's the moon?

2243
01:32:00,176 --> 01:32:01,576
We were waiting to see that.

2244
01:32:01,576 --> 01:32:02,975
(Where is the moon?)

2245
01:32:03,546 --> 01:32:07,015
(When the sun sets and night falls,)

2246
01:32:08,246 --> 01:32:12,555
(the moon rises like a beautiful painting.)

2247
01:32:13,315 --> 01:32:16,956
(While everyone was focused on making dinner,)

2248
01:32:17,055 --> 01:32:19,225
I guess you keep liking the foods you ate as a kid.

2249
01:32:19,225 --> 01:32:20,756
- Right.
- The things you ate as a kid.

2250
01:32:20,756 --> 01:32:24,095
(the moon showed itself quietly.)

2251
01:32:24,666 --> 01:32:28,095
(The crescent moon peeked out and went right back in.)

2252
01:32:28,935 --> 01:32:32,105
(They exchanged the Wollyu Peak moon for their delicious meal.)

2253
01:32:32,405 --> 01:32:33,636
(He's disappointed that he missed the moon.)

2254
01:32:33,636 --> 01:32:35,206
We didn't get the chance to see it.

2255
01:32:36,046 --> 01:32:39,145
(He's disappointed about something else.)

2256
01:32:39,515 --> 01:32:41,246
(He grabs his bowl and gets up.)

2257
01:32:41,246 --> 01:32:43,086
- Are you going to get seconds?
- Yes.

2258
01:32:43,086 --> 01:32:44,116
Eat more.

2259
01:32:44,445 --> 01:32:46,456
Everyone's enjoying the meal.

2260
01:32:47,386 --> 01:32:49,525
Myoung eats a lot.

2261
01:32:49,525 --> 01:32:50,685
That's why I like him.

2262
01:32:52,326 --> 01:32:56,366
(He starts round 2 on his own.)

2263
01:32:56,666 --> 01:32:57,966
It's nice to see you eat so well.

2264
01:32:57,966 --> 01:32:59,235
- I know.
- Right?

2265
01:32:59,836 --> 01:33:01,595
He's the type to keep eating when he goes on a trip.

2266
01:33:01,595 --> 01:33:02,706
I see.

2267
01:33:02,706 --> 01:33:04,136
Have you gone on trips together too?

2268
01:33:04,605 --> 01:33:06,405
- We went often.
- Really?

2269
01:33:06,405 --> 01:33:08,475
Because we go diving together...

2270
01:33:08,475 --> 01:33:09,706
- Skin scuba diving?
- Yes.

2271
01:33:09,706 --> 01:33:10,845
I see.

2272
01:33:10,845 --> 01:33:12,176
We went on a lot of trips together.

2273
01:33:12,176 --> 01:33:15,445
We went to Palau and the Phillippines together.

2274
01:33:15,445 --> 01:33:16,645
(They got closer as they enjoy the same hobby.)

2275
01:33:16,645 --> 01:33:20,015
We went to Jeju Island too. We went to a lot of places.

2276
01:33:20,015 --> 01:33:21,616
- We did.
- You guys went to the Phillippines?

2277
01:33:21,616 --> 01:33:23,426
- Yes.
- I see.

2278
01:33:23,685 --> 01:33:25,956
There's no end to diving.

2279
01:33:26,395 --> 01:33:29,296
- I'm too scared to try.
- You can go really deep.

2280
01:33:29,426 --> 01:33:30,866
I'm afraid of the silence.

2281
01:33:30,866 --> 01:33:33,536
- Is it because I've sinned a lot?
- The silence feels like meditation.

2282
01:33:33,536 --> 01:33:35,136
- I can only hear my breathing, - I know.

2283
01:33:35,136 --> 01:33:36,935
- and it's a state of zero gravity.
- That silence...

2284
01:33:36,935 --> 01:33:38,336
is so scary to me.

2285
01:33:38,805 --> 01:33:40,605
More than anything,

2286
01:33:40,605 --> 01:33:44,746
we don't have many chances to go into large primeval forests.

2287
01:33:45,076 --> 01:33:47,475
But when you go diving, you're entering one of the only places...

2288
01:33:47,475 --> 01:33:49,985
that hasn't been destroyed by humans.

2289
01:33:49,985 --> 01:33:52,386
- Right. Inside the ocean...
- It's like a third world.

2290
01:33:52,386 --> 01:33:53,416
(You must love diving.)

2291
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:55,256
Myoung is really good at diving too.

2292
01:33:55,256 --> 01:33:56,386
I see.

2293
01:33:56,525 --> 01:33:58,256
You must be athletic.

2294
01:33:58,256 --> 01:34:00,855
- You must like everything.
- I really do.

2295
01:34:00,855 --> 01:34:01,996
(Passionate Myoung enjoys trying new things.)

2296
01:34:02,155 --> 01:34:03,565
Hee Won, what did you do at Myoung's age?

2297
01:34:03,826 --> 01:34:04,996
When I was 29?

2298
01:34:05,366 --> 01:34:09,095
When I was 29, I was lost, and I left for Australia.

2299
01:34:09,095 --> 01:34:10,565
Really?

2300
01:34:10,565 --> 01:34:12,166
I thought that I should quit acting.

2301
01:34:12,166 --> 01:34:14,105
(Hee Won wanted to quit acting when he was 29.)

2302
01:34:14,105 --> 01:34:16,345
- When I was 29.
- You were just like me.

2303
01:34:16,345 --> 01:34:18,006
(Gosh, you were just like me.)

2304
01:34:18,376 --> 01:34:19,876
- Right.
- Don't you feel this way?

2305
01:34:20,376 --> 01:34:22,945
He's worried he might go back to when he struggled,

2306
01:34:22,945 --> 01:34:24,046
so he doesn't take breaks.

2307
01:34:25,716 --> 01:34:27,685
- He's worried...
- He can't take breaks.

2308
01:34:28,086 --> 01:34:30,286
that he might go back to when he struggled,

2309
01:34:30,655 --> 01:34:33,426
so he keeps working back to back.

2310
01:34:33,426 --> 01:34:35,095
(There's no rest for the rest of my life.)

2311
01:34:35,626 --> 01:34:37,725
(The intense dinner)

2312
01:34:37,725 --> 01:34:40,595
We ate like bulldozers.

2313
01:34:41,265 --> 01:34:44,466
I have an important announcement to make.

2314
01:34:45,506 --> 01:34:46,805
Actually,

2315
01:34:47,706 --> 01:34:51,246
we have to get up by 4am tomorrow.

2316
01:34:51,246 --> 01:34:52,945
(Excuse me?)

2317
01:34:52,945 --> 01:34:54,275
So we'll go to bed early tonight.

2318
01:34:54,876 --> 01:34:56,815
After we finish this, you can go to bed.

2319
01:34:57,116 --> 01:34:59,416
Here's what we'll do tomorrow.

2320
01:34:59,416 --> 01:35:00,555
(Tomorrow's special appointment)

2321
01:35:00,555 --> 01:35:03,055
I've wanted to do this before I died.

2322
01:35:03,756 --> 01:35:05,985
We might be able to do it, or we might not.

2323
01:35:05,985 --> 01:35:07,395
The weather is important.

2324
01:35:07,395 --> 01:35:11,326
We're going to ride a hot-air balloon to watch the sunrise.

2325
01:35:11,326 --> 01:35:14,435
(We're riding a hot-air balloon tomorrow.)

2326
01:35:15,996 --> 01:35:18,435
- The sunrise.
- A hot-air balloon?

2327
01:35:22,036 --> 01:35:24,975
(On a balloon as big as a house,)

2328
01:35:26,145 --> 01:35:28,845
(they'll spend time flying in the air.)

2329
01:35:29,076 --> 01:35:31,015
(Gusting)

2330
01:35:31,546 --> 01:35:35,916
(The world that's a bit smaller seen from the sky)

2331
01:35:37,926 --> 01:35:41,695
(They go back to being children and fly in the sky.)

2332
01:35:42,155 --> 01:35:43,926
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

2333
01:35:43,926 --> 01:35:46,536
Like a trip around the world on a hot-air balloon,

2334
01:35:46,536 --> 01:35:47,666
we're taking to the sky.

2335
01:35:47,966 --> 01:35:49,836
That's going to be beautiful.

2336
01:35:50,036 --> 01:35:51,435
It'll be so cool.

2337
01:35:52,935 --> 01:35:55,536
(They start the second day on a hot-air balloon.)

2338
01:35:55,775 --> 01:35:57,506
(Bye!)

2339
01:35:58,605 --> 01:35:59,616
(Impressed)

2340
01:36:00,176 --> 01:36:01,676
This is so romantic.

2341
01:36:01,676 --> 01:36:04,616
(The owners of the house are absorbed in it.)

2342
01:36:04,716 --> 01:36:05,985
(Ha Nee and Myoung are also fascinated.)

2343
01:36:05,985 --> 01:36:07,586
(Taking pictures)

2344
01:36:08,116 --> 01:36:09,985
(They fly over mountains...)

2345
01:36:09,985 --> 01:36:12,525
(and the downtown area.)

2346
01:36:12,525 --> 01:36:14,456
(They become a real family with the luxurious memory.)

2347
01:36:15,025 --> 01:36:16,395
Did you eat this, honey?

2348
01:36:16,395 --> 01:36:18,966
(Sick of it)

2349
01:36:18,966 --> 01:36:21,996
(Hee Won and Ha Nee continue their role-play of a married couple.)

2350
01:36:22,595 --> 01:36:25,235
(We should buy him a boiler.)

2351
01:36:25,235 --> 01:36:28,006
(The relationship setting is a mess.)

2352
01:36:28,006 --> 01:36:30,676
(Your brother has got a temper, honey.)

2353
01:36:30,676 --> 01:36:34,515
(Ha Nee prepares for a tea ceremony to control his temper.)

2354
01:36:35,116 --> 01:36:36,685
(Is there a flower to decorate it?)

2355
01:36:36,685 --> 01:36:38,485
(You fool.)

2356
01:36:38,485 --> 01:36:41,315
(You're the flower.)

2357
01:36:41,315 --> 01:36:42,355
That's right.

2358
01:36:45,386 --> 01:36:47,855
(Is this a family sitcom or a romantic comedy film?)

2359
01:36:47,855 --> 01:36:50,265
(How will House on Wheels 3 go?)
