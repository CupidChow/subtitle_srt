1
00:00:25,623 --> 00:00:28,164
(On the brink of winter, )

2
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:31,504
(at the foot of a mountain in Hongcheon, Gangwon Province)

3
00:00:32,203 --> 00:00:34,232
- Go on in.
- That's cold.

4
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,404
(That's cold.)

5
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,544
Open the window, Hee Won.

6
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:40,712
(They busily open the window first.)

7
00:00:40,713 --> 00:00:43,514
(Humming)

8
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:45,482
Let's just do it here.

9
00:00:45,483 --> 00:00:46,884
- Should we?
- Yes.

10
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:50,353
(The reason they're staying here and not the front yard)

11
00:00:50,354 --> 00:00:52,223
When will the guests arrive?

12
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,322
(Should we sit and wait?)

13
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,523
The guests are coming.

14
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:01,064
You're supposed to greet welcome guests at the door.

15
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:04,763
How dare you rest inside? Even the weather isn't that good.

16
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:07,502
- Hey, scout.
- Yes, sir.

17
00:01:07,503 --> 00:01:09,874
Watch out for a car a kilometer away from here.

18
00:01:10,543 --> 00:01:11,873
Then we can get outside.

19
00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:13,813
You wait for the farmhands in your room...

20
00:01:13,814 --> 00:01:16,013
and step out when you hear them.

21
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:17,642
I know.

22
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:19,713
(Amazed)

23
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:23,853
(The first snow of the year scatters.)

24
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:25,552
(White snow visited like a dream.)

25
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:27,893
The snow is getting thicker! Look.

26
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:35,034
(Large bits of cotton candy are flying in the air.)

27
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:38,734
(The snowflakes get thicker.)

28
00:01:39,363 --> 00:01:41,633
- Look how thick they are.
- Oh, my.

29
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:43,272
It's beautiful.

30
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:44,273
(Doggy Myoung is excited.)

31
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:46,813
(They smile without realizing.)

32
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:47,873
It's fantastic.

33
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,473
(They smile without realizing.)

34
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,882
(The family members share the first snow of the year.)

35
00:01:51,883 --> 00:01:53,853
It's snowing so much all of a sudden.

36
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:58,352
(Getting sentimental by the surprise snow)

37
00:01:58,353 --> 00:02:00,492
I guess we almost saved a country...

38
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:02,752
in our previous lives.

39
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:05,293
- Exactly.
- We get so many happy memories.

40
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:06,893
But we didn't actually save one.

41
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:10,103
(Come to think of it...)

42
00:02:10,303 --> 00:02:11,502
(Come to think of it...)

43
00:02:11,503 --> 00:02:13,472
It's going to be so tough shoveling all this snow.

44
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:16,174
(Back to being a private)

45
00:02:17,773 --> 00:02:20,344
- Go inside. Why are you coming out?
- Snow is getting into our shoes.

46
00:02:20,643 --> 00:02:22,344
(Putting Myoung's shoes inside)

47
00:02:22,913 --> 00:02:24,743
(And his shoes under the house)

48
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:27,214
(He's impossible.)

49
00:02:28,584 --> 00:02:29,912
You scare me.

50
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:31,554
(By the way, where are the guests?)

51
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:33,423
He's older than me, right?

52
00:02:33,823 --> 00:02:34,994
Appearance-wise...

53
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:38,063
In terms of appearance, he even looks older than me.

54
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:39,894
I can't easily talk to him in the non-honorifics even now.

55
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:42,363
- Really?
- I think he's lying about his age.

56
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:44,034
This is my first time meeting him.

57
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,833
I've only seen him in movies.

58
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:48,233
He's got the looks of a fighter for independence.

59
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:51,804
(He must be intimidating.)

60
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:54,813
(There are two men?)

61
00:02:54,814 --> 00:02:58,043
(Determined)

62
00:02:58,883 --> 00:03:00,313
(They seem extraordinary.)

63
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,584
(With a mysterious sword in his hand)

64
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:08,154
(They walk under the snow in silence.)

65
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:11,192
- It's the first snow.
- You're right.

66
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:13,094
We're seeing the first snow with them.

67
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,863
(He overcame the age difference with Dong Il.)

68
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,233
(Hello, Mr. Sung!)

69
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:23,034
(Dong Il's neighbor and Jung Pal's father in "Reply 1988")

70
00:03:23,274 --> 00:03:25,102
(And another father in Ssangmun-dong)

71
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:26,203
(Hey, Bonghwangdang.)

72
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:28,543
(Bonghwangdang!)

73
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,713
(Blinking)

74
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:33,714
(Hey.)

75
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,953
(These fathers were as close as a family.)

76
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:40,993
(Bonghwangdang!)

77
00:03:40,994 --> 00:03:44,423
(See you on House on Wheels 3.)

78
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:46,322
(The fathers of "Reply 1988")

79
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:48,293
(Choi Moo Sung and Kim Sung Kyun)

80
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:50,903
I think that's them.

81
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:52,763
(Eyes on the cooler)

82
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:55,303
(Helping without talking)

83
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:57,442
You seem tired.

84
00:03:57,443 --> 00:03:59,303
Thank you.

85
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:00,973
(Laughing)

86
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,614
There they come.

87
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,113
Hey, Moo Sung!

88
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:07,753
(Glad to see him)

89
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:10,253
(A little nervous as it's his first time meeting them)

90
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,583
- Hello!
- Hello.

91
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,154
(Broadly)

92
00:04:14,723 --> 00:04:16,023
(He looks friendly unlike Myoung expected.)

93
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:17,763
Hi.

94
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:20,933
The weather suits you perfectly.

95
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,533
(Youngest smiles brightly after seeing their faces.)

96
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:24,203
- In this winter...
- Good to meet you.

97
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:26,773
- Hello.
- Hello.

98
00:04:26,774 --> 00:04:28,133
I thought you were his manager.

99
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:30,572
- Welcome.
- Good morning.

100
00:04:30,573 --> 00:04:31,903
- I'll take that.
- It's a gift.

101
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,002
- It's really heavy.
- This one?

102
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:34,273
- Yes.
- I'll carry it.

103
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,743
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

104
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:37,884
I'm so glad to see you.

105
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:40,154
You're...

106
00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:43,154
(Hey, Mr. Kim.)

107
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:46,423
(Half-hearted)

108
00:04:46,993 --> 00:04:48,023
You're...

109
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:49,454
(Hey, Mr. Sung!)

110
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:52,492
(Dong Il gives him a big hug today.)

111
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:53,894
All right. Thank you.

112
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:55,733
- Now...
- What's that?

113
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:58,062
Moo Sung, have you met Hee Won?

114
00:04:58,063 --> 00:04:59,533
- We're meeting for the first time.
- Yes.

115
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:01,473
- You've never been on a show.
- No.

116
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,904
- What about you, Myoung?
- It's also my first time.

117
00:05:04,574 --> 00:05:05,802
- Yes, it's our first time.
- Really?

118
00:05:05,803 --> 00:05:07,774
(Moo Sung also meets Youngest for the first time.)

119
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,283
- Are you two working together?
- Currently...

120
00:05:10,284 --> 00:05:11,583
- We are.
- Right now?

121
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:12,644
Yes.

122
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:14,283
- What about you, Myoung?
- I...

123
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:15,352
- Long time no see.
- Right.

124
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:18,784
(Sung Kyun just finished filming a movie with Myoung.)

125
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:21,653
We have the first snow to greet you.

126
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,623
- I know.
- The weather is wonderful.

127
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,422
- Isn't it beautiful?
- It is.

128
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:26,464
It's lovely.

129
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:28,062
Let's go.

130
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:29,893
- Why do you have so many umbrellas?
- They're gifts.

131
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:31,034
- Those are gifts.
- Gifts?

132
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,534
- But...
- Gifts.

133
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,103
It's nice.

134
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:37,903
- It's really light.
- Right?

135
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,103
Yes, it's very light.

136
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:41,043
Thank you.

137
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:42,543
What's this?

138
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:46,144
- I'll cook you something delicious.
- All right. Leave these here.

139
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:49,183
- Let's watch the first snow.
- Sure.

140
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:51,222
The umbrellas that Moo Sung brought.

141
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:52,324
(An exciting first trip with the first snow)

142
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:54,037
How have you been?

143
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:58,537
(Greeting each other properly)

144
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:00,808
- Come on.
- Look at this house.

145
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:03,077
- You even lock the doors.
- Ready?

146
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:06,005
- Sung Kyun, sit in the back.
- Okay.

147
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:07,047
Moo Sung, sit up front.

148
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:09,777
(Grunting)

149
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,816
(Dong Il, Myoung, and Sung Kyun sit in the back.)

150
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,186
This car has never been this cramped.

151
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:19,787
I'm sorry. It's because of me.

152
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:22,255
No, not really... It is.

153
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,396
(Joking)

154
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:27,237
(Crouching)

155
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:28,867
Let's hit the road.

156
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:31,337
(Off to a sweet start in a cramped car)

157
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:33,236
(Bright eyes)

158
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:36,136
- The weather cleared up.
- All of a sudden.

159
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:38,276
I can't believe it snowed today.

160
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:40,816
(It's brighter than ever as if it never snowed.)

161
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,516
- We're off to buy meat, right?
- Yes.

162
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,815
On our way there,

163
00:06:45,816 --> 00:06:49,016
there's a place that only sells special cuts of meat.

164
00:06:49,987 --> 00:06:50,987
(Headed straight toward the town)

165
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:53,696
Really? I'm salivating.

166
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:56,755
My boys are here,

167
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:58,927
so I'll make sure you get invigorated today.

168
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:02,597
Enjoy a lot of delicious food before you go.

169
00:07:02,737 --> 00:07:03,806
I'd love to.

170
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:08,236
(They arrive at a small town in Hongcheon in no time.)

171
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:09,506
Let's go right away.

172
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:12,106
This is it.

173
00:07:12,107 --> 00:07:14,575
(They get to the butcher's shop in an instant.)

174
00:07:14,576 --> 00:07:16,646
- Hello.
- Hello.

175
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:19,645
What are some tasty special cuts...

176
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:21,656
for a party of five?

177
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:24,027
We have all special cuts of pork.

178
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:26,987
This is called cube roll.

179
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:28,856
Cube roll.

180
00:07:28,857 --> 00:07:30,125
(It looks different from regular cuts of pork.)

181
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:33,097
- Nabi cut.
- These are all special cuts.

182
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:35,096
Is this pork or beef?

183
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:37,606
- They're all pork.
- Good.

184
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:39,566
- How does the color look so good?
- Great.

185
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:40,976
It's really...

186
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:42,907
(They have funny names like the chewy cut and the white cut.)

187
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,375
- You should choose.
- Us?

188
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:46,445
(The guests can choose.)

189
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:48,776
The two of you. Choose whatever you want.

190
00:07:48,777 --> 00:07:50,046
(Which will taste better?)

191
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:51,546
Pork...

192
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:54,057
Pork jowl meat sounds good.

193
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:57,727
The chewy cut sounds delicious.

194
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,356
- We'll have one.
- It looks really chewy.

195
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:01,756
What else? Moo Sung.

196
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:03,327
- Moo Sung.
- One more.

197
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:07,796
(Staring)

198
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:11,937
(What do they have here?)

199
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,176
(Extremely discreet)

200
00:08:16,636 --> 00:08:18,776
(If you really can't decide...)

201
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:20,915
- Doesn't pork jowl meat sound good?
- Whatever you want.

202
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:21,946
(Trying again)

203
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:23,015
The white cut.

204
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:24,316
(I want to choose the white cut.)

205
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:27,286
- Cube roll and...
- Pork jowl meat sounds tasty.

206
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:30,016
(You win.)

207
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:31,957
Hee Won can choose one too.

208
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:33,327
Pork jowl meat.

209
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:34,327
(He earns his pork jowl meat.)

210
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:35,395
He doesn't even look.

211
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:36,626
(Iron will)

212
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:38,227
Isn't this too much?

213
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,136
- That'll disappear in a second.
- It won't take long.

214
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:43,597
- Is that right?
- We're cooking it over charcoal.

215
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,406
For Koreans...

216
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:49,306
I hear that Youngest will cook for us today.

217
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:51,006
- Yes.
- What can you cook?

218
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:54,317
- Chicken.
- Chicken? Braised spicy chicken?

219
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:55,776
Braised spicy chicken?

220
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:59,617
I'll cook it in a cauldron.

221
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:02,216
Hello.

222
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:05,687
We want to make braised spicy chicken.

223
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:08,356
That's huge. We can just buy one.

224
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:09,425
(Purchasing one large Korean native chicken)

225
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:12,197
- Great.
- One seems enough.

226
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:16,067
I've been craving braised spicy chicken for a few days.

227
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:18,337
I'll cook it deliciously for you.

228
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:20,775
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

229
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:22,036
- Thank you!
- Goodbye.

230
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:24,176
- I think we bought all of them.
- Okay.

231
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:28,016
We bought pork and chicken.

232
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:29,546
We have too much food.

233
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:36,217
(They head to the front yard at last.)

234
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:39,925
Pork jowl meat cooked over a charcoal fire...

235
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:42,656
I think it'll taste really good.

236
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:43,966
- A charcoal fire?
- Yes.

237
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:44,996
(Gulping)

238
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:49,197
Sung Kyun, you live in a country house,

239
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:50,736
so you must have a lot of barbecues.

240
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:52,936
We had so many. When we first moved in,

241
00:09:52,937 --> 00:09:55,136
we always brought charcoal.

242
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:57,446
We even cooked fish over the charcoal fire.

243
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:59,347
- Right.
- We just loved it.

244
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:01,646
You must be really good at building a fire then.

245
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:04,916
Well... But I've been living there for 6 or 7 years now.

246
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,117
Now we just cook meat on a frying pan.

247
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:11,286
Like, "You're supposed to cook meat on a frying pan."

248
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:13,727
(Laughing)

249
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:15,727
Moo Sung, do you like meat?

250
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:17,327
I enjoy it.

251
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:21,496
In "I Saw the Devil",

252
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:25,567
- you ate bloody meat in a scene.
- I know.

253
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:27,937
I was so surprised.

254
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:31,977
(Actually, that meat was...)

255
00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:33,707
It was Grade Three.

256
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:35,577
Grade Three?

257
00:10:36,676 --> 00:10:37,745
Others were too expensive.

258
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:38,946
(Saying it flatly)

259
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:40,487
One of the staff members came and said,

260
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:42,386
"I'm sorry that it's Grade Three."

261
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:45,857
(It's funnier as he says it so flatly.)

262
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:48,596
It was Grade Three, yet it was so bloody.

263
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:49,697
(It was hard trying to make it look delicious.)

264
00:10:50,557 --> 00:10:52,896
(Gently lying on his shoulder)

265
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,597
(Thinking)

266
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:56,937
- Youngest.
- Yes?

267
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:59,535
Among these four senior actors...

268
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:01,036
(4 senior actors)

269
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:02,837
Who seems the nicest?

270
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:05,446
(That was random.)

271
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,107
Who? Be honest.

272
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,446
You can be honest.

273
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:10,916
(In a tight spot)

274
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:14,357
(Candidate 1: Mr. Bulletproof)

275
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:17,626
(Candidate 2: A killer who enjoys meat)

276
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:21,097
(Candidate 3: A gangster with bob hair)

277
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,296
(Candidate 4: A slave hunter who didn't brush his teeth)

278
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:28,597
(The nicest-looking one among them...)

279
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:32,005
It's you.

280
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:34,477
(It's my big brother, of course.)

281
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:37,876
(Oh, come on.)

282
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:39,876
You'll do great in the army.

283
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:44,817
(Youngest's level of social skills is at max.)

284
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,317
It brings back old memories to be with you guys.

285
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:49,557
It's really nice.

286
00:11:50,756 --> 00:11:52,285
(On their way to the front yard past the autumn foliage)

287
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:53,756
- Moo Sung.
- Yes?

288
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:58,367
Play a song that suits this season. A song that you like.

289
00:11:58,796 --> 00:11:59,926
- A song?
- Yes.

290
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:02,097
These days,

291
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,867
I love this singer's voice.

292
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:07,606
Good. Play it.

293
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:08,636
(Curious)

294
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:10,947
We get to know what type of music Moo Sung is into.

295
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:18,087
(Screaming)

296
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:20,347
Is it screaming music?

297
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:27,996
("2002" by Anne-Marie)

298
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:32,296
(What's this song that doesn't match our vibe?)

299
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:36,937
(Dazed)

300
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:40,977
(Anne-Marie)

301
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:44,246
(Fidgeting)

302
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:49,175
I want to sing along, but I can't.

303
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:50,217
Me neither.

304
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,187
The lyrics are beautiful.

305
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:54,256
Yes, I just listened to it, and realized they are.

306
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:55,385
(Really?)

307
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:56,416
It's meaningful.

308
00:12:57,286 --> 00:13:00,025
Her name is Anne-Marie. The lyrics are below.

309
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:02,525
She's singing about a grown-up man and a woman,

310
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:05,827
and their lovely childhood when they were little.

311
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:09,237
She always sings with a smile on her face.

312
00:13:09,896 --> 00:13:12,366
It looks like she's genuinely happy to sing.

313
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:14,276
It makes me happy to watch her sing.

314
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:16,737
Surprisingly, you're really...

315
00:13:17,477 --> 00:13:20,746
sentimental and delicate.

316
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,577
It's the exact opposite of your looks.

317
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:26,446
(The extreme case of hard outside and soft inside)

318
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:28,756
(Feeling shy)

319
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:33,255
(Thanks to his unexpected song choice, )

320
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:36,727
(the drive becomes sentimental.)

321
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:42,036
(As they drive on the country road with music...)

322
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:43,766
(Yawning)

323
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:50,076
(Feeling drowsy)

324
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:54,077
(His eyelids are closing.)

325
00:13:55,246 --> 00:13:58,746
(Actually, when it snowed this morning...)

326
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:00,347
It's nice, isn't it?

327
00:14:00,348 --> 00:14:03,217
(Breathing in the clean air, )

328
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,255
- It soothes me.
- Yes.

329
00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:07,526
(the whole family enjoyed a walk.)

330
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:12,025
Let's buy this pack. I'll make you mushroom rice.

331
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:14,165
- Sure.
- I'd love that.

332
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,665
Grilled deodeok...

333
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,135
- Is this any good?
- It's very good.

334
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:18,606
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

335
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,107
- Stay healthy.
- Thank you for coming.

336
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:24,947
(He can't help but doze off as he's all warmed up.)

337
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:27,776
(Dozing)

338
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:30,045
(Laughing)

339
00:14:30,046 --> 00:14:31,146
He's so cute.

340
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:35,755
(A shot of Youngest in his sleep)

341
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:37,987
Drive carefully. Try not to wake him up.

342
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:41,526
(Thank you.)

343
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:45,567
(Driving slowly to let Youngest keep sleeping)

344
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:51,807
(Across a bridge over a small brook)

345
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:54,737
This way.

346
00:14:55,307 --> 00:14:58,107
Why are the roads to the places with great scenery all curvy?

347
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:01,817
I think we're almost there.

348
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:03,875
(Now that they're almost at the destination...)

349
00:15:03,876 --> 00:15:05,786
The view is amazing here.

350
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,457
(He opens his eyes.)

351
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:11,826
(This place is wonderful.)

352
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,026
Where should we park?

353
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:17,026
(Entering the front yard with full hearts)

354
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:20,096
(Today's front yard with the vast lawn is...)

355
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:21,766
Oh, my gosh.

356
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:26,506
(When you leave a bit early from Seoul, )

357
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:30,576
(you can get there in an hour and a half.)

358
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:32,046
(105km from Seoul to Hongcheon)

359
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:37,915
(Today's house surrounded by mountains and trees)

360
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,687
Isn't our house so pretty from here?

361
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:41,256
It is.

362
00:15:42,357 --> 00:15:45,187
(The pine trees and the Korean pine wrap around the house.)

363
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:48,326
There's a folding screen behind us and a work of art in front of us.

364
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:49,656
(They work as a natural screen that blocks cold winds.)

365
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:52,926
The lawn is as pretty as a picture here.

366
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:54,866
This place is so...

367
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:58,207
(You can enjoy the clear sky and air to the full.)

368
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:00,936
(Our hideout)

369
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:04,246
(We stay at the campground in Dongmakgol, Hongcheon.)

370
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,875
- Come on, Sung Kyun.
- Yes.

371
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:08,316
You said you were good at building a fire.

372
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:09,477
- The fire?
- Yes.

373
00:16:09,717 --> 00:16:11,145
- Sure.
- Build one.

374
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:13,317
(It's been a long time since I've built one.)

375
00:16:14,046 --> 00:16:16,756
(Let's just put them in.)

376
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:22,756
(Adding a lot of firewood since it's cold)

377
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:25,425
This way.

378
00:16:25,426 --> 00:16:26,526
And...

379
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,636
(It's packed without room for ventilation.)

380
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:30,636
Oh, gosh. Are you sure you lived in a country house for six years?

381
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,336
- Seriously.
- I just wanted it to be warm.

382
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:35,276
(I wanted it to be warm.)

383
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:39,747
The world has changed.

384
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:41,645
(Peeking)

385
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:43,146
You can't force them in.

386
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:46,516
I think he only pretends to live in a country house.

387
00:16:46,517 --> 00:16:47,587
You punk.

388
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,587
How did you start a fire so fast?

389
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:54,226
(That's incredible.)

390
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:58,666
(Toddling around after watching the fire)

391
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:03,296
(What should I do?)

392
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:04,705
Hee Won, check the water!

393
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:05,767
The water?

394
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:09,475
(Hee Won goes to get water.)

395
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:12,607
(And Moo Sung follows him.)

396
00:17:14,646 --> 00:17:16,675
Do you want to get water with me?

397
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:18,817
- We can pour it in here.
- I'll lift it.

398
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:21,057
Good.

399
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:23,256
(The water fills up well...)

400
00:17:23,257 --> 00:17:25,985
(as they lift the container up high.)

401
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:27,257
That's good enough.

402
00:17:29,097 --> 00:17:30,996
(He closes the lid.)

403
00:17:30,997 --> 00:17:31,997
Good.

404
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:33,126
- Good?
- Yes, that's good.

405
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:34,496
(Dusting)

406
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:37,267
(This is fun.)

407
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:41,475
(Youngest rolls up his sleeves.)

408
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:43,475
Here. Pour some water.

409
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:45,646
(He was about to unpack the groceries...)

410
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:50,847
(when Sung Kyun entered the house.)

411
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:54,455
(Laughing)

412
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:56,556
There are so many.

413
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:59,186
(So many groceries.)

414
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:02,097
They look appetizing now that we took them out.

415
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:07,195
(He finally gets a look of the household...)

416
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:08,966
(of House on Wheels after unpacking.)

417
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:11,705
(Peeping)

418
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:15,277
(Looking around the kitchen while standing still)

419
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:16,406
(Exclaiming)

420
00:18:19,277 --> 00:18:23,347
(Now he quietly watches the gallery of House on Wheels.)

421
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:26,386
Nice. Very nice.

422
00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:29,816
(Looking around)

423
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,725
I'll stand here. Let me just wash the rice.

424
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:36,196
(The owners may be busy with housework, )

425
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:40,695
(yet Sung Kyun looks around the house on his own.)

426
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:43,096
- This house is really nice.
- Oh, you should look around.

427
00:18:43,097 --> 00:18:45,006
- Oh, right.
- I'll look around.

428
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,406
I'm sorry I forgot.

429
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:49,176
- You have two beds.
- I'm so sorry.

430
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:51,905
(Interested)

431
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:53,307
You could live here.

432
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:55,675
Compared to the studio apartment you lived in...

433
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:59,317
when things were tough, this place is far better.

434
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:03,185
- I mean it.
- I have many family members.

435
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:04,826
My wife and I always talk...

436
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:08,256
about wanting to live alone in a house like this one.

437
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:10,556
You're talking about that for the first time.

438
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:14,027
We just thought it'd be nice to have a small place for ourselves.

439
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:16,297
You must be very discontent with your marriage.

440
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:20,935
I'm not discontent. It's just that our house is usually noisy.

441
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:22,906
My wife also talks about that.

442
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:25,445
It's not like...

443
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:27,107
(I have no complaints, honey.)

444
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:29,847
- Are you cooking mushroom rice?
- That's right.

445
00:19:30,577 --> 00:19:32,817
It's for my boys.

446
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:34,386
(Impressed)

447
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:37,586
When we were on "Reply 1988",

448
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:39,185
- we had great memories...
- Yes.

449
00:19:39,186 --> 00:19:41,256
in Daegu. The famous raw beef.

450
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:43,056
You guys loved it, so...

451
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,326
It was so delicious.

452
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:46,067
I asked for it when I heard you were coming.

453
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:48,836
(Dong Il brought raw beef...)

454
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:50,996
(to the filming site of "Reply 1988".)

455
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:52,465
That's what I'm good at.

456
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:57,576
(All members of the staff had happy memories.)

457
00:19:57,577 --> 00:19:59,276
I got it by express bus delivery.

458
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:01,176
- This morning?
- Yes, from Daegu.

459
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:02,846
- Raw beef.
- Raw beef.

460
00:20:02,847 --> 00:20:04,846
So our lunch is braised spicy chicken and...

461
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:06,086
Yes, he's cooking braised spicy chicken.

462
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:08,455
- That's all we're eating, right?
- Yes.

463
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:09,486
Okay.

464
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:11,625
Then I'll make rolled omelets.

465
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:13,026
- Rolled omelets.
- Yes.

466
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:15,027
Make a giant one.

467
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:18,296
Let's offer them the most precious meal...

468
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:20,496
- Thank you.
- in the world.

469
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:22,367
You'll be surprised.

470
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:26,807
(Chop fresh raw beef...)

471
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,676
(and dip it in the special sauce.)

472
00:20:30,837 --> 00:20:34,446
(It'll bring back the memories on "Reply 1988".)

473
00:20:34,676 --> 00:20:36,916
(Dong Il's raw beef of memories)

474
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:40,817
(Youngest's first-ever cooking for the seniors)

475
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,827
(The wonderful combination of spicy soup and chicken)

476
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,686
(Myoung's cauldron-braised spicy chicken)

477
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,225
(Hee Won makes the side dish that's loved by everyone, )

478
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:51,966
(rolled omelets.)

479
00:20:52,926 --> 00:20:56,367
(And they put the special cuts of pork they bought over a fire.)

480
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:59,706
There's fire everywhere.

481
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:04,036
(How will the special lunch taste?)

482
00:21:04,037 --> 00:21:05,445
You could live here.

483
00:21:05,446 --> 00:21:07,145
Yes, it has everything.

484
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:09,577
You can't actually live here, though.

485
00:21:10,077 --> 00:21:13,287
(Youngest became the main chef for the first time ever.)

486
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:16,056
(3 potatoes)

487
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:17,286
And...

488
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:20,426
(How many carrots should I use?)

489
00:21:20,956 --> 00:21:23,156
(Just one.)

490
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:26,296
(Is it too few?)

491
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:27,366
Good.

492
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:29,735
(Half a carrot more?)

493
00:21:29,736 --> 00:21:31,066
(He tries to break it with his hands, )

494
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:33,867
(but it doesn't work that well.)

495
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:35,975
(Torn)

496
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:39,277
It'll be the rarest meal in the world.

497
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:40,875
- Sung Kyun.
- Yes.

498
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:43,445
- I'll cook that for you.
- Thank you.

499
00:21:43,446 --> 00:21:44,945
You'll be surprised.

500
00:21:44,946 --> 00:21:47,087
(Back to 2 carrots. No?)

501
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:51,357
(He can't decide how many vegetables to use as there are more people.)

502
00:21:52,126 --> 00:21:53,826
Why, Youngest? Is it too cramped?

503
00:21:53,827 --> 00:21:55,996
No, take your time. I have to...

504
00:21:55,997 --> 00:21:57,826
- You can wash them here.
- Okay.

505
00:21:57,827 --> 00:21:59,466
- Right.
- I'll stand here.

506
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:01,297
Let me just wash the rice.

507
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:04,807
(Let's wash the vegetables first!)

508
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:07,635
(He wears cotton gloves first, and...)

509
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:09,777
I think we should put the charcoal here.

510
00:22:15,216 --> 00:22:19,347
(He washes them in water with cotton gloves on.)

511
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:23,087
(Dazed Myoung)

512
00:22:23,857 --> 00:22:26,056
(He works hard, not knowing what's wrong.)

513
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:27,587
(Wet)

514
00:22:28,357 --> 00:22:29,625
- Did you wear gloves?
- Yes.

515
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:30,996
Good. Hey, you...

516
00:22:30,997 --> 00:22:32,596
- They go inside the rubber gloves!
- Oh, right.

517
00:22:32,597 --> 00:22:33,666
You...

518
00:22:34,597 --> 00:22:36,066
You must be still half-asleep.

519
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:37,136
(Embarrassed)

520
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:40,337
(I'm a fool)

521
00:22:41,406 --> 00:22:44,077
(He must be nervous to cook his first meal.)

522
00:22:45,777 --> 00:22:46,946
(Startled)

523
00:22:47,476 --> 00:22:50,416
(He keeps making mistakes.)

524
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:53,787
(When he trims the onions, )

525
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:56,385
(he taps on them twice as if he's breaking an egg.)

526
00:22:56,386 --> 00:22:57,416
Hee Won!

527
00:22:57,587 --> 00:22:59,757
(He peels them in a new way.)

528
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:02,896
(He does his best to peel the carrots, but...)

529
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:07,626
(Peeling too much)

530
00:23:08,297 --> 00:23:09,996
I think the peels are off.

531
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:12,136
(I think the peels are off.)

532
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:16,736
(How thick are the peels?)

533
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:18,905
(Disciplined Youngest keeps making mistakes for some reason.)

534
00:23:18,906 --> 00:23:19,975
No!

535
00:23:19,976 --> 00:23:21,746
(Disciplined Youngest keeps making mistakes for some reason.)

536
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:22,816
My carrot.

537
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:24,375
This is really expensive. Look.

538
00:23:24,376 --> 00:23:26,086
- They're so thin.
- Why doesn't it work?

539
00:23:26,087 --> 00:23:27,087
(Glancing)

540
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,086
Can I help you with anything?

541
00:23:29,087 --> 00:23:31,186
- Tell me if I can help.
- Okay.

542
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:32,956
I have nothing else to do.

543
00:23:34,587 --> 00:23:36,726
(I'll try it myself.)

544
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:39,266
(Can he finish his braised spicy chicken?)

545
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:41,396
I'm going to eat lots of vegetables.

546
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:44,166
Open the raw beef.

547
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:46,136
- The raw beef...
- Oh, the raw beef.

548
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:49,277
You guys open it with a knife.

549
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:52,107
(Looking forward to it)

550
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:55,776
- Oh, my.
- It's a lot.

551
00:23:55,777 --> 00:23:58,516
- This is so scrumptious.
- It's seriously tasty.

552
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:00,117
It tastes amazing.

553
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:03,087
- Is that beef?
- Yes.

554
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:06,486
It's really delicious. Dong Il brought this to the shoot.

555
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:09,896
(He comes out to prepare the dish they had together.)

556
00:24:10,196 --> 00:24:12,796
Take a seat. I'll unwrap this.

557
00:24:12,797 --> 00:24:15,566
We need to relieve our hunger first. Let's have this.

558
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:16,636
- Okay.
- That would be great.

559
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:18,135
Goodness.

560
00:24:18,136 --> 00:24:19,236
Look at this.

561
00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:22,406
(Exclaiming)

562
00:24:23,537 --> 00:24:26,206
(Happy)

563
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,116
(He cuts it right away.)

564
00:24:30,117 --> 00:24:32,547
- Which cut is it?
- It's a cut of beef.

565
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:34,415
(He laughs at Dong Il's joke.)

566
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:35,486
"A cut of beef".

567
00:24:36,216 --> 00:24:38,425
There's not much fat, so I guess it's not sirloin.

568
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:40,327
Right. Last time,

569
00:24:41,186 --> 00:24:44,196
they cut this into cubes.

570
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,826
I think they didn't cut it this time on purpose.

571
00:24:46,827 --> 00:24:47,997
We were shooting then,

572
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:49,936
- so they cut it into pieces.
- That's right.

573
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:51,935
- Since it's easier to eat that way.
- Right.

574
00:24:51,936 --> 00:24:53,165
(Raw beef brings back their old memories.)

575
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,636
It's good to be here together. It reminds me of the old days.

576
00:24:56,337 --> 00:24:58,777
(You're right.)

577
00:24:59,176 --> 00:25:01,307
(He agrees.)

578
00:25:02,577 --> 00:25:06,916
(It reminds them vividly of the time they spent together.)

579
00:25:07,517 --> 00:25:09,716
(Raw beef makes them recall their old days.)

580
00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:13,886
Food plating is really important for us.

581
00:25:14,027 --> 00:25:15,126
It looks really nice.

582
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:19,027
Since you guys say you all like this,

583
00:25:19,196 --> 00:25:21,767
it makes me feel good too.

584
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:25,205
Make the sauce now. Make it two.

585
00:25:25,206 --> 00:25:26,706
- Make it two?
- Yes.

586
00:25:27,037 --> 00:25:30,337
I think we added a lot of oil when we made it last time.

587
00:25:32,446 --> 00:25:34,777
- I just need to add the oil?
- I guess so.

588
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:37,276
It will be greasy if you add it too much.

589
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:38,547
(Pouring)

590
00:25:39,186 --> 00:25:41,716
I think this sauce is amazing.

591
00:25:42,956 --> 00:25:45,656
This is a real deal.

592
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:48,695
Hee Won is particular about foods,

593
00:25:48,696 --> 00:25:50,827
but he actually buys and eats it at home.

594
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:52,695
He asks me to get it.

595
00:25:52,696 --> 00:25:53,867
(Adding sesame seeds)

596
00:25:54,837 --> 00:26:01,577
(Chewy and savory raw beef by Dong Il is ready.)

597
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:03,935
Try it with the sauce.

598
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:06,406
(Sung Kyun tries it first with the sauce.)

599
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:08,747
- It's good.
- Moo Sung.

600
00:26:09,216 --> 00:26:11,716
(Smiling)

601
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:13,945
(He eats it right away as if he was waiting for it.)

602
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:15,656
(His eyes widen.)

603
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:18,116
Hee Won, come here. This is what you like.

604
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:20,455
- I'm working on the fire.
- You need to use wood for this.

605
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:22,497
It will get all over the place like before.

606
00:26:24,257 --> 00:26:25,566
- Myoung. Here.
- Yes?

607
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:26,695
(Myoung is busy cooking.)

608
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:28,236
Try it with the sauce.

609
00:26:29,396 --> 00:26:30,435
(His eyes widen.)

610
00:26:30,436 --> 00:26:31,497
It's so good, right?

611
00:26:32,736 --> 00:26:33,807
(Savoring)

612
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:36,636
Let's eat first.

613
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:38,776
- Dong Il. Thank you for the food.
- Sure.

614
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:39,807
(The lunch begins.)

615
00:26:40,277 --> 00:26:41,675
Only a few pieces...

616
00:26:41,676 --> 00:26:43,077
- will be enough to make you full.
- That's right.

617
00:26:43,817 --> 00:26:46,386
I think that raw beef tastes better...

618
00:26:46,946 --> 00:26:50,087
when it's cut into big chunks.

619
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,287
What do you think? You wanted to have this.

620
00:26:53,986 --> 00:26:55,296
- It's good.
- Is it good?

621
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:56,297
Yes. It's so good.

622
00:26:58,426 --> 00:26:59,497
It's good.

623
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:02,367
- This sauce is amazing.
- It is amazing, right?

624
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:03,837
It's so amazing.

625
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,337
I don't usually eat raw beef.

626
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:09,037
- But it's good.
- But for this,

627
00:27:09,777 --> 00:27:10,876
I really enjoy it.

628
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:13,506
- It's good, right?
- Right.

629
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,576
(He takes a bite while recalling the old times.)

630
00:27:14,577 --> 00:27:15,617
It's good.

631
00:27:16,277 --> 00:27:17,346
This is so good.

632
00:27:17,347 --> 00:27:19,216
(Another bite)

633
00:27:20,146 --> 00:27:21,985
Gosh! It's so good.

634
00:27:21,986 --> 00:27:23,386
(They can't stop eating.)

635
00:27:23,857 --> 00:27:28,456
(While they are devouring the raw beef...)

636
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:31,796
- How did you make this sauce?
- Just take the whole chunk.

637
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:34,426
I've never had a sauce like this before.

638
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:37,997
(He's busy cooking.)

639
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:41,807
(Glancing)

640
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:46,047
(He takes a piece of raw beef.)

641
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,747
Try this.

642
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:50,246
This is so good.

643
00:27:50,247 --> 00:27:52,246
(Moo Sung takes care of Youngest.)

644
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:53,317
It's good, right?

645
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:54,646
This is really good.

646
00:27:54,647 --> 00:27:57,117
(He comes back to his seat nonchalantly.)

647
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,626
(I love you, Moo Sung.)

648
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:04,156
(Sung Kyun also checks on Youngest.)

649
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:08,635
(Youngest faces the whole chicken.)

650
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:09,767
Do you...

651
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:11,336
Do you want me to prepare the chicken?

652
00:28:11,337 --> 00:28:12,465
Can you?

653
00:28:12,466 --> 00:28:13,807
- Let me do it for you.
- All right.

654
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:15,376
I had nothing to do anyway.

655
00:28:16,307 --> 00:28:17,675
- Bring it here.
- Okay.

656
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:18,945
(He takes the chicken without hesitation.)

657
00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:22,176
(Appearing out of the blue)

658
00:28:23,216 --> 00:28:24,986
- Be careful not to hurt your hand.
- All right.

659
00:28:25,946 --> 00:28:29,956
(He cuts the drumstick without hesitation.)

660
00:28:31,117 --> 00:28:33,257
This is still too big, so I need to cut it again.

661
00:28:35,226 --> 00:28:36,357
Drumsticks.

662
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:39,726
(Looking at the chicken makes him hungry again.)

663
00:28:39,827 --> 00:28:40,866
- Should I cut it?
- Go ahead.

664
00:28:40,867 --> 00:28:42,236
(He cuts it powerfully.)

665
00:28:42,736 --> 00:28:44,337
- It worked as I cut it hard.
- Right.

666
00:28:45,466 --> 00:28:46,506
That's right.

667
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:48,066
(He strikes it.)

668
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:50,405
He hits different places for each stroke.

669
00:28:50,406 --> 00:28:51,635
(Glancing)

670
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:52,806
He did it right this time.

671
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:56,077
(He must be doing a good job.)

672
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:57,577
That's the neck.

673
00:28:58,416 --> 00:28:59,416
Watch your hand.

674
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:00,685
You must hit this part here.

675
00:29:00,686 --> 00:29:02,155
(His chicken prepping skill makes the spectators focus.)

676
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:04,116
That's right. I even need to tell him this.

677
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,126
- Goodness.
- I knew it.

678
00:29:07,226 --> 00:29:08,725
Now he's enjoying it.

679
00:29:08,726 --> 00:29:09,895
(Thanks to the help of tough Sung Kyun...)

680
00:29:09,896 --> 00:29:10,926
He got it now.

681
00:29:11,257 --> 00:29:12,326
Great.

682
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:14,625
(He's done cutting the huge chicken.)

683
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:16,165
See? It's done in no time.

684
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,436
- It was amazing. Good job.
- That was amazing.

685
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:20,867
- Sung Kyun. Come out now.
- Okay.

686
00:29:21,507 --> 00:29:25,676
(Taking the chicken Sung Kyun prepared)

687
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:28,306
(He cleans it thoroughly.)

688
00:29:28,307 --> 00:29:29,317
That's a lot.

689
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:35,587
(To get rid of the chicken odor, )

690
00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:40,156
(he puts in bay leaves.)

691
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:43,426
(He cuts some ginger.)

692
00:29:44,297 --> 00:29:46,997
(He adds it to get rid of the smell.)

693
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:50,367
(Myoung is here.)

694
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:53,636
- Is it done already?
- No. I just need to boil it.

695
00:29:55,037 --> 00:29:57,676
- There are bay leaves and ginger.
- Make sure it's balanced.

696
00:29:58,876 --> 00:30:00,705
That pot looks quite classy.

697
00:30:00,706 --> 00:30:02,146
(He has an unusual taste.)

698
00:30:03,646 --> 00:30:05,117
Make sure it's balanced.

699
00:30:08,686 --> 00:30:09,756
(The members are trying to help the youngest.)

700
00:30:09,757 --> 00:30:11,655
- Turn it.
- Let me see, Myoung.

701
00:30:11,656 --> 00:30:12,986
Make it face this way. No, I mean...

702
00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:15,027
I mean you need to turn the stove.

703
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:17,226
- Like this?
- No. Just turn it.

704
00:30:18,027 --> 00:30:19,326
- Is it okay?
- It's good.

705
00:30:19,327 --> 00:30:20,327
Is it okay?

706
00:30:20,626 --> 00:30:22,997
(Finally, it's on the fire.)

707
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:26,206
(Hee Won takes a look at it.)

708
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:28,976
It's ready now.

709
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,307
You two, come here.

710
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:31,807
Take a seat, Myoung.

711
00:30:32,676 --> 00:30:35,076
Take it and try it.

712
00:30:35,077 --> 00:30:36,277
Try it. It's so good.

713
00:30:37,247 --> 00:30:39,445
(He finally takes a bite.)

714
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:41,787
(Savoring)

715
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:43,856
- Isn't it great?
- It is.

716
00:30:43,857 --> 00:30:45,656
It's even better because it's warm today.

717
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:47,426
(Even while he's enjoying the food...)

718
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:48,726
(Staring)

719
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:53,067
(His spicy braised chicken is soaked in water.)

720
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:54,725
Have a seat, Sung Kyun.

721
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:58,537
(He's thinking about the next step of his recipe.)

722
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:02,136
(Thinking hard)

723
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,976
(He takes a bite first.)

724
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:11,346
(While enjoying the raw beef, )

725
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:13,847
(he glances at it again.)

726
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:18,416
(In the end, he gets up.)

727
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:25,097
(He returns to the kitchen.)

728
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:28,297
(While the chicken is being cooked, )

729
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:31,636
(Youngest makes the sauce.)

730
00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:33,866
(Hee Won follows him while grunting.)

731
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:36,436
(Grunting)

732
00:31:37,507 --> 00:31:38,905
I need to make rolled omelet.

733
00:31:38,906 --> 00:31:40,577
Myoung.

734
00:31:41,206 --> 00:31:43,746
(He takes out his phone.)

735
00:31:43,747 --> 00:31:45,986
(Looking serious)

736
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,155
(He's looking at something carefully.)

737
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:51,456
(Loud)

738
00:31:52,726 --> 00:31:54,455
(A familiar voice comes out from his phone.)

739
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:59,466
(If you put big pieces of ingredients in rolled omelet...)

740
00:31:59,896 --> 00:32:02,766
(It's not hard to make rolled omelet.)

741
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:04,767
(All right. I'm ready.)

742
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,106
(He scans ingredients first.)

743
00:32:07,107 --> 00:32:08,205
Scallions.

744
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:09,337
(Scallions)

745
00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:12,106
(Hee Won shows Myoung the scallions.)

746
00:32:12,107 --> 00:32:13,146
- Scallions?
- Yes.

747
00:32:15,007 --> 00:32:16,945
Should I put two of these?

748
00:32:16,946 --> 00:32:18,787
Is it too much? Do we need just one?

749
00:32:18,986 --> 00:32:20,145
(Myoung is busy checking his recipe.)

750
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,456
No, I think we need to add two of them.

751
00:32:23,787 --> 00:32:25,955
Okay. Do we put onions in it?

752
00:32:25,956 --> 00:32:28,185
- We don't add onions, right?
- No.

753
00:32:28,186 --> 00:32:29,426
(He's still busy.)

754
00:32:30,297 --> 00:32:32,966
Chives? I don't think we need chives.

755
00:32:34,426 --> 00:32:37,367
Chives? Scallions will do, right?

756
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:39,837
These two will be enough, right?

757
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:43,205
Do we put Cheongyang chili in rolled omelet?

758
00:32:43,206 --> 00:32:44,876
- Yes?
- Do we put Cheongyang chili in it?

759
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,606
We could put it in.

760
00:32:47,607 --> 00:32:49,817
- Right? We can put it in.
- Sure.

761
00:32:50,077 --> 00:32:52,287
Should we add three? Would that be enough?

762
00:32:52,547 --> 00:32:53,646
Two? All right.

763
00:32:56,216 --> 00:32:58,885
When it comes to rolled omelets...

764
00:32:58,886 --> 00:33:01,186
- Yes?
- I saw how to make it.

765
00:33:01,656 --> 00:33:04,856
It said that the vegetables should be cut into small pieces.

766
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,566
(It said that the vegetables should be cut into small pieces.)

767
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,926
That's a must.

768
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:11,736
(To chop up the scallion...)

769
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:13,135
(He must have learned this skill from the video.)

770
00:33:13,136 --> 00:33:16,406
(Biting his lips)

771
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:20,676
(He must have also learned this skill from the video.)

772
00:33:21,077 --> 00:33:23,216
(Getting rid of chili seeds)

773
00:33:23,517 --> 00:33:25,847
(He preps the ingredients delicately.)

774
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:29,756
(He chops and chops.)

775
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:32,526
(While Hee Won is focused on chopping the vegetables...)

776
00:33:33,787 --> 00:33:36,826
(Myoung begins making the sauce for the braised spicy chicken.)

777
00:33:36,827 --> 00:33:38,696
(Doenjang)

778
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:42,465
(He adds plum syrup, cooking wine, )

779
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:45,307
(and garlic.)

780
00:33:46,307 --> 00:33:50,676
(He rinses the blanched chicken.)

781
00:33:51,577 --> 00:33:55,376
(He mixes it with the sauce.)

782
00:33:55,377 --> 00:33:56,546
Is it done already?

783
00:33:57,477 --> 00:33:59,385
(Hee Won is still chopping the scallions.)

784
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:00,546
You finished it so fast.

785
00:34:01,287 --> 00:34:02,416
(Tilting his head)

786
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:05,956
I don't think we can have rolled omelet today at this rate.

787
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:07,057
(Don't worry.)

788
00:34:09,727 --> 00:34:12,497
Doesn't it sound like I'm a trained chef?

789
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:15,097
This sound is amazing. Don't you think so?

790
00:34:18,497 --> 00:34:20,836
(The cauldron lid for braised spicy chicken is ready.)

791
00:34:21,307 --> 00:34:22,377
(Impressed)

792
00:34:23,477 --> 00:34:25,346
- Are we going to grill it on this?
- Right.

793
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:26,376
(Dong Il installs the cauldron lid for Myoung.)

794
00:34:26,377 --> 00:34:27,647
It's ready now.

795
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:29,775
Give it to me.

796
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,847
(Kind)

797
00:34:31,776 --> 00:34:34,287
(Careful)

798
00:34:34,546 --> 00:34:36,816
- Carrying it is the trickiest part.
- Why is that?

799
00:34:37,316 --> 00:34:40,687
I'll become an arch-enemy if I pour it over.

800
00:34:40,957 --> 00:34:42,856
(You're right.)

801
00:34:43,397 --> 00:34:44,525
- Should I pour it all?
- Yes.

802
00:34:44,526 --> 00:34:46,565
I'll add some water here.

803
00:34:46,566 --> 00:34:48,025
You're going to add some water? That'd be good.

804
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:49,166
Pour it here.

805
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:51,236
There's the sauce left here.

806
00:34:52,336 --> 00:34:53,666
(He pours it over.)

807
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:54,667
Good.

808
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:56,175
(They just started to simmer it, but it already looks scrumptious.)

809
00:34:56,176 --> 00:34:58,577
Myoung. Look at this. This is great.

810
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:00,747
Shouldn't we hold a feast?

811
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:04,716
- The chicken was huge.
- I think...

812
00:35:05,716 --> 00:35:07,787
- it'll be enough for five servings.
- I know, right?

813
00:35:08,517 --> 00:35:09,585
It looks so good.

814
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:11,315
(They just need to boil it now.)

815
00:35:11,316 --> 00:35:12,786
It's already boiling since the heat is high.

816
00:35:12,787 --> 00:35:15,457
(Simmering)

817
00:35:16,397 --> 00:35:20,296
(Hee Won just started cracking eggs.)

818
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:24,036
(Hitting)

819
00:35:24,037 --> 00:35:25,707
(He puts the knife down.)

820
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:28,136
(He cracks eggs.)

821
00:35:30,906 --> 00:35:34,446
(He's cracking eggs in three steps.)

822
00:35:35,776 --> 00:35:40,017
(He does it carefully without making a mistake.)

823
00:35:40,886 --> 00:35:42,917
(Hitting carefully)

824
00:35:43,886 --> 00:35:45,086
(He puts the knife down.)

825
00:35:45,486 --> 00:35:46,586
(Now, it's time to break the egg.)

826
00:35:47,986 --> 00:35:49,627
Why did I put it in here?

827
00:35:50,026 --> 00:35:51,255
(He made a mistake.)

828
00:35:51,256 --> 00:35:54,066
I should've put it in there after I crack it.

829
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:58,696
(But he continues making rolled omelet.)

830
00:35:59,506 --> 00:36:02,405
(He brings something without any hesitation.)

831
00:36:02,406 --> 00:36:04,077
(Sprinkling)

832
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:06,977
(He adds a generous amount of curry powder.)

833
00:36:07,676 --> 00:36:10,176
(He mixes it well.)

834
00:36:10,676 --> 00:36:13,347
(He takes some paper towels.)

835
00:36:14,147 --> 00:36:17,057
(Rolling)

836
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:19,655
(He dips it in the oil, )

837
00:36:19,656 --> 00:36:21,957
(and rub it on the frying pan.)

838
00:36:22,856 --> 00:36:25,796
(Showing off the new skill he learned from his teacher)

839
00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:30,037
(He starts making rolled omelets.)

840
00:36:31,196 --> 00:36:35,136
(Pour in two ladles of the egg mixture.)

841
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:41,347
(He's flipping it right after he poured it in?)

842
00:36:42,176 --> 00:36:43,876
(He's poking the egg mixture when it's not even cooked yet.)

843
00:36:43,877 --> 00:36:46,816
(Slopping)

844
00:36:47,316 --> 00:36:50,386
(He's pretty serious.)

845
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,925
(He tries to stop the egg mixture from flowing.)

846
00:36:52,926 --> 00:36:54,356
Gosh. This egg is...

847
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:57,127
(Crinkled)

848
00:36:57,526 --> 00:36:58,526
Goodness.

849
00:36:58,527 --> 00:36:59,596
(This is not easy.)

850
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:00,597
(Pouting)

851
00:37:01,827 --> 00:37:03,266
It's hard to roll it.

852
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:05,767
(He tries his best to roll it.)

853
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:07,937
(Covering)

854
00:37:08,537 --> 00:37:09,905
(He fixes it with the remaining part.)

855
00:37:09,906 --> 00:37:11,106
Rolled omelet is...

856
00:37:12,136 --> 00:37:14,347
I added too much egg mixture.

857
00:37:15,247 --> 00:37:16,376
(It seems he got the hang of it.)

858
00:37:16,377 --> 00:37:17,675
I see. This is how I do it.

859
00:37:17,676 --> 00:37:18,747
(It seems he got the hang of it.)

860
00:37:19,247 --> 00:37:22,517
(This time, he adds only one ladle of egg mixture.)

861
00:37:23,386 --> 00:37:28,057
(He holds tools on both hands.)

862
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:33,526
(He rolls it as if he's making gimbap.)

863
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:35,367
Goodness.

864
00:37:36,437 --> 00:37:37,566
Gosh.

865
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:40,867
(But it's hard to roll it.)

866
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:44,506
(He buckles down and fixes it.)

867
00:37:45,577 --> 00:37:49,347
(He made a cone made of eggs.)

868
00:37:49,747 --> 00:37:52,347
(It's not easy to make rolled omelet.)

869
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:56,686
(But I won't give up!)

870
00:37:56,687 --> 00:37:57,815
Gosh. It's rolled omelet.

871
00:37:57,816 --> 00:37:58,957
(Gosh. It's rolled omelet.)

872
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:00,187
Rolled omelet?

873
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:03,296
- You're making a lot.
- It'll be delicious, you know.

874
00:38:03,557 --> 00:38:05,056
- It looks delicious.
- Right.

875
00:38:05,057 --> 00:38:07,565
It looks fluffy.

876
00:38:07,566 --> 00:38:08,627
- Really?
- That's what I like.

877
00:38:09,636 --> 00:38:12,167
But it's hard to shape it.

878
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:13,767
To be honest.

879
00:38:14,236 --> 00:38:15,735
(When he was rolling it without any expectations...)

880
00:38:15,736 --> 00:38:18,006
- Goodness. Look.
- You did it.

881
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:20,876
(He successfully rolls it again.)

882
00:38:20,877 --> 00:38:23,917
Don't you think I've done a good job with this?

883
00:38:24,877 --> 00:38:25,945
You did great.

884
00:38:25,946 --> 00:38:27,147
(He finally got the hang of it.)

885
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:29,815
It fell apart.

886
00:38:29,816 --> 00:38:31,356
I flipped it so well.

887
00:38:31,886 --> 00:38:33,386
- Right? I flipped it well.
- Right.

888
00:38:33,756 --> 00:38:35,086
- Am I doing it right?
- Yes.

889
00:38:35,526 --> 00:38:36,925
(Dong Il came after hearing the good news.)

890
00:38:36,926 --> 00:38:39,466
- Cut this.
- Dong Il. I rolled it well, right?

891
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,367
Give me a bigger piece. I want to taste it.

892
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:45,396
Dong Il. It tastes amazing.

893
00:38:45,397 --> 00:38:47,367
(He takes a bite.)

894
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:50,636
It's good. Try it.

895
00:38:51,006 --> 00:38:52,175
- It's good.
- It's no joke.

896
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:53,276
- It's really good.
- Right.

897
00:38:54,906 --> 00:38:57,117
- Here.
- Try it. You seasoned it well.

898
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,486
- It's delicious.
- Isn't it good?

899
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:02,286
It's not easy to make rolled omelets.

900
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:04,386
Gosh. I'm afraid you might ask me to cook again.

901
00:39:05,117 --> 00:39:07,127
(Hee Won seems excited.)

902
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:09,326
- It's hard to make rolled omelet.
- Right. It's difficult.

903
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:11,397
I wasn't going to cook, but...

904
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:13,097
The fire looks perfect now.

905
00:39:13,497 --> 00:39:15,097
What do we grill first? Should we start with pork belly?

906
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:19,707
Hee Won said he liked pork jowl meat.

907
00:39:20,506 --> 00:39:23,806
(Chewy white cut...)

908
00:39:23,807 --> 00:39:25,176
- Pork jowl meat?
- Yes.

909
00:39:25,377 --> 00:39:26,846
It'll take some time to cook since it's thick.

910
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:27,847
(and a generous amount of pork jowl meat that Hee Won loves)

911
00:39:28,506 --> 00:39:30,417
(He adds another menu naturally.)

912
00:39:30,747 --> 00:39:32,076
It's being cooked so well.

913
00:39:32,077 --> 00:39:34,446
- Is it being cooked well?
- Sure thing.

914
00:39:35,517 --> 00:39:38,017
(Gulping)

915
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:39,726
(Myoung's first dish, braised spicy chicken on a cauldron lid is ready.)

916
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:42,957
There's no need to worry now, Myoung. Well done.

917
00:39:44,397 --> 00:39:47,766
Gosh. I'm sure you'll love this rolled omelet.

918
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:48,796
(Rolled omelet that Hee Won made with a lot of effort)

919
00:39:49,196 --> 00:39:52,605
I think this kimchi will be the rival of your rolled omelet.

920
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:54,206
(Sung Kyun brought his kimchi too.)

921
00:39:54,207 --> 00:39:56,936
- Goodness.
- I can't wait to try it.

922
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:57,976
(Expectant)

923
00:39:57,977 --> 00:40:00,206
- You're shredding it?
- I hope you guys will like it.

924
00:40:00,207 --> 00:40:01,606
(Sung Kyun shreds it with his hands.)

925
00:40:02,307 --> 00:40:03,545
Goodness. What do I do with this?

926
00:40:03,546 --> 00:40:06,386
Braised spicy chicken smells so good.

927
00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:08,885
(A meal filled with their memories is ready.)

928
00:40:08,886 --> 00:40:10,786
This is awesome.

929
00:40:10,787 --> 00:40:11,787
(A meal filled with their memories is ready.)

930
00:40:12,156 --> 00:40:14,627
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

931
00:40:16,696 --> 00:40:17,796
Let's dig in.

932
00:40:18,827 --> 00:40:20,925
You can just cut it. Cut it in half.

933
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:22,466
(Hee Won's whole rolled omelet)

934
00:40:23,437 --> 00:40:25,866
It looks really delicious, Hee Won.

935
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:26,867
It is delicious.

936
00:40:26,868 --> 00:40:28,536
I added my secret ingredient.

937
00:40:28,537 --> 00:40:30,106
(Exclaiming)

938
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:32,905
(Sung Kyun cuts it into a bite-sized piece.)

939
00:40:32,906 --> 00:40:35,347
(Taking a bite)

940
00:40:36,577 --> 00:40:37,676
How do you like my rolled omelet?

941
00:40:39,386 --> 00:40:42,556
(Savoring)

942
00:40:42,557 --> 00:40:43,585
- Isn't it good?
- It is.

943
00:40:43,586 --> 00:40:44,856
- I smell curry.
- Right.

944
00:40:46,187 --> 00:40:47,287
I added curry powder.

945
00:40:47,886 --> 00:40:49,397
- That must be why.
- Yes.

946
00:40:49,696 --> 00:40:51,426
(Chewing)

947
00:40:53,196 --> 00:40:54,696
I can smell curry.

948
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:57,796
This is really tasty.

949
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:00,806
I should put some curry powder...

950
00:41:00,807 --> 00:41:02,206
- in rolled omelet too.
- I know, right?

951
00:41:02,207 --> 00:41:03,877
- Really?
- It tastes really different.

952
00:41:04,577 --> 00:41:05,577
I've never thought about it.

953
00:41:05,577 --> 00:41:06,577
(An unexpected combination of rolled omelet and curry powder)

954
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:09,376
Really? I just added it since it was there.

955
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:10,576
(Really? I just added it since it was there.)

956
00:41:10,577 --> 00:41:12,586
(Chuckling)

957
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:14,986
(Laughing)

958
00:41:15,316 --> 00:41:16,385
(He's cool.)

959
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:17,585
You just added it since it was there.

960
00:41:17,586 --> 00:41:18,687
(He's cool.)

961
00:41:18,856 --> 00:41:22,597
(It's time to taste Youngest's braised spicy chicken.)

962
00:41:25,057 --> 00:41:27,397
(Smirking)

963
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:29,367
Gosh. What's wrong with this braised spicy chicken?

964
00:41:30,897 --> 00:41:34,105
(They don't like it?)

965
00:41:34,106 --> 00:41:35,906
- This is amazing.
- Right.

966
00:41:36,906 --> 00:41:39,577
(I was worried.)

967
00:41:40,176 --> 00:41:41,247
It looks good.

968
00:41:41,406 --> 00:41:45,946
(Sung Kyun tries a big piece too.)

969
00:41:48,617 --> 00:41:49,986
(Savoring)

970
00:41:50,187 --> 00:41:52,586
(It's delicious.)

971
00:41:53,926 --> 00:41:55,756
It's so good, Myoung. You did great.

972
00:41:57,127 --> 00:41:58,327
(Exclaiming)

973
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:01,867
(Shy)

974
00:42:02,267 --> 00:42:03,966
- Braised spicy chicken is so great.
- I know, right?

975
00:42:05,597 --> 00:42:07,537
(Savoring)

976
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:09,136
It's not as good as my rolled omelet, though.

977
00:42:09,937 --> 00:42:12,477
(Dumbfounded)

978
00:42:12,946 --> 00:42:16,577
(That's Hee Won.)

979
00:42:17,517 --> 00:42:20,386
(Dong Il tries Sung Kyun's kimchi.)

980
00:42:20,517 --> 00:42:21,546
(Exclaiming)

981
00:42:22,287 --> 00:42:23,386
Isn't it good?

982
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:26,827
- It's so good.
- It's good.

983
00:42:28,127 --> 00:42:31,396
Did you make this kimchi with your wife?

984
00:42:31,397 --> 00:42:32,397
Yes.

985
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:38,696
(It's even more delicious if you eat it with warm rice.)

986
00:42:40,006 --> 00:42:42,066
I can't stop eating this kimchi.

987
00:42:46,747 --> 00:42:48,877
- Thank you, honey.
- Goodness.

988
00:42:50,617 --> 00:42:52,747
(Meanwhile, Hee Won is...)

989
00:42:54,687 --> 00:42:57,617
I put scallions in it. Try it with some meat.

990
00:42:57,716 --> 00:42:59,187
Right. I should eat it when it's still warm.

991
00:43:00,156 --> 00:43:01,956
This braised spicy chicken is...

992
00:43:01,957 --> 00:43:03,755
(He puts the meat on kimchi.)

993
00:43:03,756 --> 00:43:07,397
(Having a big bite)

994
00:43:09,497 --> 00:43:11,767
Dong Il. Try this pork with kimchi.

995
00:43:11,997 --> 00:43:13,466
- It's delicious, isn't it?
- Yes.

996
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,505
(Sung Kyun tries it as Hee Won recommended.)

997
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:16,536
This is so delicious.

998
00:43:16,537 --> 00:43:18,736
(Sung Kyun tries it as Hee Won recommended.)

999
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,247
All the dishes go well together.

1000
00:43:21,707 --> 00:43:24,376
They really go well together.

1001
00:43:24,377 --> 00:43:25,577
(Youngest eats the meat with sesame oil sauce.)

1002
00:43:26,816 --> 00:43:28,186
(Meanwhile, this person is eating without saying a word.)

1003
00:43:28,187 --> 00:43:30,287
- All you need is kimchi.
- Exactly.

1004
00:43:31,156 --> 00:43:33,585
You can make kimchi stew, kimchi fried rice, and everything.

1005
00:43:33,586 --> 00:43:34,655
(Moo Sung looks like he's a big eater, but...)

1006
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:36,057
- You can also make kimchi jeon.
- Right.

1007
00:43:36,897 --> 00:43:40,727
(A little bit of scallion salad and rolled omelet)

1008
00:43:41,526 --> 00:43:44,196
(He takes a big piece of white cut.)

1009
00:43:44,696 --> 00:43:46,605
(In two bites)

1010
00:43:46,606 --> 00:43:48,366
(In three bites)

1011
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:49,736
(In four bites)

1012
00:43:50,136 --> 00:43:52,477
(Why is he eating so sparingly?)

1013
00:43:53,906 --> 00:43:55,106
Moo Sung, you should finish it.

1014
00:43:55,506 --> 00:43:57,077
- All of this?
- Yes.

1015
00:43:58,816 --> 00:44:00,187
I can't eat more than one bowl of rice these days.

1016
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:02,247
I don't have much appetite.

1017
00:44:03,287 --> 00:44:05,886
(You?)

1018
00:44:06,356 --> 00:44:08,156
I used to be able to eat about seven servings in these bowls.

1019
00:44:09,057 --> 00:44:11,457
(7 servings?)

1020
00:44:12,796 --> 00:44:15,167
Now this is what you can call eating outdoor.

1021
00:44:16,566 --> 00:44:20,065
It's great. That was such a wonderful meal.

1022
00:44:20,066 --> 00:44:21,136
It really was.

1023
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:25,675
(Hee Won and Myoung came back into the warm room.)

1024
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:26,807
Is it warm?

1025
00:44:29,377 --> 00:44:32,815
(Yawning right away once he goes under the blanket)

1026
00:44:32,816 --> 00:44:35,986
It's so warm and nice.

1027
00:44:38,386 --> 00:44:40,355
(He feels drowsy after a good meal with braised spicy chicken.)

1028
00:44:40,356 --> 00:44:41,356
It's not hot.

1029
00:44:41,357 --> 00:44:43,755
(He feels drowsy after a good meal with braised spicy chicken.)

1030
00:44:43,756 --> 00:44:46,026
(Falling asleep)

1031
00:44:47,497 --> 00:44:52,597
(Myoung must've felt nervous about cooking for the first time.)

1032
00:44:53,106 --> 00:44:54,905
(After lunch, he falls asleep right away...)

1033
00:44:54,906 --> 00:44:58,307
(with his mouth open.)

1034
00:44:59,106 --> 00:45:00,675
(Peeping)

1035
00:45:00,676 --> 00:45:03,377
He is sleeping with his mouth open.

1036
00:45:04,017 --> 00:45:05,476
(Laughing)

1037
00:45:05,477 --> 00:45:06,886
He must've felt really tired.

1038
00:45:07,986 --> 00:45:11,787
(Not knowing they're talking about him, he keeps sleeping.)

1039
00:45:13,687 --> 00:45:15,355
Just let him keep sleeping.

1040
00:45:15,356 --> 00:45:16,627
(Let him keep sleeping.)

1041
00:45:17,327 --> 00:45:19,397
(Sleep tight.)

1042
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:24,497
(Myoung will go off to the dreamland for a moment.)

1043
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:27,735
(The older guys, on the other hand...)

1044
00:45:27,736 --> 00:45:28,807
By the way,

1045
00:45:29,506 --> 00:45:30,706
I know...

1046
00:45:30,707 --> 00:45:32,405
you are good at playing evil characters,

1047
00:45:32,406 --> 00:45:35,077
but you are good at comical and serious roles too.

1048
00:45:35,577 --> 00:45:37,246
Sung Kyun is good at everything.

1049
00:45:37,247 --> 00:45:39,747
- He is almost like a rival to me.
- No, please.

1050
00:45:40,517 --> 00:45:42,516
What made you famous?

1051
00:45:42,517 --> 00:45:43,985
(Which work made Kim Sung Kyun famous?)

1052
00:45:43,986 --> 00:45:45,585
- "Nameless Gangster".
- "Nameless Gangster".

1053
00:45:45,586 --> 00:45:49,056
- Yes.
- You had bob hair back then, right?

1054
00:45:49,057 --> 00:45:50,656
- Were you married back then?
- Yes.

1055
00:45:51,156 --> 00:45:53,766
How old were you when you filmed "Nameless Gangster"?

1056
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:54,827
Me?

1057
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:57,536
While filming it, I was 31 years old.

1058
00:45:57,537 --> 00:45:59,667
But you looked too old for a 31-year-old.

1059
00:46:00,106 --> 00:46:01,166
That's serious business.

1060
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:03,335
He has looked this way since his first birthday.

1061
00:46:03,336 --> 00:46:06,045
Were you really 31 years old?

1062
00:46:06,046 --> 00:46:07,976
That's serious business.

1063
00:46:07,977 --> 00:46:09,276
I told you.

1064
00:46:09,776 --> 00:46:12,117
When I met them, I couldn't talk casually with them.

1065
00:46:12,647 --> 00:46:14,146
By the time we were done, I asked,

1066
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:16,855
- "May I talk casually with you?" - Right. I was 31 years old.

1067
00:46:16,856 --> 00:46:19,826
But thinking back about it, I never had a period of obscurity.

1068
00:46:19,827 --> 00:46:22,126
I'd be embarrassed to say that I had any.

1069
00:46:22,127 --> 00:46:24,096
- I was really young.
- If you were 31 years old,

1070
00:46:24,097 --> 00:46:26,327
it means you got famous super early in life.

1071
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:28,167
Moo Sung, you were in obscurity for a while, right?

1072
00:46:29,327 --> 00:46:30,736
Right, I was...

1073
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:34,235
I filmed "I Saw the Devil"...

1074
00:46:34,236 --> 00:46:36,036
- when I got better known.
- Which one?

1075
00:46:36,037 --> 00:46:37,306
"I Saw the Devil".

1076
00:46:37,307 --> 00:46:39,807
That's when I first saw you too.

1077
00:46:40,477 --> 00:46:42,247
But "I Saw the Devil" was...

1078
00:46:42,546 --> 00:46:44,976
in theaters around the same time as "The Man from Nowhere".

1079
00:46:44,977 --> 00:46:46,246
- Right. You were in that.
- Right.

1080
00:46:46,247 --> 00:46:50,385
So, "I Saw the Devil" and "The Man from Nowhere" were rivals.

1081
00:46:50,386 --> 00:46:53,155
But actually, when "I Saw the Devil" came out,

1082
00:46:53,156 --> 00:46:56,627
a serial killer had just gotten caught.

1083
00:46:57,097 --> 00:46:59,397
And the movie was too similar to the real situation.

1084
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:02,167
So many people were too scared to watch it.

1085
00:47:02,727 --> 00:47:05,167
- I really liked the movie.
- I did too.

1086
00:47:06,066 --> 00:47:08,836
Back then, since the two movies were competing,

1087
00:47:09,537 --> 00:47:11,776
I was worried that yours was more fun.

1088
00:47:12,736 --> 00:47:15,005
We were too scared.

1089
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:16,316
He hasn't changed.

1090
00:47:17,077 --> 00:47:20,146
You were in the middle of a mountain by yourself.

1091
00:47:20,147 --> 00:47:22,446
You lived in a strange place in the movie, right?

1092
00:47:22,816 --> 00:47:25,957
- My character raised dogs there.
- Right.

1093
00:47:26,187 --> 00:47:28,787
The dogs were as big as bulls.

1094
00:47:29,727 --> 00:47:33,666
There was a scene where I had to feed dogs behind the iron bars.

1095
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,266
(He had to film scenes where he fed the dogs.)

1096
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:36,437
That was really scary.

1097
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:40,537
I was too scared to act properly. I was afraid they'd bite me.

1098
00:47:40,937 --> 00:47:43,505
(It's so adorable how he is cowardly.)

1099
00:47:43,506 --> 00:47:46,247
(Laughing)

1100
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:48,045
I was so scared.

1101
00:47:48,046 --> 00:47:49,377
(Still feeling scared)

1102
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:51,315
When I first saw you,

1103
00:47:51,316 --> 00:47:53,116
I thought you really were a serial killer.

1104
00:47:53,117 --> 00:47:55,116
Remember the scene when he eats the steak and smiles?

1105
00:47:55,117 --> 00:47:57,187
I almost thought you were a real serial killer.

1106
00:47:57,716 --> 00:48:00,557
You know there are people in life who make you feel bad for no reason.

1107
00:48:01,687 --> 00:48:03,256
You don't deserve to say that.

1108
00:48:03,457 --> 00:48:05,956
I know I was like that at the time too,

1109
00:48:05,957 --> 00:48:08,826
but I thought I saw someone who was a bit worse than me.

1110
00:48:08,827 --> 00:48:11,537
(He is a bit more upsetting than I am.)

1111
00:48:12,497 --> 00:48:14,866
- You two were pretty upsetting.
- Right.

1112
00:48:14,867 --> 00:48:17,207
- That was...
- You can't say that either.

1113
00:48:17,577 --> 00:48:19,976
It upset me. You were about the same.

1114
00:48:19,977 --> 00:48:20,977
(You are similar to us.)

1115
00:48:21,207 --> 00:48:23,675
How many people have you killed in the movies?

1116
00:48:23,676 --> 00:48:25,815
(How many people have you killed in the movies?)

1117
00:48:25,816 --> 00:48:27,247
I'm not sure myself.

1118
00:48:28,187 --> 00:48:29,416
(Everyone agrees on what he means.)

1119
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:30,656
I'm not sure myself.

1120
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:33,026
If the three of you sit here together,

1121
00:48:33,227 --> 00:48:35,086
no one would dare approach.

1122
00:48:35,986 --> 00:48:37,397
Is this a Villain Special?

1123
00:48:38,727 --> 00:48:41,227
Right. That should be our title for today. Villain Special.

1124
00:48:41,526 --> 00:48:42,826
We got it.

1125
00:48:42,827 --> 00:48:44,296
(Very gentle)

1126
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:47,937
In a drama, there was a scene where I die in a hole.

1127
00:48:48,207 --> 00:48:49,806
Do you die in dramas too?

1128
00:48:49,807 --> 00:48:51,176
It's in a different drama.

1129
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:54,045
I die after getting shot five times.

1130
00:48:54,046 --> 00:48:55,376
- You got shot five times?
- Yes.

1131
00:48:55,377 --> 00:48:57,116
I had bags full of blood too.

1132
00:48:57,117 --> 00:49:00,816
I had to get changed in the cold and got shot multiple times.

1133
00:49:00,986 --> 00:49:04,655
Then they wanted to take another scene like that.

1134
00:49:04,656 --> 00:49:05,986
So I had to repeat it.

1135
00:49:06,687 --> 00:49:09,695
Then I had to wait in the cold while getting more blood bags.

1136
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:10,997
It's really dangerous.

1137
00:49:11,897 --> 00:49:15,866
But it's clear to all that you won't die after getting shot once.

1138
00:49:15,867 --> 00:49:18,096
- I need at least five bullets.
- You do.

1139
00:49:18,097 --> 00:49:20,807
When it's close, even an empty gun shoots something out at you.

1140
00:49:21,307 --> 00:49:23,806
I'm glad they didn't have to use something like a machine gun.

1141
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:25,606
(Stepping out smoothly)

1142
00:49:27,477 --> 00:49:31,517
(Grabbing the rice puff on the chair)

1143
00:49:32,816 --> 00:49:35,815
(Eating a rice puff with his eyes still closed)

1144
00:49:35,816 --> 00:49:39,086
(Impressed)

1145
00:49:39,656 --> 00:49:43,627
(I wonder what they are talking about right now.)

1146
00:49:44,227 --> 00:49:45,855
The blood bag was scary.

1147
00:49:45,856 --> 00:49:48,366
I had to put it right here on the chest.

1148
00:49:48,367 --> 00:49:50,866
I shot a movie with a French director once.

1149
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:52,436
It had to come here.

1150
00:49:52,437 --> 00:49:54,606
But somehow, it ended up getting a bit higher.

1151
00:49:55,307 --> 00:49:56,576
(Shrieking)

1152
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:57,775
Everyone got startled.

1153
00:49:57,776 --> 00:50:00,275
It exploded, and the blood inside...

1154
00:50:00,276 --> 00:50:01,945
- shot up.
- It went in another direction.

1155
00:50:01,946 --> 00:50:03,517
It popped all over.

1156
00:50:03,776 --> 00:50:08,617
On the screen, my face got covered in blood as soon as I got shot.

1157
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:11,557
- They must've used that scene.
- Of course, they did.

1158
00:50:11,787 --> 00:50:13,885
- Bloopers are even better.
- It was very realistic.

1159
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:16,795
But I got burned a bit.

1160
00:50:16,796 --> 00:50:18,855
- That would happen.
- It splashed and burned me.

1161
00:50:18,856 --> 00:50:21,695
I'd rather get stabbed.

1162
00:50:21,696 --> 00:50:23,136
It's better for the person stabbing too.

1163
00:50:23,566 --> 00:50:26,236
Knives are much more convenient.

1164
00:50:26,937 --> 00:50:31,377
But actually, it's the best to get shot on your bare skin.

1165
00:50:32,406 --> 00:50:33,446
How so?

1166
00:50:34,307 --> 00:50:36,005
If you get stabbed at places like this,

1167
00:50:36,006 --> 00:50:37,275
they plant something for the blood.

1168
00:50:37,276 --> 00:50:39,146
But let's say you got shot on your forehead.

1169
00:50:39,147 --> 00:50:41,186
Then they would make a dummy.

1170
00:50:41,187 --> 00:50:43,715
They would shoot to a dummy.

1171
00:50:43,716 --> 00:50:45,086
(They use a dummy instead.)

1172
00:50:45,287 --> 00:50:47,687
You can't plant anything here.

1173
00:50:48,787 --> 00:50:50,996
I've actually died a lot in movies.

1174
00:50:50,997 --> 00:50:52,856
- Really?
- I've had many dummies made.

1175
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:54,565
- You must have one ready.
- I do.

1176
00:50:54,566 --> 00:50:58,537
So these days, I've been getting a dummy once in 4 or 5 years.

1177
00:50:58,796 --> 00:51:01,336
(Laughing)

1178
00:51:02,136 --> 00:51:04,006
After I was done with one movie,

1179
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:06,576
I died in another movie,

1180
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:08,877
so I was going to make a dummy, but they said they had one already.

1181
00:51:09,377 --> 00:51:11,416
So after 4 or 5 years since that happened,

1182
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:13,847
they said my face changed because I got older.

1183
00:51:14,386 --> 00:51:15,445
So they wanted another one?

1184
00:51:15,446 --> 00:51:18,355
After about five years, they wanted to make another one,

1185
00:51:18,356 --> 00:51:20,627
which I used for another few years.

1186
00:51:21,327 --> 00:51:23,826
I think the most recent one I made was about four years ago.

1187
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:24,896
Was it four years ago?

1188
00:51:24,897 --> 00:51:27,326
So I should get a new one next year.

1189
00:51:27,327 --> 00:51:29,367
(I should get another one next year.)

1190
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:32,897
(The early morning snow has stopped.)

1191
00:51:33,906 --> 00:51:37,077
(It is colder with the wind in the afternoon.)

1192
00:51:38,577 --> 00:51:39,577
That's great.

1193
00:51:39,578 --> 00:51:41,046
(Making campfire to warm up)

1194
00:51:41,676 --> 00:51:42,746
It's good.

1195
00:51:42,747 --> 00:51:45,077
(It's pretty chilly.)

1196
00:51:46,147 --> 00:51:48,686
Should we have a warm cup of tea?

1197
00:51:48,687 --> 00:51:50,287
- No.
- Why not?

1198
00:51:51,457 --> 00:51:55,287
For you guys, for the first time on this show,

1199
00:51:57,256 --> 00:52:00,026
we'll take you to the best place for resting.

1200
00:52:00,627 --> 00:52:02,266
(Hesitant)

1201
00:52:02,267 --> 00:52:03,295
Are we going somewhere?

1202
00:52:03,296 --> 00:52:04,497
- Yes.
- I see.

1203
00:52:05,267 --> 00:52:08,436
I'll take you to a place you will never forget.

1204
00:52:08,437 --> 00:52:11,076
I'll bring you to a place where you can make good memories.

1205
00:52:11,077 --> 00:52:12,206
Let's go.

1206
00:52:12,207 --> 00:52:13,247
(Suspicious)

1207
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:15,045
I mean...

1208
00:52:15,046 --> 00:52:18,076
It's not something like going in the cold water, is it?

1209
00:52:18,077 --> 00:52:19,377
Cold water?

1210
00:52:20,687 --> 00:52:22,315
(Don't worry and just follow me.)

1211
00:52:22,316 --> 00:52:24,585
We aren't going in the cold water. Let's go.

1212
00:52:24,586 --> 00:52:25,815
(Where is he taking us?)

1213
00:52:25,816 --> 00:52:28,486
- Take these.
- I'm very nervous right now.

1214
00:52:29,687 --> 00:52:30,925
- Sikhye.
- Good.

1215
00:52:30,926 --> 00:52:32,126
Let's take that.

1216
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,796
- Tangerines.
- Tangerines.

1217
00:52:33,966 --> 00:52:35,796
I'll bring the blanket.

1218
00:52:36,097 --> 00:52:37,636
- We need a blanket too?
- Yes, we do.

1219
00:52:38,037 --> 00:52:39,437
- Are we ready?
- Let's go.

1220
00:52:39,597 --> 00:52:41,006
It will be wonderful.

1221
00:52:41,466 --> 00:52:43,676
It's a place we got for ourselves.

1222
00:52:45,077 --> 00:52:50,147
(There is a special resting place in the front yard of the house.)

1223
00:52:51,347 --> 00:52:52,846
(What did Dong Il prepare for the guests?)

1224
00:52:52,847 --> 00:52:53,945
Come over here.

1225
00:52:53,946 --> 00:52:56,017
(What did Dong Il prepare for the guests?)

1226
00:52:57,856 --> 00:52:59,356
(Impressed)

1227
00:53:00,057 --> 00:53:01,585
- I love this.
- What is this place?

1228
00:53:01,586 --> 00:53:04,155
This is what I prepared for you.

1229
00:53:04,156 --> 00:53:05,626
This was it?

1230
00:53:05,627 --> 00:53:06,897
Take a look.

1231
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,497
I love this.

1232
00:53:11,466 --> 00:53:13,166
(A warm red clay room)

1233
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:15,537
- This was it?
- Take off your jackets.

1234
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:17,206
- This place is...
- Take off your jackets.

1235
00:53:17,207 --> 00:53:18,235
Oh, my goodness.

1236
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,335
(Myoung is excited.)

1237
00:53:19,336 --> 00:53:20,747
It's great in here.

1238
00:53:22,776 --> 00:53:24,476
(I'll help you make...)

1239
00:53:24,477 --> 00:53:25,946
(wonderful memories today.)

1240
00:53:26,687 --> 00:53:31,816
(It's the place that makes you feel you went back to 1988.)

1241
00:53:33,557 --> 00:53:35,855
(It's a room with floor heating that makes you recall the past.)

1242
00:53:35,856 --> 00:53:37,457
Goodness. Moo Sung.

1243
00:53:38,156 --> 00:53:39,256
It's warm.

1244
00:53:40,897 --> 00:53:42,166
(The familiar place brings smiles to their faces.)

1245
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:43,267
You can lean on the wall.

1246
00:53:43,696 --> 00:53:45,836
- I love it here.
- Make yourself comfortable.

1247
00:53:46,136 --> 00:53:48,406
- Warm yourself up.
- It was so cold outside.

1248
00:53:49,236 --> 00:53:51,906
I love how nice and warm it is.

1249
00:53:52,836 --> 00:53:56,175
I see the smoke coming out from the fire burning right now.

1250
00:53:56,176 --> 00:53:57,215
Right.

1251
00:53:57,216 --> 00:53:58,876
(The floor is heated with the heat from the furnace.)

1252
00:53:58,877 --> 00:54:01,945
- It's so warm.
- It's hot over here.

1253
00:54:01,946 --> 00:54:03,046
- It's so hot.
- My gosh.

1254
00:54:03,287 --> 00:54:05,756
- Gosh. I want to heat my back.
- Yes, we should.

1255
00:54:06,417 --> 00:54:07,925
(Exclaiming)

1256
00:54:07,926 --> 00:54:10,296
(Lying down)

1257
00:54:10,457 --> 00:54:12,926
- Moo Sung.
- Gosh, this is so warm.

1258
00:54:14,526 --> 00:54:15,667
Gosh, my back...

1259
00:54:16,597 --> 00:54:17,696
- Yes, this is it.
- How come...

1260
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:21,006
everyone is groaning so much?

1261
00:54:22,006 --> 00:54:24,207
- This is great.
- Totally.

1262
00:54:25,276 --> 00:54:26,307
It's excellent.

1263
00:54:26,877 --> 00:54:31,417
(In the old days, sleeping up on the warm spot on the floor...)

1264
00:54:31,877 --> 00:54:37,457
(and getting up to enjoy some snacks were the happiest moments.)

1265
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:39,586
- Gosh, I'm tired.
- The floor is really hot.

1266
00:54:39,886 --> 00:54:42,426
- I want to drink some sikhye.
- Right, sikhye...

1267
00:54:42,986 --> 00:54:45,056
I feel like I'm having sikhye...

1268
00:54:45,057 --> 00:54:46,566
- in a real sauna.
- Yes. This spot is so hot.

1269
00:54:47,426 --> 00:54:48,465
Here is the ice.

1270
00:54:48,466 --> 00:54:49,466
(We definitely need ice for the sikhye in a sauna.)

1271
00:54:49,467 --> 00:54:51,195
- There you go.
- Oh, man. It's perfect with ice.

1272
00:54:51,196 --> 00:54:52,635
Here. We need ice in it.

1273
00:54:52,636 --> 00:54:53,766
(They are going to drink icy cold sikhye on the hot ondol floor.)

1274
00:54:53,767 --> 00:54:54,836
I'm adding ice for everyone.

1275
00:54:55,937 --> 00:54:58,905
- So they made this room separately?
- Well...

1276
00:54:58,906 --> 00:55:02,306
Or maybe the previous owner made it.

1277
00:55:02,307 --> 00:55:03,676
This deodeok sikhye is amazing.

1278
00:55:04,117 --> 00:55:05,146
This is so nice.

1279
00:55:05,147 --> 00:55:09,045
Dong Il, this sikhye is awesome. It tastes like deodeok.

1280
00:55:09,046 --> 00:55:10,316
- It's good?
- Yes. Try it.

1281
00:55:10,886 --> 00:55:12,215
(Deodeok sikhye...)

1282
00:55:12,216 --> 00:55:14,057
(Sitting up quickly)

1283
00:55:15,227 --> 00:55:16,855
This sikhye is so delicious.

1284
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:18,557
(I've got to drink sikhye in an ondol room.)

1285
00:55:21,867 --> 00:55:23,997
(Enjoying)

1286
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:27,736
Shall we spread the blanket and lie down?

1287
00:55:27,937 --> 00:55:29,506
There you go. Lie down.

1288
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:31,537
The biggest guy should take the spot on the farthest inside.

1289
00:55:32,006 --> 00:55:33,136
I think the oldest person should take it.

1290
00:55:34,347 --> 00:55:35,546
I would burn on that spot.

1291
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:39,045
I almost thought you gave it up for me.

1292
00:55:39,046 --> 00:55:40,517
(Dong Il, the warmest spot is for you.)

1293
00:55:41,386 --> 00:55:42,586
I love it here.

1294
00:55:43,117 --> 00:55:45,816
It's so warm.

1295
00:55:47,557 --> 00:55:49,385
(It seems everyone is...)

1296
00:55:49,386 --> 00:55:50,425
(peacefully warming their back.)

1297
00:55:50,426 --> 00:55:51,497
This is it.

1298
00:55:54,227 --> 00:55:57,796
(Gosh, it's too hot.)

1299
00:55:58,537 --> 00:56:02,566
(Sizzling)

1300
00:56:09,276 --> 00:56:10,517
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

1301
00:56:10,977 --> 00:56:12,276
You like to heat your back, right?

1302
00:56:12,676 --> 00:56:15,417
I actually feel better with my back on the hot floor.

1303
00:56:15,546 --> 00:56:18,017
- Do you want to take my spot?
- No, I'm okay.

1304
00:56:18,557 --> 00:56:21,256
My feet are already burning on this spot.

1305
00:56:21,557 --> 00:56:24,295
It's too hot here. My spot is right next to the furnace.

1306
00:56:24,296 --> 00:56:27,667
I don't think it should be this hot for a dry sauna.

1307
00:56:29,466 --> 00:56:31,065
- I can't stand the heat.
- Gosh, it's too hot.

1308
00:56:31,066 --> 00:56:32,537
I think we should...

1309
00:56:33,707 --> 00:56:36,735
take turns to take this spot...

1310
00:56:36,736 --> 00:56:38,336
so that I can take a breather.

1311
00:56:38,807 --> 00:56:41,847
Can someone switch with me? It's literally burning here.

1312
00:56:42,807 --> 00:56:44,977
No wonder the floor on this spot was burnt in black soot.

1313
00:56:45,747 --> 00:56:47,716
Normally, I feel stiff in my shoulder.

1314
00:56:48,117 --> 00:56:50,816
I'm telling you. My body is all aglow.

1315
00:56:55,227 --> 00:56:57,296
Dong Il, lie on your side. You'll feel less hot.

1316
00:56:57,656 --> 00:57:00,166
- Less hot?
- Your body touches the floor less.

1317
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,196
(Laughing)

1318
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:03,796
Come on, it's obvious.

1319
00:57:05,397 --> 00:57:06,807
Trust me and lie on your side.

1320
00:57:07,606 --> 00:57:09,636
Well, I have pain in my shoulder.

1321
00:57:10,437 --> 00:57:14,446
(Feeling the warmth of the furnace, )

1322
00:57:15,577 --> 00:57:21,216
(they are taking a nap in the afternoon.)

1323
00:57:23,117 --> 00:57:26,957
(Snoring)

1324
00:57:28,356 --> 00:57:29,385
(It's too hot.)

1325
00:57:29,386 --> 00:57:30,496
Isn't it too hot?

1326
00:57:30,497 --> 00:57:33,867
- Yes. I feel hot in these clothes.
- I know, right?

1327
00:57:37,966 --> 00:57:39,296
(Snoring)

1328
00:57:42,836 --> 00:57:44,437
(Snoring)

1329
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,006
(Snoring)

1330
00:57:55,017 --> 00:57:58,586
He is snoring. He already fell asleep on this hot floor.

1331
00:57:58,886 --> 00:57:59,886
Who is snoring?

1332
00:58:02,026 --> 00:58:03,355
- Who?
- You.

1333
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:05,256
- I was snoring?
- Yes, you just did.

1334
00:58:06,127 --> 00:58:07,266
You were snoring like this.

1335
00:58:07,267 --> 00:58:09,727
- I was?
- Yes. I was talking about you.

1336
00:58:09,997 --> 00:58:11,167
Well, I didn't hear anything.

1337
00:58:12,136 --> 00:58:15,867
(Meanwhile, Myoung moved over to the side.)

1338
00:58:16,537 --> 00:58:19,506
(How can they lie down on this boiling floor?)

1339
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,446
(My gosh, my butt is burning.)

1340
00:58:31,287 --> 00:58:35,156
(He tries to hang on by sitting on tiptoes.)

1341
00:58:36,926 --> 00:58:39,097
(I can't stand it anymore.)

1342
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:46,867
I think I'll have to get some fresh air to cool down.

1343
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:50,005
- He's young, right?
- What do you mean?

1344
00:58:50,006 --> 00:58:51,937
I was like him when I was younger. I couldn't stand the heat.

1345
00:58:52,377 --> 00:58:53,546
I would have gone outside already.

1346
00:58:54,577 --> 00:58:58,276
(Finally, Myoung escaped from the ondol room.)

1347
00:58:58,676 --> 00:59:00,917
(Closing the door to stop the heat from coming out)

1348
00:59:01,816 --> 00:59:02,886
Gosh, it's hot.

1349
00:59:03,656 --> 00:59:05,316
Leave the door open.

1350
00:59:08,327 --> 00:59:10,127
- I can't stand it anymore.
- Open the door.

1351
00:59:10,327 --> 00:59:12,557
It's because the floor is hot.

1352
00:59:13,097 --> 00:59:16,836
(It's too hot for them too.)

1353
00:59:18,136 --> 00:59:20,636
Can someone please stop heating the floor?

1354
00:59:20,966 --> 00:59:23,466
My spot is the worst because it's right next to the furnace.

1355
00:59:25,377 --> 00:59:27,176
My butt is burning.

1356
00:59:27,877 --> 00:59:30,917
(Holding his heated hip)

1357
00:59:31,676 --> 00:59:32,746
(Sitting on the wooden porch where it's cool)

1358
00:59:32,747 --> 00:59:34,147
Yes, this is it.

1359
00:59:37,716 --> 00:59:38,986
The clouds are moving.

1360
00:59:41,187 --> 00:59:43,996
(As the wind blows hard, )

1361
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:48,926
(the clouds are moving in the sky.)

1362
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,066
(Lying down)

1363
00:59:53,397 --> 00:59:54,406
Gosh, it's refreshing.

1364
00:59:56,006 --> 00:59:58,807
(Taking a break with the cool breeze)

1365
01:00:00,546 --> 01:00:03,776
(Meanwhile, they are still in the ondol room.)

1366
01:00:08,886 --> 01:00:11,316
(I can't take it anymore.)

1367
01:00:13,827 --> 01:00:15,026
I can't stay there. It's too hot.

1368
01:00:16,156 --> 01:00:18,627
(Dong Il ends up coming outside the ondol room as well.)

1369
01:00:19,926 --> 01:00:21,767
You know what? My pants are soaked in sweat.

1370
01:00:22,097 --> 01:00:23,466
- Really?
- Yes, I'm serious.

1371
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:27,836
My gosh, it's cool out here.

1372
01:00:29,307 --> 01:00:31,537
(His face is glossy.)

1373
01:00:32,537 --> 01:00:34,046
- This is nice.
- Is it?

1374
01:00:34,906 --> 01:00:36,877
Because it's cool out here and I'm having tangerines.

1375
01:00:38,046 --> 01:00:40,286
How can you constantly eat?

1376
01:00:40,287 --> 01:00:42,386
- I'm sorry?
- How can you eat on and on?

1377
01:00:42,917 --> 01:00:44,216
I didn't eat tangerines inside. That's why.

1378
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,016
(He is indeed a foodie.)

1379
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,086
- Seriously...
- It's good to eat it here.

1380
01:00:47,756 --> 01:00:50,256
- Did you rest well?
- Yes.

1381
01:00:51,827 --> 01:00:52,996
It's so refreshing.

1382
01:00:52,997 --> 01:00:54,226
(The moon already appeared in the sky.)

1383
01:00:54,227 --> 01:00:56,626
- Oh, gosh.
- My gosh, this was great.

1384
01:00:56,627 --> 01:00:58,636
Shall we prepare dinner then?

1385
01:00:59,696 --> 01:01:02,566
(What is inside the cooler that Sung Kyun brought?)

1386
01:01:03,106 --> 01:01:05,576
(For everyone, Sung Kyun brought...)

1387
01:01:05,577 --> 01:01:08,647
(a cod.)

1388
01:01:08,776 --> 01:01:10,105
(The dinner menu is...)

1389
01:01:10,106 --> 01:01:13,517
(cod fish soup.)

1390
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:20,386
(The soup is made with a fleshy cod, which is a white meat fish.)

1391
01:01:21,127 --> 01:01:25,426
(Cod fish soup is a perfect dish to have in the cold weather.)

1392
01:01:25,957 --> 01:01:28,727
(I'll make fried rice after that.)

1393
01:01:29,097 --> 01:01:31,836
(You will make fried rice?)

1394
01:01:32,367 --> 01:01:36,235
(With the leftover fish soup, )

1395
01:01:36,236 --> 01:01:42,247
(Moo Sung is going to make fried rice.)

1396
01:01:42,707 --> 01:01:45,877
Before I dress the fish,

1397
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,855
- I'll boil the broth first.
- Okay.

1398
01:01:50,856 --> 01:01:52,117
(Rustling)

1399
01:01:52,687 --> 01:01:54,655
Is it all right if I go through your kitchen?

1400
01:01:54,656 --> 01:01:57,727
- Of course.
- I know it's impolite though.

1401
01:01:59,526 --> 01:02:01,596
(The chef Sung Kyun is looking for the kitchenware he needs.)

1402
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:03,026
Well, you have everything.

1403
01:02:03,296 --> 01:02:04,937
You have something like this too?

1404
01:02:08,236 --> 01:02:10,306
- Is the cooler outside? The cod?
- Yes.

1405
01:02:10,307 --> 01:02:11,405
- I'll go bring it.
- Myoung, down there...

1406
01:02:11,406 --> 01:02:13,676
(Is the cooler put outside? I'll go and get it.)

1407
01:02:15,147 --> 01:02:17,116
(Moo Sung wants to help the main chef Sung Kyun.)

1408
01:02:17,117 --> 01:02:18,377
- Here it is.
- Good.

1409
01:02:18,747 --> 01:02:25,086
(I'll assist you, Sung Kyun. Please make a nice cod fish soup.)

1410
01:02:26,316 --> 01:02:29,457
(Opening the cooler)

1411
01:02:30,597 --> 01:02:32,826
- Gosh, it is...
- It's huge.

1412
01:02:32,827 --> 01:02:33,827
Pardon me?

1413
01:02:35,196 --> 01:02:38,167
(He stepped back out of shock.)

1414
01:02:38,466 --> 01:02:40,605
- Let me see.
- I think this pot is too small.

1415
01:02:40,606 --> 01:02:41,635
(What's all the fuss about? Let me see how big it is.)

1416
01:02:41,636 --> 01:02:42,707
It's too big.

1417
01:02:44,037 --> 01:02:46,037
Gosh, it's as big as a tuna.

1418
01:02:47,207 --> 01:02:48,276
This is too...

1419
01:02:49,176 --> 01:02:51,545
How did you even buy such a big one?

1420
01:02:51,546 --> 01:02:53,147
(Salivating)

1421
01:02:54,446 --> 01:02:56,787
How did you even buy such a big one?

1422
01:02:58,017 --> 01:02:59,116
It's too heavy to hold.

1423
01:02:59,117 --> 01:03:01,627
(The cod is so big that it's not easy to hold.)

1424
01:03:02,086 --> 01:03:03,326
(Cod, the main ingredient)

1425
01:03:03,327 --> 01:03:06,057
(For your information, it's not tuna.)

1426
01:03:07,026 --> 01:03:08,026
(Exclaiming)

1427
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:10,267
(Gigantic)

1428
01:03:13,636 --> 01:03:15,505
I don't think any of our pots are big enough for that.

1429
01:03:15,506 --> 01:03:16,867
(Sung Kyun bought a huge cod enough for five portions.)

1430
01:03:17,136 --> 01:03:19,906
(Is everyone ready to be full?)

1431
01:03:20,207 --> 01:03:23,816
(How would Sung Kyun's cod fish soup taste?)

1432
01:03:24,517 --> 01:03:25,917
I brought my own knife from home.

1433
01:03:26,776 --> 01:03:29,445
- You brought your own knife?
- I prefer to use a dull knife.

1434
01:03:29,446 --> 01:03:32,386
I'm scared to use a knife that's too sharp.

1435
01:03:33,316 --> 01:03:34,386
Really?

1436
01:03:35,886 --> 01:03:36,926
What are these?

1437
01:03:37,356 --> 01:03:38,356
Anchovies.

1438
01:03:39,026 --> 01:03:41,026
I brought all the ingredients for the broth as well.

1439
01:03:41,327 --> 01:03:42,327
Oh, gosh.

1440
01:03:43,127 --> 01:03:46,937
(Scallion roots, shiitake mushrooms, anchovies, kelp, and seasonings.)

1441
01:03:47,707 --> 01:03:48,766
I'll use them up.

1442
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:50,936
(Adding the ingredients to make the broth deep)

1443
01:03:50,937 --> 01:03:54,046
He is using scallion roots. That means he is good at cooking.

1444
01:03:56,147 --> 01:03:59,046
(Slicing the radish to add the zesty flavor)

1445
01:03:59,546 --> 01:04:02,647
I can see that Sung Kyun knows how to cook.

1446
01:04:03,086 --> 01:04:04,855
- Aren't I right?
- Yes, you're right.

1447
01:04:04,856 --> 01:04:07,687
- I make this broth for all soups.
- At home?

1448
01:04:08,057 --> 01:04:09,256
Shall I just boil it then?

1449
01:04:09,756 --> 01:04:11,355
- Yes, it needs to be boiled.
- Okay.

1450
01:04:11,356 --> 01:04:12,397
(Thanks to Sung Kyun, the broth just needs to be boiled.)

1451
01:04:12,696 --> 01:04:15,667
(Safely filmed with permission from the owner)

1452
01:04:19,267 --> 01:04:21,566
Now I need to dress this guy.

1453
01:04:25,707 --> 01:04:27,006
(Impressed)

1454
01:04:28,546 --> 01:04:29,546
You mean, the ingredients for the fried rice?

1455
01:04:29,547 --> 01:04:31,416
(Did I pick something too big?)

1456
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:32,477
- But you know what?
- Well...

1457
01:04:33,816 --> 01:04:37,417
This is so big. I bet it has big guts as well.

1458
01:04:37,517 --> 01:04:39,617
- Very much so.
- So I should...

1459
01:04:40,086 --> 01:04:41,256
You shouldn't throw away the guts.

1460
01:04:43,526 --> 01:04:46,557
(He trembles with his teeth clenched.)

1461
01:04:46,856 --> 01:04:49,367
- Okay, go ahead.
- I'll get this first, and then...

1462
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:52,037
(With all his strength)

1463
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:54,105
Be careful, okay?

1464
01:04:54,106 --> 01:04:55,166
(Amid their concerns, he is struggling with the cod.)

1465
01:04:55,167 --> 01:04:56,867
You don't want to use a sharp knife?

1466
01:04:58,406 --> 01:04:59,736
- Gosh.
- I'm saying, boil this first.

1467
01:05:02,506 --> 01:05:04,445
My gosh, seriously...

1468
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:05,946
(Myoung is running away while Moo Sung is amazed.)

1469
01:05:06,216 --> 01:05:07,247
It's huge.

1470
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:08,985
Be careful and don't pop it.

1471
01:05:08,986 --> 01:05:11,286
(He is carefully pulling out the guts.)

1472
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:12,517
Pull them out and put them here.

1473
01:05:12,886 --> 01:05:15,326
(Stiff)

1474
01:05:15,327 --> 01:05:17,456
It's hard to believe how much guts it has.

1475
01:05:17,457 --> 01:05:20,497
- Oh no...
- My gosh, Look at the guts.

1476
01:05:21,097 --> 01:05:22,295
The roe is huge too.

1477
01:05:22,296 --> 01:05:23,367
(Impressed)

1478
01:05:24,196 --> 01:05:26,835
Good. Now put it here. I'll cut off the head for you.

1479
01:05:26,836 --> 01:05:27,867
(Now put it here. I'll cut off the head for you.)

1480
01:05:29,506 --> 01:05:35,477
(Dong Il is helping Sung Kyun with prepping the cod.)

1481
01:05:36,077 --> 01:05:38,117
I'll clean them for you. Give me whatever that needs to be cleaned.

1482
01:05:38,647 --> 01:05:40,175
- Let's get this over with.
- I'm already cleaning them.

1483
01:05:40,176 --> 01:05:41,916
(He doesn't forget to wear the gloves.)

1484
01:05:41,917 --> 01:05:43,816
Gosh, what a mess here.

1485
01:05:45,687 --> 01:05:52,156
(Moo Sung is also helping the main chef Sung Kyun.)

1486
01:05:52,827 --> 01:05:55,796
(Working in perfect harmony)

1487
01:05:56,627 --> 01:06:02,867
(Prepping the cod is going smoothly as they work together.)

1488
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:07,577
(Is it almost done?)

1489
01:06:07,707 --> 01:06:10,207
Okay, then. Where can I find bowls?

1490
01:06:10,847 --> 01:06:14,016
Open the cabinet, and you will see bowls in different sizes.

1491
01:06:14,017 --> 01:06:15,085
- Whichever one you need...
- Oh, okay.

1492
01:06:15,086 --> 01:06:16,216
(Shall I prepare the ingredients for the fried rice then?)

1493
01:06:17,756 --> 01:06:20,957
(Eggs are important for the fried rice.)

1494
01:06:23,457 --> 01:06:24,526
This is it?

1495
01:06:26,597 --> 01:06:31,066
(How come I can't take it out?)

1496
01:06:32,937 --> 01:06:35,466
I don't understand how you guys take out the eggs.

1497
01:06:36,406 --> 01:06:37,477
This is too...

1498
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:42,776
(The eggs are too small for Moo Sung's big hands.)

1499
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:45,747
- How do you take it out?
- I'm sorry?

1500
01:06:45,977 --> 01:06:47,046
How do you pull it out?

1501
01:06:48,316 --> 01:06:51,117
If I overturn it, the eggs would break.

1502
01:06:52,917 --> 01:06:55,026
- You took it out? That's amazing.
- Gosh, it's taking so long.

1503
01:06:55,156 --> 01:06:57,696
- Why are they so slippery?
- Yes. Thanks for your help.

1504
01:06:58,926 --> 01:07:01,526
(Now I have eggs ready.)

1505
01:07:02,497 --> 01:07:05,566
(Taking a cutting board)

1506
01:07:06,136 --> 01:07:09,207
(Rustling)

1507
01:07:09,736 --> 01:07:11,436
- This is boiling up.
- Okay. One second.

1508
01:07:11,437 --> 01:07:13,077
(Moo Sung's countertop)

1509
01:07:14,847 --> 01:07:16,207
(Sniffing)

1510
01:07:16,847 --> 01:07:20,215
(He is carefully choosing...)

1511
01:07:20,216 --> 01:07:23,885
(a small knife instead of a big knife.)

1512
01:07:23,886 --> 01:07:24,886
This is good.

1513
01:07:25,187 --> 01:07:27,855
(Kneeling politely)

1514
01:07:27,856 --> 01:07:33,097
(He starts to chop ingredients for the fried rice.)

1515
01:07:35,267 --> 01:07:37,126
- My gosh, Moo Sung.
- Yes?

1516
01:07:37,127 --> 01:07:39,435
You are such a big guy to mince the peppers like that.

1517
01:07:39,436 --> 01:07:40,497
Look how cute you are.

1518
01:07:41,306 --> 01:07:43,007
Actually, it's been a while.

1519
01:07:44,177 --> 01:07:45,936
Gosh, you look so cute.

1520
01:07:47,946 --> 01:07:50,305
You are so cute holding the small knife.

1521
01:07:50,306 --> 01:07:51,345
(He is as cute as a teddy bear.)

1522
01:07:51,346 --> 01:07:52,676
You look like you're holding a box cutter.

1523
01:07:52,677 --> 01:07:54,016
(Feeling shy)

1524
01:07:54,247 --> 01:07:56,515
Look how he is chopping with that small knife.

1525
01:07:56,516 --> 01:07:57,555
(Laughing)

1526
01:07:57,556 --> 01:08:00,587
- Come on, don't make me laugh.
- With a beard like that.

1527
01:08:01,627 --> 01:08:03,926
- To make the texture great, - Okay.

1528
01:08:03,927 --> 01:08:06,826
- I should chop it in small pieces.
- They need to be minced, right?

1529
01:08:06,827 --> 01:08:08,696
- It's better when they're minced.
- Right.

1530
01:08:09,367 --> 01:08:12,467
(Mincing)

1531
01:08:12,896 --> 01:08:14,036
(Staring)

1532
01:08:14,037 --> 01:08:17,306
You look like a person who has studied cooking for 30 years.

1533
01:08:18,877 --> 01:08:19,935
You chopped them really nicely.

1534
01:08:19,936 --> 01:08:22,577
(Feeling shy)

1535
01:08:22,976 --> 01:08:25,876
I cooked for myself for five years.

1536
01:08:25,877 --> 01:08:27,586
- What did you cook for five years?
- I'm sorry?

1537
01:08:27,587 --> 01:08:29,345
- What did you normally cook?
- You mean, the main dish?

1538
01:08:29,346 --> 01:08:30,547
Yes, and side dishes...

1539
01:08:31,887 --> 01:08:32,917
Fried rice.

1540
01:08:35,587 --> 01:08:37,797
(My gosh.)

1541
01:08:38,127 --> 01:08:40,896
(Starting with peppers, )

1542
01:08:41,467 --> 01:08:44,095
It's easier when they're chopped. I can pour everything all at once.

1543
01:08:44,096 --> 01:08:47,266
(he is also chopping scallions and chives into small pieces.)

1544
01:08:47,436 --> 01:08:48,466
(He is good.)

1545
01:08:48,467 --> 01:08:49,537
Okay, it's done.

1546
01:08:50,306 --> 01:08:51,376
Okay.

1547
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:52,475
(A plenty of chopped ingredients)

1548
01:08:52,476 --> 01:08:53,476
Okay.

1549
01:08:54,507 --> 01:08:58,146
(Eggs, peppers, scallions, and chives)

1550
01:08:58,446 --> 01:09:00,077
You said that we have aged kimchi, right?

1551
01:09:00,516 --> 01:09:02,116
Ripe kimchi? Yes, we have ripe kimchi.

1552
01:09:02,117 --> 01:09:03,486
Can you give me a little bit?

1553
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:06,816
I think the fried rice will taste great with it.

1554
01:09:08,587 --> 01:09:10,026
I just need a little bit.

1555
01:09:11,757 --> 01:09:12,797
(Exclaiming)

1556
01:09:14,497 --> 01:09:16,827
(Mouth-watering)

1557
01:09:17,436 --> 01:09:20,695
(Sitting in a polite way with his feet close together, )

1558
01:09:20,696 --> 01:09:23,406
(he is chopping kimchi in a tiny size as well.)

1559
01:09:24,037 --> 01:09:25,435
- Oh, I see you already have it.
- Yes.

1560
01:09:25,436 --> 01:09:27,606
- I'll leave it here. This is nice.
- Okay.

1561
01:09:28,047 --> 01:09:29,146
I can just sprinkle it later.

1562
01:09:30,707 --> 01:09:31,717
With this...

1563
01:09:32,577 --> 01:09:33,617
and this...

1564
01:09:34,387 --> 01:09:35,416
Perfect.

1565
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:37,417
(Arranging various ingredients)

1566
01:09:37,957 --> 01:09:40,826
Everything is ready. I can just mix them with rice later.

1567
01:09:40,827 --> 01:09:44,056
(Chopping the ingredients for the fried rice is completed.)

1568
01:09:44,627 --> 01:09:46,095
(Meanwhile, prepping the cod is almost over as well.)

1569
01:09:46,096 --> 01:09:47,696
It took so long because it's too big.

1570
01:09:48,627 --> 01:09:49,627
I hear you.

1571
01:09:49,628 --> 01:09:51,696
I lost. I'm defeated by its immensity.

1572
01:09:52,867 --> 01:09:54,906
You sound like a smart person with those words.

1573
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:56,337
By its immensity.

1574
01:09:57,236 --> 01:10:02,077
(The last step is to get rid of the blood thoroughly.)

1575
01:10:02,507 --> 01:10:05,717
(Prepping the gigantic cod is also completed.)

1576
01:10:05,816 --> 01:10:07,116
(Glimpsing)

1577
01:10:07,117 --> 01:10:09,946
Gosh, you are using a lot of water.

1578
01:10:10,446 --> 01:10:12,516
Well, I have no choice.

1579
01:10:12,887 --> 01:10:15,756
- You're washing away the blood?
- Yes, exactly.

1580
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:16,827
(Getting rid of the blood is an important part of the recipe.)

1581
01:10:17,596 --> 01:10:21,127
(That's a lot of work.)

1582
01:10:21,497 --> 01:10:23,926
It seems he knows what he is doing.

1583
01:10:23,927 --> 01:10:25,167
(I think he knows how to cook.)

1584
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:28,235
I think so. He even knows how to cook fish.

1585
01:10:28,236 --> 01:10:29,507
(I acknowledge that he is good at cooking.)

1586
01:10:29,707 --> 01:10:31,836
- I think everything's almost ready.
- I think so.

1587
01:10:31,837 --> 01:10:33,276
- You think so?
- Yes.

1588
01:10:33,677 --> 01:10:36,247
- Come on, Dong Il.
- It's better when I do it myself.

1589
01:10:36,806 --> 01:10:38,416
That way, I can control how much I want to tilt it.

1590
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:39,546
(He is holding the brazier full of burning charcoals.)

1591
01:10:39,547 --> 01:10:42,087
Here. Go get the tongs.

1592
01:10:44,186 --> 01:10:45,387
Where is it?

1593
01:10:47,056 --> 01:10:48,256
(He is rushing as Dong Il is holding the hot brazier.)

1594
01:10:48,257 --> 01:10:49,427
- Come on.
- I found them.

1595
01:10:51,257 --> 01:10:52,626
(He is dashing with the tongs.)

1596
01:10:52,627 --> 01:10:54,226
Here. It must be so hot.

1597
01:10:54,566 --> 01:10:56,866
- I'll tilt it. Take it out slowly.
- Okay.

1598
01:10:56,867 --> 01:10:59,436
(As Dong Il wants to use good charcoals, )

1599
01:11:00,236 --> 01:11:01,336
(he is enduring the heat although it's too hot.)

1600
01:11:01,337 --> 01:11:02,667
- Good. Gosh, it's hot.
- Okay.

1601
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:05,177
Dong Il...

1602
01:11:05,837 --> 01:11:08,047
You were like a person who does a super strength show.

1603
01:11:10,406 --> 01:11:11,576
What? What is going on?

1604
01:11:11,577 --> 01:11:13,247
(What's going on?)

1605
01:11:13,377 --> 01:11:16,247
What just happened? I missed it.

1606
01:11:16,816 --> 01:11:18,916
Dong Il, that was amazing.

1607
01:11:18,917 --> 01:11:20,386
What is amazing about that? I just endured it.

1608
01:11:20,387 --> 01:11:22,386
Seriously, you were amazing.

1609
01:11:22,387 --> 01:11:24,695
- Are you sure you're not burnt?
- No. I'm all right.

1610
01:11:24,696 --> 01:11:25,757
(While Hee Won is amazed by Dong Il's sacrifice...)

1611
01:11:26,327 --> 01:11:31,467
(In the dark, )

1612
01:11:32,797 --> 01:11:36,706
(a mysterious man...)

1613
01:11:36,707 --> 01:11:39,337
(is walking toward the house.)

1614
01:11:40,236 --> 01:11:45,976
(Although he is so close, nobody recognized he's approaching.)

1615
01:11:46,747 --> 01:11:47,747
Sung Kyun.

1616
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:50,346
Oh, hey.

1617
01:11:51,587 --> 01:11:53,956
- Everyone. Look who is here.
- My gosh.

1618
01:11:53,957 --> 01:11:55,656
Look. Director Shin is here.

1619
01:11:55,986 --> 01:11:57,025
Hello, Won Ho.

1620
01:11:57,026 --> 01:11:58,096
(Can you pay attention to Director Shin?)

1621
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,127
- Hello.
- Hello.

1622
01:12:02,467 --> 01:12:05,366
- Director Shin is here. Hello.
- Hello.

1623
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:08,207
- Hello. Long time no see.
- Hello.

1624
01:12:09,566 --> 01:12:14,906
(Through Director Shin, the fathers on "Reply 1988" became friends.)

1625
01:12:16,606 --> 01:12:20,117
(He is the director of the Reply series and "Hospital Playlist".)

1626
01:12:20,846 --> 01:12:26,516
(He shares consolation by depicting different stories of people's life.)

1627
01:12:27,457 --> 01:12:31,457
(Director Shin Won Ho)

1628
01:12:31,997 --> 01:12:35,266
(Many familiar faces have gathered together.)

1629
01:12:35,526 --> 01:12:37,296
Excuse me, Director Shin. I'm in the middle of something.

1630
01:12:37,297 --> 01:12:38,867
(Sung Kyun teases him as soon as he gets here.)

1631
01:12:39,667 --> 01:12:42,435
- You seem to have lost weight.
- What was that?

1632
01:12:42,436 --> 01:12:44,066
It seems that you've lost weight.

1633
01:12:44,707 --> 01:12:46,405
- It seems you've gained weight.
- Darn it.

1634
01:12:46,406 --> 01:12:47,435
(They tease each other.)

1635
01:12:47,436 --> 01:12:48,507
Come sit here.

1636
01:12:49,146 --> 01:12:50,546
Come and have a seat. Aren't you cold?

1637
01:12:50,547 --> 01:12:52,516
- No, I'm not.
- Okay. Have a seat.

1638
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:58,556
How come everyone is so calm?

1639
01:12:59,117 --> 01:13:00,486
- I'm sorry?
- What do you mean?

1640
01:13:00,656 --> 01:13:02,426
- We're actually so excited.
- Hold on.

1641
01:13:02,427 --> 01:13:05,957
(This is how real close friends welcome a friend.)

1642
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:07,555
- Myoung.
- Yes?

1643
01:13:07,556 --> 01:13:09,826
- It's your first time meeting him?
- Yes, it is.

1644
01:13:09,827 --> 01:13:11,367
- Say hello to him.
- Hello. It's nice to meet you.

1645
01:13:11,566 --> 01:13:13,436
So when he starts filming the next drama...

1646
01:13:13,936 --> 01:13:16,266
Right. You're joining the military soon.

1647
01:13:17,007 --> 01:13:19,707
When you are discharged, I'll introduce you to him again.

1648
01:13:19,906 --> 01:13:21,346
Is he really entering the army? Or you're just saying that?

1649
01:13:21,476 --> 01:13:23,506
- Is it for real?
- I'm sorry, Myoung.

1650
01:13:23,507 --> 01:13:25,117
When you're back, I'll formally introduce you to him.

1651
01:13:25,316 --> 01:13:26,646
You don't need to be acquainted with him now.

1652
01:13:27,016 --> 01:13:28,286
(He feels sad already before he performs the military service.)

1653
01:13:28,287 --> 01:13:29,346
I'm sorry again.

1654
01:13:29,587 --> 01:13:31,486
When you're discharged, I'll introduce you to each other.

1655
01:13:31,957 --> 01:13:35,726
(My gosh, Myoung...)

1656
01:13:36,587 --> 01:13:37,656
It's boiling up.

1657
01:13:40,497 --> 01:13:42,026
It smells great already.

1658
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:44,867
What is that?

1659
01:13:45,396 --> 01:13:48,507
Sung Kyun is making cod fish soup.

1660
01:13:48,707 --> 01:13:51,076
- Sung Kyun is making it?
- He says he cooks it at home too.

1661
01:13:51,077 --> 01:13:52,606
- Because he likes to drink.
- Okay.

1662
01:13:53,236 --> 01:13:55,775
- I don't think I can add it all.
- Add the head though.

1663
01:13:55,776 --> 01:13:58,146
I just added the head.

1664
01:13:58,776 --> 01:13:59,917
It's good that it won't have too much fish smell.

1665
01:14:00,677 --> 01:14:02,787
(Surprised)

1666
01:14:03,016 --> 01:14:04,656
Gosh. I struggled with this.

1667
01:14:04,816 --> 01:14:06,985
(Pop-eyed)

1668
01:14:06,986 --> 01:14:08,627
- You chopped the whole thing?
- Yes.

1669
01:14:09,226 --> 01:14:10,627
- Sit down.
- It was crazy.

1670
01:14:11,127 --> 01:14:12,627
He chopped everything himself.

1671
01:14:12,856 --> 01:14:15,095
It was huge like this.

1672
01:14:15,096 --> 01:14:16,367
(He puts in a big piece too.)

1673
01:14:16,967 --> 01:14:19,736
Should we add the minced Cheongyang chilis from earlier?

1674
01:14:20,266 --> 01:14:22,406
Let's add some Cheongyang chilis. Or it might be fishy.

1675
01:14:22,507 --> 01:14:23,806
You have to add that.

1676
01:14:24,406 --> 01:14:25,475
It won't be fishy.

1677
01:14:25,476 --> 01:14:28,406
I cleaned the fish perfectly.

1678
01:14:28,776 --> 01:14:29,805
You have to add that.

1679
01:14:29,806 --> 01:14:30,975
- Or it will be fishy.
- Right.

1680
01:14:30,976 --> 01:14:33,015
- But he said it won't be fishy.
- Really?

1681
01:14:33,016 --> 01:14:34,815
(It won't be fishy, but he adds water parsley.)

1682
01:14:34,816 --> 01:14:36,515
Okay.

1683
01:14:36,516 --> 01:14:39,217
(Once he brings it to a boil, it's ready.)

1684
01:14:39,717 --> 01:14:41,726
I'm all done. It was hectic.

1685
01:14:43,026 --> 01:14:45,127
- Good job. Seriously.
- It was hectic.

1686
01:14:46,997 --> 01:14:49,025
- You didn't eat, right?
- No. I'm so hungry.

1687
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:50,065
You are?

1688
01:14:50,066 --> 01:14:51,765
Why are you expecting food from us?

1689
01:14:51,766 --> 01:14:54,436
- You invited me for a meal.
- We're just going to hang out.

1690
01:14:54,707 --> 01:14:56,206
You said you'd cook for me and invited me for a meal.

1691
01:14:56,207 --> 01:14:57,266
I did? What do you like to eat?

1692
01:14:57,906 --> 01:14:59,306
Me? I like meat.

1693
01:14:59,577 --> 01:15:01,706
Goodness. You...

1694
01:15:01,707 --> 01:15:03,806
- Hey, Won Ho wants meat.
- Right.

1695
01:15:04,007 --> 01:15:06,717
No. I can eat whatever you have. I'm good with anything.

1696
01:15:07,016 --> 01:15:09,287
- Should we grill the pork rind?
- Sounds good.

1697
01:15:09,587 --> 01:15:10,646
The pork rind...

1698
01:15:11,186 --> 01:15:15,355
(Placing the pork rind neatly on top of the heated charcoals)

1699
01:15:15,356 --> 01:15:16,426
All right.

1700
01:15:16,427 --> 01:15:17,525
(Hee Won grills the pork rind.)

1701
01:15:17,526 --> 01:15:19,195
That should do for the pork rind.

1702
01:15:19,196 --> 01:15:20,226
(Hee Won grills the pork rind.)

1703
01:15:22,596 --> 01:15:24,396
I think this is going to be so tasty.

1704
01:15:24,837 --> 01:15:26,537
It looks so chewy.

1705
01:15:27,337 --> 01:15:31,436
(The master of charcoals bring life...)

1706
01:15:32,436 --> 01:15:36,877
(to the appetizing pork rind that's grilled just right.)

1707
01:15:37,707 --> 01:15:38,716
Here.

1708
01:15:38,717 --> 01:15:41,286
(Dipping it in the curry powder and putting it in his mouth)

1709
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:42,346
Try it.

1710
01:15:44,117 --> 01:15:45,117
How is it?

1711
01:15:45,686 --> 01:15:48,427
- Is it good? Are you serious?
- Yes.

1712
01:15:48,686 --> 01:15:52,496
(The master of charcoals also tries one.)

1713
01:15:52,497 --> 01:15:53,757
- This is it.
- Is it?

1714
01:15:56,467 --> 01:15:58,496
(The master of charcoals prepare the chewy cut ready.)

1715
01:15:58,497 --> 01:16:00,537
- I heard the chewy cut is good.
- Yes.

1716
01:16:02,306 --> 01:16:06,507
(Hee Won is working hard for the guest who loves meat.)

1717
01:16:06,877 --> 01:16:07,905
Sit down and eat, Youngest.

1718
01:16:07,906 --> 01:16:09,105
(Glancing at the cod fish soup)

1719
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:10,177
- Eat.
- Okay.

1720
01:16:10,377 --> 01:16:12,877
You'll have the cod fish soup with rice later, right?

1721
01:16:13,047 --> 01:16:16,015
Yes. We'll eat it with rice. Let's bring the ladle.

1722
01:16:16,016 --> 01:16:17,957
Leave it in the pot, so they can help themselves.

1723
01:16:20,957 --> 01:16:22,726
(Getting up)

1724
01:16:23,186 --> 01:16:25,655
Let's just have the soup first. Let's have rice later.

1725
01:16:25,656 --> 01:16:27,056
Right. We'll have rice with that.

1726
01:16:27,396 --> 01:16:28,765
Then should we scoop up just a bit?

1727
01:16:28,766 --> 01:16:31,127
- We need to have fried rice later.
- No. Let's do this then.

1728
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,636
Let's get a bit of rice now. And have fried rice later.

1729
01:16:33,637 --> 01:16:36,507
- Okay.
- Let's split three bowls of rice.

1730
01:16:36,766 --> 01:16:37,935
- Should I make fried rice now?
- Then we'll eat more later.

1731
01:16:37,936 --> 01:16:40,006
No. Let's have a meal first. We can have that at the end.

1732
01:16:40,007 --> 01:16:42,676
- The fried rice...
- We can eat that after this.

1733
01:16:42,677 --> 01:16:44,515
- Sure. That's better.
- Right?

1734
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:45,676
(Fried rice is better at the end.)

1735
01:16:45,677 --> 01:16:46,747
Goodness.

1736
01:16:46,976 --> 01:16:48,717
But if we eat rice first, we'll get full.

1737
01:16:49,016 --> 01:16:50,117
Right.

1738
01:16:50,917 --> 01:16:52,855
- You sound so kind.
- What?

1739
01:16:52,856 --> 01:16:53,916
You sound so kind.

1740
01:16:53,917 --> 01:16:55,656
(Moo Sung sounds kind when he speaks.)

1741
01:16:56,556 --> 01:16:57,656
You're making me blush.

1742
01:16:59,056 --> 01:17:02,726
(He's adorable.)

1743
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:05,195
(The meat is grilled nicely.)

1744
01:17:05,196 --> 01:17:06,396
Dong Il, the meat is ready.

1745
01:17:06,736 --> 01:17:08,736
- Gosh. Put it there.
- This...

1746
01:17:09,306 --> 01:17:10,536
- Should I scoop up some rice?
- You should just...

1747
01:17:10,537 --> 01:17:11,837
- Yes. Get the rice.
- Get the rice.

1748
01:17:12,577 --> 01:17:13,775
Sung Kyun, can I take this now?

1749
01:17:13,776 --> 01:17:16,106
Here. I won't scoop up a lot of rice.

1750
01:17:16,446 --> 01:17:17,645
- Okay.
- This is a lot.

1751
01:17:17,646 --> 01:17:19,276
(Feeling glum)

1752
01:17:20,247 --> 01:17:22,387
- Can you eat fried rice after this?
- Yes.

1753
01:17:22,887 --> 01:17:23,887
We can eat everything.

1754
01:17:23,888 --> 01:17:25,516
(He can only think about his fried rice.)

1755
01:17:26,056 --> 01:17:29,827
(And there's cod fish soup with a refreshing broth.)

1756
01:17:30,287 --> 01:17:31,326
(He moves it to the table.)

1757
01:17:31,327 --> 01:17:33,896
It's Sung Kyun's cod fish soup. You know?

1758
01:17:35,066 --> 01:17:36,296
(Sung Kyun makes a refreshing cod fish soup.)

1759
01:17:36,297 --> 01:17:37,297
I hope you like it.

1760
01:17:37,427 --> 01:17:41,467
You know? This is the soup for the athletes...

1761
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:42,966
in terms of amount. Or the soldiers.

1762
01:17:42,967 --> 01:17:46,707
(The chewy cut and pork rind, grilled by the master of charcoals)

1763
01:17:47,276 --> 01:17:52,247
(Today's dinner will be a fun party in their mouths.)

1764
01:17:52,677 --> 01:17:53,877
(Impressed)

1765
01:17:55,047 --> 01:17:56,916
(Sung Kyun's cod fish soup mesmerizes them.)

1766
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:59,056
(That looks delicious.)

1767
01:17:59,816 --> 01:18:02,786
(In this refreshing soup, )

1768
01:18:02,787 --> 01:18:04,286
- It's half broth and half fish.
- That's good.

1769
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:07,827
(there are big chunks of cod.)

1770
01:18:08,196 --> 01:18:09,866
I'll divide the chunks equally.

1771
01:18:09,867 --> 01:18:11,195
(Scooping up the cod and broth generously)

1772
01:18:11,196 --> 01:18:13,366
Wait. I added everything.

1773
01:18:13,367 --> 01:18:14,367
That's a whole fish?

1774
01:18:14,906 --> 01:18:17,976
Yes, but it's much bigger than the cod people usually think of.

1775
01:18:19,476 --> 01:18:22,046
(Dong Il, the head chef of the show, tastes the broth first.)

1776
01:18:22,047 --> 01:18:23,146
(Amazed)

1777
01:18:24,406 --> 01:18:26,116
(Sipping the warm broth...)

1778
01:18:26,117 --> 01:18:27,117
(A sigh of satisfaction)

1779
01:18:27,247 --> 01:18:28,716
(on a cold winter night)

1780
01:18:28,717 --> 01:18:29,846
(A sigh of satisfaction)

1781
01:18:31,556 --> 01:18:32,956
(It heats up their cold bodies.)

1782
01:18:32,957 --> 01:18:33,957
- It's good.
- This is good.

1783
01:18:35,087 --> 01:18:36,156
(A sigh of satisfaction)

1784
01:18:37,026 --> 01:18:38,855
He's not someone we should take lightly of.

1785
01:18:38,856 --> 01:18:40,726
(Grinning)

1786
01:18:41,156 --> 01:18:42,195
(A sigh of satisfaction)

1787
01:18:42,196 --> 01:18:44,466
(There are only satisfying sighs in the front yard.)

1788
01:18:44,467 --> 01:18:45,596
Gosh. That hits the spot.

1789
01:18:47,096 --> 01:18:48,706
(He eats a big piece of cod.)

1790
01:18:48,707 --> 01:18:49,936
But in this dish,

1791
01:18:50,837 --> 01:18:53,605
- there is...
- Gosh. It's amazing.

1792
01:18:53,606 --> 01:18:55,806
Gosh. This is so good.

1793
01:18:56,747 --> 01:18:59,145
(The tender and chewy fish meat...)

1794
01:18:59,146 --> 01:19:02,646
(coats their mouths with a clean flavor.)

1795
01:19:03,146 --> 01:19:06,287
- The cod fish soup is refreshing.
- This is amazing.

1796
01:19:07,186 --> 01:19:09,827
(Having a big piece)

1797
01:19:10,556 --> 01:19:11,756
(Moo Sung has a small piece.)

1798
01:19:11,757 --> 01:19:14,526
(Savoring it)

1799
01:19:15,367 --> 01:19:20,367
(He takes his time with small bites.)

1800
01:19:21,837 --> 01:19:25,207
(What's this?)

1801
01:19:25,936 --> 01:19:29,946
(It was grilled with a nice, smoky flavor.)

1802
01:19:30,247 --> 01:19:33,617
(This cut has the chewiest texture ever.)

1803
01:19:34,417 --> 01:19:39,116
(He tastes the chewy cut for the first time.)

1804
01:19:39,117 --> 01:19:40,257
Is it not good?

1805
01:19:40,417 --> 01:19:41,586
What? Which cut is this?

1806
01:19:41,587 --> 01:19:42,587
(It's so good.)

1807
01:19:42,588 --> 01:19:44,895
- The inner intestine.
- No. The chewy cut.

1808
01:19:44,896 --> 01:19:46,025
- It's the chewy cut.
- It's the chewy cut.

1809
01:19:46,026 --> 01:19:47,297
- It's so good.
- The chewy cut.

1810
01:19:47,827 --> 01:19:51,096
- It's so good.
- Hee Won grilled it nicely.

1811
01:19:51,936 --> 01:19:53,435
(Glancing)

1812
01:19:53,436 --> 01:19:57,065
(The chewy cut is delicious?)

1813
01:19:57,066 --> 01:19:58,206
I've never had it.

1814
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,736
(He's never had it before.)

1815
01:20:00,476 --> 01:20:04,646
(He has to try it when he's curious.)

1816
01:20:04,976 --> 01:20:07,377
(Satisfied)

1817
01:20:08,186 --> 01:20:10,086
This is really good. So good.

1818
01:20:10,087 --> 01:20:14,287
(It's chewy without any fat.)

1819
01:20:15,457 --> 01:20:18,895
(Captivated by the chewy cut)

1820
01:20:18,896 --> 01:20:19,896
It's good.

1821
01:20:20,297 --> 01:20:21,297
- Is it?
- Yes.

1822
01:20:22,327 --> 01:20:23,396
The meat.

1823
01:20:23,627 --> 01:20:24,996
Do you want more meat?

1824
01:20:24,997 --> 01:20:26,936
(The various textures please their mouths.)

1825
01:20:27,236 --> 01:20:31,207
(They're having an abundant and happy meal.)

1826
01:20:31,736 --> 01:20:35,776
Now that I'm here, I think I can keep on eating.

1827
01:20:35,976 --> 01:20:37,247
- Really?
- Yes.

1828
01:20:37,577 --> 01:20:39,515
- My portion isn't big.
- Same here.

1829
01:20:39,516 --> 01:20:41,516
But I can't stop eating here.

1830
01:20:42,287 --> 01:20:44,015
We have to press the deodeok later.

1831
01:20:44,016 --> 01:20:46,016
(Joking)

1832
01:20:46,656 --> 01:20:47,887
We bought deodeok too.

1833
01:20:48,356 --> 01:20:49,486
Stop it.

1834
01:20:49,787 --> 01:20:51,627
Everyone, stop it.

1835
01:20:57,066 --> 01:20:58,096
When we got here,

1836
01:20:59,137 --> 01:21:00,297
what was the first thing we ate?

1837
01:21:01,196 --> 01:21:02,606
- The first thing we ate.
- What?

1838
01:21:02,707 --> 01:21:04,565
What did we eat when we came down?

1839
01:21:04,566 --> 01:21:06,106
(Serious)

1840
01:21:06,476 --> 01:21:09,076
- The meat. The raw meat.
- The braised spicy chicken.

1841
01:21:09,077 --> 01:21:10,905
The braised spicy chicken and the raw meat.

1842
01:21:10,906 --> 01:21:14,046
Then we had pork jowl meat and the white cut of meat.

1843
01:21:14,047 --> 01:21:16,116
We had steamed buns and jjondeugi in the red clay room.

1844
01:21:16,117 --> 01:21:18,086
We had sikhye and tangerines.

1845
01:21:18,087 --> 01:21:20,286
When we got back, we had steam buns and date tea.

1846
01:21:20,287 --> 01:21:22,356
(This is everything he ate in the past 5 hours.)

1847
01:21:22,827 --> 01:21:25,456
- And what are we having next?
- The deodeok.

1848
01:21:25,457 --> 01:21:26,695
- That's tasty.
- Are you serious?

1849
01:21:26,696 --> 01:21:28,395
- The grilled deodeok.
- It's really good.

1850
01:21:28,396 --> 01:21:29,696
It's really good.

1851
01:21:30,066 --> 01:21:32,266
We will grill deodeok and eat it.

1852
01:21:34,797 --> 01:21:36,836
He doesn't say he won't eat it.

1853
01:21:36,837 --> 01:21:38,837
And he can eat.

1854
01:21:39,831 --> 01:21:42,500
(It's really good.)

1855
01:21:42,501 --> 01:21:45,131
(We will grill deodeok and eat it.)

1856
01:21:47,031 --> 01:21:48,299
(He doesn't say he won't eat it.)

1857
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,340
(And he can eat.)

1858
01:21:50,501 --> 01:21:51,970
I used to eat a lot back then.

1859
01:21:52,214 --> 01:21:54,373
When I was working on "Prison Playbook"...

1860
01:21:54,374 --> 01:21:55,485
Gosh. He...

1861
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:57,484
- What?
- Whenever he filmed with food,

1862
01:21:57,485 --> 01:21:58,913
he ate a lot.

1863
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,413
(Whenever he filmed with food, he ate a lot.)

1864
01:22:00,414 --> 01:22:03,154
- The art team didn't prepare a lot.
- I went to the shoot to eat.

1865
01:22:03,155 --> 01:22:04,424
They ran out of food later because of me.

1866
01:22:05,424 --> 01:22:08,054
(I liked it.)

1867
01:22:08,624 --> 01:22:12,794
(When Moo Sung was filming "Prison Playbook", )

1868
01:22:14,265 --> 01:22:19,134
(he gobbled up the food.)

1869
01:22:19,504 --> 01:22:24,275
(Even when only the back of his face was in the shot, he ate a lot.)

1870
01:22:24,575 --> 01:22:26,174
(You'll get indigestion.)

1871
01:22:26,945 --> 01:22:29,945
(It's so good.)

1872
01:22:30,414 --> 01:22:33,185
I lost weight before I started. But I gained weight after the drama.

1873
01:22:34,214 --> 01:22:36,854
- You don't usually get tasty food.
- Right.

1874
01:22:36,855 --> 01:22:38,894
- But their food was so good.
- Right.

1875
01:22:38,895 --> 01:22:40,953
When we filmed "Reply 1988", we didn't go out to eat.

1876
01:22:40,954 --> 01:22:42,494
- We ate the food for the drama.
- Yes.

1877
01:22:42,865 --> 01:22:44,525
- We did that for the Reply series.
- Right.

1878
01:22:44,964 --> 01:22:46,164
We ate the food for the drama.

1879
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,864
I'm filming another drama, set in a prison.

1880
01:22:49,865 --> 01:22:52,575
But we don't get any eating scenes. That's so disappointing.

1881
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:54,873
We never eat in the scenes.

1882
01:22:54,874 --> 01:22:58,674
(He bursts into laughter as Moo Sung is serious.)

1883
01:22:59,275 --> 01:23:01,275
(Pondering)

1884
01:23:01,914 --> 01:23:04,614
By the way, I'm sorry to ask this, Moo Sung.

1885
01:23:04,615 --> 01:23:06,714
(By the way, I'm sorry to ask this, Moo Sung.)

1886
01:23:07,454 --> 01:23:09,424
Do we have to eat the fried rice?

1887
01:23:10,225 --> 01:23:12,993
- He prepared the ingredients.
- He prepared all the ingredients.

1888
01:23:12,994 --> 01:23:14,895
- But...
- It will be a small tasting dish.

1889
01:23:15,155 --> 01:23:16,565
It's like having chestnuts.

1890
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:20,464
(I'm so stuffed.)

1891
01:23:20,994 --> 01:23:23,803
That's why I suggested eating this with fried rice.

1892
01:23:23,804 --> 01:23:26,134
(Upset)

1893
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:28,844
Fine. All right.

1894
01:23:29,945 --> 01:23:31,544
Since we're eating now, let's keep eating.

1895
01:23:32,975 --> 01:23:35,043
- I'll go make it then.
- Yes. Let's keep eating.

1896
01:23:35,044 --> 01:23:37,185
You know, fried rice is delicious.

1897
01:23:38,815 --> 01:23:40,213
(He's unstoppable.)

1898
01:23:40,214 --> 01:23:42,753
By the way, we should fry rice...

1899
01:23:42,754 --> 01:23:45,855
with the leftover food. But that's just a new dish.

1900
01:23:46,254 --> 01:23:47,993
Then that's the fried rice...

1901
01:23:47,994 --> 01:23:49,623
- without the cod fish soup.
- Right.

1902
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:52,163
Yes. That's a totally fresh dish.

1903
01:23:52,164 --> 01:23:53,834
(What is this?)

1904
01:23:54,365 --> 01:23:58,405
(The chef of the fresh fried rice gets his ingredients.)

1905
01:23:58,975 --> 01:24:02,405
(Moo Sung, you can eat everything you want.)

1906
01:24:03,105 --> 01:24:07,844
(The owners are helping him prepare to cook fried rice.)

1907
01:24:08,475 --> 01:24:11,843
(Getting a lot of butter)

1908
01:24:11,844 --> 01:24:14,015
(Melt it on a cauldron lid.)

1909
01:24:14,254 --> 01:24:16,324
(Adding chopped kimchi and scallions)

1910
01:24:16,325 --> 01:24:18,254
It's the perilla oil.

1911
01:24:18,624 --> 01:24:22,424
(Excited)

1912
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:25,633
(They said they were full, )

1913
01:24:25,634 --> 01:24:27,834
(but all of their eyes...)

1914
01:24:28,265 --> 01:24:31,104
(are on the fried rice.)

1915
01:24:31,105 --> 01:24:32,334
It looks pretty good.

1916
01:24:32,905 --> 01:24:33,934
(Gosh.)

1917
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:35,945
- There goes in the rice.
- Gosh.

1918
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:37,674
Don't expect too much.

1919
01:24:38,374 --> 01:24:41,475
The cod fish soup was so good. This is a small tasting dish.

1920
01:24:43,785 --> 01:24:46,454
- When will you add the broth?
- I don't have to add the broth.

1921
01:24:46,855 --> 01:24:48,984
You said adding the broth will be the special ingredient.

1922
01:24:48,985 --> 01:24:51,884
No. The fried rice is totally unrelated to the cod fish soup.

1923
01:24:52,725 --> 01:24:54,453
Then this is just butter-fried rice.

1924
01:24:54,454 --> 01:24:56,093
You need to add the broth or something.

1925
01:24:56,094 --> 01:24:57,463
You said that's the special ingredient.

1926
01:24:57,464 --> 01:24:59,434
I do that when the soup is spicy.

1927
01:24:59,435 --> 01:25:01,235
- Right.
- That's when I add the broth.

1928
01:25:02,235 --> 01:25:04,105
I stir-fried the rice with the leftover spicy soup.

1929
01:25:04,765 --> 01:25:06,633
But that's a clear soup.

1930
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:07,674
(He can't believe it.)

1931
01:25:08,235 --> 01:25:10,105
(Cracking)

1932
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:13,544
Let's add some eggs.

1933
01:25:14,174 --> 01:25:15,515
It looks pretty good.

1934
01:25:17,015 --> 01:25:18,185
Let's just add three.

1935
01:25:18,714 --> 01:25:20,154
If you add too many eggs, it tastes too eggy.

1936
01:25:20,155 --> 01:25:21,985
(He only adds three eggs, so it doesn't get too eggy.)

1937
01:25:22,655 --> 01:25:25,225
(Moist)

1938
01:25:25,624 --> 01:25:26,923
Hey, taste it.

1939
01:25:26,924 --> 01:25:29,694
No. Let's scorch the rice a bit.

1940
01:25:29,695 --> 01:25:31,423
- Do you want me to spread it?
- Yes.

1941
01:25:31,424 --> 01:25:32,663
- You want me to burn it?
- Press it.

1942
01:25:32,664 --> 01:25:34,163
- Sure.
- Okay.

1943
01:25:34,164 --> 01:25:35,464
This lid is big anyway.

1944
01:25:36,565 --> 01:25:40,274
(After spreading it out thinly, when the moisture evaporates...)

1945
01:25:40,275 --> 01:25:42,174
Check if the bottom turned golden brown.

1946
01:25:42,975 --> 01:25:44,873
Wait. It's kind of ready.

1947
01:25:44,874 --> 01:25:46,373
Is it ready? Should we eat now?

1948
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:47,414
Scrape it.

1949
01:25:48,015 --> 01:25:52,685
(The fried rice is definitely making them salivate.)

1950
01:25:53,054 --> 01:25:54,383
- Thank you, Moo Sung.
- Thank you for cooking.

1951
01:25:54,384 --> 01:25:55,384
Thank you.

1952
01:25:55,385 --> 01:25:57,454
(They taste the dessert fried rice, completely unrelated to the soup.)

1953
01:25:58,054 --> 01:26:02,054
(It's scorched fried rice, just how Dong Il likes.)

1954
01:26:02,594 --> 01:26:04,993
(Having a big spoonful)

1955
01:26:04,994 --> 01:26:07,834
(It's hot.)

1956
01:26:08,195 --> 01:26:09,264
(Glancing)

1957
01:26:09,265 --> 01:26:11,204
(Studying their faces)

1958
01:26:12,304 --> 01:26:14,034
It's the typical fried rice we know.

1959
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:15,904
(It's a familiar flavor of kimchi and butter.)

1960
01:26:15,905 --> 01:26:17,575
- This is tasty.
- Yes.

1961
01:26:18,204 --> 01:26:19,243
It's delicious.

1962
01:26:19,244 --> 01:26:20,275
(Familiar flavors are the best.)

1963
01:26:20,874 --> 01:26:24,584
(I like it too.)

1964
01:26:25,015 --> 01:26:26,213
(Familiar food is the best.)

1965
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:27,285
Gosh.

1966
01:26:29,424 --> 01:26:32,793
(It's like they never had rice earlier.)

1967
01:26:32,794 --> 01:26:33,895
Gosh.

1968
01:26:35,355 --> 01:26:37,793
(Having big spoonfuls...)

1969
01:26:37,794 --> 01:26:39,494
(of the fried rice)

1970
01:26:39,895 --> 01:26:41,293
It's good.

1971
01:26:41,294 --> 01:26:43,405
(They are enjoying the food.)

1972
01:26:43,935 --> 01:26:47,634
(I'm full.)

1973
01:26:51,204 --> 01:26:55,274
(They are suffering from the huge intake of food.)

1974
01:26:55,275 --> 01:26:57,583
Seriously. I can still eat.

1975
01:26:57,584 --> 01:27:00,054
- Right.
- I thought I couldn't eat more.

1976
01:27:01,054 --> 01:27:03,053
- Gosh. That was good.
- That was delicious.

1977
01:27:03,054 --> 01:27:05,025
- That was nice.
- It was delicious.

1978
01:27:08,459 --> 01:27:10,567
- Gosh. That was good.
- That was delicious.

1979
01:27:10,568 --> 01:27:12,629
- That was nice.
- It was delicious.

1980
01:27:14,948 --> 01:27:17,577
You were together the whole day. Did these two...

1981
01:27:17,578 --> 01:27:19,448
talk today?

1982
01:27:19,988 --> 01:27:21,046
These two?

1983
01:27:21,047 --> 01:27:23,518
He is usually the chatty type, but he's quiet today.

1984
01:27:23,717 --> 01:27:25,887
I need to get into the mood.

1985
01:27:26,217 --> 01:27:27,858
Once he does, he talks a lot.

1986
01:27:28,457 --> 01:27:31,227
What does he usually talk about?

1987
01:27:31,228 --> 01:27:32,296
I'm all over the place.

1988
01:27:32,297 --> 01:27:33,827
- For example, - About life?

1989
01:27:33,828 --> 01:27:36,496
there was one time he talked about his senior trip...

1990
01:27:36,497 --> 01:27:39,268
in high school. Seriously. He talked about it...

1991
01:27:40,507 --> 01:27:42,238
for five minutes.

1992
01:27:42,807 --> 01:27:44,517
- I thought you liked my story.
- Right.

1993
01:27:44,837 --> 01:27:47,806
We bonded when we filmed "Prison Playbook".

1994
01:27:47,807 --> 01:27:49,376
So he completely ignored me.

1995
01:27:49,377 --> 01:27:51,776
But when it happened, it was really funny.

1996
01:27:52,076 --> 01:27:53,187
Oh, that?

1997
01:27:53,517 --> 01:27:55,716
It was an old train.

1998
01:27:55,717 --> 01:27:56,757
Are you going to tell the story now?

1999
01:27:57,717 --> 01:28:00,227
- It's a funny story.
- Okay. Let's hear him out.

2000
01:28:00,356 --> 01:28:01,386
I was on my senior trip.

2001
01:28:01,387 --> 01:28:05,996
Back then, on Tongil-ho Train, there was a switchboard.

2002
01:28:06,927 --> 01:28:09,325
But I turned it off just in case...

2003
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:11,936
when we entered the tunnel.

2004
01:28:11,937 --> 01:28:13,807
- I see.
- It was pitch-dark.

2005
01:28:14,937 --> 01:28:16,506
You know what happened when it was dark?

2006
01:28:16,507 --> 01:28:20,146
At first, people were surprised. Then they started to scream.

2007
01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:23,417
After hearing them scream, I turned on the switch again.

2008
01:28:23,946 --> 01:28:27,087
People were grabbing each other's hair. It was a mess.

2009
01:28:29,087 --> 01:28:30,257
Wasn't that a fun story?

2010
01:28:31,856 --> 01:28:35,427
(The silence is deafening.)

2011
01:28:36,627 --> 01:28:40,627
(He has to hold back his laughter which he didn't expect to do.)

2012
01:28:40,797 --> 01:28:42,466
And I turned it off again at the next tunnel.

2013
01:28:42,467 --> 01:28:43,495
(The story wasn't over?)

2014
01:28:43,496 --> 01:28:45,695
After that, my homeroom teacher had flour all over him.

2015
01:28:45,696 --> 01:28:46,906
That's what I did.

2016
01:28:48,267 --> 01:28:50,606
I did that three times. It was so fun.

2017
01:28:52,106 --> 01:28:53,946
- Let's clean this up first.
- Okay.

2018
01:28:54,377 --> 01:28:56,776
- Let's talk after we clean up.
- It's funny when you imagine it.

2019
01:28:57,177 --> 01:28:58,676
(Stubborn)

2020
01:28:58,677 --> 01:29:00,746
- We can talk then.
- I'm serious.

2021
01:29:01,717 --> 01:29:02,945
I made a fun memory for them.

2022
01:29:02,946 --> 01:29:05,285
You're timid now. It was such a long story back then.

2023
01:29:05,286 --> 01:29:07,655
What? How can I make it long...

2024
01:29:07,656 --> 01:29:10,195
- after what you said?
- We're lucky that he only...

2025
01:29:10,196 --> 01:29:12,195
- did that three times.
- How can I after what you said?

2026
01:29:12,196 --> 01:29:14,996
We're lucky that he only did that three times.

2027
01:29:15,297 --> 01:29:17,996
- What if he did it ten times?
- We would be in trouble then.

2028
01:29:18,137 --> 01:29:20,137
- Did you do it...
- If he did it ten times...

2029
01:29:20,507 --> 01:29:24,535
No. He still remembers what happened on that trip...

2030
01:29:24,536 --> 01:29:26,336
and has fun talking about. That's so innocent of him.

2031
01:29:26,337 --> 01:29:27,745
He was laughing when he was telling the story.

2032
01:29:27,746 --> 01:29:30,216
- That's such a good memory for me.
- Right.

2033
01:29:30,217 --> 01:29:32,916
- He's such an innocent guy.
- Yes, he is.

2034
01:29:32,917 --> 01:29:34,815
- He still remembers it.
- He's so excited...

2035
01:29:34,816 --> 01:29:36,315
- about it.
- Right.

2036
01:29:36,316 --> 01:29:38,286
You two seem to see things eye to eye.

2037
01:29:39,257 --> 01:29:41,426
But Hee Won's stories aren't this boring.

2038
01:29:41,427 --> 01:29:42,456
What?

2039
01:29:42,786 --> 01:29:45,057
(Laughing)

2040
01:29:45,496 --> 01:29:48,526
(It was really fun!)

2041
01:29:50,236 --> 01:29:54,007
(Sitting under the sky side by side...)

2042
01:29:54,706 --> 01:29:59,076
(brings back memories of their times together.)

2043
01:30:00,946 --> 01:30:03,945
My gosh. When I filmed "Reply 1994",

2044
01:30:03,946 --> 01:30:06,315
I met Sung Kyun for the first time.

2045
01:30:06,316 --> 01:30:08,646
- "Reply 1994".
- Right.

2046
01:30:08,946 --> 01:30:12,956
At first, I thought he was a parent too.

2047
01:30:14,026 --> 01:30:15,627
I didn't think he was a student.

2048
01:30:17,218 --> 01:30:20,458
(The first day Dong Il and Sung Kyun met)

2049
01:30:20,866 --> 01:30:23,235
(He's...)

2050
01:30:23,236 --> 01:30:24,995
(twenty years old.)

2051
01:30:24,996 --> 01:30:26,906
(I'm serious.)

2052
01:30:27,406 --> 01:30:29,877
(Bowing politely)

2053
01:30:32,776 --> 01:30:34,406
After our first meeting,

2054
01:30:35,106 --> 01:30:38,076
he left. Then Woo Jung said this.

2055
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:40,186
"I'll give you 1,000 dollars..."

2056
01:30:40,187 --> 01:30:41,847
"if you can drop the honorifics until the end of our drama."

2057
01:30:43,616 --> 01:30:45,815
(Groaning)

2058
01:30:45,816 --> 01:30:48,086
We met up for our first read-through.

2059
01:30:48,087 --> 01:30:50,825
Il Hwa looked at him like this.

2060
01:30:50,826 --> 01:30:53,526
And she asked me this, "He's older than me, right?"

2061
01:30:54,767 --> 01:30:56,096
- Il Hwa said that?
- Yes.

2062
01:30:56,097 --> 01:30:57,337
I told her he was 10 years younger.

2063
01:30:58,467 --> 01:31:00,336
It would've been fun if Jae Myung was here.

2064
01:31:00,337 --> 01:31:01,337
Right.

2065
01:31:01,338 --> 01:31:02,905
- That guy...
- He never fails.

2066
01:31:02,906 --> 01:31:04,075
- He does everything.
- Really?

2067
01:31:04,076 --> 01:31:06,477
Won Ho ruined my image.

2068
01:31:06,706 --> 01:31:08,806
- What?
- You only gave me weird roles.

2069
01:31:08,807 --> 01:31:10,576
You were the one who made them look weird.

2070
01:31:11,377 --> 01:31:13,386
The lines were clear.

2071
01:31:13,387 --> 01:31:15,547
You took it farther.

2072
01:31:15,847 --> 01:31:19,187
He would complain the most when we start a new drama.

2073
01:31:19,456 --> 01:31:24,427
He wants to meet junior actors for auditions.

2074
01:31:24,696 --> 01:31:25,995
There was a rumor back then.

2075
01:31:25,996 --> 01:31:27,495
Anyone who played my daughter would get successful.

2076
01:31:27,496 --> 01:31:28,966
And everyone got successful.

2077
01:31:28,967 --> 01:31:31,066
I also auditioned to be his daughter.

2078
01:31:32,167 --> 01:31:34,106
You auditioned to be my daughter?

2079
01:31:34,937 --> 01:31:37,776
I hate it when men talk about their confessions to women.

2080
01:31:37,937 --> 01:31:39,636
Your dramas are nothing but that.

2081
01:31:39,637 --> 01:31:41,306
Right. It's fine in dramas.

2082
01:31:41,307 --> 01:31:44,245
- You make no sense.
- When my friend tells me...

2083
01:31:44,246 --> 01:31:47,017
(This will be another unforgettable night for them.)
