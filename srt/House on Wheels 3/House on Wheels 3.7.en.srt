1
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:28,182
(After spending a day in Mount Joowol,)

2
00:00:28,893 --> 00:00:31,993
(the moonlight is clear tonight...)

3
00:00:31,993 --> 00:00:34,822
(above our house.)

4
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:36,933
- Hyun Chul, are you leaving now?
- Yes.

5
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:38,063
I'll go with him.

6
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:41,532
- I think it'll be fun.
- It is fun.

7
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:42,703
When I get there.

8
00:00:42,703 --> 00:00:44,673
(Woo Hee wears her socks.)

9
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:47,343
- Give it to me.
- How do you turn it on?

10
00:00:47,343 --> 00:00:49,113
- Keep pushing it.
- It turns on.

11
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:50,412
- It runs on electricity.
- Good.

12
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:51,513
There.

13
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:52,813
- Go?
- Should I hold it?

14
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:54,843
- Goodbye.
- See you.

15
00:00:54,843 --> 00:00:56,612
- Bye.
- Good night.

16
00:00:58,252 --> 00:01:01,383
(After dinner a few hours ago...)

17
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:05,862
(Can we check out the cypress forest at night?)

18
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:06,892
At night?

19
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:09,133
(You'd go to the cypress forest at night by yourself?)

20
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:12,233
(Hyun Chul has a hobby of taking a night walk alone.)

21
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:14,502
(I see.)

22
00:01:14,902 --> 00:01:16,502
- Goodbye.
- See you.

23
00:01:16,502 --> 00:01:18,303
- Bye.
- Good night.

24
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:20,703
- Scream when you see a wild animal.
- Okay.

25
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:23,013
Is there cell reception in the woods?

26
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:25,582
- Yes, there is.
- Why are you looking weak?

27
00:01:25,582 --> 00:01:27,713
- You were so confident.
- We'll walk you...

28
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,112
to the bridge.

29
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:32,183
Over there. It's a trail.

30
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:33,222
Well, then.

31
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:36,323
(Look behind our house,)

32
00:01:36,323 --> 00:01:39,563
(and the trail stretches out.)

33
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:43,492
(At the end of the trail is a forest full of cypress trees.)

34
00:01:45,132 --> 00:01:46,132
(But it's pitch-black for now.)

35
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:47,862
Will they be able to see anything in this darkness?

36
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:51,032
Send us a letter.

37
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:52,942
Bye.

38
00:01:52,942 --> 00:01:53,972
- All right.
- Bye.

39
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:57,412
- We'll be back.
- Make a lot of money, okay?

40
00:01:57,412 --> 00:01:58,442
Right.

41
00:01:58,642 --> 00:02:00,582
- We'll be back.
- Bye.

42
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:03,013
(Taking something out)

43
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:05,112
- Make it look sentimental.
- You look cute.

44
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:06,782
(Hyun Chul turns on his camera phone.)

45
00:02:06,782 --> 00:02:08,282
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

46
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:09,623
- Bye.
- Bye.

47
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:11,992
Hyun Chul is a movie director,

48
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:13,593
so he must take good videos.

49
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:15,323
- Go ahead.
- Come on.

50
00:02:16,132 --> 00:02:17,593
Let's go. Watch your step.

51
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:20,832
- Good night.
- How long will you take?

52
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,233
We have to look for you if you don't come back in time.

53
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:24,332
(Leaving the family members who are worried)

54
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:26,802
- We'll be back in 30 minutes.
- In 30 minutes?

55
00:02:26,802 --> 00:02:27,943
- Yes.
- Okay.

56
00:02:27,943 --> 00:02:30,573
(Goodbye, everyone.)

57
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,013
(Hyun Chul and Woo Hee take a night walk.)

58
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:35,312
It's uphill. Will you be all right?

59
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,312
I'm not tired.

60
00:02:37,353 --> 00:02:39,353
I ate too much today.

61
00:02:39,353 --> 00:02:40,483
(Hyun Chul and Woo Hee)

62
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:43,622
So if I take a walk like this,

63
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,022
(Relying on the small lantern)

64
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:46,323
I'll be able to sleep better.

65
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:47,362
(The two keep pace with each other.)

66
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:50,163
Tell me if it's too hard for you.

67
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:51,193
- Okay.
- We'll go back.

68
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:56,033
How did you even think about coming here alone?

69
00:02:57,772 --> 00:02:58,832
It's too scary.

70
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:00,802
(I can't see ahead.)

71
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:02,742
I'm walking blindly.

72
00:03:02,742 --> 00:03:03,772
(They can't see the trail as it's too dark.)

73
00:03:03,772 --> 00:03:05,413
Right.

74
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:07,283
(They can't see the trail as it's too dark.)

75
00:03:07,283 --> 00:03:09,483
- It is a bit scary.
- It is, isn't it?

76
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:11,212
It's terrifying.

77
00:03:12,112 --> 00:03:13,353
We look so scary.

78
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:14,622
(Even our faces look scary.)

79
00:03:15,953 --> 00:03:19,293
But when will I ever get to...

80
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:20,962
experience this?

81
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:21,962
(This is a rare opportunity.)

82
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:24,862
And I'll be able to sleep well.

83
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:26,832
I look terrifying, don't I?

84
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,902
- You look okay in general, - Do I look scary?

85
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,342
- but your eyes are...
- I just...

86
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:33,802
Your eyes are radiating.

87
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:36,543
I can't see you at all.

88
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:39,082
Oh, I had the flash on.

89
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:40,612
(Sorry about the flash.)

90
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:43,212
You know how it gets scary...

91
00:03:43,212 --> 00:03:44,953
- Sorry.
- without the light, right?

92
00:03:46,582 --> 00:03:49,122
- What on earth is going on?
- This has never happened before.

93
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:50,122
(Only the landlords are left at House on Wheels 3.)

94
00:03:54,163 --> 00:03:56,133
Should we wait for them...

95
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,832
and cook ramyeon when they come back?

96
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:00,362
Ramyeon with shiitake mushrooms?

97
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,062
That's nice.

98
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:03,133
(I'd love that.)

99
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:04,832
- We can cook it here.
- Good.

100
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:07,503
I'm full, but if it's ramyeon...

101
00:04:08,103 --> 00:04:10,043
We'll set everything up...

102
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:12,783
and add the noodles to eat it once they return.

103
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:14,883
He's so tiring.

104
00:04:14,883 --> 00:04:16,353
(Laughing)

105
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:20,353
- He's such a peculiar guy.
- I know.

106
00:04:21,723 --> 00:04:22,723
(Awaiting Hyun Chul and Woo Hee)

107
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:25,423
Then we'll move them to tears.

108
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:26,992
It'll be a surprise. Right, Youngest?

109
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:30,733
- Hey, Hee Won.
- Yes?

110
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,163
I got the gas tank here.

111
00:04:33,763 --> 00:04:36,202
It's like preparing for dinner...

112
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:38,403
all over again.

113
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:40,942
(That's what I'm saying.)

114
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,473
(Taking things out)

115
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:44,612
- The big one.
- Shiitake mushrooms...

116
00:04:44,612 --> 00:04:45,783
That's right.

117
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:48,512
- Should I take out a lot of them?
- Yes.

118
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:51,213
(Oh, here's a big one!)

119
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:58,723
(The shiitake mushrooms they picked this afternoon)

120
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:02,062
Let's put a lot of them to add the scent.

121
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:03,733
(Chopping)

122
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:06,233
It feels like... Look at the mushrooms.

123
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:08,233
It's like chopping abalones or conch shells.

124
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:11,903
(Gulping already)

125
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:12,903
Look at that.

126
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:16,143
- Hyun Chul is a sweetheart.
- Yes?

127
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:17,213
(Hyun Chul is such a sweetheart.)

128
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:18,973
He's not calculative at all.

129
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,483
He seems so pure.

130
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:26,452
Maybe it was a good thing that he told us he was going there.

131
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:27,952
(Considering Hyun Chul's personality...)

132
00:05:28,382 --> 00:05:29,423
(You're right about that.)

133
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:30,723
Say...

134
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:33,122
he left without telling anyone when we were all asleep.

135
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:34,663
That would have been a bigger problem.

136
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:36,833
It was good that he warned us.

137
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,932
(We're lucky that he told us.)

138
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:40,485
They'll be able to eat mushrooms...

139
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:42,185
(I'll feed them to their fill!)

140
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:43,185
(to their fill.)

141
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:47,454
(He chops them one by one.)

142
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:49,724
Look. We have so many mushrooms.

143
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,524
(Full of shiitake mushrooms)

144
00:05:52,795 --> 00:05:54,394
This is incredible.

145
00:05:54,865 --> 00:05:57,365
This is my first late-night meal...

146
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:59,665
since I joined House on Wheels.

147
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:01,665
- It's our first time too.
- Really?

148
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:02,704
- The very first one.
- It's our first.

149
00:06:04,105 --> 00:06:05,844
I won't add any eggs to make it refreshing.

150
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:07,875
Open the soup packet.

151
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:09,844
- Open it up?
- Yes.

152
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:12,915
We could make kimchi jjigae just with kimchi.

153
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,115
There are so many mushrooms.

154
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:17,584
(We have so many of them.)

155
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:18,615
The mushrooms.

156
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:20,884
- Where's the soup powder?
- Add it.

157
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:22,824
It's so weird that I can always eat more ramyeon.

158
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:24,324
- Done?
- Yes.

159
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:25,865
All preparations are done.

160
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:27,426
(Now that we added the soup powder...)

161
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,796
How long has it been since they left? About 30 minutes?

162
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:33,904
How was today?

163
00:06:33,904 --> 00:06:35,005
- Today?
- Yes.

164
00:06:36,074 --> 00:06:37,735
I was a bit flustered at first.

165
00:06:38,574 --> 00:06:40,704
- But I'm all right now.
- That's good.

166
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:45,214
I think Dong Il cares about you a lot.

167
00:06:45,214 --> 00:06:46,945
- I like it.
- He kept talking to you.

168
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:48,485
- He did.
- Yes.

169
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,654
- Why? You startled me.
- What is it?

170
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:53,884
Something moved.

171
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,154
I was so startled.

172
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:57,925
It was like a frog. It startled me.

173
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,865
(As they walk while greeting the friends in the forest...)

174
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:03,495
It looks so cool here, doesn't it?

175
00:07:03,495 --> 00:07:04,795
Hooray!

176
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:06,935
I see stars.

177
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:10,904
(Amazed)

178
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:12,334
This is awesome.

179
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,474
Awesome.

180
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:15,805
(The stars in the sky are visible now that it's dark.)

181
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:16,945
Hooray!

182
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:20,315
(The stars in the sky are visible now that it's dark.)

183
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,344
Great.

184
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:23,084
(The night view...)

185
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:25,315
I wish they came with us to see this.

186
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:29,185
(is framed against the cypress trees.)

187
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:33,724
(Woo Hee skips as she's excited to see stars.)

188
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:36,735
- I must look so scary.
- Is it too bright?

189
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:38,495
I can't see anything.

190
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:41,134
I'll film you.

191
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:43,375
Right now, you look really...

192
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,404
(Shy)

193
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:46,245
good. It's like...

194
00:07:47,404 --> 00:07:50,045
we're filming a music video for a hip hop song.

195
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:54,344
A rebel. Are you dancing right now?

196
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:56,515
(He looks like he's dancing.)

197
00:07:58,155 --> 00:08:00,385
(Embarrassed after dancing)

198
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:02,484
But...

199
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:05,754
the sound of the water is so nice.

200
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:06,765
It is.

201
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:07,765
(I love it.)

202
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:13,065
(The clear sound of water breaking the silence of the forest)

203
00:08:13,065 --> 00:08:14,204
I get...

204
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:17,234
why you like taking night walks.

205
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:18,775
Right?

206
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:20,675
(Right?)

207
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:23,114
(Chattering from afar)

208
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:26,114
- When the light is gone...
- Sorry.

209
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,315
- I'm sorry.
- I can't see anything.

210
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,454
Are they coming?

211
00:08:30,254 --> 00:08:31,315
Are they here?

212
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:32,984
They're back?

213
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:34,555
(They hear their voice from a distance.)

214
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,885
- Are they here?
- This is nice.

215
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:37,395
(Getting nervous)

216
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:39,055
I see the light there.

217
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:40,494
They're really back.

218
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:44,195
It startled me. It was like a frog.

219
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:46,435
- Should I turn on the fire?
- Yes.

220
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:49,165
(Rushing)

221
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:51,035
- Boil it over high heat, Youngest.
- Okay.

222
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:53,574
(They have the ramyeon soup ready.)

223
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:56,344
(Acting as if nothing happened)

224
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:57,415
Guys.

225
00:08:58,315 --> 00:09:00,545
We were too worried to go to bed.

226
00:09:00,545 --> 00:09:01,984
- Really?
- Yes.

227
00:09:01,984 --> 00:09:03,984
We've been standing here all this time.

228
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:05,484
We haven't moved a step.

229
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:07,124
You're lying.

230
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:09,425
- No.
- We're standing right now.

231
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:12,594
- You know, because it's nighttime, - Yes.

232
00:09:13,265 --> 00:09:15,624
I can see the stars so clearly.

233
00:09:15,624 --> 00:09:16,765
- Is that so?
- Yes.

234
00:09:17,094 --> 00:09:19,295
With the lights off, I could even see the moon.

235
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:22,065
You're hungry after the walk, aren't you?

236
00:09:22,065 --> 00:09:23,074
(By the way...)

237
00:09:23,805 --> 00:09:26,545
So we prepared ramyeon with mushrooms for you.

238
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:28,844
- Are you serious?
- Yes. We set up the whole thing.

239
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:30,244
- For real?
- Yes.

240
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:32,045
- We're serious.
- Are we eating again?

241
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:34,244
But we went on a walk to digest the meal.

242
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:37,354
- We're serious.
- Are you serious?

243
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:40,025
You're digested now, right? You can get back to eating.

244
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:41,854
- Come here, Hyun Chul.
- Really?

245
00:09:41,854 --> 00:09:43,754
- Is this for real?
- Yes, they prepared all of it.

246
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:45,254
- Everything is ready.
- What?

247
00:09:45,254 --> 00:09:46,695
- Seriously?
- Yes.

248
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:49,065
I'm telling you.

249
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:51,695
There will be more mushrooms than ramyeon noodles, Hyun Chul.

250
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:52,734
Take your seats.

251
00:09:53,035 --> 00:09:54,104
It's already...

252
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:55,864
Look at the chili and everything.

253
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:57,874
You were serious.

254
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:01,104
(A party of mushrooms)

255
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:04,045
This isn't ramyeon with mushrooms. This is mushrooms with ramyeon.

256
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:05,744
We had everything prepared so that we could just add...

257
00:10:05,744 --> 00:10:08,015
- the noodles when you returned.
- Amazing.

258
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:12,555
(Help yourselves.)

259
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:15,584
Hyun Chul said...

260
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:18,425
he was going to the cypress forest,

261
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:20,565
so we got to have a late-night meal for the first time.

262
00:10:21,094 --> 00:10:22,364
(What?)

263
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:24,035
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

264
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:26,704
It is. It's Hyun Chul's fault.

265
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:28,405
I'm just being honest.

266
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,405
(New experiences like the night walk and the first late-night meal)

267
00:10:32,004 --> 00:10:33,074
I apologize.

268
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:36,214
(Hyun Chul is so cute.)

269
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:37,945
I think the water is boiling now.

270
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:40,244
(They stand up right away.)

271
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:41,445
Drop the ramyeon in.

272
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:44,815
This is so funny.

273
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:46,555
(This is so funny.)

274
00:10:46,785 --> 00:10:48,885
Gosh. This is nice.

275
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:50,895
The amount of water is perfect.

276
00:10:52,354 --> 00:10:53,895
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

277
00:10:54,724 --> 00:10:56,135
It must be delicious.

278
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:57,165
(Mushroom ramyeon at 11pm)

279
00:10:57,364 --> 00:10:58,395
It looks so good.

280
00:10:58,395 --> 00:11:00,065
(It looks good.)

281
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:03,035
(Excited)

282
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:04,905
Let's eat before it gets soggy.

283
00:11:04,905 --> 00:11:06,805
- Okay. Thank you for the food.
- Try it.

284
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:09,145
I came here to eat good food and have fun anyway.

285
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:10,775
If you want to eat more, put rice in it.

286
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:11,816
Okay.

287
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:13,215
- Please eat.
- Okay.

288
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,946
- Take them all.
- Okay.

289
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:16,484
Let's eat.

290
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:17,685
(Hyun Chul, who must've been hungry after taking a walk, eats first.)

291
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:20,254
(Impressed)

292
00:11:20,254 --> 00:11:21,525
- Thank you.
- How does it taste?

293
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:22,895
- It's so good.
- Gosh. Try mushrooms.

294
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:24,295
- Are these mushrooms good?
- They're amazing.

295
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:29,425
(Woo Hee slurps.)

296
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:31,065
(Savoring)

297
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:35,864
(Exclaiming)

298
00:11:36,035 --> 00:11:37,104
These mushrooms smell so good.

299
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:43,874
(You must eat this.)

300
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:49,015
(They all seem like they're having their first meal of the day.)

301
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:51,254
- This is so delicious.
- Right?

302
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:54,685
I can't believe I can still eat it.

303
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:57,525
- My goodness.
- I know.

304
00:11:57,954 --> 00:11:58,954
(It's a midnight snack.)

305
00:11:58,954 --> 00:12:01,795
- Gosh. This is so strange.
- I know.

306
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:06,065
It's about time you get hungry.

307
00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:08,234
(She said it was strange, but she keeps eating it.)

308
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:11,004
- I should've added the last one.
- You mean the noodles?

309
00:12:11,374 --> 00:12:13,775
(Dong Il bursts into laughter.)

310
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:16,374
(They are all enjoying it.)

311
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:17,874
It's nice to have Hyun Chul here.

312
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:20,915
- It's nice to have Hyun Chul here?
- Yes.

313
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:22,714
I'm full.

314
00:12:23,354 --> 00:12:25,655
(The night wore on.)

315
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:27,155
Did you see the inside of the tent?

316
00:12:27,155 --> 00:12:28,584
- No, not yet.
- Let me show you.

317
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:31,124
- Okay.
- It's even better...

318
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:33,364
- It's way better.
- than a hotel room.

319
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:36,994
(I can't wait.)

320
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:39,464
- Gosh. It's awesome.
- Look.

321
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:40,834
(They exclaim as soon as they see it.)

322
00:12:40,964 --> 00:12:42,204
It's so nice.

323
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,435
So cute.

324
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:47,004
- It's very spacious. Look.
- It's so nice.

325
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:49,445
- Go inside.
- Seriously.

326
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:51,574
(Hyun Chul goes into the tent.)

327
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:53,744
Go in.

328
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:55,214
What is he doing?

329
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:56,285
(Lying flat)

330
00:12:56,714 --> 00:12:57,954
What is he doing?

331
00:12:57,954 --> 00:13:00,484
Hey. You should lie face up.

332
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:02,624
(Hyun Chul is so funny.)

333
00:13:02,624 --> 00:13:04,254
You should lie face up.

334
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:05,555
- It's nice.
- Why are you looking at blankets?

335
00:13:05,754 --> 00:13:07,065
- Goodness.
- Right?

336
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:09,565
(You like it, right?)

337
00:13:10,135 --> 00:13:11,464
(I'll lie down here too.)

338
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:12,765
It's perfect for you, Woo Hee.

339
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:16,305
- You'll feel so warm. Seriously.
- It's really warm in there.

340
00:13:16,474 --> 00:13:19,334
It feels so...

341
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:20,844
These blankets are so good too.

342
00:13:22,244 --> 00:13:25,974
(She keeps rubbing the blankets.)

343
00:13:26,645 --> 00:13:28,614
- Then who will sleep up there?
- Who's going to sleep up there?

344
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:31,685
I'll sleep in the tent.

345
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:33,655
- Great.
- Really?

346
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:34,854
Where do you want to sleep, Woo Hee?

347
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:36,954
- I'll sleep up there.
- Up there?

348
00:13:36,954 --> 00:13:38,094
I want to sleep on the top bunk.

349
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:39,795
- Good night.
- Good night.

350
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:41,094
Sleep tight, Hyun Chul.

351
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:42,525
- Good night.
- Good night.

352
00:13:43,734 --> 00:13:45,234
(Woo Hee takes the top bunk that she's been curious about.)

353
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:47,464
(This is nice.)

354
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:49,135
Okay. I'll turn off the lights.

355
00:13:49,565 --> 00:13:50,834
Good night.

356
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,545
(- I'll turn off the lights. - Good night.)

357
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:56,675
(When they turn off the lights,)

358
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:58,374
- We can see the stars from here.
- I know.

359
00:13:58,374 --> 00:13:59,545
- Even when we're lying down.
- Right.

360
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:01,344
(they can see the stars from the house.)

361
00:14:01,344 --> 00:14:02,545
Goodness. The stars are...

362
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:03,685
- There are so many stars, right?
- Right.

363
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:05,515
(There are so many stars, right?)

364
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:06,685
(Impressed)

365
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:08,385
The stars are beautiful.

366
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:13,525
(What kind of day awaits them tomorrow?)

367
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:18,734
(The morning breaks in the garden in Mount Joowol.)

368
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:26,074
(The forest is turning yellow.)

369
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:33,415
(The House on Wheels is...)

370
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:36,815
(surrounded by high mountains.)

371
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:41,385
(It's still dark since the sun hasn't reached yet.)

372
00:14:41,785 --> 00:14:44,655
(The glasses are fogged up,)

373
00:14:45,124 --> 00:14:48,124
(making the house cozy like blankets.)

374
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:51,864
(The members are still sleeping soundly.)

375
00:14:52,135 --> 00:14:57,305
(Woo Hee wakes up.)

376
00:14:57,305 --> 00:14:59,604
(She stretches as soon as she wakes up.)

377
00:14:59,604 --> 00:15:02,104
(Stretching)

378
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:05,675
(Sitting up)

379
00:15:05,844 --> 00:15:08,945
(She stretches her legs too.)

380
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:14,854
(She stretches while listening to the snores.)

381
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:17,754
(Woo Hee's morning starts a bit earlier...)

382
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:20,464
(than the house owners.)

383
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,665
(Let me see the morning sky.)

384
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:29,905
(Flustered)

385
00:15:30,935 --> 00:15:33,844
(She folds it carefully.)

386
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:38,114
(She puts it back in its place.)

387
00:15:38,844 --> 00:15:43,155
(I'm bored. When will everyone get up?)

388
00:15:43,714 --> 00:15:46,754
(Wriggling)

389
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:50,494
(Current time: 7:20am)

390
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:54,594
(Getting up)

391
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:58,234
(Dong Il is up.)

392
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:02,234
(Dong Il goes out without noticing Woo Hee.)

393
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:07,744
(Dazed)

394
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:09,445
Gosh. It's cold in the morning.

395
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:10,775
(Chilly)

396
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:12,614
The wood is wet.

397
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:15,545
(The head of the house prepares to make a fire for the members.)

398
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:19,315
(Busy, glancing)

399
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:22,925
(I'll go out too.)

400
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:25,925
(Careful)

401
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:29,835
(Pushing)

402
00:16:29,964 --> 00:16:31,294
Did you have a good rest?

403
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:32,895
I had a good rest last night.

404
00:16:32,895 --> 00:16:34,165
- Did you?
- Yes.

405
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:37,905
(The air is fresh in the morning.)

406
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:42,105
(Hold on.)

407
00:16:42,675 --> 00:16:46,115
(Woo Hee takes a walk in the front yard energetically.)

408
00:16:46,244 --> 00:16:49,415
(She's already excited in the morning.)

409
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:52,885
(She took a short and energetic walk.)

410
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:56,954
You must be cold. I should make a fire.

411
00:16:57,825 --> 00:16:59,655
- Thank you.
- Right.

412
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:02,024
- May I help you with that?
- Okay.

413
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:05,635
(She closes the door in case the members are cold.)

414
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:08,264
Gosh. This is so nice.

415
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:10,135
(This morning is perfect for gazing at fire since it's gotten cold.)

416
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:13,575
- It's so nice.
- I know. Isn't it hot?

417
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,945
(Hyun Chul wakes up at the sound of Woo Hee and Dong Il talking.)

418
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:22,945
(Shall I go out too?)

419
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:29,925
(We were waiting for you.)

420
00:17:30,395 --> 00:17:31,855
- Did you sleep well?
- Good morning.

421
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:35,294
- How was it?
- It was nice.

422
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:38,595
- Is everyone up?
- They're still sleeping.

423
00:17:40,835 --> 00:17:42,464
I can't tell which one of us are the guests.

424
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:46,774
Have you done manual labor early in the morning, Hyun Chul?

425
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:49,774
- Yes, I think so.
- Really?

426
00:17:50,514 --> 00:17:52,675
Let's move three chairs. Let them move their own chairs.

427
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:56,385
(Squeaking)

428
00:17:56,385 --> 00:17:58,615
They should be up by now when it's so loud out here.

429
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,284
(Coughing)

430
00:18:02,554 --> 00:18:03,724
(Wake up.)

431
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:05,494
You think that would wake them up?

432
00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:08,024
(Glancing)

433
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:09,325
Just put it over there.

434
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:10,794
(He gazes at them fondly.)

435
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:12,564
Okay. Have a seat, Hyun Chul.

436
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:14,405
(Warm)

437
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:15,504
Hasn't it been a while...

438
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:16,835
since you warmed yourself by the fire early in the morning?

439
00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:19,075
- It's the first time in my life.
- Is that so?

440
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:20,875
You're having a lot of new experiences here.

441
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,175
Like Hee Won.

442
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:25,145
(He's cute.)

443
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:26,814
Let's listen to a song for this morning.

444
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:29,484
- I have a song request.
- What is it?

445
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:32,814
- The exercise song.
- What was that song?

446
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:34,925
- The morning exercise song?
- The exercise song?

447
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:37,895
(Is this it?)

448
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:39,355
- That's the song.
- That's right.

449
00:18:39,355 --> 00:18:40,494
Do you remember the moves?

450
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:42,365
(Stretching)

451
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:43,395
Right. I remember it.

452
00:18:43,395 --> 00:18:45,764
(They still remember the moves.)

453
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,135
Get up, Hyun Chul.

454
00:18:47,135 --> 00:18:49,804
You need to warm up your joints in the morning.

455
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:51,635
What was the next move?

456
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:53,605
- I don't think it is.
- No?

457
00:18:53,605 --> 00:18:54,804
(Shall I stretch my joints?)

458
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:56,405
My joints make a cracking sound.

459
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:58,575
(They make a lot of noise while exercising.)

460
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:00,544
It does help me warm up my body.

461
00:19:00,544 --> 00:19:03,145
(What is this noise?)

462
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:05,454
(Excited)

463
00:19:05,454 --> 00:19:06,754
- What are they doing?
- This is fun.

464
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:08,754
Like this.

465
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,155
That's right.

466
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:12,925
(Am I in a dream?)

467
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:15,964
(What?)

468
00:19:17,095 --> 00:19:18,294
What's the next move?

469
00:19:18,294 --> 00:19:19,935
(What are they doing?)

470
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:22,365
- You should do it like this.
- I see.

471
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:24,375
(It's a bizarre sight.)

472
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,004
Right. We need to stretch our arms.

473
00:19:26,004 --> 00:19:29,974
(They're exercising in the front yard.)

474
00:19:29,974 --> 00:19:31,675
- He's up.
- Who?

475
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:34,784
(Good morning, Hee Won!)

476
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:36,115
(Half asleep)

477
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:38,915
Hee Won.

478
00:19:38,915 --> 00:19:40,385
(Shy)

479
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:41,655
What time is it now?

480
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:43,895
It's 8:20am.

481
00:19:43,895 --> 00:19:45,325
(Grunting)

482
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:46,425
Gosh.

483
00:19:47,224 --> 00:19:49,264
Guys. What are you doing?

484
00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:51,695
What are you guys doing when we have guests here?

485
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:54,105
The sun is up.

486
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:55,534
(In haste)

487
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:57,734
(Myoung welcomes Hyun Chul as soon as he wakes up.)

488
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:58,774
Right.

489
00:19:58,774 --> 00:19:59,935
(Myoung hugs him all of a sudden.)

490
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,175
Just like that.

491
00:20:01,774 --> 00:20:03,645
(The members are all awake after making a big fuss.)

492
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:04,875
It's morning!

493
00:20:05,744 --> 00:20:09,185
(He might need some more time.)

494
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:12,615
(Hyun Chul suddenly walks somewhere.)

495
00:20:13,155 --> 00:20:16,155
(Looking around)

496
00:20:16,754 --> 00:20:18,195
(Exclaiming)

497
00:20:18,355 --> 00:20:19,494
I want to see it.

498
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:22,895
(He's looking somewhere for quite a while.)

499
00:20:22,895 --> 00:20:24,734
(Glancing)

500
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:26,564
It's very sunny, isn't it?

501
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:28,635
- It'll be great if we go there now.
- What?

502
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:30,204
- Now?
- Where?

503
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:34,105
It'll be great if we go to the forest.

504
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:36,575
(He's addicted to the forest.)

505
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:38,345
It'll be great if we go there now.

506
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:41,445
- Hyun Chul wants to go there now.
- No.

507
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:43,355
(Again?)

508
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:45,054
- No.
- Okay. Let's go.

509
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:46,585
All of a sudden?

510
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:48,554
(I just said it'd be great.)

511
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,195
Can I wear my sunglasses?

512
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:52,454
- Are you asking me?
- Yes.

513
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:54,825
Can I wear my sunglasses? What do you think?

514
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:57,564
(This morning, they will do what Hyun Chul tells them.)

515
00:20:57,564 --> 00:20:58,564
It's great.

516
00:20:58,564 --> 00:21:03,064
(Meanwhile, Hee Won is not aware of the situation.)

517
00:21:03,835 --> 00:21:04,835
Gosh. It's cold.

518
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:08,044
Let's go see the morning sun.

519
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:09,845
He looks so surprised.

520
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:12,714
(What?)

521
00:21:12,714 --> 00:21:14,585
Hyun Chul wants to go see the morning sun with us.

522
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:16,814
- Hee Won.
- Open your eyes.

523
00:21:17,185 --> 00:21:19,185
Let's go. Which way is it, Hyun Chul?

524
00:21:19,185 --> 00:21:20,454
- You should lead the way.
- Let's go.

525
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:24,554
- Which way should we go?
- We'll go this way.

526
00:21:26,254 --> 00:21:27,695
(You don't need to go far.)

527
00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:29,494
(When you walk along the trail behind our house,)

528
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:35,635
(you'll see the green forest.)

529
00:21:36,204 --> 00:21:39,234
(Hyun Chul takes the lead.)

530
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:42,075
- Hyun Chul is going by himself.
- Wait up, Hyun Chul.

531
00:21:42,075 --> 00:21:44,575
(- Wait up, Hyun Chul. - Hyun Chul is going by himself.)

532
00:21:44,814 --> 00:21:46,544
- Wait for us.
- You must be good at climbing.

533
00:21:46,544 --> 00:21:48,385
No. Let's go together.

534
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:49,714
(With the guide who walks a little fast...)

535
00:21:50,415 --> 00:21:51,754
Get a grip, sir.

536
00:21:52,284 --> 00:21:54,655
I can't open my eyes. I'm getting better now.

537
00:21:56,794 --> 00:21:59,695
- The weather is beautiful today.
- Right. The weather is so good.

538
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:03,195
(Last night, Hyun Chul and Woo Hee...)

539
00:22:03,325 --> 00:22:06,095
(walked along the dark trail.)

540
00:22:06,865 --> 00:22:09,865
- There are leaves on the ground.
- Right.

541
00:22:09,865 --> 00:22:11,774
- They're like cushions, - Right.

542
00:22:13,335 --> 00:22:14,974
so it's easier to walk.

543
00:22:14,974 --> 00:22:17,415
(There were fallen leaves on the trail last night.)

544
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,044
Hyun Chul. Did you sleep well in the tent?

545
00:22:20,044 --> 00:22:22,145
- Yes, I slept well.
- Really?

546
00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:23,415
I slept well.

547
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:26,454
You wanted to go to the forest first thing in the morning?

548
00:22:26,655 --> 00:22:27,655
(Well...)

549
00:22:27,954 --> 00:22:28,984
I'm sorry.

550
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:30,024
(I'm sorry.)

551
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:33,964
Hyun Chul came up with this plan by himself.

552
00:22:33,964 --> 00:22:36,524
(Chuckling)

553
00:22:37,435 --> 00:22:40,534
The grass is wet with early morning dew.

554
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:43,405
- So pretty.
- It looks pretty with dewdrops.

555
00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:46,335
This forest is beautiful.

556
00:22:46,335 --> 00:22:48,244
(They get to know the beauty of the forest in the morning.)

557
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:49,345
Awesome.

558
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:51,415
We've been to many places,

559
00:22:51,415 --> 00:22:53,244
but we've never climbed mountains in the morning.

560
00:22:54,214 --> 00:22:55,244
(They find happiness in an unexpected morning walk.)

561
00:22:55,244 --> 00:22:57,655
- This is so nice.
- Right? I love the sunlight.

562
00:22:57,655 --> 00:22:58,655
(They find happiness in an unexpected morning walk.)

563
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:00,454
Did you enjoy your walk last night, Hyun Chul?

564
00:23:01,085 --> 00:23:03,125
- Yes, I loved it.
- I see.

565
00:23:04,554 --> 00:23:06,524
It's tough, but you can do it.

566
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:08,264
- What are you talking about?
- Yes?

567
00:23:08,264 --> 00:23:09,264
(Meanwhile, Dong Il keeps teasing Hee Won.)

568
00:23:09,695 --> 00:23:12,135
- Hang in there.
- Okay.

569
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:14,905
All right. Go ahead.

570
00:23:14,905 --> 00:23:17,905
(Where's the place that they've finally arrived?)

571
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:19,905
(Amazed)

572
00:23:22,244 --> 00:23:24,214
You can see cypress trees from here. Look.

573
00:23:24,214 --> 00:23:26,675
(A different scenery unfolds before their eyes.)

574
00:23:27,014 --> 00:23:28,744
This is so beautiful.

575
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:31,585
(Woo Hee and Hyun Chul were here last night.)

576
00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:33,825
This is really nice.

577
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:36,125
(The thick forest full of green cypress trees)

578
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:40,595
Gosh. This cypress tree is very tall.

579
00:23:42,564 --> 00:23:45,464
This is so nice.

580
00:23:45,464 --> 00:23:48,234
(Trees rising high into the sky which they couldn't see last night)

581
00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:50,605
(The members walk in the thick cypress forest.)

582
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:53,804
- It's so beautiful.
- It smells good.

583
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:56,044
I love the smell of grass.

584
00:23:58,044 --> 00:24:02,244
(Full of phytoncide)

585
00:24:03,014 --> 00:24:05,284
(It's good to be here.)

586
00:24:05,284 --> 00:24:06,355
Since I'm here,

587
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:08,524
I should breathe in the fresh air.

588
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:14,925
(It's a good thing that we came here.)

589
00:24:16,224 --> 00:24:17,764
In a place like this,

590
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:20,764
we should have some morning coffee and honey rice cake.

591
00:24:20,764 --> 00:24:22,204
(Chuckling)

592
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:24,675
Some steamed rice cake with pumpkin, right?

593
00:24:25,075 --> 00:24:26,804
Gosh. We're going to enjoy our breakfast.

594
00:24:26,804 --> 00:24:29,974
(Let's go eat breakfast!)

595
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:36,845
(Since they took a walk, it's time to fill their stomachs.)

596
00:24:38,554 --> 00:24:41,355
I'll give it a try.

597
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:46,655
(Woo Hee seems busy as soon as she gets back.)

598
00:24:48,064 --> 00:24:50,024
(I want to cook this soup for you guys.)

599
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:51,595
(Are you going to cook something for us?)

600
00:24:52,095 --> 00:24:55,034
(When they cooked dinner yesterday,)

601
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:58,034
(Woo Hee promised to make shrimp jeotgal stew for breakfast.)

602
00:24:58,435 --> 00:25:02,044
(It's good to eat it when you feel cold or your throat is dry.)

603
00:25:03,204 --> 00:25:05,575
I made shrimp jeotgal stew with pumpkins recently.

604
00:25:05,575 --> 00:25:07,145
- You did? Really?
- Yes.

605
00:25:08,415 --> 00:25:11,714
What I'm going to make is what he just said.

606
00:25:12,484 --> 00:25:15,484
(What will the shrimp jeotgal stew they make taste like?)

607
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:17,754
Can I help you with anything?

608
00:25:18,554 --> 00:25:20,224
- Nothing.
- No, it's okay.

609
00:25:21,095 --> 00:25:24,165
(Dong Il and Hee Won get to rest comfortably.)

610
00:25:24,264 --> 00:25:27,204
They're such great guests. They are a bit high maintenance.

611
00:25:27,204 --> 00:25:28,204
I know, right?

612
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:30,704
(- They are a bit high maintenance. - I know, right?)

613
00:25:31,304 --> 00:25:32,534
I cook this often...

614
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:35,044
at home.

615
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,075
I have this all the time.

616
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:40,445
My mom cooks it very often.

617
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:42,044
I see.

618
00:25:42,044 --> 00:25:43,214
Do people eat this often in Gyeonggi Province?

619
00:25:43,214 --> 00:25:44,254
That must be it.

620
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,314
- You're right, Hyun Chul.
- Really?

621
00:25:46,314 --> 00:25:48,355
- Not many people know this dish.
- Really?

622
00:25:48,355 --> 00:25:49,385
(Shrimp jeotgal stew is very anticipated since it's unfamiliar.)

623
00:25:49,385 --> 00:25:50,395
Not as many as you'd think.

624
00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:51,395
(Shrimp jeotgal stew is very anticipated since it's unfamiliar.)

625
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:54,994
(First, put in the meat.)

626
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:58,964
(Add ginger to get rid of the smell of meat.)

627
00:25:59,264 --> 00:26:00,264
Put it in.

628
00:26:00,264 --> 00:26:02,865
(She adds it before the water boils to get rid of the smell of meat.)

629
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:05,875
She cooked for me when I was young.

630
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:09,375
My mom also cooked this often...

631
00:26:10,145 --> 00:26:12,345
Like this.

632
00:26:12,345 --> 00:26:13,645
(He cuts off the stalk end.)

633
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:15,284
Have you made it yourself?

634
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:17,915
(He cuts it in half.)

635
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:24,625
(Hyun Chul cuts it into small pieces.)

636
00:26:26,724 --> 00:26:29,264
Let it be delicious.

637
00:26:31,635 --> 00:26:33,734
- How do I cut the chili peppers?
- Chili peppers?

638
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:34,804
Cut it sideways.

639
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,075
- Do I cut them into big pieces?
- Yes.

640
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,274
Right. You're doing great.

641
00:26:40,075 --> 00:26:41,345
You cut them so well.

642
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:43,004
- I'm not good at it.
- No, I'm not.

643
00:26:44,514 --> 00:26:46,314
(Amazed)

644
00:26:47,145 --> 00:26:48,685
How is this shape?

645
00:26:48,685 --> 00:26:49,744
- It looks good.
- Isn't it a bit weird?

646
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:51,984
- Not at all.
- Don't think about its shape.

647
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:53,954
- It doesn't matter, Hyun Chul.
- But I don't like it.

648
00:26:53,954 --> 00:26:55,754
- It doesn't matter how it looks.
- Hyun Chul.

649
00:26:55,754 --> 00:26:58,655
Didn't you say you're not organized when you cook?

650
00:26:58,655 --> 00:26:59,994
But you seem like a perfectionist.

651
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:02,865
He cut the green onions and zucchini nicely.

652
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,994
- He really cut them nicely.
- Right.

653
00:27:05,994 --> 00:27:07,635
(Shy)

654
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:10,435
He's good with knives since he's close with Hee Won.

655
00:27:10,435 --> 00:27:11,435
(He's done prepping all the ingredients.)

656
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:14,145
(He's good at it.)

657
00:27:16,105 --> 00:27:18,544
Should I warm this up?

658
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:21,784
(The eye warmer that Woo Hee made)

659
00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:26,714
Please just forget about it.

660
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:30,625
Then...

661
00:27:31,554 --> 00:27:32,625
Well...

662
00:27:33,395 --> 00:27:35,724
Just microwave it for one minute.

663
00:27:35,724 --> 00:27:37,695
It could be cooked if you heat it up for a long time.

664
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:39,635
(The reason why Woo Hee is being so anxious is...)

665
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:45,534
(She was anxious even before she gave them her gift.)

666
00:27:47,645 --> 00:27:48,675
But it's lame.

667
00:27:48,675 --> 00:27:51,075
(It's lame.)

668
00:27:51,814 --> 00:27:52,974
(This is an eye warmer.)

669
00:27:52,974 --> 00:27:53,984
(Exclaiming)

670
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:57,014
(Impressed)

671
00:27:57,754 --> 00:27:59,615
(There are red beans in it.)

672
00:28:00,284 --> 00:28:03,925
(Red beans can retain heat, so they are used to make warmers.)

673
00:28:04,954 --> 00:28:07,165
(What if we microwave it for more than 1 minute?)

674
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,264
(Wouldn't the red beans become edible?)

675
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:11,635
(That's possible.)

676
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:15,635
(It will be okay.)

677
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:19,835
(He can't help sniffing the warmer.)

678
00:28:20,135 --> 00:28:22,375
(Sniffing)

679
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:25,415
(Hey.)

680
00:28:26,044 --> 00:28:28,544
(Laughing)

681
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:30,915
- It's cooked, isn't it?
- No, it's not.

682
00:28:30,915 --> 00:28:32,484
- Let me see.
- There's nothing in it.

683
00:28:32,685 --> 00:28:33,954
- Give it to me.
- Oh, right.

684
00:28:33,954 --> 00:28:36,085
- Give it to me.
- Right. We need to see if it works.

685
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:37,554
(She hands it to Dong Il reluctantly.)

686
00:28:37,554 --> 00:28:38,954
That's an eye warmer.

687
00:28:38,954 --> 00:28:40,095
(Dong Il takes it to his nose too.)

688
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:42,195
Gosh. It smells like beans.

689
00:28:43,095 --> 00:28:45,264
- The red beans are cooked.
- Let me see.

690
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:48,405
Heat it up a bit longer. It's still not warm.

691
00:28:48,405 --> 00:28:50,435
- But if we microwave it longer...
- Just try it.

692
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:52,935
- If we microwave it longer, - The thing is...

693
00:28:52,935 --> 00:28:55,375
- it'll be cooked.
- I used a quilted cloth for this.

694
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:57,375
Just do 2 or 3.

695
00:28:57,814 --> 00:28:59,744
Three if you can, but two would be enough.

696
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:03,014
- Let's do that while they cook.
- That sounds good.

697
00:29:05,655 --> 00:29:08,254
I should've used ordinary cloth.

698
00:29:08,254 --> 00:29:11,895
But I wanted to make the ones with different colors,

699
00:29:12,155 --> 00:29:15,724
so I used quilted cloth.

700
00:29:15,895 --> 00:29:18,764
I love the texture and colors.

701
00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:20,905
That's what I wanted, but...

702
00:29:21,435 --> 00:29:23,304
I have one for you too. Do you want it?

703
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:24,605
(Nice!)

704
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:26,474
Take this.

705
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:28,605
- I sewed it myself. Put it in here.
- Goodness.

706
00:29:31,214 --> 00:29:33,115
(I love it.)

707
00:29:33,115 --> 00:29:35,814
But don't use it. It could be cooked.

708
00:29:36,585 --> 00:29:38,454
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

709
00:29:40,254 --> 00:29:41,325
What happened?

710
00:29:42,454 --> 00:29:44,524
(The eye warmers are heated up right on time.)

711
00:29:44,524 --> 00:29:45,524
They're cooked.

712
00:29:46,794 --> 00:29:48,024
Gosh. What to do?

713
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:49,994
Woo Hee.

714
00:29:49,994 --> 00:29:52,935
Gosh. It's because I used the wrong cloth.

715
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:55,504
I wanted to make it pretty,

716
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:57,905
- so I chose the thick one.
- For now...

717
00:29:57,905 --> 00:30:00,274
But it could become a bit wet.

718
00:30:01,044 --> 00:30:04,615
(What will Woo Hee's eye warmers be like?)

719
00:30:05,974 --> 00:30:09,185
(They put the warmers on their eyes.)

720
00:30:09,445 --> 00:30:11,115
I'm sorry, guys.

721
00:30:11,115 --> 00:30:12,885
(She apologizes as soon as they use them.)

722
00:30:13,685 --> 00:30:17,524
Gosh. It smells like hoppang.

723
00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:19,754
- Gosh. I can smell the red beans.
- I know.

724
00:30:19,754 --> 00:30:22,224
(The eye warmer smells savory when it's heated.)

725
00:30:23,964 --> 00:30:27,405
It'll make you so warm if you use it on your neck in winter.

726
00:30:27,405 --> 00:30:28,435
That's right.

727
00:30:28,435 --> 00:30:29,865
(They can feel the heat from the red beans on their eyes.)

728
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:32,375
- This is nice, Dong Il.
- It's warm.

729
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,974
- Right. It's effective.
- I like this, Woo Hee.

730
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:37,714
- My eyes feel so warm.
- Thank you.

731
00:30:37,714 --> 00:30:38,945
(Thank you.)

732
00:30:40,544 --> 00:30:42,085
You are too kind.

733
00:30:42,085 --> 00:30:45,284
My eyes feel warmer, and it whets my appetite.

734
00:30:47,284 --> 00:30:50,054
(Laughing)

735
00:30:50,484 --> 00:30:52,095
Hoppang really is the best winter snack.

736
00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:53,125
(As a side effect, their appetite has exploded.)

737
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:54,325
Oh, my.

738
00:30:56,595 --> 00:30:57,595
Gosh.

739
00:30:59,095 --> 00:31:01,464
(Hoping the stew will be better)

740
00:31:02,304 --> 00:31:04,234
Do you want to season it?

741
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:06,435
I like my food salty though.

742
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:08,905
But I eat really little salt.

743
00:31:08,905 --> 00:31:10,605
I don't think you like the way I season it.

744
00:31:12,014 --> 00:31:14,214
How do they like their food?

745
00:31:15,385 --> 00:31:16,484
- Salty...
- They like it salty.

746
00:31:17,554 --> 00:31:20,585
You can do what you normally do, then.

747
00:31:20,585 --> 00:31:23,254
(Hyun Chul is nervous even before tasting it.)

748
00:31:24,395 --> 00:31:25,524
Should we take it off now?

749
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,294
In 1, 2, 3.

750
00:31:31,994 --> 00:31:36,564
(Could the eye warmer have helped?)

751
00:31:38,204 --> 00:31:39,835
(Blinking)

752
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:41,575
(Is it effective?)

753
00:31:42,345 --> 00:31:43,774
I think I got double eyelids.

754
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:45,845
Look.

755
00:31:46,314 --> 00:31:47,345
Look at me.

756
00:31:48,415 --> 00:31:50,284
Your eyes got so...

757
00:31:50,484 --> 00:31:52,054
skinny.

758
00:31:55,524 --> 00:31:56,554
How do I look?

759
00:31:56,954 --> 00:31:58,454
I think I look the same.

760
00:31:58,454 --> 00:31:59,825
Did I get double eyelids?

761
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:04,734
(Back to his old good-looking days)

762
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:06,935
You got double eyelids.

763
00:32:06,935 --> 00:32:08,764
- It's red beans double eyelids.
- Right.

764
00:32:08,764 --> 00:32:10,034
It's so funny.

765
00:32:11,905 --> 00:32:13,105
(Getting up)

766
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:15,575
Woo Hee, I got double eyelids, right?

767
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:17,845
Are you opening them wide on purpose?

768
00:32:17,845 --> 00:32:19,145
(The way he looks makes you back away from him.)

769
00:32:19,345 --> 00:32:21,514
What happened? Your eyes look different.

770
00:32:21,514 --> 00:32:22,585
(Checking the effects of the hot back)

771
00:32:23,185 --> 00:32:24,185
Am I imagining it?

772
00:32:24,185 --> 00:32:25,254
(Laughing)

773
00:32:25,655 --> 00:32:27,155
- Is it that weird?
- No. It's fine.

774
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:30,484
Is it so weird that it's making you laugh at me?

775
00:32:30,484 --> 00:32:31,754
How do I look?

776
00:32:32,925 --> 00:32:33,994
(Laughing)

777
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,195
- Your eyes got red.
- I did, didn't it?

778
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:38,935
I think they got dyed with the red bean color.

779
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:40,665
You said it's red beans, right?

780
00:32:41,905 --> 00:32:43,234
Do my eyes look red?

781
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:46,135
(It has a mysterious effect of making them more handsome.)

782
00:32:46,135 --> 00:32:47,675
They do look red.

783
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:49,405
- Right?
- So funny.

784
00:32:49,405 --> 00:32:51,415
But I think it feels more refreshing now.

785
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:54,685
I didn't know red beans are effective on me.

786
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:55,714
(Making the eyes look less puffy with the hot pack)

787
00:32:55,714 --> 00:32:56,714
It's nice.

788
00:32:57,145 --> 00:32:59,355
Let's season it at the end.

789
00:32:59,355 --> 00:33:00,984
(Finishing up the stew outside)

790
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:03,125
(Adding the vegetables)

791
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,425
Be careful not to let it splash on you.

792
00:33:07,764 --> 00:33:08,825
Should we add the shrimp jeotgal?

793
00:33:09,224 --> 00:33:11,034
Let's do what you've always done.

794
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:12,835
Do it as you have done.

795
00:33:14,304 --> 00:33:18,274
(Adding plenty of shrimp jeotgal to suit the elder guys' preference)

796
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:20,945
Is this the shrimp jeotgal?

797
00:33:22,974 --> 00:33:24,744
(Let us talk about this shrimp jeotgal.)

798
00:33:25,974 --> 00:33:29,515
(It's a special shrimp jeotgal acquired from a cave.)

799
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:33,655
(It made Myoung's eyes open wide.)

800
00:33:34,484 --> 00:33:37,325
(It's the shrimp jeotgal from the cave.)

801
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:42,265
(How amazing will this shrimp jeotgal stew be?)

802
00:33:43,894 --> 00:33:47,805
(Hyun Chul checks if it's well-seasoned.)

803
00:33:49,334 --> 00:33:50,774
(Laughing)

804
00:33:51,805 --> 00:33:53,975
You seemed to add a lot. But are you going for more?

805
00:33:53,975 --> 00:33:57,515
- Yes.
- Just pour a lot in it.

806
00:33:57,515 --> 00:33:58,544
(Anxious)

807
00:33:58,544 --> 00:34:00,044
- Don't feel anxious.
- It's fine.

808
00:34:00,475 --> 00:34:02,914
You can add more if you need to.

809
00:34:02,914 --> 00:34:05,455
You could add more shrimp jeotgal at the end too.

810
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:09,055
(It's for the elder guys who love salty food.)

811
00:34:10,624 --> 00:34:11,995
(Is it okay?)

812
00:34:14,394 --> 00:34:20,234
(He must feel under pressure and keeps checking.)

813
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,135
(How many times is he going to try it?)

814
00:34:24,434 --> 00:34:26,205
(Slurping)

815
00:34:29,305 --> 00:34:30,374
Try it.

816
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,874
(A super detailed way to season food)

817
00:34:33,874 --> 00:34:35,814
(Tasting)

818
00:34:37,115 --> 00:34:38,115
How is it?

819
00:34:39,254 --> 00:34:40,285
I like it.

820
00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:42,925
Say it with confidence.

821
00:34:42,925 --> 00:34:45,294
If you feel unsure about it, we won't eat it.

822
00:34:46,225 --> 00:34:48,195
- It's good I think.
- Okay.

823
00:34:48,394 --> 00:34:50,064
Is it good? Then, that's good.

824
00:34:50,564 --> 00:34:51,635
Is it just perfect?

825
00:34:51,635 --> 00:34:54,095
(Myoung is setting up the side dishes.)

826
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:59,334
(Woo Hee's radish green kimchi that her mom made)

827
00:35:01,305 --> 00:35:04,075
(Four delicious kimchis are ready.)

828
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:08,015
(She is taking something else out too.)

829
00:35:10,044 --> 00:35:12,515
Mom made these for me right before I got here...

830
00:35:12,515 --> 00:35:14,254
when I told her I'm coming here.

831
00:35:15,825 --> 00:35:17,184
Look at that crab.

832
00:35:17,955 --> 00:35:19,024
Here's the crab.

833
00:35:19,955 --> 00:35:22,595
- I need to take it out at once.
- Look at the marinated crab.

834
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:26,664
That's insane. That looks terribly good.

835
00:35:26,865 --> 00:35:28,905
I hope it's good.

836
00:35:29,535 --> 00:35:32,035
- Look at the crab.
- I know, right?

837
00:35:33,104 --> 00:35:34,905
(Loving their reactions)

838
00:35:36,745 --> 00:35:39,374
(It's filled with roe.)

839
00:35:39,714 --> 00:35:40,714
Crab.

840
00:35:40,814 --> 00:35:41,885
Crab.

841
00:35:41,984 --> 00:35:43,015
Crab.

842
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,455
Crab shape.

843
00:35:46,455 --> 00:35:49,785
(Plating them nicely on a plate)

844
00:35:49,785 --> 00:35:50,825
Look at the roe.

845
00:35:50,955 --> 00:35:52,955
- I know, right?
- It looks good.

846
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:55,664
It's not just good. It's a specialty.

847
00:35:56,394 --> 00:35:59,794
That soy sauce would taste amazing with the laver.

848
00:36:00,195 --> 00:36:01,205
It's the best.

849
00:36:03,234 --> 00:36:04,604
It looks so good.

850
00:36:06,805 --> 00:36:10,245
(Hyun Chul, who fell in love with the marinated crab,)

851
00:36:11,015 --> 00:36:13,314
(starts chopping in silence.)

852
00:36:19,484 --> 00:36:21,155
(Impressed)

853
00:36:21,155 --> 00:36:22,584
As expected.

854
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:24,595
Please help me with that.

855
00:36:24,595 --> 00:36:26,655
(Hyun Chul makes a clever contribution.)

856
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:28,024
Let's make it look pretty.

857
00:36:28,124 --> 00:36:30,095
- I'm in trouble.
- What's wrong?

858
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:33,064
I'll eat so much for breakfast.

859
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:36,035
(Thanks to Woo Hee, they'll have a hearty breakfast.)

860
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:37,705
And then, I'm done!

861
00:36:37,705 --> 00:36:40,274
(Done setting up the crabs)

862
00:36:42,144 --> 00:36:43,305
(Placing carefully)

863
00:36:43,305 --> 00:36:46,274
(The crabs stick out of the plate.)

864
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:49,144
- We have so many crabs.
- Here they come.

865
00:36:49,745 --> 00:36:52,854
Gosh. What is all this?

866
00:36:54,624 --> 00:36:56,925
The breakfast is crazy.

867
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,455
(Pleased)

868
00:36:59,455 --> 00:37:00,655
Thank you for the work.

869
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:03,495
- Let's eat now.
- Help yourselves.

870
00:37:04,535 --> 00:37:06,964
(Let's try the delicious breakfast prepared by the guests.)

871
00:37:06,964 --> 00:37:08,265
Thank you for the food.

872
00:37:09,035 --> 00:37:12,374
For the past two days, I've been eating a ridiculous amount of food.

873
00:37:12,535 --> 00:37:14,135
(Singing)

874
00:37:14,135 --> 00:37:15,774
Thank you for the food.

875
00:37:15,774 --> 00:37:17,874
(The breakfast makes him hum automatically.)

876
00:37:18,345 --> 00:37:19,714
(So excited)

877
00:37:19,714 --> 00:37:20,914
Enjoy.

878
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,285
I hope it's good.

879
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:25,254
(Slurping the stew first to warm their bodies up)

880
00:37:25,254 --> 00:37:26,914
- It's so good.
- Is it okay?

881
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:35,095
Is it okay, Hyun Chul? I hope it's okay.

882
00:37:35,624 --> 00:37:38,794
(Woo Hee tries a bite while feeling worried.)

883
00:37:38,794 --> 00:37:41,405
I love how it's seasoned.

884
00:37:41,705 --> 00:37:42,734
(I'm glad.)

885
00:37:42,734 --> 00:37:45,175
- He seasoned it really well.
- I agree.

886
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:51,175
Is it okay?

887
00:37:51,175 --> 00:37:53,044
The stew is really tasty.

888
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:56,945
I like having huge chunks of meat...

889
00:37:56,945 --> 00:37:58,115
in here. It's good.

890
00:37:58,455 --> 00:38:00,584
(There are pieces of pork in the shrimp jeotgal stew.)

891
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:02,225
- It's nice, right?
- It really is.

892
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:06,055
(Loving the shrimp jeotgal stew)

893
00:38:07,155 --> 00:38:09,225
(Slurping)

894
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,725
It's good.

895
00:38:12,195 --> 00:38:14,234
- It has a deeper flavor.
- It does.

896
00:38:14,234 --> 00:38:16,164
(Everyone likes the shrimp jeotgal stew.)

897
00:38:16,705 --> 00:38:17,934
I must get greedy with this.

898
00:38:18,934 --> 00:38:19,975
I must.

899
00:38:19,975 --> 00:38:23,044
(The big soy sauce marinated crab got him excited.)

900
00:38:24,814 --> 00:38:26,414
Please eat the one with plenty of roe.

901
00:38:26,414 --> 00:38:27,414
This one is great.

902
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:31,044
Look at that. It's filled up with meat and innards.

903
00:38:31,044 --> 00:38:32,115
(The soy sauce marinated crab is filled with so much meat and roe.)

904
00:38:32,115 --> 00:38:33,354
It's indescribable.

905
00:38:34,055 --> 00:38:35,055
(Impressed!)

906
00:38:36,885 --> 00:38:38,794
(Continually getting amazed)

907
00:38:39,794 --> 00:38:40,995
(More meat keeps coming out magically)

908
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:43,064
It keeps coming out without a limit.

909
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:47,495
(From one crab shell)

910
00:38:48,004 --> 00:38:50,164
I got this much from one crab shell.

911
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:51,535
(Bountiful)

912
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:55,044
- It has so much roe.
- It's incredible.

913
00:38:55,905 --> 00:38:57,374
(It's mouth-watering.)

914
00:38:57,675 --> 00:38:59,675
This is insane.

915
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:04,084
(Pleased)

916
00:39:04,455 --> 00:39:07,184
(Here is the roasted laver.)

917
00:39:08,184 --> 00:39:09,725
This is the real deal.

918
00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:12,624
(He sure knows how to make food taste good.)

919
00:39:13,254 --> 00:39:15,195
(This is it.)

920
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:19,164
(Myoung also tries a bite like the other guys have.)

921
00:39:19,164 --> 00:39:20,964
I love how you made the stew too.

922
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:24,635
I'm glad.

923
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,874
(Taking a bite of the bugak)

924
00:39:29,044 --> 00:39:30,874
This bugak is incredible.

925
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,544
It's good.

926
00:39:34,274 --> 00:39:36,314
(Crunchy)

927
00:39:38,055 --> 00:39:40,414
- I love Cheongyang chili bugak.
- Really?

928
00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:43,254
I thought you'd like it since you like spicy food.

929
00:39:45,024 --> 00:39:46,055
(Bugak 1)

930
00:39:46,655 --> 00:39:47,725
(Bugak 2)

931
00:39:48,294 --> 00:39:49,524
(Bugak 3)

932
00:39:50,464 --> 00:39:51,535
(Bugak 4)

933
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:52,995
(Bugak 5)

934
00:39:54,064 --> 00:39:55,604
It's insane.

935
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:59,004
(I can't stop eating this.)

936
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:01,805
- You should pack some home.
- Sorry?

937
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:03,445
You can bring some home I brought a lot.

938
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:04,515
Sounds good.

939
00:40:06,945 --> 00:40:09,745
Woo Hee, I like all of your homecooked meals.

940
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:12,385
The bugak and everything.

941
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:14,414
It's really the best.

942
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:17,624
(The members get treated well from the guests.)

943
00:40:18,555 --> 00:40:19,754
The crab is so good.

944
00:40:21,564 --> 00:40:23,925
(The crab...)

945
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:25,734
(makes his eyes open wide.)

946
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:27,334
Myoung looks more vibrant.

947
00:40:30,035 --> 00:40:31,064
You have to boil it.

948
00:40:31,064 --> 00:40:33,035
(He digs in to show a real eating show.)

949
00:40:34,705 --> 00:40:39,515
(Myoung is eating like a horse without a stop.)

950
00:40:39,515 --> 00:40:40,515
(Staring)

951
00:40:40,515 --> 00:40:41,714
You're really enjoying it, aren't you?

952
00:40:43,314 --> 00:40:45,854
- I'm eating like a pig.
- No, you are not.

953
00:40:48,624 --> 00:40:51,894
(I want another bowl of rice.)

954
00:40:52,155 --> 00:40:55,624
(Scraping)

955
00:40:57,524 --> 00:40:59,434
This is too little.

956
00:41:01,734 --> 00:41:06,475
(Still, he continues to eat.)

957
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:09,945
I can see how much you love eating,

958
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:12,374
but I feel bad that you have to control your diet when you work.

959
00:41:16,615 --> 00:41:19,854
(Myoung's hand is constantly moving as he is busy eating.)

960
00:41:20,015 --> 00:41:23,425
Seriously, how much rice do you eat?

961
00:41:24,555 --> 00:41:26,124
(I love food.)

962
00:41:26,124 --> 00:41:27,964
You really enjoy eating.

963
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:32,794
I remember that even when we met Myoung for the first time,

964
00:41:32,794 --> 00:41:35,265
he enjoyed the meal to the fullest.

965
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:39,635
He appreciates the food whenever he eats.

966
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:41,544
I haven't seen anyone who enjoys eating like him.

967
00:41:41,544 --> 00:41:42,644
Look at Hyun Chul.

968
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:44,644
He seems he is forcing himself to eat.

969
00:41:44,845 --> 00:41:45,845
(Me?)

970
00:41:45,845 --> 00:41:47,274
Come on, he is enjoying the meal too.

971
00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:51,484
Actually, he eats quietly but finishes the whole thing.

972
00:41:52,115 --> 00:41:55,385
(The scraping sound shows that he almost finished his soup.)

973
00:41:56,925 --> 00:41:59,455
(It's fun to tease Hyun Chul.)

974
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:02,894
(Staring)

975
00:42:03,225 --> 00:42:04,765
- Hyun Chul.
- Yes?

976
00:42:04,765 --> 00:42:06,064
What is your dream?

977
00:42:06,064 --> 00:42:09,334
Anything you want to do or you want to be?

978
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:10,734
(All of a sudden...)

979
00:42:10,734 --> 00:42:12,774
(my dream?)

980
00:42:13,175 --> 00:42:15,104
I just want to eat a lot of delicious food...

981
00:42:15,104 --> 00:42:16,845
- That's your dream?
- and to travel around.

982
00:42:18,714 --> 00:42:20,345
I want to travel a lot.

983
00:42:20,745 --> 00:42:23,144
I see. Anything else? Just traveling?

984
00:42:23,345 --> 00:42:25,785
- Traveling and a house with a yard.
- Okay.

985
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:28,124
(Nodding)

986
00:42:28,124 --> 00:42:29,124
Yes, that's what I want.

987
00:42:29,425 --> 00:42:31,394
So your dream is to be a member of House on Wheels.

988
00:42:31,854 --> 00:42:32,925
(Is he a prospective new member?)

989
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,055
Exactly. Because we travel around...

990
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:35,664
Yes, we travel around and we eat delicious food.

991
00:42:36,825 --> 00:42:37,925
This is perfect for him,

992
00:42:37,925 --> 00:42:39,865
because we travel around and we eat a lot.

993
00:42:39,865 --> 00:42:41,405
- Absolutely.
- Right?

994
00:42:41,405 --> 00:42:46,274
I think if I take his place, I'll do great.

995
00:42:48,144 --> 00:42:53,115
(None of them expected that he would be so straightforward.)

996
00:42:53,644 --> 00:42:54,714
Great.

997
00:42:54,714 --> 00:42:55,885
(He feels dazed because of what Hyun Chul said.)

998
00:42:55,885 --> 00:42:57,084
He's so good, seriously.

999
00:42:57,245 --> 00:42:58,314
- Dong Il.
- He is good.

1000
00:42:58,314 --> 00:42:59,484
It's been fun.

1001
00:43:00,184 --> 00:43:04,155
(They have finished their breakfast with laughter.)

1002
00:43:04,794 --> 00:43:06,124
Do we have soy sauce marinated crab left?

1003
00:43:06,124 --> 00:43:08,564
- Yes, that and...
- Let's eat it by the sea.

1004
00:43:08,564 --> 00:43:09,995
(Let's go to the seaside and eat it there.)

1005
00:43:11,164 --> 00:43:14,595
(Where will be the front yard for today?)

1006
00:43:15,035 --> 00:43:18,035
We will set up the house right in front of the sea,

1007
00:43:18,535 --> 00:43:21,035
and we will do fishing right in front of our house.

1008
00:43:21,035 --> 00:43:22,205
- We'll do long surf casting.
- So we are leaving?

1009
00:43:22,205 --> 00:43:23,774
Yes, we're going to do some surf casting.

1010
00:43:23,774 --> 00:43:25,015
(We're going to the South Sea?)

1011
00:43:25,015 --> 00:43:26,714
That's awesome.

1012
00:43:28,544 --> 00:43:36,455
(The great times that they spent in the Mount Joowol)

1013
00:43:38,555 --> 00:43:42,794
- I loved it here. I'll miss this.
- Me too.

1014
00:43:43,024 --> 00:43:44,095
Totally.

1015
00:43:44,695 --> 00:43:50,635
(Shall we go to the new front yard with the sea in front?)

1016
00:43:54,774 --> 00:43:56,544
(They are heading to the new front yard in the great weather.)

1017
00:43:56,544 --> 00:44:00,714
The weather has been perfect for the two days.

1018
00:44:02,184 --> 00:44:04,955
(Gazing out)

1019
00:44:05,484 --> 00:44:07,414
- Look. It's so beautiful.
- I think we're going a little fast.

1020
00:44:07,414 --> 00:44:08,455
- Look there.
- Well...

1021
00:44:08,455 --> 00:44:10,825
(What is Woo Hee pointing at?)

1022
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:13,524
(Along the way next to the running house,)

1023
00:44:13,524 --> 00:44:18,894
(there is a wave of green trees.)

1024
00:44:19,535 --> 00:44:21,934
Isn't it very beautiful that all different trees are mixed?

1025
00:44:23,564 --> 00:44:28,874
(Each and every tree in the woods is in a different shape and color.)

1026
00:44:30,004 --> 00:44:34,245
The heights are all different, and the shapes are all different,

1027
00:44:34,945 --> 00:44:36,414
- but it is beautiful.
- Right.

1028
00:44:38,354 --> 00:44:40,914
It's the same with people. We all look different too.

1029
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:45,854
The world is beautiful as the people living in it are all different.

1030
00:44:47,555 --> 00:44:50,095
So being true to myself...

1031
00:44:50,664 --> 00:44:52,794
and being myself the way I am is the most beautiful thing, I think.

1032
00:44:53,135 --> 00:44:54,834
- I agree.
- Yes.

1033
00:44:56,035 --> 00:45:00,975
(The wonderful scenery gives them a lot to think about.)

1034
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:04,575
Who hasn't done fishing before?

1035
00:45:04,575 --> 00:45:06,345
- I haven't.
- Me neither.

1036
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:07,515
The three of you?

1037
00:45:07,515 --> 00:45:08,544
- Yes.
- Yes.

1038
00:45:08,644 --> 00:45:09,984
(The three of them have no experience in fishing.)

1039
00:45:09,984 --> 00:45:12,684
- How come?
- I want to try it.

1040
00:45:13,015 --> 00:45:15,984
The only thing I'm thinking about is I'm going to take first place.

1041
00:45:15,984 --> 00:45:17,385
- Really?
- Yes.

1042
00:45:17,955 --> 00:45:19,055
One, two.

1043
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,664
So what rank are you expecting to get?

1044
00:45:21,664 --> 00:45:23,024
(Myoung predicts that he will be in...)

1045
00:45:23,464 --> 00:45:25,794
I want to be in one of the top three.

1046
00:45:25,794 --> 00:45:28,334
- Really?
- Everyone is ambitious.

1047
00:45:28,334 --> 00:45:29,365
You think so?

1048
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:31,064
What about you, Woo Hee?

1049
00:45:31,504 --> 00:45:36,004
I think I'll come in third place out of all of us.

1050
00:45:36,004 --> 00:45:38,575
- Third place?
- Third place.

1051
00:45:38,774 --> 00:45:41,615
I think either Hee Won or I will be in last place.

1052
00:45:42,684 --> 00:45:44,214
(Me?)

1053
00:45:44,214 --> 00:45:46,584
Look at his face.

1054
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:49,825
What do you think about my opinion?

1055
00:45:49,825 --> 00:45:51,024
- I agree with you.
- His facial expression was so...

1056
00:45:51,024 --> 00:45:52,095
Really?

1057
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:55,294
I think, without having to ask, Hyun Chul wants first place.

1058
00:45:55,894 --> 00:45:57,365
Aren't I right?

1059
00:45:58,434 --> 00:46:00,135
- Well, I think...
- Right?

1060
00:46:01,294 --> 00:46:03,035
(Curious)

1061
00:46:03,205 --> 00:46:06,004
(Very curious)

1062
00:46:06,004 --> 00:46:07,205
- I think...
- Right?

1063
00:46:08,075 --> 00:46:10,245
Fishing isn't important to me,

1064
00:46:10,245 --> 00:46:12,575
because I am already with you, Dong Il and Hee Won.

1065
00:46:12,575 --> 00:46:14,475
What has gotten into you?

1066
00:46:14,475 --> 00:46:15,584
Gosh.

1067
00:46:15,584 --> 00:46:18,615
- Look at him.
- Suddenly, what happened to you?

1068
00:46:19,515 --> 00:46:21,555
Because I was already able to "fish up" a great connection.

1069
00:46:21,555 --> 00:46:23,354
(Shocked)

1070
00:46:26,754 --> 00:46:29,024
- I thought I knew who you are.
- Maybe he should take your place.

1071
00:46:29,024 --> 00:46:30,394
- Really?
- What?

1072
00:46:31,894 --> 00:46:34,035
- I can see it. It's right there.
- Right.

1073
00:46:34,635 --> 00:46:36,035
What a unique place.

1074
00:46:36,035 --> 00:46:38,274
The field of reeds lies in front of the sea.

1075
00:46:39,805 --> 00:46:41,945
This is different.

1076
00:46:42,874 --> 00:46:44,075
From here...

1077
00:46:45,175 --> 00:46:47,714
(Making a powerful right turn)

1078
00:46:48,175 --> 00:46:51,044
(What kind of scenery would they see from the house today?)

1079
00:46:52,615 --> 00:46:54,484
(Exclaiming)

1080
00:46:54,754 --> 00:46:57,124
- Is this real?
- My goodness. What is this place?

1081
00:46:57,925 --> 00:47:01,095
- This is just unbelievable.
- I have to be very careful.

1082
00:47:01,455 --> 00:47:03,664
(His eyes are wide open.)

1083
00:47:04,964 --> 00:47:09,635
(As soon as they make a right turn,)

1084
00:47:11,135 --> 00:47:14,405
(the front yard with the golden grass appears.)

1085
00:47:17,705 --> 00:47:19,914
What is this place?

1086
00:47:21,644 --> 00:47:23,584
This is marvelous.

1087
00:47:23,584 --> 00:47:26,055
- This is amazing.
- Oh, my goodness.

1088
00:47:26,055 --> 00:47:27,385
(They are speechless as they see the view.)

1089
00:47:27,754 --> 00:47:29,684
(Is he a goat?)

1090
00:47:29,854 --> 00:47:32,024
(Exclaiming)

1091
00:47:32,495 --> 00:47:33,695
(The path is picturesquely situated right next to the sea.)

1092
00:47:33,695 --> 00:47:36,564
Seriously, this place is superb.

1093
00:47:36,564 --> 00:47:39,394
(As they go in further along the path,)

1094
00:47:40,064 --> 00:47:42,164
(the scenery of the clean sea in Boseong unfolds.)

1095
00:47:42,164 --> 00:47:44,535
The scenery is extraordinary.

1096
00:47:44,535 --> 00:47:46,004
This is awesome.

1097
00:47:48,205 --> 00:47:51,745
(It takes only ten steps from the house to the sea.)

1098
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:55,184
(The sea is so close that it seems it is right outside the window.)

1099
00:47:55,484 --> 00:48:00,214
(Today, the South Sea is their front yard.)

1100
00:48:01,484 --> 00:48:04,385
(During the daytime, the sea with the Deungnyang Island shines,)

1101
00:48:04,385 --> 00:48:08,464
(and the sun sets in purple as it gets dark.)

1102
00:48:08,794 --> 00:48:12,095
(As the sea is right in front of the house,)

1103
00:48:12,294 --> 00:48:15,905
(they can take as much time as they want when fishing.)

1104
00:48:16,365 --> 00:48:18,334
(Today, we live...)

1105
00:48:18,334 --> 00:48:22,544
(right in front of the sea in Boseong.)

1106
00:48:22,845 --> 00:48:27,515
(At this place with the open sea,)

1107
00:48:27,945 --> 00:48:32,055
(would you like to join us today?)

1108
00:48:37,055 --> 00:48:38,655
This is crazy.

1109
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:41,425
(Literally, the house is right in front of the sea.)

1110
00:48:41,425 --> 00:48:43,894
The view is splendid.

1111
00:48:45,794 --> 00:48:48,865
- This is so...
- I'm speechless.

1112
00:48:48,865 --> 00:48:50,765
(The sea is shining in front of their eyes,)

1113
00:48:51,874 --> 00:48:53,175
Look. That boat is passing.

1114
00:48:53,175 --> 00:48:54,934
(and the beautiful ridges are seen from where they are standing.)

1115
00:48:55,405 --> 00:48:59,314
(The beautiful scenery is seen from the window too.)

1116
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:01,175
This is so great.

1117
00:49:03,184 --> 00:49:06,214
It's so beautiful here.

1118
00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:09,624
(In awe)

1119
00:49:10,254 --> 00:49:12,394
- This is by far the best.
- Really?

1120
00:49:12,394 --> 00:49:13,425
I love it here.

1121
00:49:14,024 --> 00:49:16,825
Dong Il, are we doing fishing right over there?

1122
00:49:16,825 --> 00:49:18,024
- Surf casting?
- Yes, right over there.

1123
00:49:18,794 --> 00:49:21,035
- Are you sure you'll be okay?
- Of course.

1124
00:49:21,595 --> 00:49:23,464
Because we can cast the rod and relax...

1125
00:49:24,635 --> 00:49:26,035
("Monthly Fishing" on House on Wheels 3)

1126
00:49:26,035 --> 00:49:27,334
with surf casting.

1127
00:49:28,504 --> 00:49:32,214
(Surf casting is done by making a long-distance cast.)

1128
00:49:32,475 --> 00:49:35,945
(A sinker is tied at the end of the fishing line,)

1129
00:49:35,945 --> 00:49:39,655
(so that you can make a long cast by using the weight of the sinker.)

1130
00:49:39,885 --> 00:49:43,655
(You can wait for a bite with the rod placed on a holder.)

1131
00:49:43,655 --> 00:49:44,984
(Please pay attention to this.)

1132
00:49:44,984 --> 00:49:47,894
(When you have a bite, the bell tied on the rod rings.)

1133
00:49:48,425 --> 00:49:52,135
(It is important to make a swift upward motion to set the hook.)

1134
00:49:52,434 --> 00:49:55,205
(Hee Won, the official Fishing King of House on Wheels)

1135
00:49:55,434 --> 00:49:58,164
(He catches a fish whenever he casts.)

1136
00:49:58,305 --> 00:49:59,934
(Gosh, did I catch another one?)

1137
00:50:00,104 --> 00:50:03,205
(He is blessed with luck when it comes to fishing.)

1138
00:50:03,274 --> 00:50:05,475
(Even this happened.)

1139
00:50:06,274 --> 00:50:09,015
(Come on, how do I have a bite without a bait?)

1140
00:50:09,015 --> 00:50:10,115
(Hee Won)

1141
00:50:10,115 --> 00:50:11,984
(Worship the Fishing King)

1142
00:50:12,115 --> 00:50:14,854
(For your information, he is unlucky with fishing.)

1143
00:50:14,854 --> 00:50:18,825
(Will Hee Won be lucky today again?)

1144
00:50:19,825 --> 00:50:23,064
(He is completely relaxed.)

1145
00:50:23,894 --> 00:50:25,995
- Hee Won, which spot are you using?
- What?

1146
00:50:26,164 --> 00:50:28,635
- Which spot are you going to pick?
- It's none of your business.

1147
00:50:28,934 --> 00:50:30,964
I want to do it next to you.

1148
00:50:30,964 --> 00:50:33,934
- No.
- I want to do it next to him too.

1149
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:36,374
- I can't believe you guys.
- I want to go next to Hee Won.

1150
00:50:37,104 --> 00:50:38,945
I'm picking the spot next to yours.

1151
00:50:39,115 --> 00:50:41,175
No, don't.

1152
00:50:41,175 --> 00:50:42,544
Why are you guys following me?

1153
00:50:42,544 --> 00:50:44,044
I'm going to follow you.

1154
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:46,084
Gosh, I feel tired.

1155
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:49,254
It seems the sea is shallow here. Can we still catch fish?

1156
00:50:49,484 --> 00:50:51,584
That's why we're going to make a long cast.

1157
00:50:52,024 --> 00:50:53,825
Can we really make a long cast that far?

1158
00:50:54,595 --> 00:50:56,725
- It can go that far?
- It's not easy.

1159
00:50:57,064 --> 00:50:58,464
It's not easy to do that.

1160
00:50:58,495 --> 00:51:01,635
When the bell rings, you have to set the hook.

1161
00:51:01,635 --> 00:51:04,334
- Come here, everyone.
- Why?

1162
00:51:04,564 --> 00:51:07,234
Come here and take lugworms.

1163
00:51:07,635 --> 00:51:09,845
(Slightly opening the box of lugworms)

1164
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:13,515
(Screaming out of disgust)

1165
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:14,515
What?

1166
00:51:15,785 --> 00:51:19,115
They look scarier than I expected.

1167
00:51:20,115 --> 00:51:22,084
I don't normally get easily scared though.

1168
00:51:22,354 --> 00:51:23,555
(Gosh.)

1169
00:51:23,555 --> 00:51:24,584
Did you see them?

1170
00:51:24,584 --> 00:51:26,095
(Yes, I did.)

1171
00:51:26,354 --> 00:51:27,354
What happened?

1172
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:30,564
- I saw lugworms for the first time, - Okay.

1173
00:51:30,564 --> 00:51:32,865
I thought I wouldn't be scared, but they look scary.

1174
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:34,794
(Let me see.)

1175
00:51:35,805 --> 00:51:36,865
Aren't they scary?

1176
00:51:36,964 --> 00:51:39,675
(Nodding)

1177
00:51:42,945 --> 00:51:44,874
I think there is something else for the bait.

1178
00:51:44,874 --> 00:51:45,874
(Shall we use a different kind of bait?)

1179
00:51:45,874 --> 00:51:48,615
- Shrimps are for the fish traps.
- Okay.

1180
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:51,615
With these mackerel in it...

1181
00:51:51,615 --> 00:51:52,615
(He is putting differnt baits into the fish trap.)

1182
00:51:52,615 --> 00:51:54,314
Let's show them what we can do.

1183
00:51:55,354 --> 00:51:58,425
- I hope we catch something with it.
- I hope so.

1184
00:51:59,655 --> 00:52:02,294
(Go.)

1185
00:52:02,624 --> 00:52:05,334
(A fish trap is thrown into the sea, in case they don't catch any fish.)

1186
00:52:05,434 --> 00:52:08,394
(Another fish trap is thrown as one is not enough.)

1187
00:52:08,394 --> 00:52:09,964
(I hope I can catch something with it.)

1188
00:52:09,964 --> 00:52:11,004
Okay, done.

1189
00:52:11,004 --> 00:52:14,504
(Will they be able to catch anything with the fish traps?)

1190
00:52:14,675 --> 00:52:15,845
- So after this...
- Okay.

1191
00:52:15,845 --> 00:52:17,075
(Before they cast their fishing rod...)

1192
00:52:17,075 --> 00:52:18,615
- Here?
- Bait the hook with a lugworm.

1193
00:52:19,774 --> 00:52:21,115
Put a lugworm on the hook.

1194
00:52:21,115 --> 00:52:22,714
Now? Lugworm?

1195
00:52:22,984 --> 00:52:24,914
You can't do it?

1196
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,015
I will try.

1197
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:30,084
Myoung, do you know how to bait a hook?

1198
00:52:30,584 --> 00:52:32,425
- With a lugworm?
- Yes. Have you done it before?

1199
00:52:32,425 --> 00:52:33,695
You just put it on the hook.

1200
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:36,564
(Bright)

1201
00:52:36,865 --> 00:52:39,734
I think we can follow how he does.

1202
00:52:39,964 --> 00:52:40,995
Okay.

1203
00:52:41,894 --> 00:52:44,664
(He went on his way.)

1204
00:52:45,334 --> 00:52:46,334
I can do this.

1205
00:52:46,334 --> 00:52:47,334
(Getting ready to bait the hook by herself)

1206
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:48,805
(She takes her courage in both hands and opens the box.)

1207
00:52:48,805 --> 00:52:50,374
(Wriggling)

1208
00:52:50,374 --> 00:52:52,475
(Frustrated)

1209
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:54,374
Yes, I can do this.

1210
00:52:54,644 --> 00:52:56,684
(No, I can't.)

1211
00:52:56,684 --> 00:52:57,814
I can do it.

1212
00:52:58,414 --> 00:53:01,555
(I don't think I can.)

1213
00:53:02,455 --> 00:53:03,725
(Exhaling deeply)

1214
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:07,124
I don't get easily scared, but...

1215
00:53:10,365 --> 00:53:12,164
(Wriggling)

1216
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,995
(Getting goosebumps)

1217
00:53:15,334 --> 00:53:18,234
(Meanwhile, Hyun Chul is...)

1218
00:53:18,234 --> 00:53:19,905
(Sighing)

1219
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,205
(I want to cry.)

1220
00:53:22,774 --> 00:53:24,504
Is there a way to make them pass out?

1221
00:53:24,604 --> 00:53:26,115
No, you shouldn't.

1222
00:53:26,845 --> 00:53:28,845
- Oh, my gosh.
- Goodness.

1223
00:53:29,214 --> 00:53:30,445
They are vigorous.

1224
00:53:30,445 --> 00:53:32,754
Seriously, how do they move like this?

1225
00:53:33,184 --> 00:53:36,354
Gosh, it's so noisy here. You're scaring fish.

1226
00:53:37,325 --> 00:53:38,354
I'm sorry.

1227
00:53:38,854 --> 00:53:41,024
- You shouldn't make too much noise.
- Okay, again...

1228
00:53:41,024 --> 00:53:42,325
- I'm sorry.
- Shoot.

1229
00:53:42,524 --> 00:53:45,664
You do fishing with your own luck. How come you talk so much?

1230
00:53:46,195 --> 00:53:49,164
I'm here with my family and I'm showing them how to do it.

1231
00:53:49,405 --> 00:53:50,705
Then you should know better.

1232
00:53:50,705 --> 00:53:53,705
My apology. Gosh, come on.

1233
00:53:54,374 --> 00:53:56,144
(The bait escaped.)

1234
00:53:56,745 --> 00:53:59,075
I missed the bait because of you.

1235
00:53:59,214 --> 00:54:01,015
- Seriously...
- My gosh.

1236
00:54:01,544 --> 00:54:03,144
- Hyun Chul.
- Yes?

1237
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:06,015
Can you please bait my hook just once?

1238
00:54:06,254 --> 00:54:07,515
Okay, I'll help you.

1239
00:54:08,015 --> 00:54:10,254
(He comes to help although he feels scared too.)

1240
00:54:10,254 --> 00:54:13,794
I thought I could do it,

1241
00:54:14,095 --> 00:54:15,195
but this is too scary.

1242
00:54:15,425 --> 00:54:17,865
(On the other hand, Myoung isn't scared of touching lugworms.)

1243
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,535
(Brave Myoung is calmly baiting the hook.)

1244
00:54:23,205 --> 00:54:26,175
Even fishing requires courage as well.

1245
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:29,745
It's done. You can cast it now.

1246
00:54:30,675 --> 00:54:31,705
Thanks a lot.

1247
00:54:31,705 --> 00:54:34,745
(With the help of Hyun Chul, she finally baited the hook.)

1248
00:54:35,044 --> 00:54:37,345
Now I lift the rod...

1249
00:54:37,714 --> 00:54:39,584
Why don't you watch how they do before you cast it?

1250
00:54:40,615 --> 00:54:43,555
(Ready to cast)

1251
00:54:44,624 --> 00:54:48,655
(Have a good look. This is the Fishing King's cast.)

1252
00:54:48,825 --> 00:54:49,865
(Plop)

1253
00:54:49,865 --> 00:54:50,865
Good.

1254
00:54:51,225 --> 00:54:53,995
(In a relaxed manner)

1255
00:54:54,464 --> 00:54:58,604
(Dong Il's first casting)

1256
00:54:59,075 --> 00:55:01,905
(She learns how to cast by looking at them.)

1257
00:55:02,604 --> 00:55:04,805
Step back and like this...

1258
00:55:05,515 --> 00:55:06,945
- Do I pull it back?
- Be careful, behind you.

1259
00:55:07,475 --> 00:55:08,544
- Like this?
- Yes.

1260
00:55:08,544 --> 00:55:09,615
- I cast it now?
- Yes.

1261
00:55:09,615 --> 00:55:10,714
(The two beginners are very discreet.)

1262
00:55:10,714 --> 00:55:11,885
One, two...

1263
00:55:13,254 --> 00:55:14,285
Gosh.

1264
00:55:14,515 --> 00:55:16,354
Gosh.

1265
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,725
(That's not casting. That's throwing.)

1266
00:55:17,725 --> 00:55:20,254
(She is brave enough to throw the fishing rod.)

1267
00:55:20,254 --> 00:55:21,925
(Embarrassed)

1268
00:55:21,925 --> 00:55:23,124
That's okay. Nobody saw you.

1269
00:55:24,095 --> 00:55:25,095
No one saw what happened.

1270
00:55:25,095 --> 00:55:26,695
(Let's just say nothing happened.)

1271
00:55:26,695 --> 00:55:29,064
- Hee Won. Can you help?
- All right.

1272
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:30,834
- Coming.
- It's okay. Nobody saw it.

1273
00:55:31,734 --> 00:55:33,905
Give me that. Let me see.

1274
00:55:33,905 --> 00:55:35,644
How did I miss it?

1275
00:55:35,644 --> 00:55:37,475
- Sorry, one second.
- So...

1276
00:55:37,845 --> 00:55:38,975
go like this when this happens.

1277
00:55:38,975 --> 00:55:40,515
(Fishing King Hee Won is teaching them how to cast a rod.)

1278
00:55:40,515 --> 00:55:41,745
And then... What happened to this?

1279
00:55:41,745 --> 00:55:43,345
- Hold here tight.
- Here?

1280
00:55:43,345 --> 00:55:44,714
Hold it tight with your right hand, okay?

1281
00:55:45,015 --> 00:55:47,785
Just think that you're casting it in the air.

1282
00:55:47,785 --> 00:55:50,024
- Not into the sea, but in the air.
- Okay, in the air.

1283
00:55:50,024 --> 00:55:52,325
Watch how I move.

1284
00:55:52,325 --> 00:55:54,225
From this motion...

1285
00:55:54,624 --> 00:55:55,725
- Pay attention to the movement.
- Okay.

1286
00:55:56,124 --> 00:55:59,164
- One, two, three. Like this.
- I see.

1287
00:55:59,765 --> 00:56:00,765
(I see.)

1288
00:56:00,765 --> 00:56:02,734
Let it go, okay? Now try it.

1289
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,164
One, two, three.

1290
00:56:04,705 --> 00:56:05,874
One, two, three.

1291
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:08,905
Nice. Good job.

1292
00:56:10,405 --> 00:56:11,644
You did well.

1293
00:56:12,414 --> 00:56:15,314
(Meanwhile, Dong Il is resting after casting the rod.)

1294
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:18,414
How are you guys doing?

1295
00:56:18,745 --> 00:56:20,484
Well, we're doing all right.

1296
00:56:21,055 --> 00:56:22,785
- You are?
- Yes.

1297
00:56:24,655 --> 00:56:28,124
Someone like him is the most annoying person at a fishing place.

1298
00:56:28,894 --> 00:56:30,564
He should just mind his own business.

1299
00:56:30,564 --> 00:56:33,195
I think I'll be lucky today.

1300
00:56:33,195 --> 00:56:34,195
(Confident)

1301
00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:36,334
Gosh, he is too loud.

1302
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:37,535
Hee Won, stop talking about me.

1303
00:56:38,135 --> 00:56:39,535
- I'm sorry?
- Stop talking about me.

1304
00:56:39,934 --> 00:56:41,274
I'm not talking about you, Dong Il.

1305
00:56:41,405 --> 00:56:42,905
I can hear everything with Bluetooth, you know?

1306
00:56:43,644 --> 00:56:45,975
- What? Bluetooth?
- Bluetooth.

1307
00:56:46,414 --> 00:56:48,445
- I can hear everything.
- Okay, Dong Il.

1308
00:56:48,445 --> 00:56:49,814
(He is quite sharp-eared.)

1309
00:56:49,814 --> 00:56:53,155
(Meanwhile, Myoung is still baiting the hook.)

1310
00:56:53,455 --> 00:56:56,225
Myoung, what's slowing you down? Go ahead and cast it.

1311
00:56:57,655 --> 00:56:58,655
You know how to cast it, right?

1312
00:56:58,655 --> 00:57:00,595
(Dong Il is on his way to teach him how to cast.)

1313
00:57:00,794 --> 00:57:01,894
Reel it in a bit.

1314
00:57:02,624 --> 00:57:04,564
Hold it. Reel it out.

1315
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:07,035
- Like this.
- Forward, right?

1316
00:57:07,035 --> 00:57:09,805
- And open your right hand, okay?
- Like this.

1317
00:57:10,004 --> 00:57:11,564
Yes, like that. Hold it with that hand.

1318
00:57:11,805 --> 00:57:13,874
Check behind you to see if there's anything.

1319
00:57:14,075 --> 00:57:15,075
(Myoung is learning in a harsh way.)

1320
00:57:15,075 --> 00:57:16,305
Good. That's it.

1321
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:20,374
Check the direction and cast it.

1322
00:57:23,914 --> 00:57:26,984
- Where did it go?
- To the diagonal direction.

1323
00:57:26,984 --> 00:57:28,015
Is it stuck with mine?

1324
00:57:28,714 --> 00:57:29,825
I think it's stuck.

1325
00:57:31,254 --> 00:57:32,854
Pull it.

1326
00:57:32,854 --> 00:57:33,925
(The fishing line looks tight as it's stuck with Myoung's.)

1327
00:57:34,024 --> 00:57:36,064
I think it's pulling yours too.

1328
00:57:36,064 --> 00:57:37,124
(He is stuck with Dong Il who has no luck with fishing.)

1329
00:57:38,695 --> 00:57:40,195
What have you done?

1330
00:57:40,195 --> 00:57:42,035
If you want to cast it again...

1331
00:57:42,035 --> 00:57:43,104
(On the other hand, Hee Won is still very friendly.)

1332
00:57:43,104 --> 00:57:45,575
Reel it in like this, and then...

1333
00:57:47,035 --> 00:57:48,604
(Ringing)

1334
00:57:48,874 --> 00:57:50,374
(Wait. This is...)

1335
00:57:50,374 --> 00:57:51,705
- Okay.
- Goodness.

1336
00:57:52,144 --> 00:57:53,945
- You have a bite?
- I have a bite.

1337
00:57:54,615 --> 00:57:55,684
What is it?

1338
00:57:56,184 --> 00:57:58,684
- What?
- He caught a fish.

1339
00:57:58,785 --> 00:58:02,015
(What is the first fish of the day?)

1340
00:58:03,754 --> 00:58:06,794
- You have a bite?
- He caught a fish.

1341
00:58:07,524 --> 00:58:08,555
This is awesome.

1342
00:58:08,555 --> 00:58:10,925
(A goby is caught with the power of the Fishing King.)

1343
00:58:11,164 --> 00:58:13,734
It's amazing. You caught it, Hee Won.

1344
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:15,765
Hey.

1345
00:58:15,765 --> 00:58:17,405
(I'm so excited.)

1346
00:58:18,064 --> 00:58:19,075
I can't believe this.

1347
00:58:19,075 --> 00:58:20,075
(Admiring)

1348
00:58:20,075 --> 00:58:21,934
- Who caught it?
- Hee Won did.

1349
00:58:22,175 --> 00:58:23,845
- No, Woo Hee did - Hee Won did.

1350
00:58:24,144 --> 00:58:27,015
Here. Just cast it however you want.

1351
00:58:27,445 --> 00:58:29,115
Seriously, this is so annoying.

1352
00:58:29,945 --> 00:58:31,345
What should I do with it? Should I catch it?

1353
00:58:31,345 --> 00:58:34,055
- Should I?
- Here. Catch it.

1354
00:58:34,854 --> 00:58:37,555
Gosh, I caught it before it finishes digesting the lugworm.

1355
00:58:38,385 --> 00:58:39,455
What should I do?

1356
00:58:40,254 --> 00:58:42,725
(Swinging)

1357
00:58:42,725 --> 00:58:44,765
Isn't it gross?

1358
00:58:45,225 --> 00:58:46,964
- I'm all right.
- Are you sure?

1359
00:58:47,064 --> 00:58:48,894
I'm okay. I can do this.

1360
00:58:48,894 --> 00:58:51,305
Hold it tight, and then unhook it.

1361
00:58:51,305 --> 00:58:52,305
(Woo Hee is bravely unhooking the fish.)

1362
00:58:52,604 --> 00:58:54,635
Are you scared? I was scared at first too.

1363
00:58:56,445 --> 00:58:57,445
Did you get it?

1364
00:58:57,445 --> 00:58:58,445
(I made it.)

1365
00:58:58,445 --> 00:59:00,714
- Shall I set it free?
- Yes, it's too small. Let it go.

1366
00:59:00,914 --> 00:59:02,445
Don't get caught again, okay?

1367
00:59:02,445 --> 00:59:04,584
- Good.
- Hee Won, it was amazing.

1368
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:06,155
- Great job.
- How did you catch it?

1369
00:59:07,084 --> 00:59:08,155
A fish was really caught.

1370
00:59:08,155 --> 00:59:09,385
(I can't believe that a fish was actually caught.)

1371
00:59:09,385 --> 00:59:11,155
- Into the air, okay? One, two...
- One, two...

1372
00:59:11,155 --> 00:59:13,024
(Woo Hee is excited, and cast the rod again.)

1373
00:59:13,254 --> 00:59:16,365
- Go.
- There you go. Great.

1374
00:59:16,365 --> 00:59:19,934
(They're enjoying fishing in the front yard.)

1375
00:59:21,495 --> 00:59:24,705
(They wait with their fishing rod cast in the sea...)

1376
00:59:25,135 --> 00:59:28,305
(or they sit back and relax at home.)

1377
00:59:28,305 --> 00:59:31,374
(Everyone is enjoying the moment in the way they want.)

1378
00:59:31,475 --> 00:59:32,714
Hyun Chul, how is it going?

1379
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:34,374
I haven't even cast it yet.

1380
00:59:35,515 --> 00:59:40,984
(He's been baiting the hook for 30 minutes.)

1381
00:59:41,714 --> 00:59:45,354
(He is an extremely careful person.)

1382
00:59:45,524 --> 00:59:47,925
(Quietly, he casts it for the first time.)

1383
00:59:49,195 --> 00:59:50,894
(Flapping)

1384
00:59:51,564 --> 00:59:54,035
(Hold on.)

1385
00:59:54,135 --> 00:59:55,705
(He lost the lugworm after the first casting.)

1386
00:59:55,705 --> 00:59:57,405
Come on, seriously?

1387
00:59:57,405 --> 00:59:59,075
(Snorting)

1388
00:59:59,675 --> 01:00:01,874
(Embarrassed)

1389
01:00:01,874 --> 01:00:03,805
- Hyun Chul, what's going on?
- No, it's nothing.

1390
01:00:03,805 --> 01:00:05,945
- I'm all right.
- I clearly saw a lugworm on it.

1391
01:00:05,945 --> 01:00:07,274
It was flown away.

1392
01:00:07,644 --> 01:00:08,914
It was there a moment ago, and what just happened?

1393
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:11,814
(Oh, gosh.)

1394
01:00:11,814 --> 01:00:13,214
It's frustrating.

1395
01:00:15,314 --> 01:00:17,055
We can really catch fish here, right?

1396
01:00:18,254 --> 01:00:20,595
I just have to wait like this, right?

1397
01:00:20,595 --> 01:00:24,595
Yes. Fishing is all about waiting, okay?

1398
01:00:29,934 --> 01:00:32,104
(The bell tied on the rod is ringing.)

1399
01:00:32,305 --> 01:00:34,504
(I can't wait any longer.)

1400
01:00:34,504 --> 01:00:36,745
(Running)

1401
01:00:36,745 --> 01:00:37,845
I'm sorry, Dong Il.

1402
01:00:39,945 --> 01:00:40,945
(The rods got tangled again.)

1403
01:00:40,945 --> 01:00:42,544
What's with you?

1404
01:00:42,885 --> 01:00:44,314
Gosh, Youngest.

1405
01:00:44,314 --> 01:00:46,254
(The youngest continues the legacy of bad fishermen.)

1406
01:00:46,254 --> 01:00:47,714
I'm sorry. I'm going to pass you.

1407
01:00:47,714 --> 01:00:48,914
- Wait.
- Hey!

1408
01:00:50,624 --> 01:00:53,024
My gosh. He's driving me crazy!

1409
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,254
(These two are clashing today.)

1410
01:00:54,455 --> 01:00:55,725
What's up with you?

1411
01:00:56,524 --> 01:00:58,325
(Smiling)

1412
01:00:59,064 --> 01:01:00,064
Gosh, you punk.

1413
01:01:00,064 --> 01:01:02,464
I'm sorry.

1414
01:01:02,464 --> 01:01:04,934
He won't let me stay still!

1415
01:01:05,405 --> 01:01:09,445
(Meanwhile, Hyun Chul tries casting his rod again.)

1416
01:01:10,475 --> 01:01:12,675
(Where did it go?)

1417
01:01:13,214 --> 01:01:14,544
(Right here.)

1418
01:01:14,774 --> 01:01:16,714
(Exclaiming)

1419
01:01:17,745 --> 01:01:22,854
(He carefully reels it in to lure the fish.)

1420
01:01:26,055 --> 01:01:27,055
I got...

1421
01:01:28,195 --> 01:01:29,564
(He got a fish?)

1422
01:01:29,825 --> 01:01:33,464
(Nobody heard him.)

1423
01:01:34,135 --> 01:01:37,104
I got one, but I lost it.

1424
01:01:40,135 --> 01:01:41,405
It's swimming away.

1425
01:01:43,774 --> 01:01:45,004
(Sighing)

1426
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:48,544
I should take a break.

1427
01:01:51,214 --> 01:01:52,345
(Fishing...)

1428
01:01:52,345 --> 01:01:55,354
(is hard.)

1429
01:01:57,624 --> 01:01:58,925
(Tripping)

1430
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:02,794
(Weak)

1431
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:06,894
(He gives up on fishing as soon as he starts.)

1432
01:02:07,334 --> 01:02:10,464
(Woo Hee returns home for a bit too.)

1433
01:02:10,705 --> 01:02:11,905
This doesn't fit me.

1434
01:02:13,504 --> 01:02:16,475
(The oldest casts his rod and turns around...)

1435
01:02:16,475 --> 01:02:17,504
Hey!

1436
01:02:17,504 --> 01:02:18,805
(He runs again.)

1437
01:02:19,044 --> 01:02:20,075
Hey!

1438
01:02:20,814 --> 01:02:22,475
(What?)

1439
01:02:22,475 --> 01:02:24,184
(Woo Hee's rod)

1440
01:02:24,184 --> 01:02:26,584
(Shaking)

1441
01:02:27,615 --> 01:02:28,655
Hey!

1442
01:02:28,655 --> 01:02:30,984
(It's going!)

1443
01:02:30,984 --> 01:02:34,825
(The head of the house runs at the speed of light.)

1444
01:02:35,155 --> 01:02:36,524
Oh, my.

1445
01:02:36,524 --> 01:02:38,064
(The owner of the rod rushes back to her spot.)

1446
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:39,464
Reel it in.

1447
01:02:40,434 --> 01:02:41,464
- Reel it in.
- Did I catch something?

1448
01:02:41,464 --> 01:02:42,964
(Stomping)

1449
01:02:43,504 --> 01:02:44,805
This one is big!

1450
01:02:45,535 --> 01:02:47,075
- I caught something!
- Bring it up!

1451
01:02:47,075 --> 01:02:50,975
(What kind of fish did she catch?)

1452
01:02:51,374 --> 01:02:52,615
I caught something.

1453
01:02:52,874 --> 01:02:54,675
(It's a small black porgy.)

1454
01:02:54,675 --> 01:02:56,885
You're number one right now!

1455
01:02:57,544 --> 01:02:59,285
Chun Woo Hee caught two fish!

1456
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:00,814
I caught two fish!

1457
01:03:00,814 --> 01:03:02,115
(Proud)

1458
01:03:02,214 --> 01:03:04,225
(Envious)

1459
01:03:04,325 --> 01:03:06,254
For fish like black porgy,

1460
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:09,995
they have to be over 20cm for us to keep.

1461
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,765
- Let it go.
- You have to let it go.

1462
01:03:12,524 --> 01:03:13,564
Goodbye.

1463
01:03:13,695 --> 01:03:15,695
In any case, Woo Hee is in first place today.

1464
01:03:18,135 --> 01:03:20,934
She's got fisherman's luck.

1465
01:03:23,604 --> 01:03:25,104
I did everything I need to do today.

1466
01:03:26,414 --> 01:03:28,615
(Sitting)

1467
01:03:29,285 --> 01:03:30,745
Why aren't you eating? It's good.

1468
01:03:31,584 --> 01:03:33,414
Why is fishing so exhausting?

1469
01:03:33,414 --> 01:03:35,655
I thought fishing was...

1470
01:03:35,655 --> 01:03:39,184
- leisurely.
- Isn't that how it is?

1471
01:03:39,794 --> 01:03:41,894
- My mentality...
- It's exhausting.

1472
01:03:42,794 --> 01:03:45,964
(And here...)

1473
01:03:48,135 --> 01:03:51,504
(There's another person who's exhausted.)

1474
01:03:51,564 --> 01:03:54,905
(For the youngest, who's fishing for the first time...)

1475
01:03:55,805 --> 01:04:00,044
(All I'm thinking about is coming in 1st place for fishing.)

1476
01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:02,015
(What place do you think you'll come in?)

1477
01:04:02,245 --> 01:04:04,745
(He had big dreams of becoming the Fishing King.)

1478
01:04:06,354 --> 01:04:09,484
(He has coffee in one hand and a chair in the other.)

1479
01:04:09,484 --> 01:04:11,124
(How nice.)

1480
01:04:12,854 --> 01:04:15,794
(Rod, take good care of me.)

1481
01:04:16,664 --> 01:04:19,595
Does the bell ring when there's a fish?

1482
01:04:19,595 --> 01:04:21,664
You get a message that says, "I have a bite".

1483
01:04:23,305 --> 01:04:24,305
(I have a bite.)

1484
01:04:24,305 --> 01:04:25,305
What is that?

1485
01:04:25,305 --> 01:04:27,305
(Rushing over)

1486
01:04:27,934 --> 01:04:29,004
Oh, my.

1487
01:04:30,044 --> 01:04:31,144
What is it?

1488
01:04:31,144 --> 01:04:32,874
(Beating)

1489
01:04:33,144 --> 01:04:37,414
(Do you see this? I finally...)

1490
01:04:40,184 --> 01:04:41,955
Oh, my. This is...

1491
01:04:41,955 --> 01:04:43,684
It ate the bait and swam away!

1492
01:04:44,155 --> 01:04:46,354
Why do they keep eating all the bait?

1493
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:49,425
Why do you keep losing your bait to the fish?

1494
01:04:50,365 --> 01:04:53,234
(Afterwards, the donation angel...)

1495
01:04:53,664 --> 01:04:56,865
(continued to endure a time of perseverance.)

1496
01:04:57,265 --> 01:05:00,334
(He's sad about fishing.)

1497
01:05:00,504 --> 01:05:02,905
- Is it blocked?
- I'm going to try one more time.

1498
01:05:02,905 --> 01:05:07,075
Goodness. Woo Hee is tenacious.

1499
01:05:07,414 --> 01:05:08,615
(Let's go.)

1500
01:05:08,615 --> 01:05:09,644
See?

1501
01:05:09,914 --> 01:05:11,445
I can put the worm on the hook now.

1502
01:05:11,445 --> 01:05:13,754
- See?
- I can do it!

1503
01:05:13,754 --> 01:05:15,155
(Determined)

1504
01:05:15,955 --> 01:05:18,385
- She's the scariest person ever.
- Is she?

1505
01:05:19,285 --> 01:05:20,854
Do you want me to cut some fruit up for you?

1506
01:05:21,624 --> 01:05:24,595
- Okay. You prefer this, don't you?
- Yes, I really do.

1507
01:05:24,995 --> 01:05:28,265
(He looks happy with his hands full of fruit.)

1508
01:05:28,434 --> 01:05:31,564
(He found something that suits him,)

1509
01:05:31,765 --> 01:05:35,274
(so he begins humming.)

1510
01:05:35,604 --> 01:05:37,805
(Humming)

1511
01:05:38,905 --> 01:05:42,144
(He skillfully peels the skin off the fruit.)

1512
01:05:42,345 --> 01:05:45,984
(He cuts them into bite-sized pieces.)

1513
01:05:46,314 --> 01:05:50,385
(He walks over to the family who is fishing.)

1514
01:05:50,684 --> 01:05:51,725
Have some kiwi.

1515
01:05:51,725 --> 01:05:53,854
How could you bring it at such an important moment?

1516
01:05:53,854 --> 01:05:55,024
(He delivers the fruit into his mouth.)

1517
01:05:55,024 --> 01:05:56,365
- Do you want some more?
- No, I'm fine.

1518
01:05:56,365 --> 01:05:57,365
Are you okay?

1519
01:05:58,225 --> 01:06:01,294
(He is caring like a mother bird.)

1520
01:06:01,564 --> 01:06:03,104
- Do you want more?
- No, I'm fine.

1521
01:06:03,104 --> 01:06:04,135
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1522
01:06:04,365 --> 01:06:06,274
- Do you want some fruit?
- No, thank you.

1523
01:06:06,774 --> 01:06:08,334
No, I'll have some later.

1524
01:06:08,334 --> 01:06:09,405
- You want some later?
- Yes.

1525
01:06:09,405 --> 01:06:11,405
Youngest, come here. Let's pull this out.

1526
01:06:12,044 --> 01:06:13,314
- What?
- Let's take this out.

1527
01:06:13,314 --> 01:06:15,675
(The fish trap they threw in upon arrival.)

1528
01:06:16,015 --> 01:06:19,854
(The fish are interested.)

1529
01:06:20,115 --> 01:06:24,524
(Let's see...)

1530
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:27,825
(Anticipating)

1531
01:06:28,195 --> 01:06:29,825
- What? It's just the bait.
- There's nothing in it, right?

1532
01:06:29,825 --> 01:06:30,825
There's nothing there?

1533
01:06:31,265 --> 01:06:32,725
- There's nothing in there?
- Nothing.

1534
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:35,365
There isn't a single fish in here.

1535
01:06:35,365 --> 01:06:36,765
(The first trap has 0 fish.)

1536
01:06:36,934 --> 01:06:38,234
I have a feeling this might have something.

1537
01:06:38,405 --> 01:06:39,705
- Because it's deeper?
- Yes.

1538
01:06:39,705 --> 01:06:40,734
That makes sense.

1539
01:06:41,035 --> 01:06:43,675
We should've just cooked the mackerel on the frying pan.

1540
01:06:43,905 --> 01:06:45,945
Please help me save face.

1541
01:06:45,945 --> 01:06:47,274
(Please)

1542
01:06:47,445 --> 01:06:49,245
There's not a single fish in here.

1543
01:06:49,245 --> 01:06:50,785
There are baby fish.

1544
01:06:50,785 --> 01:06:52,345
There are three baby puffers.

1545
01:06:52,345 --> 01:06:53,385
(There are three baby puffers.)

1546
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:54,754
Do you want to see a pufferfish?

1547
01:06:55,055 --> 01:06:56,285
- What?
- We caught a pufferfish.

1548
01:06:56,285 --> 01:06:57,385
- Really?
- In the fish trap?

1549
01:06:58,184 --> 01:07:00,495
- Isn't it cute?
- It's so cute.

1550
01:07:00,495 --> 01:07:02,155
- Let them go.
- Yes. Of course.

1551
01:07:02,155 --> 01:07:03,195
(Small and precious)

1552
01:07:03,195 --> 01:07:04,825
- Hee Won.
- Yes?

1553
01:07:04,825 --> 01:07:07,095
I'm going to make some food for everyone,

1554
01:07:07,095 --> 01:07:09,705
- so guide them well.
- Okay.

1555
01:07:09,705 --> 01:07:12,535
(Dong Il gave up early,)

1556
01:07:12,765 --> 01:07:13,834
(and Hyun Chul follows him in.)

1557
01:07:13,834 --> 01:07:15,975
This is... Hyun Chul,

1558
01:07:16,305 --> 01:07:18,205
- you must not like fishing.
- I don't.

1559
01:07:19,575 --> 01:07:22,044
I tried it, but it doesn't suit me.

1560
01:07:22,044 --> 01:07:23,115
It doesn't?

1561
01:07:23,115 --> 01:07:26,955
Are you the type to not do something that doesn't suit you?

1562
01:07:26,955 --> 01:07:28,354
Yes. I don't care to do it at all.

1563
01:07:28,354 --> 01:07:30,055
You're just like my son.

1564
01:07:30,055 --> 01:07:31,785
My son doesn't do things that don't suit him.

1565
01:07:32,285 --> 01:07:35,054
Hey. Aren't you the one who caught two fish?

1566
01:07:35,054 --> 01:07:36,995
Hey. Did you catch anything?

1567
01:07:37,524 --> 01:07:39,264
I don't think there are any fish here.

1568
01:07:40,165 --> 01:07:42,165
Isn't this place deeper?

1569
01:07:42,465 --> 01:07:44,234
But I'm not catching anything.

1570
01:07:44,734 --> 01:07:46,774
I'm going to catch something no matter what.

1571
01:07:47,934 --> 01:07:50,474
Right. I can do the ones with one fish.

1572
01:07:51,045 --> 01:07:53,875
(Her competitiveness is stronger than her fear.)

1573
01:07:54,245 --> 01:07:56,514
- I'm going to catch a fish!
- Me too!

1574
01:07:56,915 --> 01:07:58,615
You can do it, Chun Woo Hee!

1575
01:07:58,615 --> 01:08:01,514
I can do it! You can do it, Gong Myoung!

1576
01:08:02,215 --> 01:08:03,285
That surprised me.

1577
01:08:03,884 --> 01:08:05,655
I'm selfish... Hold on.

1578
01:08:05,854 --> 01:08:07,054
- Did you get a bite?
- Yes.

1579
01:08:07,594 --> 01:08:09,354
(Go barefoot! Don't put any shoes on!)

1580
01:08:09,564 --> 01:08:11,695
Hurry. Go barefoot! Don't put any shoes on!

1581
01:08:11,695 --> 01:08:13,835
Don't put any shoes on. Just run! Wear slippers.

1582
01:08:14,695 --> 01:08:16,035
Run. You caught something.

1583
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:18,665
(You got a bite.)

1584
01:08:19,575 --> 01:08:20,575
Hey!

1585
01:08:21,134 --> 01:08:22,174
What is that?

1586
01:08:23,674 --> 01:08:25,644
- Wait. I can't reel it in.
- What is it?

1587
01:08:26,045 --> 01:08:27,745
- What is it?
- What's going on?

1588
01:08:28,174 --> 01:08:29,445
Hyun Chul, don't be flustered.

1589
01:08:30,585 --> 01:08:33,514
(Excited)

1590
01:08:34,484 --> 01:08:37,085
- How do you reel this in?
- Slowly. Don't be flustered.

1591
01:08:37,884 --> 01:08:39,224
(His bare feet are already flustered.)

1592
01:08:39,224 --> 01:08:40,524
Hold on. This is...

1593
01:08:40,524 --> 01:08:42,195
That's right. Reel it in slowly.

1594
01:08:43,195 --> 01:08:45,465
Why won't this reel in?

1595
01:08:45,465 --> 01:08:47,394
- It broke!
- Keep reeling it in.

1596
01:08:48,064 --> 01:08:49,804
- No way!
- This is a big one.

1597
01:08:49,804 --> 01:08:50,865
- What is it?
- What?

1598
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:52,035
(It's tight like there's a big fish on the line.)

1599
01:08:52,035 --> 01:08:53,075
Is it a big one?

1600
01:08:53,734 --> 01:08:55,505
No. It's right in front.

1601
01:08:55,604 --> 01:08:57,274
(What is it?)

1602
01:08:57,575 --> 01:08:59,405
(Exclaiming)

1603
01:09:02,014 --> 01:09:04,014
You caught something in a net.

1604
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:05,184
(He caught the fish that's in the net.)

1605
01:09:05,184 --> 01:09:06,755
- What is this?
- Goodness.

1606
01:09:07,554 --> 01:09:09,655
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Why are you embarrassed?

1607
01:09:09,655 --> 01:09:11,755
You caught the net too.

1608
01:09:12,995 --> 01:09:15,995
(The water in front of the house has all gone out.)

1609
01:09:16,295 --> 01:09:19,165
(Their rods are still quiet.)

1610
01:09:19,165 --> 01:09:21,365
- Wait. Hee Won.
- Yes?

1611
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:22,764
That one is shaking.

1612
01:09:22,764 --> 01:09:24,264
- Which one?
- That one.

1613
01:09:24,264 --> 01:09:25,335
(Is the Fishing King's rod is shaking?)

1614
01:09:25,535 --> 01:09:26,734
- Mine?
- Yes.

1615
01:09:27,405 --> 01:09:28,474
Did I catch something?

1616
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:31,604
(What's with that leisure?)

1617
01:09:31,905 --> 01:09:33,945
- It's shaking again.
- Is it?

1618
01:09:35,674 --> 01:09:36,814
Did I catch something?

1619
01:09:38,984 --> 01:09:42,054
(He slowly reels it in.)

1620
01:09:42,285 --> 01:09:43,585
(There are two small fish.)

1621
01:09:43,585 --> 01:09:46,024
- Goodness.
- They're so small.

1622
01:09:46,295 --> 01:09:48,955
Gosh, he caught two.

1623
01:09:49,094 --> 01:09:51,424
That's incredible.

1624
01:09:51,965 --> 01:09:53,795
There are only small ones.

1625
01:09:53,795 --> 01:09:55,264
(The Fishing King isn't satisfied with this.)

1626
01:09:55,465 --> 01:09:57,104
I need to go further out.

1627
01:09:58,035 --> 01:10:01,104
We're too close to shore, so there are only small fishes here.

1628
01:10:01,104 --> 01:10:02,104
(He leaves the front yard that only has small fish,)

1629
01:10:02,434 --> 01:10:06,415
(and goes a bit further down from the house.)

1630
01:10:06,844 --> 01:10:10,615
(Hee Won wants to catch a big fish.)

1631
01:10:11,615 --> 01:10:15,155
(Youngest keeps sticking right beside him.)

1632
01:10:15,514 --> 01:10:16,625
(While they go far to fish...)

1633
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:17,924
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

1634
01:10:19,554 --> 01:10:23,195
(Meanwhile, the two people who have lost interest in fishing...)

1635
01:10:24,064 --> 01:10:29,835
(They're doing an impassive eating show.)

1636
01:10:30,634 --> 01:10:31,705
This is delicious.

1637
01:10:32,205 --> 01:10:34,035
It's so delicious.

1638
01:10:35,075 --> 01:10:38,375
- It's so delicious.
- It's so delicious.

1639
01:10:38,774 --> 01:10:40,144
I gave up on fishing.

1640
01:10:41,174 --> 01:10:42,215
Me too.

1641
01:10:44,215 --> 01:10:47,854
(Those who gave up on fishing are relaxing peacefully.)

1642
01:10:47,854 --> 01:10:49,255
Hey, Hyun Chul.

1643
01:10:50,255 --> 01:10:52,255
(Look at me.)

1644
01:10:52,384 --> 01:10:53,795
I'm carrying this much.

1645
01:10:55,825 --> 01:10:58,365
(Rushing over.)

1646
01:10:58,764 --> 01:11:01,335
Let's split it up. Take the ones on top.

1647
01:11:01,335 --> 01:11:02,665
Gosh, what is this?

1648
01:11:02,665 --> 01:11:04,205
You'll find out in a minute.

1649
01:11:04,205 --> 01:11:05,865
(Surprised)

1650
01:11:06,104 --> 01:11:07,634
I was so surprised while I was eating a plum.

1651
01:11:08,804 --> 01:11:10,644
It's the most delicious thing in the area.

1652
01:11:10,644 --> 01:11:14,075
(What is the Boseong ingredient he prepared?)

1653
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:16,684
Did one of your friends give it to you again?

1654
01:11:16,684 --> 01:11:18,415
No. I bought it this time.

1655
01:11:19,344 --> 01:11:21,554
These are long-legged octopus to make you guys octopus soup.

1656
01:11:21,554 --> 01:11:22,585
That's incredible.

1657
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:25,825
(Come fall, they get nice and plump.)

1658
01:11:25,955 --> 01:11:29,554
- Here. Give it to me.
- Gosh. I'm so excited.

1659
01:11:29,554 --> 01:11:31,665
(What's inside the other box?)

1660
01:11:31,665 --> 01:11:32,695
This is abalone.

1661
01:11:33,064 --> 01:11:35,564
(A treasure of clean Namhae, abalones)

1662
01:11:35,564 --> 01:11:37,835
- They're so big.
- They're really big.

1663
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:40,375
House on Wheels is on a different level.

1664
01:11:40,674 --> 01:11:42,974
You need this much to feel like you've really had it.

1665
01:11:43,774 --> 01:11:47,245
(Namhae is clear and blue in front of our front yard.)

1666
01:11:47,575 --> 01:11:49,844
(They'll have a lot of seafood...)

1667
01:11:49,844 --> 01:11:52,415
(caught in the ocean out front.)

1668
01:11:52,785 --> 01:11:55,814
(They'll enjoy a gift set of seafood in ocean garden.)

1669
01:11:56,524 --> 01:12:00,094
(Cold raw abalone and fish soup)

1670
01:12:00,325 --> 01:12:01,755
(When it's low tide, you can meet...)

1671
01:12:01,755 --> 01:12:03,894
(another precious ingredient.)

1672
01:12:04,165 --> 01:12:06,465
(It is known as the ginseng of the ocean.)

1673
01:12:06,465 --> 01:12:09,064
(The famous healthy ingredient of the south, long-legged octopus.)

1674
01:12:09,564 --> 01:12:12,465
(He'll use plump fall octopus...)

1675
01:12:13,234 --> 01:12:16,075
(to make a light, but spicy fall long-legged octopus soup.)

1676
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:20,945
(They will have a meal filled with the ingredients of Namhae.)

1677
01:12:21,814 --> 01:12:24,844
(Dong Il begins cleaning the abalone.)

1678
01:12:24,945 --> 01:12:27,984
(I have to start making food...)

1679
01:12:27,984 --> 01:12:28,984
Hee Won!

1680
01:12:30,455 --> 01:12:31,924
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

1681
01:12:31,924 --> 01:12:33,655
(Hee Won and Gong Myoung are fishing far away.)

1682
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:35,325
(He's a bit tired.)

1683
01:12:35,325 --> 01:12:36,354
I'm exhausted.

1684
01:12:36,354 --> 01:12:38,195
- Hee Won!
- Yes?

1685
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:41,365
Can you and Gong Myoung come...

1686
01:12:41,365 --> 01:12:44,134
and turn on the gas burner and set up the tripod?

1687
01:12:45,234 --> 01:12:48,934
(They can only hear the echoes from here.)

1688
01:12:49,405 --> 01:12:51,445
- What did he say?
- Woo Hee...

1689
01:12:51,844 --> 01:12:54,144
Pant... Do something with Woo Hee?

1690
01:12:54,674 --> 01:12:56,144
- What? What does he want?
- I don't know.

1691
01:12:56,144 --> 01:12:57,715
I think he wants you to do something with Woo Hee.

1692
01:12:57,715 --> 01:12:59,484
(It's too far to hear anything properly.)

1693
01:12:59,814 --> 01:13:02,014
Would I be able to hear the bells from over there?

1694
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:03,955
I doubt it.

1695
01:13:04,524 --> 01:13:07,924
I'll put it down like this. So it's safe.

1696
01:13:07,924 --> 01:13:09,094
(He repositions his rod in a safe position.)

1697
01:13:10,224 --> 01:13:13,295
(I'll be right back, fishing rod!)

1698
01:13:13,995 --> 01:13:16,764
(Will they be able to catch anything with the fishing rods?)

1699
01:13:17,934 --> 01:13:19,104
Goodness.

1700
01:13:19,104 --> 01:13:21,634
It's faster to buy it than catch it.

1701
01:13:21,634 --> 01:13:23,035
(He's hit with reality.)

1702
01:13:23,445 --> 01:13:26,274
I got some really big abalones.

1703
01:13:26,274 --> 01:13:27,545
- Abalones?
- Yes, this.

1704
01:13:27,545 --> 01:13:28,945
(He sees the sashimi for the soup.)

1705
01:13:28,945 --> 01:13:30,384
Isn't it amazing?

1706
01:13:30,384 --> 01:13:31,684
I'm not going to eat this.

1707
01:13:31,684 --> 01:13:33,085
- I'm going to eat the one I catch.
- Me too.

1708
01:13:33,085 --> 01:13:34,354
So you guys can eat all of it.

1709
01:13:35,085 --> 01:13:37,785
- Then we'll eat it by ourselves.
- It's a matter of pride.

1710
01:13:38,524 --> 01:13:41,125
Should I take it out of the shell? Or do you want to keep it on?

1711
01:13:41,354 --> 01:13:43,625
If you don't do it right, the innards pop. Do you know how?

1712
01:13:43,894 --> 01:13:45,394
I've tried it with a spoon before,

1713
01:13:45,394 --> 01:13:47,394
- but I'll try it again.
- Use a small knife.

1714
01:13:48,165 --> 01:13:51,104
Yesterday, it was cockles. Today, it's abalone.

1715
01:13:51,734 --> 01:13:55,575
(He leaves the abalones to Hyun Chul.)

1716
01:13:56,035 --> 01:13:58,505
Let's blanch the conches.

1717
01:13:58,505 --> 01:14:00,674
- Okay.
- To put in the raw fish soup.

1718
01:14:00,674 --> 01:14:03,285
- Okay, sounds good.
- We'll blanch it.

1719
01:14:03,684 --> 01:14:05,785
- If that's cool, - Yes.

1720
01:14:05,884 --> 01:14:07,814
- take the fish...
- Take the meat off the bones?

1721
01:14:07,814 --> 01:14:11,455
- That's right. I knew it.
- Sounds good.

1722
01:14:12,184 --> 01:14:13,594
You're a genius.

1723
01:14:14,394 --> 01:14:16,665
- I'll take the meat off.
- I should give you pretty ones.

1724
01:14:17,064 --> 01:14:18,394
I'll be right back.

1725
01:14:18,394 --> 01:14:19,724
I'll plate it...

1726
01:14:20,995 --> 01:14:22,934
in a pretty way too.

1727
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:27,705
(She tears them apart...)

1728
01:14:28,274 --> 01:14:29,945
(and places them on a bed of vegetables.)

1729
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:31,075
This is really nice.

1730
01:14:31,075 --> 01:14:32,104
(She places them on a bed of vegetables.)

1731
01:14:32,974 --> 01:14:34,375
(Sniffing)

1732
01:14:35,174 --> 01:14:37,184
- It smells really good.
- Doesn't it?

1733
01:14:37,585 --> 01:14:39,684
It'll go great with some rice in water.

1734
01:14:40,755 --> 01:14:43,655
I blanched it to put it in the cold raw fish soup.

1735
01:14:45,085 --> 01:14:47,255
(He cuts the conches up...)

1736
01:14:47,255 --> 01:14:51,064
(to put in the cold raw fish soup.)

1737
01:14:51,424 --> 01:14:54,094
This is enough.

1738
01:14:54,564 --> 01:14:56,564
(I'm done cutting the conches for the cold raw fish soup.)

1739
01:14:56,564 --> 01:14:57,634
Okay.

1740
01:14:58,835 --> 01:14:59,974
When you're done with the abalones,

1741
01:14:59,974 --> 01:15:01,734
- give them to me.
- Okay.

1742
01:15:03,445 --> 01:15:07,075
(He washes the dishes as he waits for the abalones.)

1743
01:15:07,474 --> 01:15:10,514
(Does he need more time?)

1744
01:15:10,884 --> 01:15:13,585
(His back should sting.)

1745
01:15:14,585 --> 01:15:16,785
(Slowly)

1746
01:15:17,655 --> 01:15:19,085
Do you need more time, Hyun Chul?

1747
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,524
I'm taking out the teeth.

1748
01:15:21,524 --> 01:15:22,724
(I'm taking out the teeth.)

1749
01:15:22,724 --> 01:15:24,365
- What are you taking out?
- The abalone's teeth.

1750
01:15:24,365 --> 01:15:26,465
- He's taking out the teeth.
- I see.

1751
01:15:26,865 --> 01:15:29,835
You're very meticulous, slow, and take a lot of time.

1752
01:15:30,634 --> 01:15:32,634
I'm not fit for TV shows. Right?

1753
01:15:32,634 --> 01:15:34,174
(He feels bad.)

1754
01:15:34,575 --> 01:15:36,705
You're an expert, so it's inevitable.

1755
01:15:37,705 --> 01:15:40,575
No. You're detailed.

1756
01:15:41,445 --> 01:15:44,115
(He goes back to preparing it.)

1757
01:15:44,344 --> 01:15:46,655
(Focused)

1758
01:15:50,825 --> 01:15:52,955
(He gets self-conscious.)

1759
01:15:52,955 --> 01:15:54,755
- Take your time. It's okay.
- Okay.

1760
01:15:55,524 --> 01:15:57,564
You're really good at removing the shell.

1761
01:15:57,965 --> 01:16:00,335
You're paying me attention. You're really watching me.

1762
01:16:00,335 --> 01:16:01,535
(Embarrassed)

1763
01:16:01,535 --> 01:16:02,535
I'm serious.

1764
01:16:03,564 --> 01:16:06,405
- The abalones are ready.
- Okay.

1765
01:16:06,405 --> 01:16:09,405
(They're really clean.)

1766
01:16:09,835 --> 01:16:11,375
Good job.

1767
01:16:12,505 --> 01:16:15,075
Is there a way to take the meat off the bone?

1768
01:16:15,274 --> 01:16:18,715
Oh, this? Take the fin of it off first.

1769
01:16:19,314 --> 01:16:20,384
Take the fin off.

1770
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:23,924
If you do it carefully like this...

1771
01:16:24,224 --> 01:16:25,255
(Yellow corvina, 1 combo)

1772
01:16:25,955 --> 01:16:26,995
(Yellow corvina, 2 combo)

1773
01:16:27,325 --> 01:16:28,394
(Yellow corvina, 3 combo)

1774
01:16:29,054 --> 01:16:31,264
- This is pretty fun.
- Isn't it?

1775
01:16:31,594 --> 01:16:33,665
Don't you get really focused?

1776
01:16:33,665 --> 01:16:35,234
This suits me too.

1777
01:16:36,965 --> 01:16:38,064
(The things that suit him.)

1778
01:16:38,064 --> 01:16:41,174
(Peeling fruit)

1779
01:16:41,634 --> 01:16:45,505
(Taking various shellfish out of its shell)

1780
01:16:45,505 --> 01:16:47,575
You're really good at taking the abalone out.

1781
01:16:47,575 --> 01:16:49,915
You didn't even pop any innards.

1782
01:16:50,085 --> 01:16:52,445
(Tearing apart the dried yellow corvina)

1783
01:16:52,445 --> 01:16:56,354
(He likes delicate tasks you must do with your hands.)

1784
01:16:56,615 --> 01:16:58,625
(Aside from putting lugworms on the hook.)

1785
01:16:58,724 --> 01:17:01,155
(Crying)

1786
01:17:01,495 --> 01:17:03,465
Why won't this reel in?

1787
01:17:03,465 --> 01:17:05,825
(Snapping)

1788
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:09,434
(He was frustrated when he was fishing.)

1789
01:17:09,434 --> 01:17:10,535
(Tripping)

1790
01:17:11,365 --> 01:17:13,634
So fishing is the only thing that doesn't suit you.

1791
01:17:13,634 --> 01:17:15,405
(He's happy now.)

1792
01:17:16,405 --> 01:17:17,844
I want to eat a piece.

1793
01:17:17,844 --> 01:17:19,905
Go ahead. Eat a piece.

1794
01:17:20,075 --> 01:17:23,115
You're supposed to taste the food you're making.

1795
01:17:23,344 --> 01:17:25,585
(His eyes open wide.)

1796
01:17:25,585 --> 01:17:26,644
Is it salty?

1797
01:17:27,115 --> 01:17:28,184
It's really good.

1798
01:17:28,955 --> 01:17:30,724
(How cute.)

1799
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:33,594
This is really savory.

1800
01:17:33,594 --> 01:17:36,795
I wonder who came up with the idea to dry this.

1801
01:17:36,795 --> 01:17:38,665
(He takes another bite.)

1802
01:17:39,024 --> 01:17:43,035
(He's self-conscious after eating it.)

1803
01:17:43,705 --> 01:17:45,604
- Do you want to try it?
- Yes.

1804
01:17:46,064 --> 01:17:48,035
(Woo Hee takes a bite too.)

1805
01:17:48,575 --> 01:17:49,604
(Exclaiming)

1806
01:17:51,104 --> 01:17:52,844
You can't stop once you start.

1807
01:17:52,844 --> 01:17:54,245
(Things are peaceful as they debone the fish.)

1808
01:17:54,514 --> 01:17:57,844
(Meanwhile, Dong Il...)

1809
01:17:58,184 --> 01:18:01,854
(is cutting the abalones for the cold raw fish soup.)

1810
01:18:02,115 --> 01:18:04,224
Should I help you cut them?

1811
01:18:04,224 --> 01:18:05,455
You can do that.

1812
01:18:06,024 --> 01:18:08,224
(The assistant chef, Myoung, stands next to him.)

1813
01:18:08,224 --> 01:18:09,755
Myoung. Cut them into thin slices.

1814
01:18:10,264 --> 01:18:11,394
- Okay.
- In long slices like this.

1815
01:18:12,724 --> 01:18:15,695
- Oh, like that? Vertically.
- Like this.

1816
01:18:15,695 --> 01:18:17,165
(The youngest copies...)

1817
01:18:17,165 --> 01:18:20,634
(and pastes what the oldest is doing.)

1818
01:18:20,634 --> 01:18:24,045
(The youngest has perfect chemistry with the youngest.)

1819
01:18:24,045 --> 01:18:26,445
(He looks out the window.)

1820
01:18:26,814 --> 01:18:28,774
Isn't your fishing rod moving?

1821
01:18:28,915 --> 01:18:30,144
It looks like it's bending down.

1822
01:18:30,745 --> 01:18:32,184
- Really?
- Take a look.

1823
01:18:32,184 --> 01:18:34,215
- Oh, really?
- Go take a look.

1824
01:18:35,484 --> 01:18:36,585
Should I go check?

1825
01:18:36,955 --> 01:18:38,955
- Go check.
- Let me just go check.

1826
01:18:38,955 --> 01:18:40,394
(He acts like he's giving in.)

1827
01:18:40,394 --> 01:18:42,155
I'll just go check.

1828
01:18:42,155 --> 01:18:43,724
(The Fishing King goes to check on the fishing rod.)

1829
01:18:43,965 --> 01:18:45,665
(The confident silhouette of the Fishing King)

1830
01:18:45,665 --> 01:18:47,295
(Humming)

1831
01:18:47,965 --> 01:18:49,634
(He can't hide his envy.)

1832
01:18:49,634 --> 01:18:51,264
(What about my fishing rod?)

1833
01:18:51,365 --> 01:18:54,634
(Quiet)

1834
01:18:55,035 --> 01:18:56,274
This big one.

1835
01:18:56,274 --> 01:18:57,604
(He feels restless.)

1836
01:18:57,604 --> 01:18:58,945
Like this.

1837
01:18:59,339 --> 01:19:01,408
- Youngest.
- Yes?

1838
01:19:01,809 --> 01:19:04,719
Do you like perilla leaves in your cold raw fish soup?

1839
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,019
Or should I not put it in?

1840
01:19:07,549 --> 01:19:09,349
- I like perilla leaves.
- Really?

1841
01:19:10,559 --> 01:19:11,618
What about lettuce?

1842
01:19:12,089 --> 01:19:13,118
I like lettuce too.

1843
01:19:13,358 --> 01:19:14,889
(He sounds so sad.)

1844
01:19:16,028 --> 01:19:17,059
Myoung.

1845
01:19:18,198 --> 01:19:21,229
Are you sad because you didn't catch anything?

1846
01:19:21,528 --> 01:19:24,498
(Dazed Gong Myoung)

1847
01:19:24,868 --> 01:19:27,469
- How did you know?
- Your voice is weak.

1848
01:19:28,368 --> 01:19:30,339
- Totally.
- Right.

1849
01:19:30,538 --> 01:19:33,849
It was your first time today, so you can do better next time.

1850
01:19:34,248 --> 01:19:36,919
(The youngest's fishing luck will come next time.)

1851
01:19:37,419 --> 01:19:41,719
(Meanwhile, the House on Wheel's expert fisherman gets to the rods.)

1852
01:19:42,849 --> 01:19:46,488
(He carefully reels it in.)

1853
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:49,828
(Did I catch something?)

1854
01:19:50,858 --> 01:19:53,458
(He caught something!)

1855
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:54,998
I caught something.

1856
01:19:56,429 --> 01:20:00,439
(One mudskipper)

1857
01:20:01,038 --> 01:20:03,368
I caught something without realizing it.

1858
01:20:03,368 --> 01:20:05,179
(He caught a fish just by leaving his rod there.)

1859
01:20:05,179 --> 01:20:06,278
Goodness.

1860
01:20:06,879 --> 01:20:08,608
I should take this back with me.

1861
01:20:08,608 --> 01:20:10,919
(He's ready to brag.)

1862
01:20:11,278 --> 01:20:14,849
(His steps look excited.)

1863
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:18,389
(Ringing)

1864
01:20:19,519 --> 01:20:21,988
He caught a fish.

1865
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:24,958
No way.

1866
01:20:25,698 --> 01:20:26,729
Is it big?

1867
01:20:27,568 --> 01:20:29,229
He caught something.

1868
01:20:29,898 --> 01:20:32,299
- You're amazing.
- He's amazing.

1869
01:20:32,299 --> 01:20:33,439
(So jealous)

1870
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:37,778
You're amazing.

1871
01:20:37,979 --> 01:20:40,139
Why are you so good at catching fish?

1872
01:20:40,648 --> 01:20:42,349
How can you say he caught that?

1873
01:20:42,349 --> 01:20:43,919
He left it there, and the fish bit.

1874
01:20:43,919 --> 01:20:45,078
Even still.

1875
01:20:45,078 --> 01:20:47,049
You said we're supposed to leave it.

1876
01:20:47,948 --> 01:20:49,889
See? I told you to look at it.

1877
01:20:50,288 --> 01:20:52,259
You're the one who caught this.

1878
01:20:52,259 --> 01:20:53,288
Congratulations.

1879
01:20:53,288 --> 01:20:54,988
(Gosh, congratulations.)

1880
01:20:55,629 --> 01:20:57,698
He's comforting me like that.

1881
01:20:58,129 --> 01:21:00,198
(They get along very well.)

1882
01:21:00,568 --> 01:21:03,868
(The 2 are done deboning the fish.)

1883
01:21:04,599 --> 01:21:06,299
- Done!
- We're done.

1884
01:21:06,498 --> 01:21:07,568
We're done.

1885
01:21:08,139 --> 01:21:09,208
The end!

1886
01:21:09,208 --> 01:21:10,509
(They're done deboning the fish together.)

1887
01:21:10,509 --> 01:21:11,979
We're done.

1888
01:21:13,979 --> 01:21:16,908
(It already looks delicious.)

1889
01:21:17,248 --> 01:21:19,379
Do you like lettuce in your cold raw fish soup?

1890
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:22,689
I love everything. I love all vegetables.

1891
01:21:22,948 --> 01:21:26,358
We make whatever the guest wants.

1892
01:21:26,788 --> 01:21:28,629
(He adds a lot of lettuce which Woo Hee likes.)

1893
01:21:28,889 --> 01:21:31,299
Do you eat cold raw fish soup with or without perilla leaves?

1894
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:32,929
I eat it with perilla leaves.

1895
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:36,028
(He makes it according to what his guests want.)

1896
01:21:36,028 --> 01:21:38,198
It looked good on TV,

1897
01:21:38,198 --> 01:21:39,799
but seeing it in person is even better.

1898
01:21:40,139 --> 01:21:43,908
(The key to the spicy and sweet sauce is gochujang with vinegar.)

1899
01:21:43,908 --> 01:21:46,108
That looks delicious. I can't believe it.

1900
01:21:47,509 --> 01:21:49,509
How can this not taste good?

1901
01:21:49,509 --> 01:21:50,679
(He even adds fresh raw fish caught in Namhae.)

1902
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:51,719
It's impossible.

1903
01:21:52,019 --> 01:21:54,818
(He pours some lemon-lime soda into the sauce...)

1904
01:21:55,089 --> 01:21:56,389
(and mixes it to create the familiar taste.)

1905
01:21:56,389 --> 01:21:57,858
That looks so good.

1906
01:21:59,358 --> 01:22:00,988
(Spicy and sweet cold raw fish soup with fresh seafood)

1907
01:22:00,988 --> 01:22:02,988
That's incredible.

1908
01:22:03,658 --> 01:22:06,498
(He goes right into making the octopus soup.)

1909
01:22:06,729 --> 01:22:08,068
Here's the radish.

1910
01:22:08,068 --> 01:22:09,269
(Here's the radish for the broth.)

1911
01:22:09,528 --> 01:22:11,698
Are you going to eat the radish in the octopus soup?

1912
01:22:11,698 --> 01:22:13,809
Should I just use it for the broth?

1913
01:22:14,408 --> 01:22:16,439
- Hyun Chul. What do you think?
- Yes?

1914
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:17,509
- What do you think?
- Okay.

1915
01:22:20,009 --> 01:22:21,278
Be clear.

1916
01:22:21,278 --> 01:22:24,448
I like to eat it in big chunks too.

1917
01:22:24,448 --> 01:22:26,179
You're so high-maintenance.

1918
01:22:26,179 --> 01:22:27,748
(Kidding)

1919
01:22:28,049 --> 01:22:30,248
(Laughing)

1920
01:22:31,358 --> 01:22:34,658
(Although he says that, he begins preparing the radish.)

1921
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:35,858
Should I do that?

1922
01:22:36,629 --> 01:22:38,458
In big pieces?

1923
01:22:38,629 --> 01:22:39,858
Yes. Gosh, Dong Il.

1924
01:22:39,858 --> 01:22:42,028
- Tell me what you want.
- Yes. In big pieces.

1925
01:22:42,028 --> 01:22:44,398
- Long, or...
- Like this.

1926
01:22:44,398 --> 01:22:45,599
- Like this?
- Yes.

1927
01:22:45,599 --> 01:22:46,698
- This thick?
- Yes.

1928
01:22:46,969 --> 01:22:49,108
- Will three pieces be enough?
- Yes.

1929
01:22:49,839 --> 01:22:51,309
- Like this?
- Yes.

1930
01:22:53,849 --> 01:22:54,908
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

1931
01:22:54,908 --> 01:22:55,908
(He checks again.)

1932
01:22:57,349 --> 01:22:58,519
Thank you.

1933
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:02,118
(Do everything your heart desires.)

1934
01:23:02,589 --> 01:23:05,589
(This will make the broth for the octopus soup refreshing.)

1935
01:23:05,618 --> 01:23:08,358
(After he adds the big pieces of radish, the broth is ready to cook.)

1936
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:09,988
Take out the garlic.

1937
01:23:09,988 --> 01:23:12,158
- The minced garlic?
- Yes.

1938
01:23:15,269 --> 01:23:19,469
(He accidentally adds too much garlic.)

1939
01:23:20,269 --> 01:23:21,509
Oh, darn it.

1940
01:23:22,469 --> 01:23:23,639
What? Doenjang?

1941
01:23:23,639 --> 01:23:25,738
No. I put too much in.

1942
01:23:25,738 --> 01:23:26,979
"Oh, darn it".

1943
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:29,708
(Goodness)

1944
01:23:30,009 --> 01:23:31,118
What?

1945
01:23:31,648 --> 01:23:33,519
He said, "Oh, darn it." and you replied with, "Doenjang?"

1946
01:23:33,519 --> 01:23:35,118
(He still doesn't understand what's going on.)

1947
01:23:36,219 --> 01:23:37,389
(Exclaiming)

1948
01:23:37,618 --> 01:23:38,689
What is it?

1949
01:23:38,689 --> 01:23:40,318
(Myoung is a bit out of it after fishing.)

1950
01:23:41,229 --> 01:23:43,358
(I'm not tired.)

1951
01:23:43,528 --> 01:23:44,658
You exclaimed.

1952
01:23:45,059 --> 01:23:48,198
(You're tired, aren't you?)

1953
01:23:48,868 --> 01:23:50,429
Can you move the lettuce?

1954
01:23:50,839 --> 01:23:52,238
- Move the lettuce?
- Yes.

1955
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:53,269
Okay.

1956
01:23:53,538 --> 01:23:55,868
- What is it?
- Nothing.

1957
01:23:56,839 --> 01:23:58,009
Are you laughing at me?

1958
01:23:58,009 --> 01:23:59,038
(He pretends to be mad.)

1959
01:23:59,708 --> 01:24:01,879
When you talk,

1960
01:24:01,879 --> 01:24:03,479
you sound excited, but...

1961
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:04,479
- Yes?
- There's some water parsley.

1962
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:06,748
(He reacts as quick as lightning.)

1963
01:24:06,748 --> 01:24:07,889
Can you take the water parsley...

1964
01:24:10,248 --> 01:24:13,259
It's right here. It's above you, Myoung.

1965
01:24:13,259 --> 01:24:14,759
- You're good at finding things.
- Of course.

1966
01:24:14,759 --> 01:24:16,288
Rinse them. Wash the water parsley.

1967
01:24:16,288 --> 01:24:17,328
Okay.

1968
01:24:17,328 --> 01:24:19,828
(He's trying to bring up his energy.)

1969
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:21,469
It'll become refreshing.

1970
01:24:22,198 --> 01:24:24,939
(His goofing-off time isn't over yet.)

1971
01:24:25,169 --> 01:24:27,439
(How funny.)

1972
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:29,208
How should I wash the water parsley?

1973
01:24:29,608 --> 01:24:32,408
We're going to blanch it at the end,

1974
01:24:32,538 --> 01:24:34,708
so wash it as thoroughly as possible.

1975
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:36,009
Should I?

1976
01:24:36,009 --> 01:24:38,248
I really like water parsley, so...

1977
01:24:39,148 --> 01:24:41,318
Put it under here. Under that.

1978
01:24:42,648 --> 01:24:46,858
(He cuts them into bite-sized pieces.)

1979
01:24:47,189 --> 01:24:48,189
(The oldest cuts...)

1980
01:24:48,189 --> 01:24:49,559
Okay. That's good.

1981
01:24:50,189 --> 01:24:52,458
I knew it. I can't do this without you.

1982
01:24:53,528 --> 01:24:55,169
(After placing them nicely in the basket...)

1983
01:24:55,169 --> 01:24:57,068
Gosh, the water parsley smells great.

1984
01:24:57,068 --> 01:24:58,698
Isn't it fresh?

1985
01:24:58,698 --> 01:25:00,299
(They can smell the fresh scent of the water parsley.)

1986
01:25:00,769 --> 01:25:02,809
We should begin setting things up.

1987
01:25:02,809 --> 01:25:04,809
- The octopus soup cooks quickly.
- Okay.

1988
01:25:05,479 --> 01:25:07,408
Myoung, can you take this?

1989
01:25:07,408 --> 01:25:08,408
Okay.

1990
01:25:09,379 --> 01:25:10,618
(Just looking at him makes her laugh.)

1991
01:25:10,618 --> 01:25:11,778
Where should I put this?

1992
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:14,948
Goodness. Good job!

1993
01:25:17,889 --> 01:25:20,419
- Why? Do you feel bad for me?
- Yes.

1994
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:22,528
What's up, Dong Il?

1995
01:25:22,528 --> 01:25:24,198
(She sets the table.)

1996
01:25:24,198 --> 01:25:25,898
- Take this...
- Yes?

1997
01:25:26,328 --> 01:25:27,469
(They begin to set the table with the meal they prepared together.)

1998
01:25:27,469 --> 01:25:28,769
That looks incredible.

1999
01:25:29,929 --> 01:25:31,898
Everyone takes one each. Okay?

2000
01:25:33,068 --> 01:25:34,139
(He adds the long-legged octopus.)

2001
01:25:34,139 --> 01:25:35,139
Goodness.

2002
01:25:37,009 --> 01:25:38,238
(They even have octopus soup made on the spot.)

2003
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:39,879
That looks so good.

2004
01:25:40,578 --> 01:25:43,809
(The filling dinner is complete.)

2005
01:25:44,367 --> 01:25:46,367
I'm going to end up eating a lot again.

2006
01:25:47,037 --> 01:25:48,207
I can't believe this.

2007
01:25:48,777 --> 01:25:50,638
- This is crazy.
- Abalones, conches...

2008
01:25:50,638 --> 01:25:51,877
(From the cold raw fish soup with abalone and conches...)

2009
01:25:53,407 --> 01:25:55,848
There's no way this won't be delicious.

2010
01:25:56,277 --> 01:25:58,548
I think today's best dish is the octopus soup.

2011
01:25:58,548 --> 01:26:00,218
The long-legged octopus are incredibly fresh.

2012
01:26:00,747 --> 01:26:03,987
(A dinner from the ocean garden at the end of the country)

2013
01:26:03,987 --> 01:26:05,027
Eat up.

2014
01:26:05,027 --> 01:26:07,997
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2015
01:26:09,327 --> 01:26:11,898
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

2016
01:26:12,598 --> 01:26:13,928
Oh, my.

2017
01:26:13,928 --> 01:26:14,997
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

2018
01:26:15,298 --> 01:26:17,037
(Woo Hee takes a big bite.)

2019
01:26:17,037 --> 01:26:18,068
(Exclaiming)

2020
01:26:18,068 --> 01:26:20,138
- How is it?
- It's good.

2021
01:26:21,438 --> 01:26:22,608
- Here.
- Thank you.

2022
01:26:22,608 --> 01:26:24,037
(Hyun Chul quietly takes a bite.)

2023
01:26:24,037 --> 01:26:27,008
(Nodding)

2024
01:26:27,648 --> 01:26:32,388
It's refreshing and sweet which is why it's so good.

2025
01:26:32,818 --> 01:26:35,318
I made it sweeter to fit your palates.

2026
01:26:35,318 --> 01:26:37,487
(I made it sweeter to fit your palates.)

2027
01:26:37,787 --> 01:26:39,157
This is a father's love.

2028
01:26:39,157 --> 01:26:41,827
(Chef Sung's refreshing and sweet cold raw fish soup!)

2029
01:26:43,558 --> 01:26:48,337
(Woo Hee has fallen in love with Chef Sung's cold raw fish soup.)

2030
01:26:48,337 --> 01:26:49,867
(Kicking)

2031
01:26:49,867 --> 01:26:52,837
(Her mouth and her feet are working hard.)

2032
01:26:53,968 --> 01:26:56,978
(I'm in such a good mood.)

2033
01:26:58,108 --> 01:27:01,348
It would've been even better if we caught this fish ourselves.

2034
01:27:02,277 --> 01:27:04,247
(He just laughs.)

2035
01:27:04,247 --> 01:27:06,048
Then we never would've eaten.

2036
01:27:07,657 --> 01:27:10,117
I should've caught you a big fish.

2037
01:27:10,117 --> 01:27:11,728
(He's filled with regrets.)

2038
01:27:12,457 --> 01:27:15,197
(How cute.)

2039
01:27:15,558 --> 01:27:17,598
I'm excited about the octopus soup.

2040
01:27:18,568 --> 01:27:20,428
- I think the soup will be good.
- I know.

2041
01:27:20,428 --> 01:27:23,037
(Another ambitious dish, octopus soup)

2042
01:27:23,298 --> 01:27:24,907
I'm going to bring another one.

2043
01:27:25,237 --> 01:27:26,837
I'll bring some more gochujang with vinegar.

2044
01:27:26,837 --> 01:27:29,938
(Hee Won suddenly goes inside the house.)

2045
01:27:32,678 --> 01:27:34,318
(Scraping)

2046
01:27:34,747 --> 01:27:39,048
(Is he doing the dishes all of a sudden?)

2047
01:27:40,048 --> 01:27:41,587
I cleaned my bowl.

2048
01:27:44,888 --> 01:27:46,827
(He did the dishes?)

2049
01:27:46,827 --> 01:27:48,758
I want to enjoy the octopus soup...

2050
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:51,367
without anything mixing in with it.

2051
01:27:52,468 --> 01:27:55,398
(My brother knows how to eat.)

2052
01:27:55,798 --> 01:27:58,068
I think the octopus soup will be the best dish today.

2053
01:27:58,808 --> 01:28:01,308
I didn't season it. I just added a bit of salt.

2054
01:28:01,308 --> 01:28:02,938
(It's not seasoned, so you never know.)

2055
01:28:04,037 --> 01:28:05,077
That's good.

2056
01:28:05,077 --> 01:28:08,777
(He fills it with some warm soup.)

2057
01:28:08,777 --> 01:28:11,018
Gosh, the long-legged octopus are really fresh.

2058
01:28:11,018 --> 01:28:13,617
(Once he takes out the octopus,)

2059
01:28:14,457 --> 01:28:18,188
(and cuts it into the bowl, a bowl of octopus soup is ready.)

2060
01:28:18,787 --> 01:28:20,027
(How does the octopus soup taste?)

2061
01:28:20,027 --> 01:28:23,558
(This looks good.)

2062
01:28:24,867 --> 01:28:25,898
Right.

2063
01:28:26,697 --> 01:28:28,037
(Slurping)

2064
01:28:28,037 --> 01:28:29,138
A little bit?

2065
01:28:31,968 --> 01:28:33,468
Is it refreshing because of the water parsley?

2066
01:28:33,468 --> 01:28:34,638
(Dong Il is curious as to how it tastes.)

2067
01:28:34,638 --> 01:28:35,737
Isn't it bland?

2068
01:28:36,877 --> 01:28:38,877
It's totally bland.

2069
01:28:39,907 --> 01:28:42,318
Of course. I didn't season it on purpose.

2070
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:44,747
Yes, that's why I like it.

2071
01:28:46,617 --> 01:28:47,758
What are you saying?

2072
01:28:48,787 --> 01:28:51,027
(Laughing)

2073
01:28:51,258 --> 01:28:53,428
It's not pungent at all.

2074
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:54,558
(I like that it's neat.)

2075
01:28:54,558 --> 01:28:55,598
Okay.

2076
01:28:57,867 --> 01:28:59,327
(It's tasty!)

2077
01:28:59,527 --> 01:29:02,938
It freshens my mouth. I'm not joking.

2078
01:29:04,638 --> 01:29:05,808
(Surprised)

2079
01:29:05,808 --> 01:29:07,138
It freshens your mouth.

2080
01:29:08,808 --> 01:29:11,048
(Trying a piece of the long-legged octopus)

2081
01:29:11,907 --> 01:29:17,218
(Dipping it in chojang)

2082
01:29:18,447 --> 01:29:20,447
(Try it!)

2083
01:29:20,447 --> 01:29:21,758
It's so tender.

2084
01:29:21,758 --> 01:29:23,587
(Me too.)

2085
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:26,058
Delicious.

2086
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:27,898
The water parsley is...

2087
01:29:27,898 --> 01:29:29,858
(The youngest wraps it in water parsley.)

2088
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:32,068
We have a lot of water parsley. Help yourself.

2089
01:29:32,068 --> 01:29:33,468
Eat it while it's still warm.

2090
01:29:34,968 --> 01:29:36,268
You should have some too.

2091
01:29:39,308 --> 01:29:40,367
You're really...

2092
01:29:40,367 --> 01:29:42,537
(Here.)

2093
01:29:43,037 --> 01:29:45,108
He only talks the talk.

2094
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:47,777
You have to give it to me.

2095
01:29:47,777 --> 01:29:49,478
How will I eat it when I'm holding all these?

2096
01:29:50,117 --> 01:29:51,348
Have some.

2097
01:29:51,348 --> 01:29:53,747
(Have some.)

2098
01:29:54,318 --> 01:29:56,587
(Bursting into laughter)

2099
01:29:57,218 --> 01:29:58,228
(Laughing)

2100
01:29:58,228 --> 01:30:02,197
(They start laughing at the table because of Hee Won's disobedience.)

2101
01:30:02,197 --> 01:30:05,167
I can't wait to try this.

2102
01:30:05,167 --> 01:30:06,268
Yes.

2103
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:08,867
Take as much rice as you want.

2104
01:30:09,438 --> 01:30:10,697
What's this thing?

2105
01:30:12,308 --> 01:30:15,037
This is the famous gochujang yellow corvina.

2106
01:30:15,777 --> 01:30:16,837
Try it.

2107
01:30:16,837 --> 01:30:18,247
You can soak it with water.

2108
01:30:18,247 --> 01:30:21,117
(All side dishes that go well with rice are here.)

2109
01:30:22,318 --> 01:30:23,478
It goes well with rice.

2110
01:30:24,178 --> 01:30:25,218
That's right.

2111
01:30:26,888 --> 01:30:30,688
(The combination of gochujang yellow corvina and green tea rice)

2112
01:30:30,688 --> 01:30:31,858
It's so scrumptious.

2113
01:30:34,858 --> 01:30:36,027
Isn't it good?

2114
01:30:37,457 --> 01:30:40,497
(Strongly agreeing)

2115
01:30:40,997 --> 01:30:43,537
I like its sticky texture.

2116
01:30:43,537 --> 01:30:44,608
Yes.

2117
01:30:44,938 --> 01:30:48,008
I can't put my spoon down because it's so tasty.

2118
01:30:48,008 --> 01:30:49,237
(The members are focused on dinner.)

2119
01:30:50,777 --> 01:30:52,478
Now I can see the ocean.

2120
01:30:54,777 --> 01:30:57,048
The sun has set as we were eating.

2121
01:30:59,117 --> 01:31:00,848
I didn't even realize it.

2122
01:31:02,318 --> 01:31:04,117
(They finally see the front yard after they're full.)

2123
01:31:04,117 --> 01:31:05,987
Doesn't this place have such a good view?

2124
01:31:05,987 --> 01:31:09,228
It's a great view. And it hits different.

2125
01:31:09,228 --> 01:31:10,758
(At the front yard with the setting sun,)

2126
01:31:12,527 --> 01:31:15,798
(they enjoy delicious food...)

2127
01:31:15,798 --> 01:31:21,808
(and spend time with good friends.)

2128
01:31:23,178 --> 01:31:25,447
- Isn't it nice?
- It is.

2129
01:31:25,608 --> 01:31:26,707
For a day...

2130
01:31:26,707 --> 01:31:30,617
No, two days. This amazing place and delicious food.

2131
01:31:31,048 --> 01:31:33,087
I think it'll linger in my memory for a long time.

2132
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:35,188
It can't get any more perfect than this.

2133
01:31:35,188 --> 01:31:36,258
(I'll remember it for a long time.)

2134
01:31:36,258 --> 01:31:38,258
I got to know great people.

2135
01:31:38,258 --> 01:31:40,358
(The special connection on House on Wheels 3)

2136
01:31:40,957 --> 01:31:42,657
- Are you all in the shot?
- Yes.

2137
01:31:43,398 --> 01:31:44,898
In 1, 2, 3.

2138
01:31:44,898 --> 01:31:46,827
(They capture the moment in a photo.)

2139
01:31:47,697 --> 01:31:52,737
(We hope you cherish it for a long time.)

2140
01:31:54,777 --> 01:31:56,308
(I'm feeling lonely on this trip.)

2141
01:31:56,808 --> 01:31:59,648
(You become sentimental in late fall.)

2142
01:32:01,377 --> 01:32:03,318
(The two guests to fill the void)

2143

2144
01:32:07,348 --> 01:32:10,117
(Genuinely taken aback)

2145
01:32:10,117 --> 01:32:12,027
(Ji Hoon's gifts that surprised everyone)

2146

(Put your faith in me today.)

(I shall fatten you.)

2149
01:32:21,068 --> 01:32:23,438
(Bold performances...)

2150
01:32:23,438 --> 01:32:25,667
(and great with fans)

2151

(I have to take a picture!)

2152

2157
01:32:39,718 --> 01:32:40,987
(Moaning)
