00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Episode 2

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Eunuch Gao, I have something to say.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let me.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Eunuch Gao, I just came to the new store.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't know what to do.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Eunuch Gao is in charge of the store.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I will definitely follow your instructions.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who cares about your money?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Enough.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You are smart.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Be honest with me.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Don't cause any trouble.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Ever since you left the herbal medicine bureau,

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
they have been making things difficult for me.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Later, they told me

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
that you were a prostitute.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They have been making things difficult for me.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Later, they made a mistake

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and sent me here.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ru Yi, I am the one who got you into trouble.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Ling Yu, don't say that.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I am the one who got you into trouble.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You don't know that after my mother died,

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
you were the only one who protected me.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If it wasn't for you,

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I wouldn't know how I have been doing.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I heard that

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
there is a master's grace every spring.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hang in there.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Find a chance to ask for the master's grace.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Maybe you can leave the new store.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If you are lucky,

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you might be able to leave the harem earlier.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We are just a small house in the new store.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Who cares about the master?

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Even if there is grace,

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
no one cares about the master.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No one cares about us.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But,

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I am not afraid of you being by my side.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't worry.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I will protect you.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
From now on,

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I will protect you

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
so that they won't dare to bully you again.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I won't let those who dare to bully us

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
go.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The Master's Grace

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Listen.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I will push her into the well.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If she struggles,

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
help me to hold her.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Eunuch Gao,

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I will help you get rid of the harem.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You have to keep your word.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You must beg Her Highness to help me

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and help me get out of the new store.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't worry.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Once it's done,

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
you will be rewarded.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Thank you, Eunuch Gao.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What are you doing?

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Help!

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let go!

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Help!

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hurry up!

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Do you want to leave the new store?

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Help!

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let go!

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let go!

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Help!

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hurry up!

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let go!

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Use your strength! How could you...

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Chief Wu,

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
why are you here in the new store?

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How dare you

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
dare to kill people in the palace?

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Take her out

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and kill her!

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Chief Wu, please spare me!

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Chief Wu, please spare me!

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Eunuch Gao threatened me!

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If I don't go,

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
he will throw me into the well!

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's Her Highness!

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's Her Highness!

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's Eunuch Jiang who killed her!

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Eunuch Gao killed people!

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's none of my business!

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was also threatened!

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Sir.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Take her out

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and pay 30,000 taels.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Chief Wu, please spare me!

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes!

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Thank you, sir.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If you didn't arrive in time,

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I would have died in the well.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Since you have died once,

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
remember it.

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sir.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Your Highness,

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
you're the only one who can fight against Consort Wan.

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You and Shisi Ya

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
are my only hope.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's a pity

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
that you didn't like Lv Yu.

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why did Consort Wan kill you?

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Because

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I knew a secret about her.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Even if I didn't know,

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
if she knew who I was,

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
she would still try to kill me.

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Who are you?

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Sir.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That night,

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
you didn't choose me as your wife.

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Tonight,

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
do you want to choose me again?

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're a disabled person.

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Sir,

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
please give me some medicine.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If my wound gets worse,

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
my hands will be broken.

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Will you bear it?

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Just hide yourself.

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can't clean her up

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and you can't clean up.

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If Ling Dang makes a sound,

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll eat you.

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Are you okay?

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Chief Wu's pouch is missing.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He ordered me to search.

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You're the most greedy person in the world.

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You must have stolen it.

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Which eye can you see that I stole it?

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Why are you accusing me?

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's the pouch that was given to you.

149
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If you lose the pouch,

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
everyone will be punished.

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Even if you didn't steal it,

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
you can't escape.

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Really?

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The pouch that His Majesty gave me?

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What are you doing?

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I didn't steal it.

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's here.

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's this pouch.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The evidence is clear.

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You still said you didn't steal it.

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I didn't steal it.

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I really didn't steal it.

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You still want to deny that

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
there are evidence and evidence.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You're being ridiculous.

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Chief Wu just spared your life.

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You even avenged him.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're dead this time.

169
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Liu Yuan, I've let you down.

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I've given up.

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Please forgive me this time.

172
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm just making things difficult for you.

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's my fault.

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I won't do it again.

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Please forgive me.

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Cuiwei,

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
we all come from the same family.

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
For the sake of the Hu family,

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
you had to attack the servants who became the masters.

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You can't just pull other people's hair

181
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
because you're an orphan.

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
There's no such thing in this world.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll warn you one last time.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
From now on,

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
if you dare to bully me again,

186
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll tell Chief Wu

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that you stole the pouch.

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll make sure you die.

189
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I won't do it again.

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I won't do it again.

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I won't bully Ruyi again.

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Your Highness,

193
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
the one in Chengxi Palace

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
seems to have calmed down a lot lately.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Last time, when we were having the Spring Banquet,

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Consort Wan was so lucky

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
that she almost got caught in the fire.

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Naturally, she will be calmer recently.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Your Highness, you mean

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
that Consort Wan put the sword

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
in the five-blooded sword?

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't know.

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I don't know.

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Is it the maid

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
named Lingyun?

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No.

207
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The sword was put by Concubine Zhao

208
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and Consort Wan.

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't understand.

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Consort Wan is very well-calmed.

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
She knows how Concubine Zhao feels.

212
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
She knows that she will

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
use her hard work to pamper her sister.

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So when Consort Wan was in the five-blooded sword,

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
she was so happy.

216
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
She even cut off her foot

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:27,920
and let the maid to do the

218
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The maid beside Wanfen

219
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
is not easy to deal with.

220
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
She even saw through His Majesty's mind.

221
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
She even calmed down a few words

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and saved her own life.

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
She is really smart.

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:54,080
But she has entered the New Bride's

225
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,080
I don't think she will be able to get out of it.

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Master, this is the medicine you asked for.

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's the medicine for the bed.

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Only when she has suffered

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
will she know how to discipline herself.

230
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Greetings, Chief Steward.

231
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Fix this dress.

232
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll give you a bottle of medicine.

233
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You give me medicine.

234
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'll fix your dress.

235
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Okay.

236
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's fair.

237
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There is a embroidery workshop in the palace.

238
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Why don't you get the embroidery workshop to make up for it?

239
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Their craftsmanship is much better than mine.

240
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay.

241
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Here.

242
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll go and get the embroidery workshop.

243
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll go and get the embroidery workshop.

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll go and get the embroidery workshop.

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'll go and get the embroidery workshop.

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So little?

247
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's enough for one person.

248
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Ruyi is also injured.

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Master, look at how well I fixed it.

250
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It should be enough for two bottles of medicine.

251
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can understand

252
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
that you are talking about yourself.

253
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's not easy to get what you want

254
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
for others.

255
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
There are so many true feelings and true memories

256
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
in the palace.

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You'd better take care of yourself.

258
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Master,

259
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
you can get Ruyi out of the New Bride's

260
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and the New Bride's World.

261
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If not,

262
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I can only use your pouch

263
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
to spread the news

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and tell everyone

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
that we are in love

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and we're even in love.

267
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'll see if you can tell me the truth.

268
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You rascal.

269
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Why do you think I would agree?

270
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
A small pouch

271
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
can threaten me.

272
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If you don't agree,

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll have to destroy your reputation.

274
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't have a good reputation.

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Help!

276
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Chief Wu is trying to molest me!

277
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Chief Wu.

278
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Chief Wu.

279
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Chief Wu.

280
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Chief Wu.

281
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Chief Wu.

282
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Chief Wu.

283
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Chief Wu.

284
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Chief Wu.

285
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Chief Wu.

286
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Chief Wu.

287
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Chief Wu.

288
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Chief Wu.

289
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Chief Wu.

290
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Chief Wu.

291
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Chief Wu.

292
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Chief Wu.

293
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Chief Wu.

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Chief Wu.

295
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Chief Wu.

296
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Chief Wu.

297
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Chief Wu.

298
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Chief Wu.

299
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Chief Wu.

300
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Chief Wu.

301
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Chief Wu.

302
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Chief Wu.

303
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Chief Wu.

304
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Chief Wu.

305
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Chief Wu.

306
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Chief Wu.

307
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Chief Wu.

308
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Chief Wu.

309
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Chief Wu.

310
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Chief Wu.

311
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Chief Wu.

312
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Chief Wu.

313
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Chief Wu.

314
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Chief Wu.

00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Chief Wu.

316
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Chief Wu.

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Chief Wu.

Chief Wu.

319
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Chief Wu.

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
