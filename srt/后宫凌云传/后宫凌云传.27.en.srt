Swords of Legends II

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,740
Episode 2

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,920
You are crazy.

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,480
You are crazy.

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,520
Consort Jing asked you to shoot her.

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,280
I'm here to kill you

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,160
for Consort Wan.

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,120
You are really crazy.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,400
You deserve to be the one

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,240
who is in charge of the debt.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,280
I'm still an official now.

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,360
If I die,

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,600
you will be punished.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,760
I don't care at all.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,520
You are now

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,760
the fish that everyone is talking about.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,520
I will torture you to death.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,400
I'm here, Your Majesty.

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,160
Didn't you say

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,480
you wanted to have dinner with me?

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,120
Are you hungry?

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,520
What do you mean?

23
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,200
I sent all the servants

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,360
out of the palace.

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,240
Do you think the bed

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,720
and the floor

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,120
are big enough

28
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,680
for me?

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,160
Your Majesty.

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,920
Let's eat.

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,600
This is the leftover.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,640
Take it away.

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,160
Don't drag me down

34
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
when you are starving.

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,120
You are so mean.

36
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,120
Say it again.

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,200
I'm mean.

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,080
I said it again.

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
What can you do?

40
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,240
How dare you hit me?

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,560
You...

42
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,560
Stop it.

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,360
Your Majesty.

44
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,600
Liu Yun.

45
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm waiting for you to come back.

46
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,720
I didn't expect you to

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,680
make a little servant.

48
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,800
You are so boring.

49
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,680
My Lady.

50
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,920
Ling Yun is so easy to deal with.

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,520
He has been cornered

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,080
and he still treats himself as his master.

53
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,920
He just said he was hungry.

54
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,400
He even hit the bowl.

55
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,640
You are so low-key.

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,840
He has served His Majesty before.

57
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,800
You are just a low-key servant.

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,520
It's not your turn to be wise.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,360
Go and kneel outside.

60
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,120
Go.

61
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,320
Aunt Jiang

62
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,320
was arranged by Consort Jing.

63
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,520
I don't want you to die too soon.

64
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,560
Do you understand?

65
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,680
Don't worry.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,520
I will live well.

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,720
My Lady.

68
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,880
She is your servant after all.

69
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,200
You should visit her at Yongxiu Palace

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,720
and give her some food.

71
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,080
Yes.

72
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,640
Your Highness is the kindest.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,720
Don't let her starve to death.

74
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,400
I can still keep her life.

75
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,480
May I ask

76
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,160
why she is so poor now?

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,080
Consort Jing hasn't fallen off the throne yet.

78
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,200
Everything has changed.

79
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,000
Are you going to deal with Aunt Jiang?

80
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,960
Just keep her.

81
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,440
Don't make her feel too comfortable.

82
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,400
I understand.

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,360
30 milliliters of honey handsome oil sold out in a flash.

84
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,040
I'm afraid you might have a rough day.

85
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,240
It's 20 milliliters of honey handsome oil sold out in a flash.

86
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm afraid you might have a rough day.

87
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,160
I'm afraid you might have a rough day.

88
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,180
explained by Half wanted

89
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,040
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,720
Greetings, Lady Mo.

91
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,040
What do you want me to do?

92
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,200
In your opinion,

93
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
is Lingyun still alive

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,160
in the palace?

95
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,360
Only His Majesty can decide

96
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,840
the life and death of a person in the palace.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,320
As you said,

98
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,800
Lingyun is His Majesty's woman.

99
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Do you know that His Majesty

100
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,280
deliberately ignores Lingyun now?

101
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,680
Does he hope that Lingyun

102
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
can be soft and beg for mercy from her?

103
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,640
Lady Mo,

104
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,040
why do you tell me this?

105
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,280
Now Lingyun has lost her power.

106
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,120
She can't do anything to you.

107
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,240
Indeed.

108
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,040
Even if Lingyun is favored,

109
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,720
she is still a strong woman.

110
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,320
She used His Majesty's love

111
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,880
to deal with Concubine Sourire.

112
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,440
We are proud of His Majesty.

113
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
Why don't we accept

114
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,880
that others are not pure to him?

115
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,240
You are smart.

116
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,360
My next target

117
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,920
is Lady Jing, who is above all.

118
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Chief Steward Wu,

119
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,360
should we cooperate together?

120
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,880
Lady, you are joking.

121
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,720
I am His Majesty's man.

122
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,640
I should share the burden

123
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,080
of the other masters in the harem

124
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,600
and talk about cooperation.

125
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,720
What Chief Steward Wu has done recently

126
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,040
has caused everyone in the harem to be afraid.

127
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,560
It's all for His Majesty.

128
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,520
Lady, if there is nothing else,

129
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,840
I will take my leave.

130
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,680
Xiaojian.

131
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,640
I am here.

132
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,360
I heard that Lingyun is sick

133
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,920
and drinks rice soup every day.

134
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,440
Go to the Imperial Hospital

135
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,800
and get some medicine for her.

136
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,160
Don't let her die.

137
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,160
Yes.

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,760
Your Highness.

139
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,920
I just got a report from Chengxi Palace.

140
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,320
As you expected,

141
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Lady Mu

142
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,800
really wants to cooperate with Chief Steward Wu.

143
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,000
Did she agree?

144
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,960
She didn't dare.

145
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,920
Everything is under your control.

146
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,840
Your Highness, there is one more thing.

147
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,600
I heard that Lingyun

148
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,840
has been tortured by Aunt Jiang

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,560
and can't get out of bed.

150
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,800
She is still alive.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,120
Aunt Jiang said

152
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,040
that Lingyun was dying.

153
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,840
But I wonder who

154
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,640
sent a medicine here.

155
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,560
Who else could it be?

156
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,640
The Wulin Manor is still protecting her.

157
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,600
Your Highness,

158
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,040
I suspect that

159
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,040
Lady Mu sent it.

160
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,840
Yes.

161
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,360
It's her.

162
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,560
It should be her.

163
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,240
She is getting more and more favored.

164
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,880
Yesterday, she played the zither and drank wine

165
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,480
in the Imperial Garden.

166
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,160
Today, she performed in the palace.

167
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,600
She is really a natural.

168
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
Now,

169
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,360
she is interfering with Lingyun's business.

170
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,880
Who does she think she is?

171
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,720
She even wants to break into the harem.

172
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,640
She did do it out of favor.

173
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,920
But she still doesn't dare

174
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,600
to ignore you.

175
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,120
I don't need her to do that.

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,800
No matter how hot-headed Lady Mu is,

177
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,800
she will never pass me

178
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,600
and become the new empress.

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,680
Yes. Yes.

180
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,720
I want her dead.

181
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,160
Your Highness.

182
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,960
Get up.

183
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,560
It's getting cold.

184
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,800
Why are you still wearing so little?

185
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,360
You should wear more clothes.

186
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,760
Take care of your health.

187
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,120
Lvhe.

188
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,960
Yes.

189
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,960
Go get some hot beef.

190
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,360
Yes.

191
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,520
Thank you for your concern.

192
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,800
I wonder why you called me here.

193
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,360
How is the thing I asked you to do

194
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,960
going on?

195
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,400
Don't worry, Your Highness.

196
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,520
I've been doing my best.

197
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,680
Good.

198
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
Here.

199
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

200
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,120
Have you been to the Imperial Hospital recently?

201
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,400
Thanks to Your Highness.

202
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,960
I'm fine.

203
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,680
I haven't been to the Imperial Hospital.

204
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,760
Why did I hear

205
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,360
that Lingyun got the medicine for saving her life

206
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,920
from the Imperial Hospital?

207
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,160
Medicine? What medicine?

208
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,960
Why would Lingyun need it?

209
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,280
Did you give her medicine

210
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,640
from the Bo Lin Manor?

211
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,240
Your Highness.

212
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,240
I didn't give her the medicine.

213
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,920
But Lingyun can't die.

214
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,520
Lingyun will be able to be a pawn

215
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,840
and serve you in the future.

216
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,040
I'm thinking for you.

217
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,520
It's not important

218
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,160
if Lingyun will be my pawn or not.

219
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,040
I care about your attitude.

220
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,480
You need to know that you're mine now.

221
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,440
Since you're mine,

222
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,520
you should know the truth.

223
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,680
You can't be so careless.

224
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But if you dare to betray me,

225
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,680
this is the consequence of Lingyun.
