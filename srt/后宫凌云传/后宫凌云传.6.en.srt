1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
Cross cut

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,840
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,160
Why am I here?

4
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,560
I should be the one asking you.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,840
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,000
What are you doing?

7
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,920
Why are you sleeping in a dirty bed?

8
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,160
Are you asking me

9
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,120
to clean up the bed?

10
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,680
There are so many people in the office.

11
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,880
Someone will clean up the bed for you.

12
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,120
I'll leave now.

13
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,680
Zhang Yuanpan,

14
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,200
do you know what this incense is?

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,560
What's wrong?

16
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,320
Where did you get this incense?

17
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,800
Do you want to die?

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,320
This is the incense

19
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,320
made by the Jin medicine in the palace.

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,520
It has the effect of making people fall in love.

21
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,520
Making people fall in love?

22
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,320
If someone in the harem finds out

23
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,720
that someone uses this medicine,

24
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,360
they will be punished severely.

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Zhang Yuanpan,

26
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,320
Mr. Wu gave me this incense.

27
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,880
How could it be Jin medicine?

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,520
No one can use it.

29
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,480
If you use it in the wrong place,

30
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,600
you'll get into trouble.

31
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,680
Thank you, Zhang Yuanpan.

32
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,440
I'll go back and throw it away.

33
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,640
Jin Yu,

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,280
you used the medicine to make me fall in love.

35
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,040
You're dead this time.

36
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,040
Jin Yu.

37
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,320
You're dead this time.

38
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,240
His Majesty has arrived!

39
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,880
Your Majesty, why are you here in my palace today?

40
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,800
I didn't prepare in advance.

41
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,560
Please forgive me.

42
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,320
I'm busy with work today.

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,560
I haven't seen you for days and I'm a little worried.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
I just want to stay with you.

45
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,440
Your Majesty, you just came back from the south.

46
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,040
You must be tired from the long journey.

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,920
I'll take you to the room.

48
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,240
It's fine.

49
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,840
Jin Yu,

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,720
get some Childishias and put some hot water on them

51
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,600
to warm you up.

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,120
Why are you standing there?

53
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,480
Go.

54
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,960
Let me call the royal physician.

55
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,760
Imperial physician Liu,

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,940
Your Highness's snow corpse

57
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,200
Song Cheese cooked all night last night

58
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,120
and theious watching卖

59
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,480
until Her Highness didn't fall asleep.

60
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,100
What's wrong with her?

61
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,500
The snow corpse

62
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,180
was offered to me from the West.

63
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,400
His Majesty gave me this.

64
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,780
Yesterday night,

65
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,440
it suddenly became so crazy.

66
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,020
Imperial physician Liu,

67
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,980
Your Highness,

68
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,580
the condition of the blood poem

69
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,020
seems to be a sign of a fever.

70
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,540
But I can diagnose it.

71
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,020
The blood poem seems to have

72
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,740
been a sign of a fever

73
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,220
caused by something

74
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,940
that is in a state of urge.

75
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,620
What?

76
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,860
Your Highness!

77
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,340
Something bad has happened!

78
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,660
What's going on?

79
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,660
What's going on?

80
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,660
What's going on?

81
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,660
What's going on?

82
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,660
What's going on?

83
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,660
What's going on?

84
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,660
What's going on?

85
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,660
Your Highness.

86
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,660
Your Highness.

87
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,660
Your Highness.

88
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,660
Asuchi?

89
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,820
What does it mean?

90
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,460
Asuchi Pill

91
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,980
is a form of a sword drug.

92
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,180
Your Highness,

93
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,780
someone used the spirit ink

94
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,060
to write on the wall.

95
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,740
The ants climbed up to eat the ink

96
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,460
and showed their handwriting.

97
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,460
Spirit ink?

98
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,420
Isn't it only in Chenxi Palace

99
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,620
that I can find it in the good sister Wan Fei's?

100
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,580
Hurry up and ask someone to wipe the words on the wall.

101
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,580
Yes.

102
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,980
What kind of spirit ink is this?

103
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,300
How dare you slander me?

104
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,460
I was lucky to be your sister.

105
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,060
I was especially favored by His Majesty.

106
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,980
I was so envious of you.

107
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,340
I never thought

108
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,580
it was the credit of Asuchi Pill.

109
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,660
Why didn't you take out

110
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,180
such a good thing

111
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,460
and share it with me?

112
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,540
I was favored

113
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,100
by my own ability.

114
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,420
I don't need your means.

115
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,980
You can deny it,

116
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,140
but someone picked up the spirit ink

117
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,500
and wrote Asuchi on the door of my Zhongning Palace.

118
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,420
How do you explain it?

119
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,140
Spirit ink?

120
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,900
His Majesty loves you.

121
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,060
The spirit ink flowers

122
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,540
were all sent to you.

123
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,380
The spirit ink was only in your palace.

124
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,580
No matter if you admit it or not,

125
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,860
the only thing you need

126
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,820
is to point to your sister.

127
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,700
The harem is not favored by the concubines.

128
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,300
They are all favored by their own abilities.

129
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,820
But if you use these tricks

130
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,700
and get caught by His Majesty

131
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,380
and get involved with the Zhao family,

132
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,260
I will never let you off.

133
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,420
I've blocked the mouth of the servant of Zhongning Palace.

134
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,540
As for the eunuch in your palace,

135
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,860
I don't need to teach you

136
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,660
how to deal with him, right?

137
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,700
Shuixi.

138
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,940
Your Highness.

139
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,420
Bring me the most recent manual

140
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,340
of the West Palace.

141
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,340
Yes.

142
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,860
Only Jinyu has used the spirit ink.

143
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,180
Jinyu?

144
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,140
Your Highness.

145
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,860
If you give the spirit ink to someone else,

146
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,420
it will be a waste of time.

147
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,500
If you give the spirit ink to someone else,

148
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,780
I will be sad.

149
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,980
Jinyu.

150
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,340
Get some spirit ink

151
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,420
and pour it with hot water

152
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,700
to warm His Majesty up.

153
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,740
Why are you standing there?

154
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,780
Go.

155
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,660
You are so ungrateful.

156
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,420
You can't even tell your position.

157
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,020
How dare a servant

158
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,540
dare to think of the position of the master?

159
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,220
Get rid of Jinyu.

160
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,020
I don't want to see him again.

161
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,420
Yes.

162
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,980
Shuixi.

163
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,540
Who gave you the guts to block my way?

164
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,020
It's not me who blocked your way.

165
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,660
It's me

166
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,700
who blocked the way of Consort Wan.

167
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,700
What do you mean?

168
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,020
What can I mean?

169
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,100
Her Highness asked me to come

170
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,300
to lock you up.

171
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,060
You have been with Her Highness for so many years.

172
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,220
Don't you know

173
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,020
what Her Highness is doing?

174
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,780
I am Her Highness's maid.

175
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,620
Even if she wants me to die,

176
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,020
I will listen to Her Highness.

177
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,620
Why do you want me to die?

178
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,620
Enough.

179
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,220
Her Highness said

180
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,220
you are filial to something that shouldn't belong to you.

181
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,100
You want to destroy it if you can't get it, right?

182
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Destroy it?

183
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,340
Did Her Highness misunderstand something?

184
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,860
I don't care

185
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,500
if she misunderstands it or not.

186
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,220
Who allowed you to touch her favorite jade seal?

187
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,660
This jade seal

188
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,820
was brought to you by Her Highness.

189
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,740
There are ten pairs done in here.

190
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,340
After drinking them!

191
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,940
Let's go where he wants to.

192
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,460
Your Highness!

193
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,660
I finally forgot about every night.

194
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,700
Blissful Bird and Rapid Mustache

195
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,380
This is Jin cassette, marking as Su Q 1960

196
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,700
Jinyu's dying

197
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,860
I can finally take coaster

198
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,820
Stop.

199
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
Aunt, you are...

200
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
Greetings, Your Highness.

201
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,820
Greetings, Your Highness.

202
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
I can't stand the sand.

203
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
There's a servant in Chengxi Palace.

204
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
He's a good man.

205
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
A servant in Chengxi Palace betrayed me.

206
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,820
I will expel all the servants in the palace.

207
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
You are all brought here by Aunt Jiang.

208
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
From now on, all of you will be loyal to me.

209
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
If you have any ill intentions, I will not forgive you.

210
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
We will listen to Your Highness's teachings.

211
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,820
If I have any ill intentions, I will atone for my sins.

212
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,820
Other than Ling Yun, all of you may leave.

213
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,820
Ling Yun, I only left you because you did good deeds.

214
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
From now on, you will serve me well.

215
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
I will not treat you badly.

216
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

217
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,820
Aunt Jiang is my old maid.

218
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
From now on, all of the matters in the palace will be decided by Aunt Jiang.

219
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
In a few days, it will be the Spring Banquet in the palace.

220
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
By then, His Majesty will also attend.

221
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,820
This is the first time I have held such an important banquet in the Sixth Palace.

222
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
You must be more careful.

223
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
You must not make any mistakes.

224
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
Yes. I will do my best to help Your Highness

225
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
to hold the Spring Banquet in the palace.

226
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,820
After leaving the prison, I came to Aunt Jiang.

227
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
I still can't wake up.

228
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
She actually asked me to deliver Wu Xie to Concubine Zhao.

229
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,820
What is the medicine in this gourd?

230
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
What medicine?

231
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
Concubine Zhao is good at martial arts.

232
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Your Highness is taking the initiative to deliver Wu Xie.

233
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,820
You really want to give Concubine Zhao a chance to show off her skills in the palace.

234
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,820
Although the palace is full of flowers and flowers,

235
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
Concubine Zhao and Concubine Zhao are sisters.

236
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
Now that Your Highness is already so favored,

237
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
you will not be too concerned with Concubine Zhao.

238
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,820
In her heart, she still misses her sister.

239
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
I will go now.

240
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
Aunt, I suddenly remembered

241
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,820
that I have finished using the Jue Ming Zi that I sewed for Your Highness.

242
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
Thank you for going to the Central Palace to deliver Wu Xie to Concubine Zhao.

243
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,820
I must hurry to the Imperial Household Department to get some Jue Ming Zi back.

244
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
The Imperial Household Department is more important to me.

245
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
I will go to the Imperial Household Department.

246
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
You go in and deliver Wu Xie.

247
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
Go.

248
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,820
I fear that Wu Xie was not made into some kind of hand-made footwear.

249
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Concubine Zhao,

250
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,820
this is the embroidered Wu Xie that Consort Sourire ordered me to deliver to you.

251
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,820
Concubine Zhao said that Concubine Zhao is good at martial arts.

252
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
With this beautiful Wu Xie,

253
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,820
she surely will be able to impress the public at the Spring Banquet in the palace.

254
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,820
Concubine Wan, you are so kind.

255
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,820
Concubine Wan said that she hopes that Concubine Zhao can be able to

256
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,820
perform the long sleeve dance for His Majesty at the Spring Banquet in the palace.

257
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
She is deliberately trying to get me involved.

258
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
What do you mean?

259
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
Concubine Wan is also kind.

260
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
How could she be trying to get me involved?

261
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,820
This long sleeve dance was performed by four women from the Jiangfang Temple.

262
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
Concubine Wan, you mean that

263
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
I have already conveyed what Concubine Wan means.

264
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
Everything is up to you.

265
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
I will take my leave.

266
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Now the maids in Chengxi Palace are so domineering.

267
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
Not only that.

268
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,820
Maybe there are other hidden secrets in this shoe.

269
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,820
Your Highness, there is nothing strange about this shoe.

270
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
You cannot dance this dance.

271
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,820
Concubine Wan is just using you as an excuse to threaten her with the gold and silver.

272
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Since she is taking the initiative to come here,

273
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,820
I cannot let this opportunity slip by.

274
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
Since she wants to see it, I will dance it for her.

275
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,820
This dance will surely make her heart flutter.

276
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
Your Highness, I am back.

277
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,820
Did she go?

278
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,820
She did.

279
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
I and Ling Yun went to the gate of the Central Palace.

280
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
She wanted to leave with the chance to take the name of Jue.

281
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
But she was still sent in by me.

282
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
She is smart.

283
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
This Ling Yun is very thoughtful and thoughtful.

284
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,820
Not only that, she is also very close to the Wu Lin Manor.

285
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,820
Then Your Highness still keeps her by your side.

286
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
There might be a future trouble.

287
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
She has been following me for many years.

288
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,820
Of course, I cannot let her off easily.

289
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,820
It is not necessary to spend a lot of money to deal with a maid.

290
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,820
But this Wu Lin Manor has been watching me for a long time.

291
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,820
So this time, I am going to kill her in front of the Wu Lin Manor.

292
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
Let her see my methods.

293
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,820
Wait and see.

294
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
I will kill her.

295
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
I will kill her.

296
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
I will kill her.

297
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
I will kill her.

298
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
I will kill her.

299
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
I will kill her.

300
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
I will kill her.

301
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
I will kill her.

302
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
I will kill her.

303
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
I will kill her.

304
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,820
I will kill her.

305
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
I will kill her.

306
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
I will kill her.

307
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,820
I will kill her.
