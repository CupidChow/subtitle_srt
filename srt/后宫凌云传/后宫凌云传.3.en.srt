00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,360
This stupid girl, Sun Mei Zi,

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,040
has ruined my plan.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,400
Please calm down, Your Highness.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,520
Aunt Sun is a greedy woman.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,760
It's a disaster if we keep her.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,400
Luckily, she didn't mention it even before she died.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,000
She secretly prepared the medicine for you.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,600
She wouldn't dare to say a word.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,520
But she's dead.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,120
Your medicine is out of stock.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,240
We have to think of another way.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,600
We can't let Asu Jiwan die like this.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,320
Yes, I'll think of a way.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,960
But I heard that

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,760
today, it's Aunt Sun

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,560
who was punished by Zhao Ping and the Wulin Prefecture.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,000
Are they going to

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,280
fight against you with their hands?

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,000
Zhao Lian'er is a smart girl.

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,320
She deserves to fight with me.

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,400
Master,

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,800
the maid of the Herb-repelling Bureau, Lingyun, is here to see you.

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,560
I wanted to knock her out,

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,240
but she was kneeling outside.

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,280
She said that you knew she would come tonight

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
and was waiting to see her.

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,120
Let her in.

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,360
Yes.

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,720
Chief Steward Wu.

32
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,320
What's the matter?

33
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,360
Although you've broken the rules,

34
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,360
I can't betray you.

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,080
I'm here to ask you

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,320
if you have any other tasks

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,160
for me to do.

38
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,080
What?

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,760
Do you want to try

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,520
the 64 sets of the ten-year-old yamen?

41
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,760
Master,

42
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,240
are you trying to revenge me?

43
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,440
I helped you to take over the Herb-repelling Bureau.

44
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,320
Now the Herb-repelling Bureau is all yours.

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,320
You've established a court

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,880
and you have a new job.

47
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,560
Isn't that enough to make you

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,960
a loyal servant?

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,360
Don't think too much.

50
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,240
You even put the blame on me

51
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,640
for the sake of the throne.

52
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,240
Now you're standing here alive.

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,120
I've already let you off.

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,560
You still have the nerve to ask for my help?

55
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,080
I'm too timid.

56
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,720
How could I dare to be Chief Steward Wu's servant?

57
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,120
So you admit that

58
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,880
you're using me?

59
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,120
Since I want to be your servant,

60
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,320
I have to make a living first.

61
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,960
Besides, you won't lose anything

62
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,480
if you take advantage of me.

63
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,600
The Herb-repelling Bureau is of great importance.

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,480
The safety of the Six Palace

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,720
will be taken over by the one I trust.

66
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,360
Then can I

67
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,040
become the one you trust?

68
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,000
word to you?

69
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,760
Who do you think?

70
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,600
Tao An.

71
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,760
I hate to see you

72
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,360
say such an untruthful thing.

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,440
who doesn't know death.

74
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,320
Chief Steward Wu,

75
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,360
I'm a fairy who can make you laugh.

76
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,000
I can prove to you

77
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,760
that I'm the one you can trust.

78
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,720
In the harem,

79
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,040
only the dead can be trusted.

80
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,080
These are all useless things

81
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,000
that Dorgon of the Fourteenth Cliff cleared.

82
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,280
Take them out of the harem.

83
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,000
Today is the grand ceremony of Concubine Sourire.

84
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,440
Be careful with your actions.

85
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,480
Whoever dares to take them out,

86
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,720
I'll punish them severely.

87
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,280
Yes.

88
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,320
Do you know what's in this box?

89
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,200
What is it?

90
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,960
It's a pretty and pretty little palace maid.

91
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,920
It must be Chief Steward Wu

92
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,240
preparing to take her to the private residence outside the harem

93
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,400
and let her enjoy it by herself.

94
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,880
Yu Yu.

95
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,640
Is there something in the box?

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,600
Listen.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,600
Right?

98
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,120
Master,

99
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,320
go back and have a rest.

100
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,080
I'll be here.

101
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,480
Today is the grand ceremony of Concubine Sourire.

102
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,440
There must be something wrong.

103
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,920
I know.

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,800
Go ahead.

105
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,640
Keep an eye on her.

106
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes.

107
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,920
You still dare to come back and wander around in front of me.

108
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,080
Aren't you afraid of death?

109
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,440
Master,

110
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,320
you took the maid out of the harem

111
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,440
with a fist of silk.

112
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,120
You're going to be beheaded.

113
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,960
I've dealt with a lot of things

114
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,120
in the harem.

115
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,600
I can't be beheaded

116
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,120
with a bold little maid.

117
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,320
But you...

118
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,600
If you came to me

119
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,680
for the grand ceremony of the Household Bureau,

120
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,280
I'd advise you to give up.

121
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,680
Master,

122
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,920
you've misunderstood.

123
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,400
I know I'm not as good as I thought.

124
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,640
I'm convinced that

125
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,360
you let her be the head of the Household Bureau.

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,720
But

127
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,600
if you insist on driving me out of the harem,

128
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,440
I'll be dead.

129
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,800
You're a smart maid

130
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,320
who only knows how to play tricks.

131
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,440
You won't live long if you stay in the harem.

132
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,440
Today,

133
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,800
you pretended to be an eunuch and sneaked into the Fengxian Hall.

134
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,680
I can kill you right now.

135
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,040
If you don't like me wearing eunuch clothes,

136
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,960
I won't wear it.

137
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,440
You...

138
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,560
You're shameless.

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,560
This is not a place for you to be relaxed.

140
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm going to stay in the harem.

141
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,640
Master, let me go.

142
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,520
No.

143
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,120
Why don't you dare to leave the harem?

144
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,920
Master,

145
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,760
if I leave the harem,

146
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,960
I'll be sold to the Household Bureau.

147
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,360
If you insist on driving me out of the harem,

148
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,920
I'll be dead.

149
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,560
Master,

150
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,040
Consort Wan has left the Fengxian Hall.

151
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,000
Master,

152
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,080
I'll stay in the Household Bureau

153
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,120
and don't cause any trouble.

154
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,320
Otherwise,

155
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,840
even if I don't kill you,

156
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,720
you won't live long.

157
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,600
Chief Steward Wu,

158
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,760
it seems that you don't feel good

159
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,440
about using your power to deal with Consort Wan.

160
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,160
Then don't blame me for betraying you

161
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,800
and getting close to Consort Wan.

162
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,280
Sister Shizhi.

163
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,400
Lingyun, what are you doing?

164
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,440
Sister Shizhi, are you going to the Fengxian Hall

165
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,280
to send a gift to Consort Wan?

166
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,040
Yes.

167
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
I'm going to send the pearl

168
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,120
made by the Household Bureau to Her Highness.

169
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,000
Sister,

170
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,880
can you give me the chance

171
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,880
to give the pearl to Consort Wan?

172
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,320
You're a palace maid who just entered the palace.

173
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,760
You can't be given such an important thing.

174
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,560
I'll show you something.

175
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,840
Empress Dowager,

176
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,160
go to the brush chamber first.

177
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,040
Yes.

178
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,040
What does this mean?

179
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,200
The Empress Dowager from the court

180
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,240
always wants someone

181
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
who needs to attend the ceremony

182
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,720
in behalf of the Emperor.

183
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,640
If I tell the Empress family

184
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,080
How is it?

185
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,160
What's the problem?

186
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,440
I have nothing to do with her.

187
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
Don't slander me.

188
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,400
Really?

189
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,240
This is what you found

190
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,000
in your personal belongings.

191
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,600
If you're not afraid,

192
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,040
I'll give the jade pendant to the Office of Penalty.

193
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,600
The Office of Penalty

194
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,760
will definitely check your real efforts.

195
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,520
Stop.

196
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,480
Sister Shizhi,

197
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,640
if you can give me

198
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,600
the chance to give the Phoenix Pearl to Concubine Wan,

199
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,960
I will definitely buy the jade pendant

200
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,280
and not say a word.

201
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,080
Yes.

202
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,200
Why hasn't the imperial physician arrived yet?

203
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,800
Your Highness.

204
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,600
Your Highness.

205
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,680
The imperial physician is here.

206
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,920
Imperial physician Liu,

207
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
why hasn't Her Highness's cough

208
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,280
been relieved yet?

209
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,760
It usually goes down when the needle is pointed.

210
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,160
It can be relieved in a moment.

211
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,400
I don't know why

212
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,680
it's like this today.

213
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,320
The emergency is coming soon.

214
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
What should we do?

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,160
A bunch of useless people.

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,920
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

217
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,160
Please calm down, Your Highness.

218
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,800
Your Highness shouldn't be angry today.

219
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,720
It's not a good time.

220
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,960
If you cough like this,

221
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,640
how can I see His Majesty?

222
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,640
Do you want those people

223
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,560
who are jealous of me

224
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,880
to laugh at me?

225
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,400
Your Highness, please don't be angry.

226
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,160
Imperial physician Liu,

227
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,440
please continue to treat Her Highness.

228
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,640
The Department of Internal Affairs, Guangchu Department,

229
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,600
the Office of Penalty, the Fragrance and Medicine Bureau

230
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,480
is here to congratulate Your Highness.

231
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,720
May Your Highness be blessed with a long life

232
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,520
and a long life.

233
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,200
Your Highness,

234
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,480
the maid of the Fragrance and Medicine Bureau

235
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,800
waiting outside the hall said

236
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,000
she had a way

237
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,520
to stop Your Highness from coughing.

238
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,840
What?

239
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,960
How can a maid

240
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,600
have more skills than an imperial physician?

241
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,880
Your Highness,

242
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,280
we can't wait for her in time.

243
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,080
How about

244
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,400
calling her in and asking her?

245
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes.

246
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,160
Your Highness,

247
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
I'm Ling Yun,

248
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,120
your servant of the Fragrance and Medicine Bureau.

249
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,200
It's you who said

250
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
you could cure my cough.

251
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,280
Yes, Your Highness.

252
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,600
Even the imperial physician has no way out.

253
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,840
What can you do?

254
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,640
Your Highness,

255
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,440
you just need to smell my medicine

256
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,000
and you'll be able to stop coughing.

257
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,040
What is this?

258
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,360
Your Highness,

259
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,360
this is the medicine

260
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,760
made from the combination of blue mint and ice silk.

261
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,160
The fresh blue mint

262
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,760
is indeed a good medicine.

263
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,520
It's the best effect

264
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,640
on cough caused by pollen.

265
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,880
But the stone is not made of blue mint.

266
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,520
Yes.

267
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,360
I made this blue mint myself

268
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,200
in case I coughed

269
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,280
when I was working.

270
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,800
Jin Yu,

271
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,680
stop

272
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,240
talking nonsense.

273
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,480
Your Highness,

274
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,640
why did you hit me?

275
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,080
I coughed a lot

276
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,920
and even the imperial physician was helpless.

277
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,240
You're the only one who can cure cough.

278
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,480
Is there such a coincidence in the world?

279
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,760
I think

280
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,560
you did it on purpose

281
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,960
to make me look ugly on the day of the imperial concubine.

282
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,160
Hit me.

283
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,240
Wait.

284
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,080
Your Highness,

285
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,160
you can hit me

286
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,280
as long as you hear me.

287
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,560
I can not only cure your cough,

288
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,720
but also know

289
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,560
who caused you to cough.

290
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,720
Go on.

291
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
Your Highness,

292
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,680
it was the general manager of the 14th Yamen,

293
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,000
Wu Linfu.

294
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,960
I smelled the smell of

295
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,720
the blue mint on you.

296
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
I heard that you coughed outside the hall today.

297
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,840
I was wondering

298
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,920
if you were also there.

299
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,200
Blue mint is the most likely to cause

300
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,440
cough to a sensitive person.

301
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,680
I'll stay in the palace.

302
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,960
No.

303
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:20,880
Let me go.

304
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,440
No.

305
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,000
Blue mint is hot.

306
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,160
People with an allergic body

307
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,720
will have cough

308
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,440
if they eat too much blue mint powder.

309
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,440
Everyone in the palace knows

310
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,280
that our concubine is allergic to blue mint powder.

311
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,520
General Manager Wu,

312
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,800
you're so vicious.

313
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,560
Wu Linfu.

314
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,640
It's you.

315
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,960
You're always rude to me.

316
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,680
I don't care about you.

317
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,080
Now you're using the pink powder

318
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,680
to harm me on my wedding day.

319
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,720
I'll report to His Majesty

320
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,200
that you and the other concubines

321
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,680
have committed a grave crime.

322
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,200
Your Highness,

323
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,040
I don't have the blue powder.

324
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,720
You need to prove yourself.

325
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Wu Linfu.

326
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,640
Do you really think that I'm a blind man

327
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,880
to everyone?

328
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,400
I'm a noble concubine.

329
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
How can I tolerate you?

330
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,880
You're so rude.

331
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,560
Your Highness,

332
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,960
although I'm a servant,

333
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm an emperor's servant.

334
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,320
I can't bully you.

335
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
But Wu Linfu

336
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,080
is not a person who can be bullied.

337
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
Wu Linfu,

338
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,320
I've put up with you

339
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,880
and I've put up with you.

340
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,600
Let's wait and see.

341
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,240
General Manager Wu,

342
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,320
Her Highness is kind-hearted.

343
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,360
Today is the wedding day of Her Highness.

344
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,160
Of course she won't be rude to you.

345
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,040
But I'll remind you

346
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,120
not to forget the rules in the palace.

347
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,280
A servant who committed a grave crime

348
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,080
will not get anything.

349
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,560
You're right.

350
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,840
You're a servant who committed a grave crime.

351
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,880
Someone.

352
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,920
Your Highness,

353
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,840
I gave you the medicine

354
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,360
and told you the truth.

355
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,600
I caused all this.

356
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,800
Please calm down, Your Highness.

357
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
Please punish me.

358
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,120
Come to my palace.

359
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,720
Your Highness.

360
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,840
I always reward and punish you.

361
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,240
You made a great contribution today.

362
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,400
What reward do you want?

363
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,760
I don't want any reward.

364
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,880
I just want to be with you.

365
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,000
You want to stay by my side?

366
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,680
What ability do you have?

367
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
I want to be your sword.

368
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,480
If you want me to be your sword,

369
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,320
I can definitely

370
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,280
blow up anyone in the palace.

371
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,880
Stay.

372
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,400
From now on, you're a member of Chengxi Palace.

373
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,080
No one can hurt you.

374
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,000
Wan Fei,

375
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,760
I'll be the one

376
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,720
who blows up your sword sooner or later.
