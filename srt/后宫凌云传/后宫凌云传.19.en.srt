00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,680
My Lady,

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,680
there's news about the maid you're looking for.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,080
Is it Lingzhu?

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,760
Yes.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,760
You really know a lot about the world.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,680
Today is the day the maid goes to the bathhouse.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,520
Lingzhu has come.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,400
How do you know

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,880
Lingzhu is going to the bathhouse today?

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,520
Ever since Concubine Wan took Lingzhu away,

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,680
Lingzhu has never left the Chengxi Palace

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
and has no trace of her.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,920
But Concubine Wan is a clean person.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,320
She will never allow

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,120
any suspicious things to happen to the maid around her.

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,680
She will let Lingzhu out sooner or later to bathe.

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,760
And this

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,880
is the chance I've been waiting for.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,400
Lingzhu.

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,600
Greetings, Lady Yun.

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,120
You remember me?

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,480
I remember you.

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,800
I once offended you

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,400
when I was a servant in the Herb-gathering Bureau.

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,360
Please forgive me.

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,840
Get up.

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,960
Thank you, Lady Yun.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,400
Get up.

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,040
I heard you were taken to Chengxi Palace.

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,880
How are you doing?

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,000
Lingzhu is fine.

34
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,120
Thank you for your concern.

35
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,760
I've also stayed in Chengxi Palace.

36
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,480
I know very well

37
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,000
how you are doing.

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,880
Concubine Wan

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,080
is really nice to me.

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,320
Do you remember Cuiwei?

41
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,360
When she was in the New Brothel,

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,800
she said she was always helping Concubine Wan

43
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,120
and was loyal.

44
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,640
But when Concubine Wan killed her,

45
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,160
she didn't care about

46
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,720
your love for her

47
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,440
and your care for her.

48
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,080
It's not easy for you to get out of Chengxi Palace.

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,320
Whether you can meet me again

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,200
depends on your fate.

51
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,800
I...

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,560
You and Cuiwei both know Concubine Wan's secret.

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,800
She won't let anyone who knows her secret

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,760
live.

55
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,920
Lingzhu,

56
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,640
you should know

57
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,680
I'm not your enemy.

58
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,880
If you want to live,

59
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,960
tell me.

60
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,200
When you were in the Herb-testing Bureau,

61
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,400
what did you and Cuiwei

62
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,280
do for Concubine Wan?

63
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,040
Please save me.

64
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,680
As long as I can

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,320
get out of Chengxi Palace,

66
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll tell you everything.

67
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,320
Concubine Wan...

68
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,920
Concubine Wan has gone mad.

69
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,520
Your Grace.

70
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,440
What's this?

71
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,800
This is from Concubine Wan's palace.

72
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,920
You can check it with the imperial physician.

73
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,360
What's this?

74
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,600
If there's nothing else,

75
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,640
I'll go to His Majesty for his duty.

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I'll take my leave.

77
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,400
Your Grace.

78
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,240
I used you before.

79
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,200
I can't repay you for your kindness.

80
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,280
But today's matter is not trivial.

81
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,520
I'm not doing this for myself.

82
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,400
I'm doing this for Concubine Wan.

83
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm doing this for myself.

84
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm doing this for the innocent workers.

85
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,040
I believe

86
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,080
after you check it,

87
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,040
you won't be on your guard.

88
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,160
What do you mean?

89
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,320
After you check

90
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,200
what this bottle is,

91
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,880
you'll believe

92
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,640
there's a devil

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,920
in the harem.

94
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,680
OK.

95
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,480
I'll check it for myself.

96
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,400
I'll OK.

97
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,280
Your Grace.

98
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,200
My desk isт's not very Tarot-oriented.

99
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,920
Because Your Grace

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,700
once said

101
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,800
it was above Windless Tower when we met outside the palace last night.

102
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,460
She mouthed a severe dart

103
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,520
and even pushed me to the ground.

104
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,280
Cuoguoetai was in this Southern real estate estate.

105
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,660
What else?

106
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,300
I wonder how she is doing.

107
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,380
Let's go to Yongxiu Palace.

108
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,020
Yes.

109
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,380
The hundred-carriage Yongxiu Palace.

110
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,260
Greetings, Lady Yun.

111
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,500
What's the matter, Eunuch Tu'an?

112
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,700
Lady Yun,

113
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,260
His Majesty is on his way to Yongxiu Palace.

114
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,460
Please get ready to receive His Majesty's sedan.

115
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,740
His Majesty didn't go to Chengxi Palace?

116
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,340
He was supposed to go there.

117
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,700
But he changed his mind.

118
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,500
Master asked me to tell you in advance.

119
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,140
Thank you, Eunuch.

120
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,660
Why are you crying?

121
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,140
Your blood

122
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,700
can be the medicine that can bring back the fire of Her Highness.

123
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,620
It's your fortune to restore her to her original form.

124
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,940
Stop crying.

125
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,980
You're so bad.

126
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,980
Your Highness,

127
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,540
I'm a lowly concubine.

128
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,660
I'm going to be punished for my sins.

129
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,940
Please let me go.

130
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,580
Lingzhu,

131
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,180
you were selected by Sun Meizi

132
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,860
in the herbal medicine bureau.

133
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,340
She has been selected in the herbal medicine bureau for many years.

134
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,100
But you two

135
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,580
are exactly the same as my birth date.

136
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,140
It's so rare.

137
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,980
You are all my precious.

138
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,380
As long as you show me your blood,

139
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,500
I won't treat you badly.

140
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,460
Your Highness,

141
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,540
in the herbal medicine bureau,

142
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,780
Eunuch Sun gave you the medicine

143
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,300
made of our cook's blood.

144
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,220
But now,

145
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,340
no one will treat her

146
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,180
if she goes there.

147
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,780
If you hurt our blood again,

148
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,780
it's no longer useful.

149
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,140
Your Highness, please let me go.

150
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,780
Shut up.

151
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,020
How can you compare her to the secret of the same blood?

152
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,980
I'm going to succeed soon.

153
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,980
After tonight,

154
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,620
I'll be able to restore my beautiful appearance.

155
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,460
For the sake of your efforts,

156
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,500
I won't argue with you.

157
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,780
If you dare to defy me again,

158
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,900
you will be the last one to die.

159
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,660
What?

160
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,100
Zhun.

161
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,100
увASZ

162
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,300
Mi enormous

163
00:06:59,220 --> 00:06:59,500
...

164
00:06:59,500 --> 00:06:59,860
brutal

165
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,220
Pro deviated referendum

166
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,820
and arrive

167
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,580
I Hulk, ha bite

168
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,860
Where is Lady Yuan?

169
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,860
My Lady went to Chengxi Palace.

170
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,860
Why did she go to Chengxi Palace?

171
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,340
Your Majesty,

172
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,540
My Lady told me

173
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,220
that if Your Majesty came to Yongxiu Palace

174
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,620
and asked me to tell you,

175
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,140
My Lady went to Chengxi Palace

176
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,620
to visit Concubine Wan who was ill.

177
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,780
My Lady said

178
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,980
that she and Concubine Wan

179
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,380
may not be on good terms,

180
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,140
but they should follow the rules of the palace.

181
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,980
As a low-ranking concubine,

182
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,100
she should go to show her respect to Concubine Wan.

183
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,580
Go to Chengxi Palace.

184
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,180
All right.

185
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,380
Did you think that if I am hurt,

186
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,940
I won't be able to rear up you?

187
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,700
Today,

188
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,060
I will wash my body

189
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,420
with the birthday Orient.

190
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,260
This is how I look in Blessing Mode!

191
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,260
Your Highness, the time of death is coming.

192
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,860
In three years, there is only one chance to be reborn.

193
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,900
It's really hard to gather these people who are the same as you.

194
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,060
I'll go outside to guard them later.

195
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,660
I won't let anyone destroy Your Highness's grand plan.

196
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,660
His Majesty has arrived!

197
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,660
What should we do?

198
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,660
Your Highness, please take a seat.

199
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:15,340
I'll go and check on the

200
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,660
Your Highness.

201
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,060
I'm here to greet Your Majesty.

202
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,460
Rise.

203
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,060
I heard that Consort Wan is ill.

204
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,060
I came to see you.

205
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,660
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

206
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,060
I will take care of your future.

207
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,460
Your Majesty.

208
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,260
I've been feeling unwell lately.

209
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,060
The air in the room is polluted.

210
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,660
Your Majesty's body is precious.

211
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,060
You mustn't damage it because it's polluted.

212
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,060
Consort Wan is right.

213
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,660
Your Majesty's body is precious.

214
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,660
You shouldn't enter the room.

215
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,060
Tong An,

216
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,660
hurry and get someone to move a chair for Your Majesty.

217
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,260
Have His Majesty and Sister Wan Fei sit under the moon to talk.

218
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,660
Yes.

219
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,260
Call the imperial physician.

220
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,860
No need.

221
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,060
The imperial physician comes to visit her everyday.

222
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,860
I've been too tired lately.

223
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,260
I'm easily tired.

224
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,060
I'll just rest more.

225
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,860
Then let Wan Fei rest.

226
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,660
She'll be able to recuperate.

227
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,460
Your Majesty, please wait a moment.

228
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,060
I've already ordered someone to go to the imperial kitchen

229
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,660
to get some special red ginseng and bird's nest soup.

230
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,260
It'll help Wan Fei recover from her illness.

231
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,260
Your Majesty has been working hard lately.

232
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,060
Let's have a drink together.

233
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,260
Okay. I'm also a bit hungry.

234
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,260
The moon is quite pretty today.

235
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,860
Let's enjoy the moon and drink the soup in this courtyard.

236
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,460
Noble Lady Yun, you're thoughtful.

237
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,860
It's all my duty.

238
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,660
It's late.

239
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,860
You've been with me for more than an hour.

240
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,860
Rest early.

241
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,860
Sister Wan Fei, take care of your health.

242
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,860
I'll see Your Majesty off.

243
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,260
I'll wait for you.

244
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,260
You should return to Yong Xiu Palace first.

245
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,660
I'll take my leave.

246
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,460
Xuan Wu Ling's Manor.

247
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,260
Your Highness, it's been an hour.

248
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,460
What should we do?

249
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,460
This bitch.

250
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,660
I'm going to kill her!

251
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,060
Useless!

252
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,660
You're all useless!

253
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,260
You're all useless!

254
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,460
What's the use of this?

255
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,260
You...

256
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,260
Yourassist servant pays respect to Your Majesty.

257
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,260
Wu Ling развитory, are you sorry for that?

258
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,060
I'm willing to be punished, this Credit.

259
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,660
What does it mean?

260
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,060
Tonight, you caught me up

261
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,860
and told me to go visit you.

262
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,660
Since I've still not had the time to go to Yong Xiu Palace

263
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,060
I've been side stuck by Get Married Lady Yun and have to go to the City Palace.

264
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,660
Do you think it's a coincidence?

265
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,380
I know my mistake.

266
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,620
I was careless.

267
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,580
I shouldn't have told you.

268
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,180
Please punish me.

269
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,620
Lady Yun and Concubine Wan are not compatible.

270
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,900
It's between concubines in the harem.

271
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,300
You favor Lady Yun.

272
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,700
What do you mean?

273
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,740
I dare not.

274
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,580
Please punish me.

275
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,540
I heard in the palace

276
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,660
that you were close to Lady Yun.

277
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,940
I want to be like you.

278
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,300
I won't cause trouble.

279
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,300
But I can't believe

280
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,900
what I saw today.

281
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,940
I know my mistake.
