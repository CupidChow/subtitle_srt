00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,400
Zhao Yingwan is getting more and more bold.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,880
Zhao,

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,400
you will be in charge of this play.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,600
I will show everyone

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,400
how evil Zhao Yingwan is.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,520
I will make sure he is dead

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,320
and not alive.

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,320
The Taoism Grandmaster

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,520
You've been following me all the way.

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Come out.

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
What do you want?

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,920
Why did you come out of Chengxi Palace?

16
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,920
You are wrong.

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,320
What happened to your hand?

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
Nothing.

19
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,120
You are His Majesty's concubine.

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,120
How dare Wan Fei hit you?

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,920
I took the initiative.

22
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,320
As long as I can expose Wan Fei's true face,

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,920
I don't care about anything.

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,320
I care about it?

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
Here you go.

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
아니에요

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Greetings, Your Hazratess.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,120
Have you found a sweet man?

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
From now on,

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,120
I will follow Your般ött beautiful girl's order.

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,720
This这么 clouds re centered as

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
a piece of cake for you?

33
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,920
I will leave without having

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,320
funds and silver.

35
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,720
I will never give up.

36
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,560
Good.

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,200
Cheng Daying of Shang Yunxuan is pregnant.

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,320
He kept it a secret.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,040
Since this child

40
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,480
is so ungraceful,

41
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,240
you should help him deal with it.

42
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,200
Your Highness,

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,440
that's a royal heir.

44
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,800
That's just a baby.

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,240
Didn't you say you would never give up?

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,000
What?

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,480
What?

48
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,480
You're going to give up now?

49
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,760
You're right.

50
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,880
I'll do it now.

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,200
Tong An,

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,320
someone is preparing some

53
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,560
fetal medicine outside the palace.

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,480
Master,

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,400
are you really going to help Consort Jing?

56
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,720
But Master,

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,040
if you take this step,

58
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,440
you can never turn back.

59
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,280
Why did Consort Jing force you to do this?

60
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,720
Prepare the medicine for me.

61
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,400
From now on,

62
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,600
take good care of her in the imperial study.

63
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,440
It's okay.

64
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,120
Don't get close to me anymore.

65
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Why?

66
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,540
Consort Jing is ANY not what she seems,

67
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,720
and her hairstyle is just too strange.

68
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,400
If you like it,

69
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,320
remove her hair,

70
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,960
and get her married.

71
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,280
Alright,

72
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,680
right away!

73
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,880
I'll get to it.

74
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,520
I don't know when I'll be a head.

75
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,960
Let's be careful

76
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,400
in case someone gets hurt.

77
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,480
I can see that you're tired.

78
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,160
Is there anything bothering you?

79
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,520
The court affairs are constantly disturbed.

80
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,280
I feel uneasy

81
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,160
in the harem.

82
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,920
Your Majesty,

83
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,200
have you heard anything?

84
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,800
There are many rumors

85
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
about Consort Wan in the harem recently.

86
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,480
I'm not sure if it's true.

87
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,240
If you have time,

88
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,600
you should visit the Chengxi Palace more often.

89
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,880
You've heard it too?

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,760
Yes.

91
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,840
I think you're suspicious.

92
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,360
I don't want to talk about it.

93
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,800
But I'm just worried

94
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,680
that if you continue to be sick,

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,600
the rumors will get worse

96
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
and you'll lose the reputation of the imperial family.

97
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,200
Consort Jing is right.

98
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,400
I should stop

99
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,080
Consort Wan from being sick.

100
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,360
Tong An,

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,400
tell her

102
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,720
that I'll have dinner in the Chengxi Palace tonight.

103
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes.

104
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
His Majesty is coming tonight?

105
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,560
Yes.

106
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,400
His Majesty just sent someone to send a message.

107
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,760
He's going to have dinner in the palace tonight.

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
How do I look now?

109
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,280
Your Highness, you're gorgeous and beautiful.

110
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,600
No.

111
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,680
I look too haggard.

112
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,720
His Majesty must not like me.

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,280
Where's the pearl?

114
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,400
I want to take a bath.

115
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,760
I want to take a bath.

116
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,400
Call the pearl back.

117
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,280
I want to take a bath.

118
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,520
I want to take a bath.

119
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,240
My Lady,

120
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,520
there's a message from the spiritual pearl.

121
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
Consort Wan heard that His Majesty was going to have dinner in the Chengxi Palace

122
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,800
and was busy with blood bath.

123
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,880
Good news.

124
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm finally going to be in the palace.

125
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,360
Your Highness.

126
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,360
What's going on outside?

127
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,080
Your Highness,

128
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,240
I accidentally made a mistake.

129
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,200
My good sister,

130
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,440
I asked Shunxi to add the scent

131
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,520
of numbness to your usual incense.

132
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,440
It should work now.

133
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,520
Your Highness,

134
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,120
Consort Jing, Shuping, Rong, Li, Cheng and others

135
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,960
have gone to the Chengxi Palace.

136
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,280
Good.

137
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,040
Let's go and have fun.

138
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,880
Wait for me.

139
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:50,540
Your Majesty has great

140
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,400
affection for me.

141
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,080
After I'm done with my bath

142
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,880
and dressed up,

143
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,600
I'll warm new发.

144
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,080
When you see my good looks,

145
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,720
Yes.

146
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,360
What's going on?

147
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,640
Your Highness.

148
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,880
Which show is this?

149
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,240
Sister Shuping.

150
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,360
Why do I feel

151
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,520
like someone is taking a bath in the sand?

152
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,080
Who is taking a bath in the sand?

153
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
So creepy.

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,240
I've never seen such a dirty trick.

155
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,040
Your Highness.

156
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,120
Your Highness.

157
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,800
Which show is this?

158
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,040
Your Majesty.

159
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,360
I don't know.

160
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,760
I heard that

161
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,320
there's a strange thing in the palace

162
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,800
that made everyone look at it.

163
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,040
So I came to have a look.

164
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,240
What?

165
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,280
It's Concubine Wan.

166
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,720
It's Concubine Wan.

167
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,240
What is she trying to do?

168
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,400
Your Majesty.

169
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,120
Rumors have it that

170
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,920
Concubine Wan is not normal.

171
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,840
I didn't believe it.

172
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,120
Now it seems

173
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,040
that she's not from the palace.

174
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,800
I'd like to see

175
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,760
what she's up to.

176
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
I know that she's not from the palace at all.

177
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,640
It must be Concubine Wan.

178
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,040
No.

179
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,960
Why am I here?

180
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,040
Why am I here?

181
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,320
Your Majesty.

182
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,480
Why are you here?

183
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,200
Your Majesty.

184
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,320
Your Majesty.

185
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,240
What?

186
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,680
You said it's the one from the Imperial Consort.

187
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,520
Your Majesty, it's not like that.

188
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,000
Let me explain, Your Majesty.

189
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
Let me explain, Your Majesty.

190
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,680
It's not like that.

191
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,800
It's not like that.

192
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
