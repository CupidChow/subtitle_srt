00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Fu Xiang,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we can finally meet again.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thank you for your kindness.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Get up.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thank you for saving me.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Otherwise,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't know

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
how long I can live

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:50,760
in the

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
world of the Three Kingdoms.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
I don't know

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
if I can live

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,760
until I see you again.

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,760
Fu Xiang,

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,760
you have to remember

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,760
that people are different.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
But some people

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
are like the grass

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
that can be crushed

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
by the power of the world.

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,760
Although we are weak,

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
as long as we

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
get together

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
and work together,

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
we won't die

28
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
in this corner.

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
If someone

30
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
bullies you after I leave,

31
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
you can't be

32
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
so easy-going

33
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
and resist.

34
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
If I have a chance,

35
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
I will take you

36
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
out of Xinzhekou.

37
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
I told you

38
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,760
that I would get you out of Xinzhekou.

39
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
I will do it.

40
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
Take my hair

41
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
and golden jade hairpin.

42
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Golden jade hairpin is vulgar.

43
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
His Majesty doesn't like it.

44
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
Yes, Your Highness.

45
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
His Majesty likes

46
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,760
gentle and beautiful women.

47
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
This hairpin

48
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,760
was gifted by His Majesty

49
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
on my birthday.

50
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Your Highness is beautiful

51
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
and adores the six palaces.

52
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
No one can take it.

53
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
Why is my hair white?

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Don't be angry, Your Highness.

55
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
I can see it clearly.

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
It's not white hair.

57
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
It's the sun

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
shining on my hair.

59
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
You are wrong.

60
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
Idiot.

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
You don't know

62
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
how to share my worries.

63
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
You only think about

64
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
how to deceive me.

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
If I lose my favor

66
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
because of you

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
and your deceit,

68
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
I will send you all to Xinzhekou.

69
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
I dare not.

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
I dare not deceive you.

71
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Your Highness,

72
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Lady Zhao is asking for an audience.

73
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
Zhao Yanwan,

74
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
you haven't come out for a long time.

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
I thought you saw

76
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
I was disqualified

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
and hid in the room

78
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
to celebrate.

79
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
Are you here

80
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
to vent your anger on me?

81
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
You are too stupid

82
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,760
to even know the news.

83
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
His Majesty

84
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
adores the palace maids.

85
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
But you said

86
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
the palace maids met with the guards.

87
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,760
Even I was hurt.

88
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
I haven't blamed you.

89
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
You came to me

90
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
to hide your grievance.

91
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,760
Zhao Yanwan,

92
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Zhao Yanwan,

93
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
who gave you the guts?

94
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,760
The social situation

95
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
attracted my brother's attention.

96
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Now my brother

97
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,760
is angry with His Majesty

98
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
and is transferred to Li Jing.

99
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
How can I warn you?

100
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
If you get my brother involved,

101
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
I will not let you go.

102
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,760
You dare to hit me?

103
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
Put away

104
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
your woman's attitude.

105
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
Don't think that

106
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
you can be free

107
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
with a beautiful face.

108
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Now His Majesty

109
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
is jealous of you.

110
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Your proud face

111
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
is useless.

112
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
You bitch.

113
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
Bitch.

114
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
How dare you hit my face?

115
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,760
How dare you hit me?

116
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
Let go.

117
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
How dare you?

118
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
How dare you hit my face?

119
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
How dare you hit my face?

120
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
How dare you hit my face?

121
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
How dare you hit my face?

122
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
I will kill

123
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
that bitch Lingyun.

124
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
You are not allowed to interfere.

125
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,760
If you do

126
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
anything

127
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
that will cause you trouble,

128
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
I will not spare you.

129
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
If you do anything

130
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
that will cause you trouble,

131
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
I will not spare you.

132
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
Your Majesty,

133
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,760
it's time to turn the cards.

134
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
It's time to turn the cards.

135
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,760
The wedding dress of Yongxiu Palace.

136
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
My Lady,

137
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,760
His Majesty came to Yongxiu Palace tonight.

138
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,760
You are wearing a plain dress.

139
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
I will find a more elegant dress

140
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
to change for you.

141
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,760
This one.

142
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
This one is good.

143
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,760
Even if you are wearing a plain dress,

144
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
it's still the most beautiful.

145
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
You are good at praising.

146
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
I am good at praising.

147
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
There are many beautiful ladies in the harem.

148
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
And I

149
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,760
am just one of them.

150
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,760
You know your place.

151
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Your Majesty.

152
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
Greetings, Your Majesty.

153
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
May Your Majesty be blessed with good health.

154
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,760
Get up.

155
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
What are you doing?

156
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Your Majesty,

157
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
do you feel

158
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
a little bit guilty about me?

159
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Why do you say that?

160
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
I did something stupid

161
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
that caused Concubine Wan and Concubine Zhao to catch me.

162
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
Your Majesty,

163
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,760
if it wasn't because of me,

164
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,760
you wouldn't have lost face.

165
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,760
If you want to vent your anger,

166
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
punish me.

167
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
According to what you said,

168
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
I should punish you well.

169
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
But Your Majesty,

170
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
I am unable to sleep at night because of you.

171
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,760
I am really worried.

172
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,760
I am thinking about sharing your burden.

173
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
I really want Your Majesty

174
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
to have a good sleep at night.

175
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
I also want to

176
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,760
beat the Zhao brothers and sisters.

177
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,760
I have a deep regret.

178
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,760
That's why I set this trap.

179
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
Who would have thought

180
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,760
Concubine Wan and Concubine Zhao

181
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
would be so overreacting.

182
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
No matter what,

183
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
I shouldn't have

184
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
involved Your Majesty in this.

185
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,760
I am guilty.

186
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Your Majesty, please punish me.

187
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,760
You are really bold.

188
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
You even dared to set this trap on me.

189
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,760
For the sake of your sincerity,

190
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,760
I will forgive you this time.

191
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
If you dare to do it again,

192
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,760
I will not forgive you.

193
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

194
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
I will not do it again.

195
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
I will not do it again.

196
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
This is a real strategy.

197
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
I have forgotten to take the West Hall.

198
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Get up.

199
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
Yes.

200
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

201
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
You little thing.

202
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,760
You are really heartless.

203
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
My Lady.

204
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
My Lady.

205
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
My Lady, you are awake.

206
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Did His Majesty go to the morning court?

207
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
Congratulations on your great achievement.

208
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
When His Majesty left,

209
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
he especially ordered

210
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
not to disturb His Majesty.

211
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
From today onwards,

212
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,760
I will definitely stand firm in the harem.

213
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
My Lady,

214
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,760
your good days are over.

215
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
You are really like a princess.

216
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Fu Xiang,

217
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
you follow me.

218
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
In the future, you will have to face

219
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
the bloodshed in the harem.

220
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
You must not let the harem

221
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
to face the bloodshed in the harem.

222
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Are you afraid?

223
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
No.

224
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
If you do not save me,

225
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
I will die in the Star Valley sooner or later.

226
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
Now,

227
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
I will give you my life.

228
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
Not to mention the bloodshed,

229
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
even if it is a mountain of knives and a lake of lakes,

230
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
as long as you need it,

231
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
I will dare to go.

232
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Okay.

233
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
No matter what the future is,

234
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
we will go to the harem.

235
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Your Highness,

236
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
you are reluctant to give up the bloodshed, right?

237
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,760
If you cannot do it,

238
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
just forget it.

239
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Now,

240
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
there is no way out.

241
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
Your Highness,

242
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
can you stop now?

243
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
If something bad happens,

244
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Your Highness,

245
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,760
you will be involved.

246
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Do you think I want to?

247
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
I checked the background of that Ling Yun.

248
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
He was the one who

249
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,760
killed the Emperor of the Great Wei.

250
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
He was the one who

251
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
was framed by Zhao Yanwan

252
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
and killed by that

253
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,760
officer's daughter.

254
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,760
It is clear that he was going to the harem

255
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
to find Zhao Yanwan to avenge him.

256
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Why did Concubine Wan

257
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
kill Ling Yun's father?

258
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Ling Yun's father

259
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
broke the secret of Zhao Yanwan's identity.

260
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
To cover up the truth,

261
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Zhao Yanwan framed Ling Yun's father for stealing.

262
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
Ling Yun's father

263
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,760
died of being poisoned.

264
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
In order to eliminate the consequences,

265
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Zhao Yanwan forced his brother

266
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
to send someone to kill the whole family of Ling Yun.

267
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
I thought

268
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,760
this matter was covered up.

269
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
But I didn't expect

270
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,760
that the fish of the net was escaped.

271
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
If I don't eliminate Ling Yun,

272
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
my brother and I will be implicated.

273
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
If he reveals

274
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,760
the identity of Zhao Yanwan's father,

275
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
the whole Zhao family will be doomed

276
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
for the crime of deceiving the emperor.

277
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
So, Ling Yun,

278
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
you must die.
