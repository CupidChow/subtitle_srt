00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Who are you?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Don't touch me!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Don't touch me!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hold her hand.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Zhang Yuepan,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I want to know

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
what disease is she suffering from?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Your Majesty,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
her pulse is weak

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and her pulse is empty.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
She should have taken

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
some unknown drugs for a long time.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Her body was almost hollowed out,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
so she had this pulse.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What's going on?

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What kind of unknown drugs

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
is she taking?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Tong An,

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
search the palace!

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Greetings, Your Majesty and Your Highness.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Your Majesty,

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I know why

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Consort Wan went crazy.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Consort Wan didn't take any drugs.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Instead,

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
she took human blood to stop her pulse.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
She took human blood to bathe.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Her pulse is not old.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Her youth is long-lasting.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Human blood to stop her pulse?

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In order to

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
restore her face,

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Consort Wan

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
was favored by His Majesty.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
She took human blood

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
to bathe every day.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Two of her servants

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
were killed by her.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Your Majesty, please investigate it.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Please save us.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Do you know

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the consequences of slandering Consort Wan?

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Do you have any evidence?

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Is what Lin Zhu said

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
true?

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Lin Zhu,

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
it's your good fortune

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
to ask me for my blood.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's your good fortune!

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Your Majesty,

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I found this

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
in Consort Wan's room.

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Pass my order.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Consort Wan has disturbed the harem.

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She has killed innocent people.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
She has taken the title

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and has destroyed the throne.

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
She will never win

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
in the Cold Palace.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Your Majesty,

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I have another report.

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Go ahead.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I have found out

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
that Consort Wan is the eldest daughter

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
of General Zhao.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
In fact,

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
she is the adopted daughter

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
of General Zhao.

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They lied to the world

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and sent her to the palace.

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It is said that

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
the blood-soaked

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Zhu Yan's forbidden spell

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
is the secret magic

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
of the adopted daughter of Yangzhou.

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you have any evidence?

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Your Majesty,

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
this is the body of Zhao Wan Song

82
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
when he took the title

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
of the first-class

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
of the Cuiying House

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
in the south of the Yangtze River.

86
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It was Zhao Yan Wan's

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
body when he was taken away.

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
General Zhao is so bold.

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Pass my order.

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Zhao Wan Song

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
has deceived the emperor.

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He is not allowed to serve the emperor.

93
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He will be demoted

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
from his post today.

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He will be demoted to a commoner.

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
His family property will be confiscated

97
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and his family will be exiled

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
to Ninggu Pagoda.

99
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
As for Lady Yun

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
who revealed the truth of the deceiving emperor,

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
she has done a great service.

102
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Lady Yun, please give her a chance.

103
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I will be cautious and careful

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and will not let you down.

106
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Your Majesty,

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I am not the adopted daughter of Yangzhou.

108
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I am not the adopted daughter of Yangzhou.

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I am the adopted daughter of the Princess Consort Wan.

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I am the adopted daughter of the Princess Consort Wan.

111
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You loved me

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
the most before.

113
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You were so beautiful.

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Don't believe this bitch, Lin Yun.

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't believe this bitch, Lin Yun.

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't believe her

117
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and her death.

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Your Majesty.

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Your Majesty.

120
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Your Majesty.

121
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I remember that

122
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
you Zhao sisters were highly favored.

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But today you are so quiet.

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's really not good.

125
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Consort Jing,

126
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
even if I am disliked,

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
it's not your turn to be happy.

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You are just the useless empress of His Majesty.

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You are not qualified to make fun of me.

130
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I have been thinking about Buddha

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and I have no intention to compete for favor.

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But this Yunpin is really powerful.

133
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He could find the evidence

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
from more than ten years ago.

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Not only did he destroy you,

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
he destroyed General Zhao

137
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and the Zhao family.

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He is so clever

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and he knows how to work.

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Lin Yun, this bitch,

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
always opposes me.

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I will cut him into pieces

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and make him a dead man.

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's a pity.

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You are trapped in this cold palace.

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You can't go out.

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
In fact, everyone has soft tears.

148
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Do you want to deal with Yunpin?

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You come here.

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I will tell you a secret.

151
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I will tell you a secret.

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Are you here to show off with me?

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You won.

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You are now the most favored woman of His Majesty.

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
His Majesty's favor is very important to you.

156
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But to me,

157
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
nothing is.

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You used to be the Princess Consort Wan.

159
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You were so high and powerful.

160
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You never looked at people.

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Now you are Zhao Yanwan.

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Can't you see who I am?

163
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Who are you?

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I have never seen you before.

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Do you remember

166
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
the Bi Jiangchen couple?

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Bi Jiangchen?

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes.

169
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Bi Jiangchen

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
was the official

171
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
who was removed from the official post

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
because you killed him.

173
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He recognized you

174
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:16,700
as the

175
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
his daughter.

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So it's you, mother.

177
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So it's you.

178
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's all your karma.

179
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
My parents died.

180
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
My brother was lost.

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Do you know

182
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
what I have been through

183
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
in the past 12 years?

184
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I spent every day in the panic.

185
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I wanted to

186
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
tear your bones and skin at all times.

187
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I finally found a chance to get into the palace

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and got you.

189
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's useless to say so much.

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Just kill me.

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's not that easy

192
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
for you to die.

193
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't you want to know

194
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
your brother's news?

195
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What did you say?

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
My brother is still alive.

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Where is my brother?

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Tell me.

199
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Where is my brother?

200
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The sky is far away.

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The mirror is in front of you.

202
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Your brother is in the light.

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But you will never know

204
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
who he is.

205
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
My brother.

206
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Your Highness.

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Your Highness.

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I need to ask you for a favor.

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What is it?

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I want to ask you

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
to find someone for me.

212
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
My brother is in the light.

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Are you joking?

214
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Or am I drunk?

215
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Why is your brother

216
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
in the palace?

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Concubine Sourire said

218
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
my brother was in the palace.

219
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He was a lover.

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He shouldn't have lied to me.

221
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Your Excellency.

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I can't live without my brother.

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Please help me find him.

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You always come to me

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
for something.

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Have you ever thought

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
why I would help you?

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Because we have the same enemy.

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Isn't Zhao Yanwan

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
your enemy?

231
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I am the director of the 14th Office.

232
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I am not enemies with anyone.

233
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I always follow the rules

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and do my job.

235
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Concubine Sourire is your enemy.

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There are many workers in the palace.

237
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If you want to find someone,

238
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
you can find him without any clues.

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Besides, it has been so many years.

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
How can you know he is still alive?

241
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What if he is no longer alive?

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Even if there is only one percent chance,

243
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I will find him.

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
If your brother

245
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
becomes someone you can't imagine,

246
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
will you still want him?

247
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No matter what he becomes,

248
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I want him.

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Why?

250
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Because he is the only family

251
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I have in this world.

252
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay.

253
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This is the list of all the workers.

254
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You can find him yourself.

255
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Zhao Yanwan has been sent to the Cold Palace.

256
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You have achieved your dream.

257
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You don't need to worry.

258
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You don't need to come to me.

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Thank you, sir.

260
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I will remember your kindness.

261
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You don't need to find him.

262
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He may not want to see you.

263
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The End
