00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Qingcheng

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Greetings to Consort Jing.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Rise.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
How is Lady Zhao's leg?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Thank you for your concern.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I am fine now.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Sit.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I heard that Lady Yun has some great tricks.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
She lured His Majesty and him on the boat in the middle of the night.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's too...

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This Lady Yun of ours,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
once she made a move,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the harem would be in a mess.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Everyone, be careful.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If you get hurt,

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
don't say that I didn't warn you.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Greetings to Consort Jing, Consort Wan, and Consort Shu.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Sit.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Lady Yun is the new concubine of His Majesty.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
She is granted to live in Yongxiu Palace.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
From today on,

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
we are all sisters.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Everyone says that Lady Yun is talented and smart.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
She is very favored by His Majesty.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We sisters are very careless.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We will have to ask for more from you in the future.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Your Highness, you are very kind.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What kind of clever people are there in the harem?

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's just that the grace of the emperor is like flowing water.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The flowers will be red for 500 days.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
His Majesty is just trying to be fresh.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
He is tired of the emperor

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
by using the lower means to compete for favor.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Grace of the emperor is like flowing water.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The flowers will be red for 500 days.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well said.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Lady Zhao was reckless a few days ago

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and angered His Majesty.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Next time, she will remember it.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I think Lady Yun looks familiar.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But where have you seen her?

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You have a good memory.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Lady Yun used to be

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
a servant of the new servant

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
who served the master.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
In the harem,

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
who is not a servant serving His Majesty?

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Serving His Majesty with all your heart

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
is the ability.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
All right.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We are all sisters.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We need to get along well.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why do we have to fight with each other?

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Greetings, Lady Yun.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Consort Jing is here to congratulate you

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
on your promotion to the Eastern Sea.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Here is a pair of pearl hairpins.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you, Consort Jing.

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Greetings, Lady Yun.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Lady Zhao has prepared

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
a gold chain bracelet for you.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Thank you, Lady Zhao.

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Greetings, Lady Yun.

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Consort Wan, congratulations on your promotion to the Yongxiu Palace

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and the pearl hairpins made by the Tianzhu Kui.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you, Consort Wan.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you, sisters.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I thank you all.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Lady Yun,

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
if you have time,

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
you can visit the palaces

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and be a good partner.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The fragrance of the Tianzhu Kui is really unique.

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I can smell it even from the box.

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This is the first time I've seen flowers from Tianzhu.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Consort Wan's gift is really special.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't be too generous.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Is there a problem, Lady Yun?

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There are strict etiquette rules in the palace.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The concubine gives the flower,

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
while the concubine gives the hairpin.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The more precious the flower is,

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the more respected it is.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Consort Wan is higher than me.

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The gift is the precious Tianzhu Kui hairpin.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a bit strange.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Then I'll take care of the hairpins.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No need.

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm waiting for her to put on makeup.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Wait here.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Steward Wu.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Greetings, Lady Yun.

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There's no one else here.

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You don't have to do this.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
My Lady and I are separated by you.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We can't use etiquette.

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What's the matter, Lady Yun?

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Consort Wan gave me the Tianzhu Kui hairpin today.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't know if there's a hidden secret in it.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Tianzhu Kui is rare.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's used to make hairpins.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The craftsman who made it should have made it himself.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Everything has to be done according to the rules.

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
There will be a professional inspection.

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There won't be any problem.

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Thank you.

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Steward Wu.

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Consort Wan and her sister

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
have been acting strangely lately.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't know what they'll do next.

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Lady Yun.

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're now the head of the palace.

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The higher you climb, the higher the mountain.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Everything needs to be prepared in advance.

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Steward Wu.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Can you help me find out

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
what's going on in Zhongning Palace?

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Stop it.

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't cause any trouble.

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Stop it?

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I haven't avenged myself. How can I stop it?

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Now, the Zhao family and I

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
are both living and dying.

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If I stop it,

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll be doomed.

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Forget it.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Forget it.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Greetings, Lady.

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You may rise.

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you, Lady.

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'd like to ask you to make some flower cakes for me.

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'd like to use this fresh Tianzhu kui

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
to make some.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Thank you.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't worry, Lady.

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll make sure you'll get

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
the flowers you like.

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
One more thing.

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Can you use other materials

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
to make the Tianzhu kui

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that can be used as a needle?

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Can you do it?

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Thank you for your gift.

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We'll make it with all our heart.

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We'll make it with real and fake needles.

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What I asked you to do today

151
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
is a big deal.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Do you understand?

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I understand.

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I won't say a word to anyone.

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Take care, Lady.

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Lady, why did you make the real flowers into cakes

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and use the fake ones?

158
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What's the secret behind the Tianzhu kui?

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't know.

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I can't wait to see it.

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I can't wait any longer.

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But in order to avoid disturbing the mood,

163
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I asked Wan Fei and her sister

164
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
to find out that I suspected the Tianzhu kui.

165
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I had to pretend to wear it.

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So the fake ones

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
were left by the mistress.

168
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Tomorrow, I'll make the Tianzhu kui

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
into a cake

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and send it back to Wan Fei.

171
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll see what it looks like

172
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
in her eyes.

173
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Today, I gathered all of you

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
to discuss the birthday of the Empress Dowager.

175
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Who else hasn't arrived yet?

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The newly-claimed Lady Yun hasn't arrived yet.

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Neither has Lady Zhao.

178
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Sisters, I'm late.

179
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Your Highnesses,

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I wish you good luck.

181
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You may rise.

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Lady Yun, you just got conferred.

183
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You should be more polite.

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
A few days ago,

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I haven't had time to thank you

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
for the gift you gave me.

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Today, I made some flower cakes

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
to give you a taste

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to express my gratitude.

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm late.

191
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Please forgive me.

192
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're the mistress.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why are you making flower cakes?

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're used to serving people.

195
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Those who don't know

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
will think you're still a maid.

197
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
After all, it was made by Lady Yun.

198
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's have a taste.

199
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Your Highness, please have a taste.

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Your Highness, please have a taste.

201
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Your Highness, please have a taste.

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
All right, sit down.

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Greetings to Your Highnesses.

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Greetings to Your Highnesses.

205
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Your Highnesses.

206
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Your Highnesses.

207
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Your Highnesses.

208
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Your face is full of blood.

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Your Highnesses.

210
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
How could you lose your temper

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
after you're hurt like this?

212
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh no,

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Her Highnesses are so proud of her.

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's going to change the world.

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,800
His Majesty has arrived.
