00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yinzi, you don't have to take the risk.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And she told me

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
she has got everything she wants.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What does she want?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
She said she wanted to make the people happy

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and enjoy the happiness.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
She has been enjoying

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
since she entered the palace.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
She has enjoyed

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
everything she wants.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So she said she would die without regret.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I have never enjoyed

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
her glory.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Of course, I won't feel sorry for her.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But as a woman,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I really don't want to see her

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
die in the palace

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
in such a hurry.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
She has buried her life in the palace.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Congratulations on your revenge, Your Highness.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's good that you are back.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I was so upset

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
about what happened a few days ago.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's my fortune

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
to be able to serve you.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
In the future,

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
don't always

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
do these trivial things.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let those lazy girls

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
do their own things.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
My Lady,

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
the workers in the palace

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
have fallen ill recently.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
They can't turn around.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So they have to do things slowly.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Fallen ill?

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Maybe the weather has changed recently.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I have gone to the Imperial Hospital

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
to get the medicine.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The entire He Palace has fallen ill.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's not normal.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Go to the other palaces

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and ask around.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
See if there is anything wrong.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It seems that you are not ill.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why are you here?

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The palace is full of women.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The people are in panic.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The palace is heavily guarded.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I sneaked in.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Protect yourself.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't come to this kind of place.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I owe you.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't worry.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I will definitely save you from the palace.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I will definitely save you from the palace.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will definitely save you from the palace.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I will definitely save you from the palace.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I will definitely save you from the palace.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No need.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mind your own business.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I am a descendant of the previous dynasty.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's my honor to share your burden.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't understand.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Since you know your identity is sensitive,

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
why are you so careless?

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
People live.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There are not many reasons

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
to do what you like.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There are not many reasons to do what you like.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now that you have done what you like,

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
you will go out of the palace and live well.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't be ridiculous.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's not easy to escape from the trap

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
that I can help you.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't see me again.

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I will definitely save you.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Wait for my news.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't need it.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I was born for my master.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I can die for my master.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I will die for my master.

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No one's life

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
is destined to be born.

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Your life should be born for yourself.

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
For me, for the future,

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
for anyone,

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
it's not worth it.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't be convinced.

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Be yourself.

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But find the meaning of living.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I never thought about

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
what you said.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't need to think about it anymore.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Believe me.

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I will definitely save you.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Your Majesty, please rest in peace.

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yan Bin,

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
don't come over.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Your Majesty,

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
the palace is in a bad mood now.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
In order to protect you from the cold,

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I suggest

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
you go to the Bishu Villa

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
to hide.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm fine.

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You should go back first.

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Someone, come!

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Call the imperial physician!

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Your Majesty, you are...

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You are infected with a swan.

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I need to get you treated as soon as possible.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I will do my best

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
to treat Your Majesty.

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Stop!

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Even His Majesty is sick.

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Is he sick too?

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Where have you been?

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I've been looking for you for a long time.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why are you back so late?

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I went to the imperial study.

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
His Majesty also got a message.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you okay?

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm fine.

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
His Majesty asked me to take

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
those sick and ill princes

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
to the palace to hide.

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You should go back to the palace

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and pack up.

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm going to take Lady Mu.

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Be careful.

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll wait for you at Taiping Gate.

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Take the prisoner to the execution ground.

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes.

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What are you doing?

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll take you out.

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
His Majesty has also got the message.

143
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The harem is not poor.

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He's allowed to leave the palace to hide.

145
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
When the time comes,

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
you can be my maid

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and leave the palace together.

148
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let's go.

149
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Be careful.

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He's sick.

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He's dead.

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Throw away the garbage.

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Sister.

154
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You're not living a good life.

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Why are you

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
here in this place

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
that makes me sick?

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The palace is in full bloom.

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't know if you're doing well.

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I came to see you.

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I've lost my job.

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You're still concerned about me.

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I have no grudge against you.

164
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I've never thought

165
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
that you'd be so kind to me.

166
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I've never thought

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
that I'd fight with you.

169
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You don't hate me

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
because I treated you like that?

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We're just doing something

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
that's good for us.

173
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The past is over.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I've paid the price.

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't hate you.

176
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Ling Yu.

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You're a kind woman.

178
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're not suitable in the palace.

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Find a chance to leave the palace

180
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and live your own life.

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Sister.

182
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The palace is in full bloom.

183
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's very important.

184
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let's find a way

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
to escape from the palace and hide.

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I've thought about it

187
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
after going through so many things.

188
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're right.

189
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's not good to force yourself.

190
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm not a good person.

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm not a good person.

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
For someone who doesn't belong to me,

193
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I've wasted so much time

194
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and effort.

195
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I should have figured it out.

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Ling Yu.

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's go out of the palace together.

198
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The farther you go, the better.

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't come back.

200
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I was the empress of His Majesty.

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm responsible for the family's mission.

202
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
At the critical moment,

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I want to spend the difficult time with His Majesty.

204
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You should go.

205
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Sister.

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If His Majesty hears you,

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
he'll regret

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
his heartless love for you.

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If I insist on staying with His Majesty,

210
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I won't persuade you anymore.

211
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But you must take good care of yourself.

212
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The imperial doctors in the Imperial Hospital

213
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
are all in the palace.

214
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You must take good care of yourself.

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay.

216
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Take good care of yourself after you leave the palace.

217
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Go.

218
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Go.

219
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We're finally free.

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Go.

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Go.
