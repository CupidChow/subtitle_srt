1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
My Lady, please check again tomorrow.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The candlelight case hurt my eyes.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Your brother is in the palace.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We can find him sooner or later.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I have to find my brother as soon as possible.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I can only relax my heart.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Help me find him.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
According to the year,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
my brother should be in the year of the temple.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The tomb of the Imperial Hospital is also from Qiongzhou.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Could it be that he is 37 years old

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and not the right age?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My Lady, the Funing in the Imperial Kitchen

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
is both the right age for the time of the visit and the arrival.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The 8th is not right.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My brother was born on the 10th of August.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And his parents are here.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
My Lady, it's really a hassle to check it.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
My Lady, do you remember

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
what your brother looks like?

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I haven't seen him for so many years.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How can I know what he looks like now?

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
By the way,

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I remember my brother had a scar on his back.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
When he climbed trees to help me get the kite,

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
he accidentally fell down and fell.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's really hard to find the scar on the back of the back.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We can't go around to show men's clothes

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and look at the back of the back, right?

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's right.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't know when I can find my brother.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I just hope he can be safe in the palace.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Have you heard that the new Lady Mu

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
was born as a horse-drawn woman?

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's really surprising.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
A horse-drawn woman?

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How is that possible?

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why would His Majesty like her?

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's hard to predict His Majesty's mind.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Who can guess?

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yesterday, he was a slave in the stable.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Today, he became the master of our Pingqi Pavilion.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He's really a great man.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And when he entered the palace,

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
he gave everyone around him a horse-drawn woman.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He's so powerful and unyielding.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What is he doing?

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Isn't he afraid of offending people?

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What are you afraid of?

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
His Majesty is in charge of him.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He has no fear.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We old people have to be careful.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If we bump into him one day,

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
it'll be a big trouble.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
My Lady, His Majesty brought a horse-drawn woman

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
back from the palace.

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
She's been promoted to Noble Lady.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
His Majesty has been very fond of her recently.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
My Lady, since Zhao Yanwan was sent to the Cold Palace,

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
His Majesty never came to our Yongxiu Palace.

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If this continues,

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
our future days will be hard to live.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
His Majesty is a wise man.

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He's obviously angry with me.

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But because of Concubine Sourire,

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
he made a scene and made me angry.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What should we do?

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Just let Noble Lady Mu take His Majesty away?

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I have heard about Noble Lady Mu.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
His Majesty favors someone else.

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
How does that have anything to do with us?

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
My Lady.

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The most important thing now is to find Bida.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Nothing else matters.

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's not a good idea to keep looking for her.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Tong An is working in the imperial study.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He has more information.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Maybe we can ask Tong An about it.

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Tong An?

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Tong An.

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Tell everyone to get me some hot water.

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes, Master.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Go.

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Wait for me at the back.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
His back also has a part.

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Have you ever thought about

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
why I would help you?

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Because we have the same enemy.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Isn't Zhao Yanwan also your enemy?

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm the head of the Fourteenth Office.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm not enemies with anyone.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If your brother

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
becomes someone you can't even imagine,

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll be the enemy of you.

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm the head of the Fourteenth Office.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm the enemy of you.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm the enemy of you.

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
If he becomes someone you can't even imagine,

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
will you still want him?

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Concubine Yun.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What are you doing here at this late hour?

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm fine.

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I went to the wrong room.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Greetings, Concubine Yun.

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Greetings, Consort Jing.

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Concubine Yun, please go to the Palace of Peace.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Greetings, Consort Jing.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What do you want me to do?

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Sit down.

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
There's a Noble Lady Mu in the palace.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you know?

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I heard a little.

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There are many beautiful flowers in the palace.

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's not a good thing to have a single thread.

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Your Highness,

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Consort Wan is gone now.

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't want to compete with her anymore.

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What if I want you to compete with her?

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Your Highness, what do you mean?

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I heard you've been looking for your brother.

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
How did you know about this?

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
As long as I want to know about the palace,

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
there's nothing I can't know.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Your Highness,

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
do you know who my brother is?

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Have you never doubted it?

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Have you never doubted it?

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Your brother is...

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Wu Lin Fu.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Impossible.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
How is that possible?

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Back then,

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
your father was killed by Consort Wan

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
for the crime of seducing someone.

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Your family was destroyed.

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You and your brother escaped.

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You and your brother died while you were escaping.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Is that right?

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Look.

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Is this the sachet your mother embroidered?

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Mother embroidered the sachet for me and my brother.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So, my brother...

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It really is him.

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If I hadn't saved him in time

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and brought him into the palace,

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
he would've been starved to death.

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He would've been starved to death.

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
If I hadn't brought him into the palace,

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
he would've been starved to death.

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Your Highness,

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
tell me the truth.

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What's the purpose?

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Go see him first.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We'll talk about it later.

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
My brother is really Wu Lin Fu.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Your Highness.

162
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Lady Cheng.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Eunuch Tu Wan, why are you here?

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Did His Majesty ask you to come see me?

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's not His Majesty.

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Consort Jing asked me to bring you some soup.

167
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's Consort Jing.

168
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
She's still thinking about me.

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I should thank her.

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Consort Jing said

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
this is a tonic made from the old mountains of the past.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
She asked you to drink it while it's hot.

173
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The imperial physician said I have weak stomach.

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I can't drink too much.

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You can leave it there.

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll keep it and drink it slowly.

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But...

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
These are all her wishes.

179
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't let them down.

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Drink it now.

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Tong An,

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
what kind of soup is this?

183
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Why did she ask me to drink it in person?

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Cheng Dayu,

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
in this palace,

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
whether you die or I live,

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm just a servant.

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Please remember that.

189
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Tong An,

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You...

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You...

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What did you give me to drink?

194
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Tong An,

195
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
have you ever been protected?

196
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I've been bullied since I was little.

197
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Until I met my master,

198
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I was bullied.

199
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I was bullied.

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I was bullied.

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I was bullied.

202
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Until I met my master,

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I was protected by my master.

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's how I experienced the respect of others.

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Protecting the weak,

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
is a good instinct.

207
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
When you have the ability to protect others,

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
you'll know.

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Come on.

210
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Pour the wine.

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Come on.

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Pour the wine.

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Come on.

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Servants,

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
pour the wine.

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Look at her.

217
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
She drank too much during the day.

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't usually take care of us.

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Why don't we just care about her?

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What are you doing?

221
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Eunuch Zhang.

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Eunuch Zhang.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Go back to work.

224
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If you can't do your job well,

225
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
you'll get hurt.

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Usually,

227
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I see you all are so honest.

228
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But today, you're just lazy.

229
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
As the saying goes,

230
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
you know people but you don't know their hearts.

231
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Today,

232
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
you dare to show off in front of me.

233
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Tomorrow,

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
you'll be

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
stabbed in the back by me.

236
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'll be the dead ghost

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
who died for nothing.

238
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What did you say?

239
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Say it again.

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I didn't say anything.

241
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Maybe I did something wrong

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and met the ghost in the middle of the night.

243
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm so suspicious.

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Recently,

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I always dreamt of Tong Wuan coming to me.

246
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
In my dream,

247
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
he kept crying with me.

248
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
He even told me

249
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
he died so unjustly.

250
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Concubine Yun is here.
