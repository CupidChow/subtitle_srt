1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Empress of Attack on Titan

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Your Majesty!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Your Majesty, save me!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Your Majesty!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Your Majesty, save me!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Your Majesty!

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
My dear, what's wrong with your face?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What's wrong with your face?

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Your Majesty,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Concubine Wan's face was hurt by Zhao Guiren's cat.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Your Majesty, I...

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Zhao Guiren, you hurt a cat.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You're so kind.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm so disappointed in you.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Your Majesty, I didn't do it.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I really didn't, Your Majesty.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I didn't, Your Majesty.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
From today on,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Zhao Guiren is grounded in Zhongning Palace.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Without my order,

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
you can't leave Zhongning Palace.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Your Highness,

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Concubine Wan is here to greet you.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let them get out!

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Stop!

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let me do it.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Your Highness.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Raise your head.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I told you to raise your head!

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You dare not look at me, right?

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Why don't you look at me?

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Am I ugly now?

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I dare not.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Everyone says that Your Highness is beautiful

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and has beautiful eyebrows.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Even if your face was hurt by a cat,

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
you're still the prettiest.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You all dare to look at my back.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You all dare to look at my back.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're all happy

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
when I was caught.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Get out!

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Go find the imperial physician for me.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What are you doing here?

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm afraid that you're lonely in the palace.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So I brought some food

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
to talk with you.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You're not a good person.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How can you be so kind?

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm never a person who is always down to earth.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Sit down.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I have a question.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm curious

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
how you did

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
to make the cat not hurt you.

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
When Concubine Sourire

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
gave me the hairpin,

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I checked it carefully

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
to see if someone

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
made a nail in the flower.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Who would be stupid enough

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
to poison the flower directly?

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Since there is no poison in the flower,

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
where will you

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
poison me?

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't know.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Later, I found out

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that someone in Zhongning Palace

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
held the cat

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and had contact

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
with the dog with the phlegm.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Your cat

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
seems to have phlegm too.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So I understood that

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
you might want to

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
use the medicine

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
to trigger your cat

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
to be crazy and hurt me.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Finally,

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
you used phlegm

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
to take responsibility.

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I understand.

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So you added

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
the beads

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
to the flower cake

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
you made?

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Lingyun,

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I have to admit

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
that you are really good.

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You have a deep plan.

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm convinced that you lost.

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But you don't have to

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
ruin her reputation.

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
She is the one who did it.

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But,

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
you are innocent.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I came here today

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to ask you

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
if we can

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
cooperate.

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Lingyun,

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
are you crazy or am I?

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I and Zhao Yanwan

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
are all the daughters of the Zhao family.

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Who are you to provoke us?

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No matter how much I hate Zhao Yanwan,

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I will never cooperate with you.

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't say it so absolutely.

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Maybe you will

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
change your mind tomorrow.

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If you and Wan Fei

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
really are like what you said,

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
why did you lose your position

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and live in the capital for several days?

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But Wan Fei

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
never pleaded for you

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
in front of His Majesty

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and saved you from prison.

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He didn't even

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
visit you once.

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Your Highness, you went to the Zhongning Palace.

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's not a good time.

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Have some chrysanthemum

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to get rid of the bad luck.

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Zhao Lian'er

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
still has the nerve to

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
argue with me.

133
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It seems that he hasn't realized

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
that he is in a bad situation.

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Lady Zhao doesn't want to

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
talk to you about

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Wan Fei.

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What should we do?

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Although he didn't mention it,

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
he still has the nerve

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
to talk to me about her.

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He is not a good person.

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Although he didn't mention it,

144
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
his reaction

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
has already verified

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
some of my guess.

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Your Highness, your guess is...

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Actually, Wan Fei

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
is a poor and inferior person.

150
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Although he has the appearance of a Qing State

151
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and adores the six palaces,

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
he is too fond of his honor

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
in exchange for his own gains and losses.

154
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He blindly thought

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
that as long as he had the character,

156
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
he could stand in the harem

157
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and be invincible.

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But the beauty Chi Mu

159
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
is the most important thing

160
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
for a general.

161
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Beauty is the most unreliable thing.

162
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
People of color love to eat

163
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
when they are in bad shape.

164
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
In this harem,

165
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
the beauty is like a cloud.

166
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
She has lived in the harem for a long time

167
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and has never heard of the fragrance.

168
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No matter how beautiful she looks,

169
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
she will get tired

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
after seeing her for a long time.

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's a pity

172
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
that Wan Fei doesn't even

173
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
understand this principle.

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
She doesn't allow her beauty

175
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
to be tainted by her appearance.

176
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
When she is not satisfied,

177
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
she becomes like a big enemy

178
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and makes her face crazy.

179
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Look at her face.

180
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
She also becomes

181
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
a slave to her beautiful face.

182
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I just want to use

183
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
her inner fear,

184
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
her potential,

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and her communication with her

186
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
to kill her.

187
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
When my mistress was favored,

188
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
you wanted to

189
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
go to the eight realms

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
to pray for her.

191
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But you just took some tonics

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and left.

193
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Miss,

194
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I just did what I was supposed to do.

195
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Your mistress

196
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
is a noble now.

197
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
A noble

198
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
can't enjoy the treatment of a commoner.

199
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No matter where you go,

200
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
you can't choose

201
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
your slave.

202
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You are a bunch of

203
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
shrewd slaves.

204
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
When my mistress is favored,

205
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
you will be the ones to suffer.

206
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You are the ones to suffer.

207
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Look at me.

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
My mistress

209
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
was already

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
favored by these shrewd slaves.

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But you gave her

212
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
a little something.

213
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You broke it.

214
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How dare you talk to me?

215
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What's wrong

216
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
with the internal affairs?

217
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If you want to blame someone,

218
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
you can only blame your mistress

219
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
for not being loyal.

220
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Aunt Jiang,

221
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
you have also received

222
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
a lot of favors from the Zhao family.

223
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
How can you be so heartless

224
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and ungrateful?

225
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You don't deserve to blame me.

226
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Miss Huizhi,

227
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
stop crying here.

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's go.

229
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Sister Huizhi,

230
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
get up.

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The internal affairs are corrupt and low.

232
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The atmosphere is not good.

233
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Aunt Jiang

234
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
has stopped the family

235
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and instead, she is cursing.

236
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Aren't you afraid that you will lose

237
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the honor of the Sixth Palace

238
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
to Consort Wan?

239
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You are so smart.

240
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't rely on the favor

241
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
of Lady Yun of Yongxiu Palace.

242
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You will be the queen of the world.

243
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
If you don't stop,

244
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Lady Zhao's today

245
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
will be your mistress' tomorrow.

246
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You...

247
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Sister Huizhi,

248
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
come here.

249
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I asked the mistress

250
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
to personally choose some gifts

251
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
for Lady Zhao

252
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and I will see.

253
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Here.

254
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
These are the best

255
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
bird's nest and ginseng.

256
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This is the winter grass.

257
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This is the fish sauce.

258
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Thank you, Sister Fuqiang.

259
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Thank you, Lady Yun.

260
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You are welcome.

261
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Our mistress said

262
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
if Lady Zhao's cat

263
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
didn't do a great job,

264
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
she wouldn't be like this today.

265
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Now that Lady Zhao

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
is being treated coldly,

267
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
our Yongxiu Palace

268
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
will surely give her a helping hand.

269
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
She won't stand aside.

270
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What?

271
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What does it have to do with Lady Zhao?

272
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Sister Fuqiang, don't you forget

273
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
if Lady Yun didn't

274
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
be the guest,

275
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
how could Lady Zhao

276
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
have a fight

277
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
with Consort Wan?

278
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't want

279
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
these things anymore.

280
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Your Highness.

281
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Your Highness.

282
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Your Highness.

283
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What's the matter?

284
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You are in a panic.

285
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Your Highness,

286
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I just saw

287
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Lady Yun's

288
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
personal maid Fuqiang

289
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
at the Imperial Household Department.

290
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
She was always protecting her.

291
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Do you think

292
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Lady Yun and Lady Zhao

293
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
have colluded with each other

294
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
secretly?

295
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I just heard

296
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
the two of them mention a cat.

297
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
They said the cat did a great job.

298
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
No wonder

299
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Ling Yu was wearing

300
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
the Peony Flower.

301
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The cat didn't go after the cat,

302
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
but came after me.

303
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It was Zhao Lian'er,

304
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
the fool,

305
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
who colluded with the Yongxiu Palace

306
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
to frame me

307
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and make me a mess.

308
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
They took advantage of the fact

309
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
that His Majesty

310
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
adored me.

311
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Lady Zhao and Your Highness

312
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
are sisters.

313
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
How could she

314
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
do such a serious thing

315
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
to Your Highness?

316
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Don't be afraid.

317
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Everyone in the palace

318
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
will die.

319
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Zhao Lian'er,

320
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
if you don't admit it,

321
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
don't blame me for being heartless.

322
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Your Highness,

323
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm sorry.

324
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm sorry.

325
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sorry.

330
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm sorry.

336
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm sorry.

338
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm sorry.

339
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm sorry.

340
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm sorry.

344
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry.
