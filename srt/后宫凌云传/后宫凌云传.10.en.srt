The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 18

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Episode 18

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let me see your feet.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Good.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ling Yun, the Taoist Grandmother said

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that you have to wash these clothes before the night.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You are so soft. When are you going to wash them?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Why should I wash my clothes? It's none of your business.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Ling Yun, I know that Ruyi is dead. You are sad.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But you can't vent your anger on me.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Ling Yun, are you still mad at me for bullying you and Ruyi?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I...

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ruyi is dead. It's meaningless to say this.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Ruyi, we are still in the present situation.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We should do our duty first.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's more important to leave here as soon as possible.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I have no time to think about the rest.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Could it be that this little girl has found a way to leave the New Shrine?

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I want to see what you want to do.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Eunuch Tuan, I know you will pass by here.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am waiting for you here.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What do you want to do, Ling Yun?

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I want to see you.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Help me. Just this once.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You can't do this.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's a big crime to bring things from outside the palace.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If I get caught, I will be in trouble.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I am in a difficult situation.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ruyi is dead.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If I don't leave the New Shrine, I will die here.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Please help me.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Please help me.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There are people here.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You are making it difficult for me.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I promise, just this once.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
As long as I can leave the New Shrine,

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I will remember your kindness and repay you.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Since we have talked about this,

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I will help you this time because of your friendship with my master.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thank you, Eunuch.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This little bitch really has a way to leave the New Shrine.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Master, this is the money Ling Yun gave me.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This...

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Did it get switched?

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
When she gave it to you, it was a stone.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
When you find someone who is not here, return this to her.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Master, you call this being hurt and being thin?

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You have been talking a lot lately.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I am sorry. Master, please rest. I will leave first.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I want everyone to respect me, fear me,

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and bow down to me.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Master, you either help me become the Queen of the Emperor

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and get the Emperor's favor,

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
or from now on,

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
we will never be friends again.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is the path I have taken.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't want to drag you down.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Thank you, Eunuch Tong An.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Your kindness and kindness are unforgettable.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Why do you want this pill?

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I spent a lot of time outside the palace to find it.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Chengxi Palace has my ear.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I found out that Consort Wan is looking for this pill.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Although she is still in prison,

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
if I can give this pill to her,

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
she will do whatever she wants.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I will ask for a favor and leave the New Shrine.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Lingyun.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Lingyun, don't blame me.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I want to take this opportunity

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
to leave this place.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Where is my mirror box?

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Where is my mirror box?

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Stop.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Did you take my mirror box?

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Mirror box?

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What mirror box? I haven't seen it.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That mirror box is very important to me. Give it back to me.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What do you mean?

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
As the saying goes,

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
you can make it clear to catch thieves and thieves.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't use these dirty tricks to frame me.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Give it back to me.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't care about you anymore.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No one can protect you.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How dare you be so arrogant?

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You are so arrogant.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You should stay in the New Shrine for a lifetime.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I will say it again.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Give me the mirror box now.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I can save it.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You don't understand what I said, do you?

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I will say it again.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I will say it again.

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I didn't take your mirror box.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But you are so anxious

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
after losing something.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I am quite relieved.

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Cuiwei,

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
everything looks so simple.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can send the medicine out of the box

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
to keep me from the New Shrine.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But if you send it out,

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
you will lose your life.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You are so arrogant.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Cuiwei,

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
don't blame me for not reminding you.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You can stay in the New Shrine

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
at least for a lifetime.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You will have hope if you stay alive.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But if you do nothing,

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I can only send you out in advance.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I hope you won't be a slave in your next life

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and become a man who is honest and honest.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Get out of my way.

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Lingyun,

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
the fortune-teller said

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
he would get the grace point today

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and leave the New Shrine.

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
How can he get the grace point?

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If only we could get the grace point,

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
that would be great.

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't envy me.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
As the saying goes,

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
good fortune comes with good fortune.

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's see

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
whether it is good or bad.

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Shut up!

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You are so arrogant.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You are so arrogant.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You are so arrogant.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You are so arrogant.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You are so arrogant.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You are so arrogant.

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You are so arrogant.

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You are so arrogant.

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You are so arrogant.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This is the Royal Garden.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Do not make any noise.

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
His Majesty and Consort Wan and Consort Jin

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
are in the garden now.

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
If you disturb His Majesty,

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
you will be in big trouble.

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes.

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Consort Jin,

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
before I entered the palace,

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
my brother told me

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
to live with my sisters

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and serve His Majesty well.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I have been

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
rude to you.

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Please forgive me.

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You are welcome.

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't care about these little things.

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We both want to serve His Majesty well.

158
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
As long as His Majesty is kind,

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
we will have nothing to ask for.

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You are right.

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Consort Wan,

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Consort Jin has always been kind.

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's not talk about the past.

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Speaking of your brother, General Wan Song,

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
he is a great man.

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He is a great man?

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Your brother has made great contributions to our court.

168
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
His Majesty just returned from his military service.

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I am still thinking

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
how to reward your brother.

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Your Majesty,

172
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I do not understand.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's just that

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I haven't seen my brother for a long time.

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I wonder if I can ask His Majesty for a reward.

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Please allow my brother

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
to enter the palace and talk to me.

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It is normal for sisters to care about each other.

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
In a few days,

180
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I will have a banquet for your brother in the Royal Garden.

181
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
By then,

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
you can have a chat.

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Ling Yun,

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
you can't run away now.

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Get up.

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Eunuch Shun Xi.

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I have something important to ask you for help.

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Who am I?

190
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I am Cui Wei,

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
a criminal in the Herb-tasting Bureau.

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This is a small token of my gratitude.

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Please accept it.

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I have a treasure to give to Consort Wan.

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
When she sees it,

196
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
she will be very happy.

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Please help me to tell her.

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Her Highness is enjoying the flowers with His Majesty.

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
She doesn't have time to see a criminal.

200
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Get out of the way.

201
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Consort Wan.

202
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Consort Wan.

203
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I have something important to ask you for help.

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Consort Wan.

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Please help me to tell her.

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Consort Wan.

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I have a treasure to give to Consort Wan.

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hu Ling Fu,

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
go and see what's going on.

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes.

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Consort Wan.

212
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Get out of the way.

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Wait.

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Mr. Wu,

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
this is a very luxurious coin.

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's very luxurious.

217
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I am going to drive it out.

218
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What do you want?

219
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Mr. Wu,

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I have a treasure to give to Consort Wan.

221
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
When she sees it,

222
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
she will be very happy.

223
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Really?

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Then please help me to tell her.

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

226
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

227
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What are you doing

228
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
in front of His Majesty

229
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
with such a lowly servant?

230
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Your Highness,

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I shouldn't have brought her in.

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But this maid said

233
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
she has a treasure to give to you.

234
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I didn't dare to send her away.

235
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So I let her in

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
to show you.

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Treasure?

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
To me?

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Your Highness,

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I heard that you were looking for this.

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I worked hard

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and finally found it.

243
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So I dared to go to the palace

244
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
to give you the treasure.

245
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Su Ji Wan

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
How could it be Su Ji Wan?

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What's your name?

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I am Cui Wei,

249
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
the criminal in the secret Justice Department.

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I see.

251
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You may leave.

252
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Did you forget something?

253
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Your Highness,

254
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I brought you a treasure

255
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,440
I... I want to ask Your Highness to give me a favor.

256
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,120
Please let me leave the New House.

257
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,360
Please give me a favor.

258
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,320
I know. I'll let you go.

259
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

260
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,720
Thank you for your grace.

261
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,920
Wait.

262
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,240
I just saw a pill in the box.

263
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
The pill I gave you

264
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
is a test for your health.

265
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,640
You took it so easily.

266
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,400
You are a precious lady.

267
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,760
You can't use a pill that you haven't tested.

268
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,920
I'm also curious

269
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,600
what kind of pill is so precious

270
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,240
that you can exchange it for my grace.

271
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,640
It's just a tonic.

272
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,040
I took it when I was making the tonic.

273
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,280
I took it because it was so precious.

274
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,920
I don't want to hurt her.

275
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,160
I remember that Consort Jing knows medicine.

276
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
Let her test it for you.

277
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,840
It's rare that we are loyal.

278
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,200
After the test, we'll reward you according to the rules.

279
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,640
Lv He.

280
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,560
Your Highness.
