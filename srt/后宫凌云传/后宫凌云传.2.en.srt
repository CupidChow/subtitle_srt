00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're just a lowly maid

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
who only works with me.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Drink it.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Liu Ruoyun, how dare you break me?

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let go! Are you crazy?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Ruyi refused to give her mother's belongings to me for nothing.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You bullied her.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I helped Ruyi to get justice.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You targeted me.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What can I bully?

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Today is a warm day.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Next time,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
it will be a hot day or a hot day.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If you don't believe me,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
try it tonight.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You... You're so unruly!

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What else do you want?

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What do you want?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let go!

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What do you want? Let go of her!

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Didn't you say

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm a jinx?

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
From now on,

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm your jinx.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
As long as I'm here,

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't want to live a good life.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You...

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let go!

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I won't say it again.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't bother you again.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let go of me!

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Listen to me.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
From now on,

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
whoever makes me feel uncomfortable,

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
his good days will come to an end.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I promise

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
you'll regret it.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Stop.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Clean the floor with water.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,960
The

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Aunt,

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
you have to help us.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Liu Ren, this bitch,

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
has no respect for us

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
since he just came to the palace.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
He doesn't care about us

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and you at all.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Aunt,

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
he treats us like this

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
because he's hitting you.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If this continues,

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
you'll be embarrassed.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes.

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm in the herbs bureau.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No one can change the fate.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Isn't Concubine Wan

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
in need of a medicine?

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She's the only one.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Tonight is the day

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
when I'll be the god of the god.

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
When the lights in my room are on,

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
you two can take away

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
everyone in the yard.

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't disturb my good things.

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How's it going?

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's going well.

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Look.

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What's wrong?

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's that?

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Ming Yu, look.

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's a blind light

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
in the room of Eunuch Sun.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Look.

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There's a blind light.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Where did it come from?

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's so strange.

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You ignorant thing.

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You've been trained for a long time.

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're not a good person.

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're not a good person.

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You're not a good person.

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're not a good person.

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're not a good person.

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
When you're trained,

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
the god will naturally lower the blind light.

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Everyone, avoid it.

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:46,580
Be careful of the sudden

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I must see today

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Sun Wei Zi.

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Sun Wei Zi.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Which way are you the god?

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Sun Wei Zi, if you're really a god,

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
you shouldn't be afraid of the dark.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Help me.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Help me.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Help me.

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Help me.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Help me.

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's not a ghost,

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
it's an eunuch.

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes.

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
How come there's an eunuch in our room?

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
How come there's an eunuch?

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's really an eunuch.

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What's going on?

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Good for nothing.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The door is locked.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's locked.

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's locked.

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
How come it's locked?

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's a door.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's a door.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's a door.

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,760
The show is about to begin.

119
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,600
Your Highness, please forgive me.

120
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,400
You daredevil servant!

121
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,600
You ran out of the medicine bureau

122
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,760
in the early morning

123
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,040
to offend Concubine Zhao.

124
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,080
Guards!

125
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,880
Arrest him!

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,880
Yes.

127
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,840
Your Highness, please forgive me.

128
00:05:50,960 --> 00:06:05,020
Pres hot影

129
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,760
Nice to meet you, Concubine Zhao.

130
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,840
I'm flattered, Mr. Wu.

131
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,120
It was you

132
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,880
I'll drag him out and beat him to death.

133
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,800
Wait.

134
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,320
I'm wrong.

135
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,120
I'm afraid the Wu's House

136
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,520
doesn't know what happened to the Herb-tasting Bureau.

137
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,680
It's not too late to see it in the room.

138
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,800
Your Highness.

139
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,640
Chief Wu.

140
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,360
Chief Wu, forgive us.

141
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
Forgive us, Chief Wu.

142
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,240
Please forgive us, Chief Wu!

143
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,000
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,600
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

145
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,680
I'm wrong.

146
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,200
I'm afraid the Wu's House

147
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,920
will never see us again.

148
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,320
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

149
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,800
Tell me,

150
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,560
Why did you two appear in Aunt Sun's room?

151
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
You won't tell me, will you?

152
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,520
I'm sure you know

153
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,240
the 64 sets of torture in the Ten-Year Yamen.

154
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,520
Come on.

155
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,280
Please spare us.

156
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,880
Please spare us.

157
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,360
I'll tell you.

158
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,120
I'll tell you.

159
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,720
I'll tell you first.

160
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,760
Tell me.

161
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,000
Uncle Mu Mu said

162
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,880
we have evil spirits.

163
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,360
We can't save ourselves.

164
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,960
If you want to save yourselves,

165
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,600
just listen to him.

166
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,280
Your Majesty,

167
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,320
we just heard his arrangement

168
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,760
to leave the body in the middle of the night.

169
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,840
Aunt Sun also said that to me.

170
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,200
Eliminate evil spirits?

171
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,480
Yes, Your Highness.

172
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,240
They are black-tongued.

173
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,200
Their bodies have been controlled by evil spirits.

174
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm here to save them.

175
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,960
I have something to report.

176
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,240
Go ahead.

177
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,600
When the maidservant of the Herb-rearing Bureau

178
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,760
were on duty in the middle of the night,

179
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,440
they saw the strange light in Aunt Sun's room.

180
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,600
I suspect that

181
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,760
Aunt Sun has been threatened by evil spirits.

182
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,880
That's why she did such a mischief.

183
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,600
You...

184
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,000
You bitch.

185
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,720
How dare you slander me?

186
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,200
We'll know whether it's slander or not in a moment.

187
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,280
Aunt Sun has a magic trick.

188
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,600
The magic water she made

189
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
can test if there are evil spirits in her body.

190
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,800
Aunt Sun,

191
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,400
if you drink the magic water

192
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,800
without spitting out the black poison,

193
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,440
I'm willing to be punished.

194
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,520
The magic water has been used up.

195
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,680
Really?

196
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,680
I saw

197
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,960
there was a big jar

198
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,360
on your shelf.

199
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,160
Get the magic water.

200
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,760
Yes.

201
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,760
This...

202
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,160
The magic water needs to be used as a magic trick.

203
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,880
We need to ask for the gods' support.

204
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,360
If we don't get the support,

205
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,760
we won't be able to do anything.

206
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,160
You'll know

207
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,640
if you drink it or not.

208
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,360
My Lord.

209
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
Tong An, feed her.

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,400
Yes.

211
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,520
No.

212
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,320
I'll feed her.

213
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,200
I'll feed you blood.

214
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't want to drink it.

215
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,920
I don't want to drink it.

216
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,720
I...

217
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,080
I'll feed her.

218
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,280
No.

219
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,040
No.

220
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,600
Guards,

221
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,800
take the evil spirit girl

222
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,720
away

223
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,440
and pour her boiling water

224
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,560
to make her come to her senses.

225
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,400
Yes.

226
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,480
No, Chief Wu.

227
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,400
I...

228
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,720
I'm not evil.

229
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,160
I just pretended to be a ghost

230
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,400
and deceived them.

231
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,480
Chief Wu,

232
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
I'm a maid of Concubine Sourire.

233
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,160
Please believe me.

234
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,760
You mean

235
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,600
Concubine Sourire is pretending to be a ghost

236
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,840
and deceiving the servants?

237
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,680
No.

238
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,400
No.

239
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,520
It's none of Concubine Sourire's business.

240
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,840
Aunt Sun slandered the consort and harmed the servants.

241
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,200
I'll punish all the servants

242
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,720
who were deceived by Aunt Sun

243
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,000
for the sake of the palace.

244
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,680
Chief Wu,

245
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,840
I was wrong.

246
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,280
I was just playing with money.

247
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,920
I poisoned everyone to cheat the money.

248
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,480
I made everyone spit black water.

249
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,480
Chief Wu,

250
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,680
please let me see Concubine Sourire.

251
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,480
Chief Wu,

252
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
I was wrong. I'll never...

253
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,280
Shut up.

254
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,360
You bitch.

255
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,600
How dare you mess up the palace?

256
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,240
You made the harem so dirty.

257
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,240
How dare you slander Concubine Sourire?

258
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,320
You're not to be punished.

259
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,840
The maid Sun Mei Zi is evil.

260
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,840
Take her away and get her out of here.

261
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,360
Yes.

262
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,080
I dare not.

263
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,080
I dare not, Chief Wu.

264
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,000
Help me.

265
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Those maid and eunuch who helped her

266
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,360
send them to the new stockade

267
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,480
and punish them severely.

268
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:13,920
Yes.

269
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,680
Sir.

270
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,640
Sir.

271
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,320
Please spare us.

272
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,280
Sir.

273
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,440
Sir,

274
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,160
the maid and eunuch are enemies.

275
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,880
How should we punish them?

276
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,320
What did you say?

277
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,040
I'm not a commoner.

278
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,120
I smelled the fragrance of eunuch's sachets

279
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,520
on her body and in the room.

280
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,200
I have a way

281
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,280
to catch her and get her to steal the sword.

282
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,720
What do you want from me?

283
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,400
Sir, you asked me to be the head of the herb bureau

284
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,480
after you killed her.

285
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,680
I'll let you decide the rest.

286
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,880
If you can really get her out of here,

287
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,240
I'll consider your suggestion.

288
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,320
Shi Shi.

289
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,600
Yes, Your Highness.

290
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,200
You'll be the head of the herb bureau.

291
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,040
Yes.

292
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,760
I'll do my best.

293
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,880
Chief Wu doesn't trust me.

294
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,800
Your Highness,

295
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,440
are you satisfied with this?

296
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,560
What's the use of being satisfied?

297
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,600
Chief Wu is worried

298
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,320
if Concubine Wan is satisfied.

299
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,240
It's so hot.

300
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,480
Let's go back to the palace.

301
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,680
Go.

302
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,800
Eunuch Tong An,

303
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,720
I want to talk to you.

304
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,800
I want to see you off.

305
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,480
There are so many people

306
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,200
in the herb bureau.

307
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,160
Miss Ling Yun,

308
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,000
you're the only one

309
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,320
who can see her off.

310
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,360
Go.

311
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,400
Let's go.

312
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,480
Let's take a rest.

313
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,680
Go.

314
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,920
You're a bitch.

315
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,400
I won't let you off even if I'm a ghost.

316
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,720
Aunt Sun,

317
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,440
save your energy.

318
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,400
Let's hug on the way to the imperial palace.

319
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,480
If I die,

320
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
no one will serve Concubine Wan.

321
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,480
She won't let you off.

322
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,880
Do you remember

323
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,240
when we moved out of the palace years ago,

324
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,760
there was a official named Bi Jiang Chen.

325
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,520
One day,

326
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,720
he came to the palace to deliver offerings

327
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,800
to the Imperial Household Department.

328
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,040
But you framed him

329
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,000
and stole the offerings to Concubine Wan.

330
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,040
He died in the Imperial Household Department.

331
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,080
You...

332
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,040
How did you know?

333
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,240
I'm Bi Jiang Chen's daughter.

334
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,000
I see.

335
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,720
So you're here to seek revenge.

336
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,640
Aunt Sun, you're admitting it.

337
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,080
You framed my father.

338
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,960
My father has no grudge against you.

339
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,120
Why did you frame him?

340
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,800
I just followed my fate.

341
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,480
After being ordered by Concubine Wan,

342
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,000
why did Wan Fan frame my father?

343
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,440
I don't know.

344
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,160
I really don't know why.

345
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,920
I'll find out whether you know the truth

346
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,000
or not yourself.

347
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,720
If evil is prosecuted andaining cruel in the end,

348
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,960
it's bubble across the whole surface.

349
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,080
Aunt Sun,

350
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,200
have a nice trip.

351
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,480
and have a good life.

352
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,080
Continue your journey.

353
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,320
Aunt Sun,

354
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,400
you have to walk slowly on the way to the imperial palace.

355
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,440
Because it won't take long.

356
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,600
Those who hurt my father

357
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,320
and slaughtered my father

358
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,160
will all go down there to accompany you.

359
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,720
From now on,

360
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,080
I'd rather step on the golden horse

361
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,560
only to get hurt by the sword.

362
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,920
I want toją jump soaring toward the abyss.

363
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:37,480
I want toization becomeacer
