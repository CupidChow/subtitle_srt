00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,040
Episode 4

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,640
No.

4
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,200
Sister.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,120
Why are you here?

6
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,640
Tie her up.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
What are you doing?

8
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,200
Wen Zhi.

9
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,240
Wen Zhi.

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,240
Help.

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,000
Stop yelling.

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,360
I've sent all the people in your yard.

13
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,160
How dare you plot against me

14
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,640
with that bitch Lin Yun?

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,240
I'll make you suffer

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,200
if you ruin my reputation.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,760
I didn't.

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,520
I didn't.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,640
It was an accident.

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,520
It was Lin Yun.

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,720
She guessed what we were going to do

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,200
and took us to the palace on purpose.

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,720
She took the cat to catch you.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,840
It wasn't me.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,840
It wasn't me.

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,640
Accident?

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,600
Do you think I'll believe your lies?

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,600
You dreamt of His Majesty's favor, right?

29
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,640
You envied my beauty

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,640
and His Majesty's favor.

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,320
Don't forget

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,320
the Zhao family is relying on my favor

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,120
to stand firm in the court.

34
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,400
But you...

35
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,520
You colluded with the outsiders and ruined my reputation.

36
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,240
You're so stupid.

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,480
Stupid!

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,640
Do you think you're a good person?

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,600
You did it for yourself.

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,640
When did you really consider the Zhao family?

41
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,120
You used me to kill people

42
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,600
and helped you get rid of the

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,520
one-time troubles.

44
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,080
I was implicated by you.

45
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
I was sent to the faraway land.

46
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,720
I was so upset.

47
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,520
You're so arrogant.

48
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,740
I think you're the biggest

49
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,400
bastard of the Zhao family.

50
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,480
Give her the medicine.

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,040
Yes.

52
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,080
What do you want to drink?

53
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,600
What do you want to drink?

54
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,480
I don't want to drink.

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,600
I don't want to drink.

56
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,520
I don't want to drink.

57
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,800
I don't want to drink.

58
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,960
I don't want to drink.

59
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,960
I don't want to drink.

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,120
I don't want to drink.

61
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,120
I don't want to drink.

62
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,160
You and I

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,480
are just tools

64
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
sent by the Zhao family to the palace to compete for favor.

65
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,760
Don't take yourself too seriously.

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,520
How does the red flower soup taste?

67
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,760
From now on,

68
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,120
you're a useless person who can't be promoted.

69
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,240
The glory of the Zhao family depends on you.

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,240
I advise you

71
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,120
not to take any wrong steps.

72
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
In the future,

73
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,280
I don't mind

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,240
the whole family of the Zhao family being destroyed.

75
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,120
Zhao Yanwen.

76
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,400
How dare you treat me like this?

77
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,440
I'm going to kill you.

78
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,080
I'm going to kill you.

79
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Give it to me.

80
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,880
I'm done.

81
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
You can't...

82
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,400
Let go.

83
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,240
Prime Minister Fu.

84
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,480
You said that all the maids in Zhongning Palace

85
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,760
were called by the Imperial Household Department to investigate the theft.

86
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,960
Yes, Your Highness.

87
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,920
The Imperial Household Department

88
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,800
has given the maids a share of the Zhongning Palace.

89
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,200
They even accused the evil people

90
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,320
of stealing the maids.

91
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,000
Then, Zhao Lian'er is the only one in Zhongning Palace tonight.

92
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,200
I think so.

93
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,200
Oh, no.

94
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,760
Zhao Lian'er is in danger.

95
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,400
I wanted to get rid of Wan Fei and Zhao Lian'er.

96
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,400
But I didn't expect

97
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,720
to see Wan Fei's bias against her.

98
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,200
She might have killed Zhao Lian'er.

99
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,600
My Lady, it's raining outside.

100
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,760
Where are you going?

101
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,480
Xiaojianzi, open the door.

102
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,400
Yes.

103
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,960
My Lady, I can't open it.

104
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,600
Open the door. Open the door.

105
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,960
Open the door.

106
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,320
Zhao Lian'er.

107
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,680
My Lady.

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,880
Open the door.

109
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,280
I told you that you're not a couple.

110
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,200
My Lady.

111
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,160
She came to save you right away.

112
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,960
My Lady. Open the door.

113
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,720
She's really a close friend.

114
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,440
It's good that

115
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,640
she saw you

116
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,840
as a man or a woman.

117
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,080
This time, she'll be the next one

118
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,600
to clean up your mess.

119
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,240
My Lady.

120
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,840
Let's go.

121
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,840
Your Grace.

122
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,360
How is Zhang Yuanpan?

123
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,640
Your Grace.

124
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,000
Zhao Lian'er has severe internal injury.

125
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,640
She had a red flower

126
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,760
and a swollen abdomen.

127
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,000
She was hit hard.

128
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,160
I'm afraid she won't be able to

129
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,640
get out of it.

130
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,640
Well...

131
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,240
Is there a way to save her?

132
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,480
Please forgive me, Your Grace.

133
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,400
I...

134
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,880
I'm really helpless.

135
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,720
The most important thing now

136
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,040
is to get her internal injury treated.

137
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,680
Your Grace.

138
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,880
I'll go and give Zhao Guiren a prescription.

139
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,520
Thank you, Zhang Yuanpan.

140
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,320
Yanyu.

141
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,240
Are you feeling better?

142
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,840
I heard everything.

143
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,280
I'm really heartbroken.

144
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,560
You've given your sister

145
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,200
such a hard time.

146
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,560
You're not happy

147
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,200
with what I said about Wan Fei?

148
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,360
She's already

149
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,640
in a state of mental illness.

150
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,600
Are you still thinking

151
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,160
about your sister's feelings?

152
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,800
She and I are not sisters.

153
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,520
I, Zhao Lian'er,

154
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,560
am the daughter of the Zhao family.

155
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,600
But Zhao Yanwan

156
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,040
is just a horse of the Yangzhou family.

157
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,480
I'm not worthy

158
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,480
of being a father to Zhao Yanwan.

159
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,440
What did you say?

160
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,200
Wan Fei is not the daughter of the Zhao family.

161
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,480
She's a horse of the Yangzhou family.

162
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,040
Yes.

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But Zhao Yanwan

164
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,880
is just a horse of the lower class.

165
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,480
If she didn't rely on the Zhao family,

166
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,360
how could she become

167
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,680
a concubine of His Majesty?

168
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,160
She dared to deprive me

169
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,840
of my right to be a concubine.

170
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,680
She really put me in a dead end.

171
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,440
I will never let her go.

172
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,680
Even if I have all my relatives,

173
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
I will let her

174
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,240
pay for what I did today.

175
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,400
I didn't expect that one day

176
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,840
I would say these to you.

177
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,320
Forget it.

178
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
The Zhao family owes you this.

179
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,080
If it weren't for Zhao Yanwan,

180
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,760
your parents wouldn't have died.

181
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,120
It seems that you've known my identity.

182
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,720
Yes.

183
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,120
I've checked it.

184
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,160
Your real name is Bi Lan.

185
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,320
Your father's name is Bi Jiangchen.

186
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,400
You entered the palace

187
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,200
to avenge Zhao Yanwan.

188
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,880
Since you know everything,

189
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,000
please tell me

190
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
why you killed

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,600
a good person like my parents.

192
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,000
Where did they offend you?

193
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,000
You want to kill my whole family.

194
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,440
Tell me.

195
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,280
Fine.

196
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,680
I have nothing to fear now.

197
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,200
I'll tell you everything.

198
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,760
When the new emperor ascended the throne,

199
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,520
in order to stabilize the situation in the court,

200
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,840
my father gave me to His Majesty.

201
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,160
But he was half a king and half a tiger.

202
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,720
He was still young and unruly.

203
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,280
So I gave my father a chance

204
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,400
to get Zhao Yanwan out

205
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,080
when he was still young

206
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,080
and replace him as the legitimate daughter of the Zhao family.

207
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,480
So,

208
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,360
Zhao Yanwan became the current concubine.

209
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,160
Look at this.

210
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,720
Your father was a local official.

211
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
He recognized Zhao Yanwan.

212
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,520
Later,

213
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,000
when he entered the palace to deliver the tribute,

214
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,320
he accidentally ran into Zhao Yanwan.

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,720
Zhao Yanwan was afraid that his identity would be exposed,

216
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,320
so he locked your father in the palace.

217
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,000
You stole the tribute

218
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,640
and arranged for the Sun Gugu of the Herb-rearing Bureau

219
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,200
to accuse your father.

220
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,320
Your father was killed by a local official.

221
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,440
To get rid of the regret,

222
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,200
Zhao Yanwan forced my brother to kill your whole family.

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,600
I didn't expect you to escape.

224
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
You're so lucky.

225
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,880
It's all because of this.

226
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,840
It's all because of this

227
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,400
that you destroyed our family.

228
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,280
In the end,

229
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,960
your family's misfortune

230
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,680
has nothing to do with the Zhao family.

231
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,600
The sin that Zhao Yanwan and my brother committed

232
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,000
was a good thing

233
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,560
because the retribution came.

234
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,400
That's why I was so shocked.

235
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,840
That's why I was so shocked.

236
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,640
I shouldn't have let Zhao Yanwan

237
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,320
have such a chance.

238
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,560
You told me the secret of the Zhao family.

239
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,680
Aren't you afraid that I would take it

240
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,040
and report it to His Majesty

241
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
and let your Zhao family be completely exterminated?

242
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,840
Zhao Yanwan said something right.

243
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,120
We are just tools

244
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,320
to strengthen the power of the Zhao family.

245
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,440
We are never seen as humans.

246
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,680
My brother and father

247
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,880
knew that I didn't want to enter the palace,

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,280
but they still sent me in.

249
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,280
They knew that I didn't fit with Zhao Yanwan.

250
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,520
They were always pretending to be a deaf and dumb

251
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,080
to make us happy.

252
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,480
I'm like this now.

253
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,920
Do I have to think for the Zhao family?

254
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,840
The one who has the head and the head of the family

255
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,200
and the one who owes the life of the Bi family,

256
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,320
my brother will make you pay for it.

257
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,160
he he...

258
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,480
Don't worry.

259
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,120
One cup of sugary drink

260
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,200
will authoritarianize your bloodline incarcerated.

261
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,640
Old Lady Li.

262
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,080
I beg you!

263
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,240
My garden is in a trap.

264
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,000
Let me go!

265
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,280
Your fortune was chosen

266
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,880
by Concubine Wan.

267
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,680
You do what 잘리는 첨 예

268
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
to let my father

269
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,800
You're lucky.

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,160
When Consort Wan gets her revenge,

271
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,120
you'll be rewarded.

272
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,000
Aunt Jiang.

273
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,800
Lingzhu,

274
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
use your blood

275
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,880
to bathe me and remove the dirt.

276
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,000
As long as I get my revenge,

277
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,880
you'll be the most capable maid in Chengxi Palace.

278
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,840
I won't treat you badly.
