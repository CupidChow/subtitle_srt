The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Help!

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Brother Wu Zong is ignoring me!

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,000
Others are avoiding me.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,500
How dare you come to me?

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
You...

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Because I know

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,000
that you are a good person.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Since the first time you helped me,

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
I knew you were a good person.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,500
All the things you did

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,500
were to make people afraid of you

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and keep your distance from you.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Because

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,000
you were afraid of being approached by others.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
You were afraid that the person you care about

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
would eventually go away from you.

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,000
Eventually, go away from you?

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sister, let's run together.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll protect you.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Li Guifang,

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll go home.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Sir,

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,000
am I right?

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Nonsense.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thank you, sir.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Remember what we discussed just now.

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Ruyi,

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,000
are you still angry?

32
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,000
What I said to them

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,500
was all fake.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,500
Don't be so petty.

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,500
What petty?

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,500
I heard what you said to others.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Didn't you agree to help others

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,500
poison Han Lingyun?

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Didn't you say

40
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
you wouldn't bully Lingyun anymore?

41
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'll tell Lingyun now.

42
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Ruyi,

43
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
don't be anxious.

44
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
I definitely dare not bully Lingyun.

45
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
What I said to Chengxi Palace

46
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,000
was all fake.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,500
I pretended to be like that.

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
I just hope that the people of Wan Fei

49
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,000
can take care of me.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,500
I will never harm Lingyun.

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Believe me.

52
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,000
I swear to God,

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,500
I will never harm Lingyun.

54
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,000
If I break my promise,

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll be beaten to death.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I won't die easily.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,500
I can't leave the harem for the rest of my life.

58
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll be a servant of the New Treasury forever.

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Nonsense.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Nonsense.

61
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,000
I've been beaten to death by the thunder.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How can I be a servant forever?

63
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,000
Then,

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,500
then you believe me.

65
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,000
The palace bucket is not finished yet.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You, you can help me to brush it.

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Cuiwei,

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I've been doing a lot of work for you recently.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ruyi,

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm not convenient now.

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,500
You just help me.

72
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
When I don't have a sore ass in the future,

73
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll help you to brush it, okay?

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Dad,

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,500
please help me.

76
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
If I can't finish my work today,

77
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
I'll be scolded again.

78
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,000
Please.

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,500
Help me.

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Then,

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,500
you have to keep your promise.

82
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,000
I, I swear.

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You can do your own thing in the future.

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,500
This is the last time.

85
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,000
Why is this here?

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What's going on?

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Why is this here?

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,500
When did this happen?

89
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
I'm scared.

90
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Who is it?

91
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
I saw her before.

92
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,000
How do you know?

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't know.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,500
You know her?

95
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
I don't know.

96
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
I don't know.

97
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
I don't know.

98
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
I don't know.

99
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
I don't know.

100
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
I don't know.

101
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,000
This is so scary.

102
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is so scary.

103
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Ruyi.

104
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Ruyi.

105
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Ruyi.

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Ruyi.

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Ruyi.

108
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Ruyi.

109
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Ruyi.

110
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
This is...

111
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
This is...

112
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
This is so scary.

113
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
This is so scary.

114
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
This is so scary.

115
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,000
Why did we see her?

116
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,500
Who did this?

117
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,500
I didn't see Ruyi last night.

118
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
She was like this when I woke up.

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,500
Consort Wan is here.

120
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Consort Wan.

121
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,000
You went into the New Seed Storage.

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,500
You forgot the most basic etiquette.

123
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Take her down.

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How did Ruyi offend you?

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why did you kill her?

126
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,500
Who dared to question me?

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Shuixi.

128
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,500
Cut her tongue.

129
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Yes.

130
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
The four-star palace maid is a bitch.

131
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
You are playing on the ground of the Shisi Yaman.

132
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Aren't you afraid that the Wu Zongguan will punish you?

133
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
You dare to be so stubborn.

134
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Do it.

135
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll take the responsibility.

136
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
The four-star palace maid is here.

137
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Consort Wan.

138
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
What are you doing?

139
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
This bitch killed Concubine Zhao a few days ago

140
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
and framed me.

141
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
I have to teach her a lesson.

142
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Do it.

143
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Why are you standing there?

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Who dares?

145
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,000
I was there at the Spring Banquet in the He Palace.

146
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
If I remember correctly,

147
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
I was there at the Spring Banquet in the He Palace.

148
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
At that time, His Majesty set up a small palace maid to be alive

149
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:38,300
and punished her in the new

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,500
Consort Jing.

151
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
You saved my life.

152
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
If one day,

153
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
you need me,

154
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
I will come to you

155
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
to repay your life.

156
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
I just passed by here today.

157
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
I happened to meet you here.

158
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
I said a few words of justice.

159
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
The people of the world

160
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
and the lives of everyone in the harem

161
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
are all His Majesty's.

162
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
If you want to thank me,

163
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
you should thank His Majesty to spare you from death.

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Only His Majesty can decide

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
everyone's fate.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Ling Yu,

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
remember Consort Jing's teaching.

168
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Only His Majesty has the right

169
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
to decide anyone's life and death.

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I must find a way to get His Majesty.

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
They said that Ru Yi was a thug

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and broke the rules of the palace.

173
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So they had to throw her away.

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Everything is as usual

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
as the knife-cut cold of March.

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ru Yi was so kind

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
but God made her suffer this.

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What's the point?

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Ru Yi is a good person.

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
She is a good person.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
She is a good person.

182
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
What's the point?

183
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
I'm here to ask you for a favor.

184
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Leave the palace soon.

185
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
No.

186
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
I want to stay.

187
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Didn't you ask

188
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
who I am?

189
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Today I'll tell you

190
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
that I'm Cui Mingfu of Wan Fei.

191
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
He killed my parents.

192
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
I've been through all the hardships

193
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
to get revenge on him.

194
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Now,

195
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
my only friend, Ru Yi,

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
was killed by him.

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
From now on,

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I, Ling Yun,

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
will do everything I can.

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Even if I can't get revenge,

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I must kill Wan Fei

202
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
as soon as possible.

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But she is the Princess Consort.

204
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How can you do that?

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I want to be His Majesty's daughter.

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I want everyone to remember me,

207
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
fear me,

208
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and be obedient to me.

209
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Your Majesty.

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Your Majesty.

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Your Majesty.

212
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Your Majesty.

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Your Majesty.

214
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Your Majesty.

215
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Your Majesty.

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Your Majesty.

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Your Majesty.

218
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Your Majesty.

219
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Your Majesty.

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Your Majesty.

221
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Your Majesty.

222
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Your Majesty.

223
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Your Majesty.

224
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Your Majesty.

225
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Your Majesty.

226
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Your Majesty.

227
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Your Majesty.

228
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Your Majesty.

229
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Your Majesty.

230
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Your Majesty.

231
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Your Majesty.

232
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Your Majesty.

233
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Your Majesty.

234
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Your Majesty.

235
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Your Majesty.

236
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Your Majesty.
