The Legend of Chusen

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Legend of Chusen

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
My Lady,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
why do you look so sad

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
after returning from the Mo's place?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Sister,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
are you going to be a horse-drawn girl today

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
or a horse?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So His Majesty likes that kind of girl.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My Lady,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
what do you think His Majesty likes?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Nothing.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My Lady,

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I think His Majesty cares about you very much.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You can definitely defeat Noble Lady Mo

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and let His Majesty pay you back.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What do you think?

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I've never treated her as my opponent.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What I'm most worried about now

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
is the safety of Official Wu.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I went to pay her back

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
just to let her

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
get rid of Consort Jing's control.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If I want to control Consort Jing,

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I must regain His Majesty's trust.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Noble Lady Mo,

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
it's hard for you to come here every day

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
to greet me.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is what I should do.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Consort Jing,

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I have a question

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and I'd like to ask you to tell me.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Go ahead.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Although His Majesty favors me,

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I feel that His Majesty

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
is thinking about someone else.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I wonder if Consort Jing knows who that person is.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Noble Lady Mo,

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
are you asking

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
if His Majesty cares about Concubine Yun very much?

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Actually,

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
if you want to pour fresh water into the cup,

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
you don't have to empty the water.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't care what kind of water is in the cup.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
As long as it doesn't suit my taste,

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll pour it out.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Noble Lady Mo, rise.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is my first time seeing you

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and I'm here in the imperial study.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
His Majesty has been busy with official affairs.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I came to visit him.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You're worrying too much.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
His Majesty has me to accompany him every night.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will take good care of His Majesty

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and share His Highness's burden.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We, as concubines,

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
must do our best to serve His Majesty.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're not the only one who can replace Noble Lady Mo.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll take my leave.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Your Highness, please forgive me.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I was careless.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Your Highness, please forgive me.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're a careless servant.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You've dirtied Her Highness's clothes

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and made Her Highness not be able to see His Majesty.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's fine.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hurry and thank Concubine Yun for being generous

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and forgive you, a careless servant.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I thank Your Highness for your forgiveness.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Noble Lady Mo,

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I want to make it clear to you.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't want to compete with you.

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You don't need to see me as your enemy.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Your Highness,

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm bearing the expectations of the people of the clan.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're not competing with me.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It doesn't mean I can't compete with you.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Although that's the case,

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
there are many people in the harem

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
who can take the credit.

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
In the end,

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
it's just a game of water and flowers.

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're wrong.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
His Majesty's favor

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
is just a game of water and flowers.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
As long as His Majesty cares about someone,

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
he's the one who's the most important.

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So what I should do

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
is to remove the stones

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
from my path.

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If His Majesty cares about me,

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
he won't fall into the game of water and flowers.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
How dare you!

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You can just think about it.

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't say it out.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I have my own purpose

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
in competing for favor in the harem.

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I once lost the thing

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I cared about the most

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
because of my own favor.

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Today, I advise you

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
not to be too stubborn.

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I just want to make up for my fault

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and not compete with you.

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I understand what you mean.

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
As long as you're telling the truth,

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll be at your service.

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mr. Wu,

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
you're so considerate

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that you're going to be a dog.

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Eunuch,

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
did you hear anything?

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I've been in the palace for so many years.

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What can I do

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
to make him see me?

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Eunuch,

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
what are you talking about?

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm a little confused.

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm just telling you a story.

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't take it seriously.

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't worry, Eunuch.

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We're very strict.

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Have you heard

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that Concubine Shu

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
is back in Longsi?

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes.

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But someone

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
brought back

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the baby-sitting medicine from outside the palace.

132
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Something big is going to happen.

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Last time, Tong An was sold.

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He died a terrible death.

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't know

136
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
which unlucky ghost

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
is going to die this time.

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Eunuch,

139
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
you mean

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
that Mr. Wu is going to

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
take down the Longsi of Concubine Shu?

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Is he going to be a scapegoat?

143
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You're such a jerk.

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I didn't say anything.

145
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you say such a thing,

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll be beheaded.

147
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm leaving.

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Your Highness,

149
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
why are you here?

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm here to tell you

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
not to do those bad things

152
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
for Consort Jing.

153
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There are so many eyes

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
staring at you.

155
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
There is no wall that doesn't have a crack.

156
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If you keep doing this,

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
something will happen.

158
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What are you talking about?

159
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't understand.

160
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Bi Da.

161
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm from Wulin.

162
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Fine.

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Since you call yourself a servant,

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll ask you

165
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
why you chose

166
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
those baby-sitting medicine to enter the palace

167
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and

168
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
how Tong An died.

169
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's not a powder.

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Why did you become like this?

171
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Did you become like this

172
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
because of me?

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm asking you.

174
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I chose the path.

175
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll walk on my own.

176
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't bother me.

177
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't do this.

179
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay?

180
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Your Highness, you're being too serious.

181
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Bi Da.

182
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't want it anymore.

184
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't want anything anymore.

185
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I only want you

186
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
to be like before, okay?

187
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Can I've another wife?

194
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Listen to me.

195
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,000
If any unborn child

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
in this palace

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
lost her mind,

198
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
you'll really

199
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
lose yourental health.

200
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So what?

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Don't mind it.

202
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And

203
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
don't try to come here again.

204
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,400
You're not welcome here.

205
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,480
Why do you have to do this?

206
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,720
Please go back, Your Highness.

207
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:53,660
Trial of

208
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,640
you don't believe me?

209
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,760
My lady,

210
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,040
how can I help you?

211
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,720
husband.

212
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:20,280
The

213
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,040
supply is limited.

214
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,240
We can't drink it all by ourselves.

215
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll drink it all by myself then.

216
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,200
Please take care of this, my lady.

217
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,080
Thank you, my lady.

218
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,080
If I find something?

219
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,640
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

220
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,440
Go and spend some money

221
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,840
and find someone who can trust you

222
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,960
in the Shuping Palace.

223
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,520
I want to exchange the spices

224
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
she often uses for this.

225
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,840
Your Highness,

226
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,840
now that Her Highness Shuping is pregnant,

227
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,680
if anything goes wrong,

228
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,320
we will be too sorry.

229
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,000
Don't worry.

230
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,640
I will take care of it.

231
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,640
I won't let you be implicated.

232
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,960
Don't worry, Your Highness.

233
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,600
I will do as you say.

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,720
Your Highness.

235
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,200
Your Highness.

236
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,520
Your Highness.

237
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,920
How dare you!

238
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,200
How dare you

239
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,040
touch the incense stove of Shuping!

240
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,080
I'm not as rich as you.

241
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,320
Why would you poison my incense stove?

242
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,240
Your Highness, I know my mistake.

243
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,960
It's Eunuch Jian from Yongxiu Palace.

244
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
He instructed me

245
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,360
to exchange the spices in your stove.

246
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,280
Yongxiu Palace?

247
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,800
It's really Concubine Yun who killed Shuping.

248
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,800
I'm going to meet His Majesty.

249
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,880
I'm going to meet His Majesty.

250
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,880
I'm going to meet His Majesty.

251
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,720
Greetings, Your Majesty.

252
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

253
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,000
Concubine Yun,

254
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,680
the maid in Shuping Palace was poisoned and was arrested.

255
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,160
The maid said

256
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,960
she was instructed by you to kill the royal heir.

257
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,440
How do you explain that?

258
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,960
Concubine Yun came to confront you in person.

259
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,560
You should have made it clear.

260
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,080
I'm innocent because of Eunuch Jian.

261
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,160
Even if I was killed by a bear,

262
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,040
I wouldn't dare to kill the royal heir.

263
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,760
I was instructed by Eunuch Jian.

264
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,440
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

265
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,440
I was also

266
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,880
instructed by someone

267
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
to arrange the maid

268
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
to exchange the spices in Shuping's incense stove.

269
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,440
Who instructed you?
