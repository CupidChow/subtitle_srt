00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,400
Consort Jing has arrived.

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,280
Consort Jing,

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,840
what do you mean?

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,720
Your Majesty,

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,360
I want to tell Ling Yun

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,960
to use someone else's identity to enter the palace

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,000
and plot against the evil.

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,080
Use someone else's identity?

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,960
Yes.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,640
Ling Yun is a fake name.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,520
Her real identity

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,600
is the former princess.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,480
The former princess?

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,440
Wulin Talisman.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,560
This is...

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,840
This is the pattern

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,440
used by the former emperor.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,280
Look.

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,800
Have you seen this person?

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,360
How is it?

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Do you recognize him?

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,760
No.

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,160
It's not you.

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,680
No?

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,200
How is it not you?

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,560
This lady

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,200
is indeed not a maid of our Bi family.

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,400
Wulin Talisman,

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,280
you said the former princess

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,920
was hiding in the harem.

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,880
Since Ling Yun is not you,

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,240
who is?

35
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,320
Bi An.

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,520
It's you.

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,840
You are...

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,040
You are...

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,800
Your Majesty,

40
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,720
she is...

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,000
She is...

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,920
Make it clear.

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,040
Your Majesty,

44
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,880
she is the same as the adopted daughter

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,200
of our family.

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,040
You are lying.

47
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,440
I dare not lie.

48
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,000
She is really the former princess.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
How dare you,

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,520
slander me.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,240
Do you know it's a death sentence?

52
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,040
Your Majesty,

53
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,120
I dare not deceive you.

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,720
This lady is the adopted daughter.

55
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,720
It's true.

56
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,760
You are a slanderer.

57
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,880
You are lying.

58
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,360
Enough.

59
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,960
Lady Mu,

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,240
do you really think I don't know anything?

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
I sent someone to secretly check your background.

62
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,960
I didn't turn my back on you.

63
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,280
I just want to see

64
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,200
how long you will play the role.

65
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,440
Come on.

66
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Take Lady Mu down.

67
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
You have suspected me for a long time.

68
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,400
I even tried my best

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,200
to play the playboy.

70
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,040
I should have killed you long ago.

71
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,520
I never thought

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
the people who accompanied me in the examination room

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,480
wanted to kill me every day.

74
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,440
You are a pervert.

75
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,520
You don't deserve to be the princess of our family.

76
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,200
I just hate that I can't give birth to a big baby

77
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,560
and cause you to bleed.

78
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,160
Take her

79
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,800
and put her in the prison.

80
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,480
Your Majesty,

81
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,040
Consort Jing

82
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,120
said I was a slanderer.

83
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,720
But now that Lady Mu has been exposed,

84
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,280
I have a few questions

85
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,360
for Consort Jing.

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,800
What else do you want to ask?

87
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,240
Consort Jing

88
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,720
used a dagger

89
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,160
to stab me.

90
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,200
I want to ask you

91
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,520
where did you get the dagger from?

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,520
The case of the B family's death

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
had nothing to do with you.

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,840
I have never been to Qiongzhou.

95
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,760
Your Majesty,

96
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,680
don't slander me.

97
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,640
Even if the case of the death of the family

98
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,720
wasn't your doing,

99
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,720
you knew

100
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,680
that Consort Wan was a concubine of Yangzhou.

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,720
You used her indenture

102
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,960
to threaten her

103
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,240
so that she could give you the dagger.

104
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,520
You used your power

105
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,040
to see Consort Wan's death

106
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,760
to get the dagger

107
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,720
so that she could not threaten you.

108
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,080
You used your power to deceive her

109
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,360
and make Her Majesty feel threatened.

110
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,680
What else can you say?

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,120
Nonsense.

112
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,280
Your Majesty,

113
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,880
she was lying.

114
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,360
Your Majesty,

115
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,760
I have been in the palace for a long time.

116
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,920
I have been defending myself

117
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,640
to protect myself.

118
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,880
I can only investigate

119
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,080
why I am the one

120
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,400
who is the target.

121
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,480
If you don't believe me,

122
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,760
you can send someone to investigate.

123
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,000
I am telling the truth.

124
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,160
Go and investigate.

125
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,120
Yes.

126
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,200
Your Majesty.

127
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,600
You don't need to make any more excuses.

128
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,280
I have already abolished your post.

129
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
I won't do anything to you.

130
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,840
But I don't want to see you again.

131
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,880
Go back to your Jinhe Palace

132
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,920
and reflect on your mistakes.

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,440
Yes.

134
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,920
Your Majesty is quite naive.

135
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,800
It's all set.

136
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,440
Your Majesty has been veryOUGHOVER

137
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,400
and Hessen has fulfilled your Xu lecture

138
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
but he hasn't come to 박金海

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,920
to see Your Majesty.

140
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,040
But since Li Shisan has come to see Li Shisan now

141
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,160
it can be said best

142
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,480
that Mingciang was repented

143
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,280
so he couldn't let her to continue

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,720
and tell ChengING

145
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,480
about how passing past

146
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,840
should be.

147
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,120
If His Majesty

148
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,760
keeps doing these things

149
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,800
he will Germans

150
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm your wife.

151
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,600
Are you here to show off?

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,680
We're not married.

153
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,680
Why should I show off?

154
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,840
You've already won the heart of the Wu Lin family.

155
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,680
Aren't you satisfied?

156
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
Is it worth it to kill each other

157
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,560
for a man's heart?

158
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,720
Of course it's worth it.

159
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,080
I watched the Wu Lin family grow up.

160
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,240
We knew each other best.

161
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,360
Then we entered the palace together.

162
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,040
I thought we'd become

163
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,400
close friends in the palace.

164
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,760
But I didn't expect

165
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,440
he would be afraid of my identity

166
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,520
and be against me.

167
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,360
He's protecting you.

168
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes.

169
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,680
He's been protecting me in silence.

170
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,000
But since you came,

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,840
everything has changed.

172
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,000
He's been putting all his heart

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,280
on you.

174
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,280
He no longer cares about me.

175
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,320
You know

176
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
we're sisters.

177
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,480
But he's not your brother.

178
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,920
I've never seen him

179
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,360
look at you.

180
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,360
Never.

181
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,880
So you've been targeting me

182
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,720
and killing me.

183
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,760
How could he come back to me

184
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,640
if he didn't kill you?

185
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,000
He's a stubborn man.

186
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,000
You didn't only lose him,

187
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,600
but also lost everything.

188
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,600
Now you're in this situation.

189
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,720
Don't you regret it?

190
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,560
Of course I do.

191
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,680
But we can't go back.

192
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,160
Lingyu,

193
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,880
you're his sister.

194
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,640
You know him best, right?

195
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,840
Tell me.

196
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,120
What should I do?

197
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,840
What should I do

198
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,080
to make him come back to me?

199
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,960
Tell me.

200
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,920
For a wrong person,

201
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,760
you've sacrificed your dignity,

202
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,960
your morality,

203
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,640
and even your life.

204
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,240
It's not worth it.

205
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,400
Jingfei,

206
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,880
think about it.

207
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,320
Don't lie to yourself again.

208
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,800
Why are you here?

209
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,280
I was wrong about you.

210
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,320
I wanted to apologize to you.

211
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
I mean,

212
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,960
it's late at night.

213
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,440
I'll go there

214
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,640
if you tell anyone.

215
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,080
Don't worry.

216
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,800
His Majesty has set me free

217
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,000
and I can go in and out freely.

218
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,880
What's wrong with Lady Mu?

219
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,560
Nothing.

220
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,760
Lady Mu is indeed a former official.

221
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,440
She was caught for her identity.

222
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,920
What else could be wrong with that?

223
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,960
What's wrong with that?

224
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,440
She's a former official's son.

225
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,880
She's not a princess

226
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,520
of the previous dynasty.

227
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,040
Right?

228
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,560
How do you know that?

229
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,160
I'm not a fool.

230
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,120
Everything went well.

231
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,600
I know

232
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,920
how my uncle is.

233
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,160
He's timid.

234
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,080
How could he be so bold

235
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,040
to make false evidence in front of His Majesty?

236
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
You arranged all of this

237
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,320
behind his back,

238
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,160
didn't you?

239
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,560
That's the best solution.

240
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,480
Isn't it?

241
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,600
Don't worry about it anymore.

242
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,320
You can save yourself forever.

243
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,040
Is that princess

244
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,520
me?

245
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,280
You knew it.

246
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,480
But now

247
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,440
your identity is out of danger.

248
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,240
No one

249
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,920
can prove your identity.

250
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,480
Everything is settled.

251
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,360
Find a chance

252
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,160
to get out of the palace.

253
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,240
I can't

254
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,720
do anything.

255
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,240
I have a lot to do.

256
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,600
Are you going to fight for

257
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,840
His Majesty's favor like other concubines?

258
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,360
Lady Mu and I

259
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,720
had a fight.

260
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,360
But we never got drunk.

261
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,680
Now

262
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,200
she's trying to help me

263
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,560
to get back at me.

264
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,520
I can't enjoy

265
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,880
the safety she gave me

266
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,200
with my life.

267
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,800
She's in trouble.

268
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
I can't do anything

269
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,040
to save her.

270
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
I have to save her.

271
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,560
If someone has to get out of the palace,

272
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,760
it should be Lady Mu

273
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,200
instead of me.

274
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,840
Do you think

275
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,840
I'm not as important as Lady Mu?

276
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,960
Are you

277
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,520
jealous of Lady Mu?

278
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,200
No.

279
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Lady Mu

280
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,320
is a loyal official.

281
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,920
She also knew

282
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,600
you were their princess.

283
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,800
She was in danger.

284
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,760
So she came to

285
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
make up for you.

286
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,680
She didn't ask you to do anything for her.

287
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,280
So

288
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,800
you don't have to take the risk.

289
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,680
She told me

290
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,280
she had everything she wanted.

291
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,000
What did she want?
