1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Untamed

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Who instructed you?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In front of His Majesty,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
you still want to hide it for others?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Is it enough to live?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That day,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Concubine Yun gave me a pack of spices

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and a piece of silver

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to exchange for the spices

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that Concubine Shu uses every day.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I know that

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
murdering the royal heirs

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
is a crime committed by the Zhuqiu clan.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So I told Concubine Shu

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
about this beforehand.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Concubine Shu can testify for me.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I have no intention of murdering the royal heirs.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I didn't lie.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If it weren't for her,

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I would have been shot by Concubine Yun.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Your Majesty,

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I just heard that

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
someone wanted to add

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the incense powder in Concubine Shu's incense.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I ordered someone to add it

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
to the incense powder

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
to make Concubine Shu's pregnancy.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I ordered Xiaojian to add the incense powder

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to Wen Bu's incense.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It won't hurt the child in her womb.

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Someone?

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Who is this person?

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There are many people in the palace.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I just heard it.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't know the identity of that person.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You don't know?

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You don't want to say it?

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Or do you mean

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that person is already you?

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Your Majesty,

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't dare to murder the royal heirs.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I think

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Concubine Yun is not

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
a very hot person.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
As long as we test

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
the incense powder that Concubine Yun sent,

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
we can prove

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
if Concubine Yun is telling the truth.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Choose Zhao Yuanpan.

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes.

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Zhao Yuanpan,

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
this incense powder is safe.

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Your Majesty,

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
this incense powder doesn't contain any poison.

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But the incense powder

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
contains the incense of the stone.

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The pregnant person

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
must be kept away from it.

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What else do you have to say?

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Your Majesty,

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I didn't murder the royal heirs.

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This incense powder

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
must have been switched.

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This incense powder

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
must have been switched.

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll give you two choices.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
One,

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
tell me who you are talking about

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
who wants to frame Concubine Yun.

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Two,

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
you take all the blame.

74
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I will kill the royal heirs

75
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and punish you.

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Your Majesty,

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I didn't murder the royal heirs.

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I believe

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Your Majesty will clear my name.

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't dare to make any decision.

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm willing to accept it.

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Pass the imperial decree.

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Concubine Yun murdered the royal heirs

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and caused chaos in the palace.

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
She is to be named as the Crown Princess.

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
She will be promoted to the Yongxiu Palace

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
as the official's daughter.

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sincere to Your Majesty.

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I have no regrets.

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Please

91
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
accept the decree.

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
My Lady,

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
everything is normal in the harem.

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You still have to live.

95
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You don't have to be too sad.

96
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You can take good care of yourself

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
here in the future.

98
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Where are Fu Xiang and the others?

99
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The people who served you before

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
have been sent to the Office of Penance.

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
They didn't do anything wrong.

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How can they punish them?

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I took the responsibility for my Lady.

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's a matter of the heaven and the earth.

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You should worry about

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
your own situation.

107
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Help!

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There's a rat!

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What are you doing here?

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't know.

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The people of the Yongxiu Palace

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
have been dismissed.

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Aunt Jiang,

114
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
why are you here?

115
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm here to serve you.

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Serve you?

117
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
There's no blanket on the bed.

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There's a rat in the room.

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There's no water in the pot.

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm thirsty.

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm thirsty.

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm thirsty.

123
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm thirsty.

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm thirsty.

125
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm thirsty.

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm thirsty.

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm thirsty.

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm thirsty.

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You still think you're the Lady?

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If you want to drink water,

131
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
go to the well and drink it yourself.

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're just a

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
concubine who has been dismissed.

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Stop doing things here.

135
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Get out.

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Chief.

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Chief.

138
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Chief.

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Chief.

140
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
His Majesty is still angry.

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You'd better not

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
mention Lady Yun.

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I know what I'm doing.

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I know what I'm doing.

145
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Greetings, Consort Jing.

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
His Majesty is writing a memorial.

147
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't bother him.

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I've prepared a tea for His Majesty.

149
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Please don't punish me.

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Can't you understand

151
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
what I'm saying?

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What do you mean?

153
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're going to go beyond my control

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and I'll be more happy to get rid of you.

155
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Are you going to do it yourself

156
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
or should I help you?

157
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Your Highness saved my life.

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You can take it away

159
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
whenever you want.

160
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You only use these words

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
to deceive me.

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But I can't see

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
your sincerity to me.

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm a loyal servant to you.

165
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm willing to open my heart

166
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and show you.

167
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Please

168
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
ask for my love for Ling Yun.

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
She went to get the incense

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
in order to stop me.

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You know

172
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the more you care about her,

173
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
the more I can't

174
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
do as you wish.

175
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Go tell His Majesty

176
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
that Yunpi is innocent.

177
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Are you threatening me?

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I care about you so much.

179
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
How dare you threaten me for her?

180
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Your Highness is the Imperial Concubine of the harem.

181
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Please be kind to yourself.

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What a pity, Wu Linfu.

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This dagger can't kill me.

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It can't kill me.

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Look at it carefully.

186
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This...

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is the ex-emperor's dagger?

188
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes.

189
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
If you hurt me with this dagger,

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
it will become a weapon

191
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and be used by everyone.

192
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Then everyone will know

193
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
that Ling Yun is the princess of the previous dynasty.

194
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
How did you know that?

195
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Where did you get this dagger?

196
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
After your family was destroyed,

197
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I sent someone to search your family's ancestral house.

198
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Wu Linfu,

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
what are you doing?

200
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sorry for offending you.

201
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I apologize to you for this.

202
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Please let Ling Yun go.

203
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You can't tell anyone about her true identity.

204
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Wu Linfu, don't do anything stupid.

205
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Just listen to me.

206
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I promise you to let her go.

207
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

208
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Your Highness.

209
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Chief Steward Wu.

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Get up.

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Lady Ling was cornered by His Majesty.

212
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Without the imperial decree,

213
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I dare not let anyone in.

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Please excuse me.

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I just want to say a few words.

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I dare not.

217
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I really dare not.

218
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Your Highness.

220
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Do you want to break the law?

221
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Leave here.

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes.

223
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

224
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Get up.

225
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes.

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I didn't expect you to be so quiet.

227
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm leaving.

228
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't want to know

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
how you got to this state.

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You mean

231
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Concubine Yun asked you to change the spice in the box?

232
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I dare not harm the royal family.

233
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So I'm here to ask for help.

234
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Please save me.

235
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Please save me.

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm in danger.

237
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If you want to live,

238
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
listen to me.

239
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This is not a murder.

240
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm willing to do anything.

241
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Then tell the imperial court

242
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
about this in advance.

243
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes.

244
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Ling Yun said

245
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
someone wanted to kill Concubine Yun.

246
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He just wanted to save her.

247
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But he never told us

248
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
who the victim was.

249
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You changed the spice

250
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
that Ling Yun gave her.

251
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,920
I don't know

252
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,160
if the incense stove

253
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,560
already has incense

254
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,120
or Ling Yu ordered someone to send it.

255
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,040
I don't know

256
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,720
if it's true or not.

257
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,840
You're despicable.

258
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,880
I'm despicable?

259
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,360
What about you, Mr. Wu?

260
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,160
How do you know

261
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,800
that Ling Yu was wronged?

262
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,160
I believe that

263
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,240
the truth is not fair.

264
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,120
If you're framed,

265
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,000
you'll be cleared one day.

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,080
I'm here to ask Ling Yu.

267
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,240
His Majesty wants him to tell the truth.

268
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,600
Who is the person

269
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
that Ling Yu chose to keep it a secret?

270
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,280
Should I

271
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,240
give him some tricks?

272
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,160
Please forgive me.

273
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,400
Don't make it hard for Ling Yu.

274
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,920
Please spare his life.

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,080
I said I didn't want his life,

276
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,760
but I don't care

277
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,000
if someone else wants his life.

278
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
The one we sent to Jiang's Valley

279
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,520
hasn't made any big moves yet.

280
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,400
Do you need me to add more fire?

281
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,080
Don't worry.

282
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,720
We don't need to do it ourselves.

283
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,160
This Jiang's Valley has served

284
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,560
Concubine Wan for many years.

285
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,800
She'll figure out a way to kill Ling Yu sooner or later.

286
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,080
You're so smart.

287
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,440
Go tell Eunuch Jiang

288
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,480
to give him more time to think about it.

289
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,600
Yes.
