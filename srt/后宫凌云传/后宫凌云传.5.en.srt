00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Episode 11

2
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,080
Sir.

3
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,360
Don't be so rude.

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,520
You're just a maid.

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,960
How dare you use me again and again?

6
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,320
Your Grace,

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,320
don't be so mean.

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,560
I have no choice.

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,480
Jin Yu wanted to harm me,

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,320
so I took the opportunity.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,680
Your Grace,

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,120
you're so kind and impartial.

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,200
You can't do anything to me.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,520
I'm just a maid.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,960
I can't just

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,280
let Jin Yu be a maid.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,640
You tried to trick me.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,240
But you explained it so well.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,160
Don't worry.

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,120
I gave all the poison medicine to Her Grace.

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,600
The one for you

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,800
was just a little bit of poison.

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,200
How could I really harm you?

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,880
Who do you think you are?

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,080
Your Grace,

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,280
you helped me so many times.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
I'm your friend.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,680
Friend?

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,720
You're a match for me.

30
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,920
Is this

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,720
your way of showing your affection?

32
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,200
I...

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,280
I just want to see how thick your skin is.

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,240
If you were bitten by Chong Yi today,

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,400
you might have died long ago.

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,200
Do you know that?

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,400
No.

38
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,200
I knew the imperial physician would use this method.

39
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,880
So I didn't touch those medicine bags at all.

40
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,080
There are so many

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,080
fireflies in the harem.

42
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,520
If we don't wake up on time,

43
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,160
we'll be in trouble at the next moment.

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,240
I really don't know

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,680
whether I should praise you for being smart

46
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,200
or scold you for being stupid.

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,400
You didn't receive the magical fish before.

48
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Do you regret it now?

49
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,840
Your Grace.

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,400
Your Grace.

51
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,840
Your Grace.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,360
I...

53
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,400
I deserve to die.

54
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,040
I deserve to die.

55
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,640
I deserve to die.

56
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,440
Your Grace.

57
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,760
I just want to cure Ling Yu.

58
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,440
I touched his hand and foot

59
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,600
in his magic potion bag.

60
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,760
But I didn't expect

61
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,880
he would be so bold

62
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,400
to use the poison to poison you.

63
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,760
Even if it proves that

64
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,960
what you said is true,

65
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
he can also pretend

66
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,000
that he was careless

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,880
and pretended to be the wrong medicine.

68
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,720
Besides, the Imperial Hospital

69
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,560
has a record of you taking the poison.

70
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,640
You're so stupid.

71
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,320
I know my mistake.

72
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,840
Please punish me.

73
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,640
Your Grace, please be careful.

74
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,360
Don't be angry with me.

75
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,800
Your Grace.

76
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,360
I'm back with the medicine.

77
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,400
Give it to him.

78
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,760
I didn't expect

79
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,360
that you would be so kind.

80
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,040
Ling Yu.

81
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,760
Do you know what I hate the most?

82
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
I don't know.

83
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,040
I hate people who are

84
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,520
so insolent.

85
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,360
I don't care who you used to be.

86
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,200
But now you're in Chengxi Palace.

87
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,640
You're only my master.

88
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,880
You should use my interests first.

89
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,000
Do you understand?

90
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,880
I understand.

91
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,440
I'll obey your instruction.

92
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,640
You may leave.

93
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,840
I'll leave now.

94
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,840
Your Grace.

95
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,880
Why are you still wronged?

96
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,560
Your Grace.

97
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,760
I'm your master.

98
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,760
But I fell for

99
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,080
that bitch's trick.

100
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,880
Please forgive me.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,600
Do you think Ling Yu

102
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,160
is the pawn

103
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,080
sent by Wulin Prefecture?

104
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,200
I'd like to see

105
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,960
what tricks he can play.

106
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,860
The Abbot of Municipal Hall

107
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,860
Episode 0.

108
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,960
Your Grace.

109
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,760
This is

110
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,760
frozenONIN JUICE

111
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,280
that I Rails for you.

112
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,280
Yes.

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,080
I see you have something to say.

114
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,600
Tell me what you want to say.

115
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,200
Master,

116
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,160
I have been confused about something.

117
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,640
The maid named Ling Yun

118
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,000
always treats you like a devil.

119
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,400
Why are you protecting her?

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,800
What are you doing?

121
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,240
What are you doing here?

122
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,000
It's that girl.

123
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,440
Go on.

124
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:19,960
You.

125
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,440
Out of my face.

126
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,200
Fengtian,

127
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,280
don't.

128
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,400
Where are you going?

129
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,000
How dare you?

130
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,880
You...

131
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,480
What's that sound?

132
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,080
Jingjing, let's run together.

133
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,280
Li Guifang, I'll protect you.

134
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,120
I'll go with you.

135
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,240
Jingjing.

136
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,240
Jingjing.

137
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,160
Tong An,

138
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,840
have you ever been protected?

139
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,920
I've been bullied since I was a child.

140
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,240
Until I met my master,

141
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
I was protected by him.

142
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,600
That's how I experienced the feeling of being respected.

143
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,080
If you're a little bit of a protection,

144
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,240
you'll be a little bit of a protection.

145
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,960
I'm not a little bit of a protection.

146
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,040
I'm a little bit of a protection.

147
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,080
It's a good nature of a person.

148
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,960
When you have the ability to protect others one day,

149
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
you'll know.

150
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,720
A'hu.

151
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,480
Tonight is the emperor's banquet.

152
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,600
Get up and do your job.

153
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,400
Don't think about anything else.

154
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,160
Yes.

155
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,600
You go with me to serve Her Highness.

156
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,320
Yes.

157
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,320
Lianyuan,

158
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,160
go and pack up the things inside.

159
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,600
Yes.

160
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,360
Yes.

161
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,440
How thicker it is.

162
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Where is the maid who picked flowers for Her Highness?

163
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
Why hasn't she come back yet?

164
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,200
Sister Jinyu,

165
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,760
His Majesty set up a banquet at Fengxian Hall tonight

166
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,640
to talk with the lords outside the palace.

167
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,080
Those girls always want to get on the high branch.

168
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,160
I guess they are deliberately

169
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
struggling in the Imperial Garden

170
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
to find an opportunity to seduce some adults.

171
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,960
Lingyun.

172
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,520
Sister Jinyu,

173
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,120
what do you want from me?

174
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,600
Go to the Imperial Garden and call them back.

175
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,200
Don't let these scoundrels

176
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
lose our power.

177
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,480
Tell them

178
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,000
to stop talking about Chengxi Palace.

179
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,200
Yes.

180
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,600
Don't tell anyone

181
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,080
about what happened just now.

182
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,880
Don't tell anyone.

183
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Sister, don't worry.

184
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm a very strict person.

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,120
I won't talk about it.

186
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,600
Lingyun,

187
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,560
the one who set the fire in the Imperial Garden

188
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
was the one who asked for the incense and medicine.

189
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,840
You were in front of those adults

190
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,400
in the Imperial Garden

191
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,880
and made a fool of yourself and lost Chengxi Palace.

192
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,960
