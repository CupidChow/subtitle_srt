00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Bi Da.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Why are you here?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let me check if you're still alive.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I know you're still angry.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm willing to do anything

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to make you happy.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Someone sent you medicine today.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What's wrong with you?

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm fine.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Why are you asking this?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Jingfei asked you to investigate me.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Since you're fine,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll leave first.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Bi Da.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm afraid I'll help Jingfei again.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
All these years,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
he just treats you

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
as a puppet

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
who can make you feel at ease.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He's already

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
treating you like a friend.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If this goes on,

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
you'll be ruined by him.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Do you know that?

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Are you done?

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
He's convinced you

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
that there's no end

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
to treating you as a Taoist.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The sins you have

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
will only increase.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Lingyun.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What's your identity now?

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why are you

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
telling me this?

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You used to be

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
the emperor's woman.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You could have ordered me

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
as the master.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But now,

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
you're nothing.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Why should I listen to you?

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They'll cheat you,

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
use you, and manipulate you.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not your sister.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't want you to...

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Enough.

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What sister?

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
In the past,

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I could be your knife.

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now,

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
why can't I

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
be Consort Jing's knife?

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Is this really what the Wulin family said?

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I dare not lie to you.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is more like it.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
All right.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You may go and receive your reward.

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Your Highness.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Wulin Mansion

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
requests to see Consort Jing.

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Come in.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Greetings, Consort Jing.

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Get up.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Your Highness,

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
the medicine

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
was indeed sent by Lady Mu.

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Lingyun is fine.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
She's fine.

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Go and clean Lady Mu up.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Your Highness,

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Lady Mu is now

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the rightful owner of the throne.

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If she does it too obviously,

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm afraid she'll ruin

79
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
the good deeds of Her Highness.

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I really don't understand.

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
She's working so hard

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
to win His Majesty's heart.

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What exactly does she want?

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
In this palace,

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
no woman

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
doesn't want to win His Majesty's heart.

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's different.

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Consort Wan and Zhao Ling'er

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
are for the Zhao family.

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Lingyun is for revenge.

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But Lady Mu

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
does some

93
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
strange tricks every day.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
She's not ashamed of it.

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What on earth is she trying to do?

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't know.

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm tired.

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You may leave.

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Your Highness,

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
should we summon the imperial physician?

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No need.

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's a heart disease.

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Your Highness,

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
are you still worried about Lady Mu?

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Lady Mu and Lingyun

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
will both die.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What are you trying to do?

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Get up and eat.

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Your Highness.

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's a half-life's life.

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can't eat it.

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll just endure it.

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How can I eat

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
a whole life's life?

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm only responsible for feeding you.

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I didn't cook this meal.

118
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You should think of a way to cook it.

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Chief Steward Wu,

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I need to talk to you.

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What's up, Degui?

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Your Excellency,

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I know you've been living a hard life.

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So I need to talk to you.

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Tong An and I have been going to the palace together since we were kids.

126
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We are best friends.

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sadder

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
when Tong An is gone.

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But I know

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
he wasn't killed by you.

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He wanted to protect you.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He committed suicide after that.

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Before he died,

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
he told me

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
to guard you for him.

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If you need help one day,

137
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm willing to fight for you

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
to protect Tong An.

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Degui,

140
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
we can't let him die.

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There's something

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I've been planning for a long time.

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I need you to help me secretly

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and bring someone

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
to the palace to meet me.

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Degui.

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm here.

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll be waiting for you.

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Degui.

150
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Degui.

151
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Degui.

152
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Degui.

153
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Degui.

154
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Degui.

155
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Degui.

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Degui.

157
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Degui.

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Degui.

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Degui.

160
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You're in such a state.

161
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm fine.

162
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
How's Chief Steward Wu?

163
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
His Excellency is helping Consort Jing

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
deal with Lady Mu.

165
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If he doesn't do as he says,

166
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Consort Jing will torture him.

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You mean

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Consort Jing tortures Chief Steward Wu?

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes.

170
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Otherwise, she would torture you.

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
My mouth.

172
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm really...

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm talking too much.

174
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So,

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
he's still helping me.

176
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He never lied to me.

177
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
How are Lady Mu and His Majesty?

178
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't know.

179
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
His Majesty sent someone

180
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
to check Lady Mu's background.

181
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He said that Lady Mu's hometown

182
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is not Shihe.

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's related to

184
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
the Mu Mansion in the southwest.

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I only know that.

186
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Mu Mansion in the southwest?

187
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's right.

188
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I heard that

189
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Lady Mu plays the piano.

190
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The piano?

191
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
More importantly,

192
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
in some places in the southwest,

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
married women

194
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
hang a gold key

195
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
on the waist.

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Lady Mu

197
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
is from Mu Mansion in the southwest.

198
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Is Mu Mansion

199
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
a loyal follower

200
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
of the previous dynasty?

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Is Lady Mu

202
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
entering the palace

203
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
to assassinate His Majesty?

204
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Chief Wu,

205
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I brought the person

206
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
you asked me to find.

207
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Greetings, Chief.

208
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You're Bi An?

209
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes.

210
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're the Chief of the Fourteenth Office.

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why don't you kneel down?

212
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Do you want to be beheaded?

213
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Greetings, Chief.

214
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're Bi Jia's relative

215
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and an elder.

216
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You don't need to be so polite.

217
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He's just

218
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
trying to tell you

219
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
that the palace is no better than the outside.

220
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You need to know

221
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
what you should say

222
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and what you shouldn't.

223
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What you should do

224
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and what you shouldn't do.

225
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Bi Jia's relative?

226
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You're...

227
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm Bi Jia's relative.

228
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm Bi Jia's relative.

229
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm Bi Jia's relative.

230
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You're...

231
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm Bi Jia's relative.

232
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

233
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What's the matter?

234
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I've been finding

235
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
that someone is strange lately.

236
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So I detained him

237
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and then

238
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
during the interrogation,

239
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I found that there's a secret behind him.

240
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I dare not deal with it.

241
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'd like to ask Your Majesty to decide it for me.

242
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Bring him in.

243
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Since Your Majesty has something important

244
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
to discuss with Chief Wu,

245
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll take my leave.

246
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Wait, My Lady.

247
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
During the interrogation,

248
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I found that he had something to do

249
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
with Lady Mu.

250
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I think you should stay

251
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and listen to him.

252
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Your Majesty,

253
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
he's here.

254
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hurry up and greet His Majesty.

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm Bi An.

256
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Arise.

258
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

259
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Your Majesty,

260
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
this is the relative

261
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
of Bi Jia from Qiongzhou.

262
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Bi Jia had a case of destruction.

263
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Behind this case,

264
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
there's a secret.

265
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What's the secret behind

266
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
the case?

267
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Your Majesty,

268
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Bi Jia was killed

269
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
because she was adopted

270
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
by a girl.

271
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The girl escaped

272
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
from the case.

273
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
She's missing now.

274
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Girl?

275
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes.

276
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
A girl is not that special.

277
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But

278
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
the identity of the girl...

279
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Don't hide it from His Majesty.

280
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't hide it from him.

281
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes.

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The real identity of the girl

283
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
is the princess

284
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
who was in the past.

285
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The princess from the past?

286
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's right.

287
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Your Majesty,

288
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I also found that

289
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
the princess from the past

290
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
was hiding in the harem.

291
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Bi An,

292
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
do you still recognize

293
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
the princess from the past?

294
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes.

295
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
She was born in my Bi Jia.

296
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
She left when she was over ten.

297
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Now that you've seen her,

298
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
can you recognize her?

299
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I haven't seen her for years.

300
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But she's a big girl.

301
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Her appearance won't change much.

302
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So I can recognize her.

303
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Consort Jing is here.

304
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Your Majesty.

305
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Your Majesty.

306
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Your Majesty.

307
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Your Majesty.

308
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Your Majesty.

309
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Your Majesty.

310
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Your Majesty.

311
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Your Majesty.

312
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Your Majesty.

313
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Your Majesty.

314
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Your Majesty.

315
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Your Majesty.

316
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Your Majesty.

317
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Your Majesty.

318
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Your Majesty.

319
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Your Majesty.

320
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Your Majesty.

321
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Your Majesty.

322
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Your Majesty.

323
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Your Majesty.

324
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Your Majesty.

325
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Your Majesty.

326
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Your Majesty.

327
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Your Majesty.

328
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Your Majesty.

329
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Your Majesty.

330
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Your Majesty.

331
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Your Majesty.

332
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Your Majesty.

333
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Your Majesty.

334
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Your Majesty.

335
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Your Majesty.

336
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Your Majesty.

337
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Your Majesty.

338
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Your Majesty.

339
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Your Majesty.

340
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Your Majesty.

341
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Your Majesty.

342
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Your Majesty.

343
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Your Majesty.

344
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Your Majesty.

345
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Your Majesty.

346
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Your Majesty.

347
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000

351
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
