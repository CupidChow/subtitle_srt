1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Chief Steward Wu.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You're really something.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Not only did you leave the New Seals' Den so soon,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
you've also come to the Imperial Prison.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Chief Steward Wu, you're great.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I was just lucky.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Chief Steward Wu,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
in a few days, His Majesty will be hosting a banquet

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to welcome General Zhao Wansong.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I want to discuss it with you.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The court officials are free to make their own plans.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I advise you not to be too rash.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I have no such intention.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
His Majesty has always been afraid of the Zhao family.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If someone takes this opportunity,

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
someone can knock down General Zhao.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Chief Steward Wu, what do you think

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
His Majesty will do?

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're really bold now.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You dare to speculate the imperial court.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I advise you to stop.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
His Majesty has doubted me.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Concubine Sourire sees me as a thorn in the eye and a thorn in the flesh.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If I don't fight,

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll only die.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now only you can help me.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So,

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
all of this is my wishful thinking.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What wishful thinking?

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Your Majesty,

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm here to congratulate you.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Please come in.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Greetings, Consort Sourire, Your Highness.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Your Highness, please rise.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You don't have to be so polite.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Why didn't you let me pass the message?

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The sisters are waiting to meet you at the gate of the palace.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Brother, you're back safely.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I can finally relax my mind

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and congratulate you on the achievement.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Recently, the ones who are celebrating have broken the door.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm tired of hearing you congratulate them every day.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
When you're here,

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
don't be so polite.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I have the Heavenly Lord's credit.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
His Majesty has invited me personally.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
With you as our backing,

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
we have a more dignified harem.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I've been protecting the sisters.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Only then can the sisters move forward freely

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and not fear any storm.

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We are even more proud of each other.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The sisters are very grateful for your protection.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The whole court is full of civil and military affairs.

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now I have the greatest credit.

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You two can relax.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The power of the Zhao family

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
will be greater day by day.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Brother, don't stand there.

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's talk inside the hall.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Take your time.

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You two can put it here.

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You put it here.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
All right.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Pack up and leave.

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Isn't she the maid of Song Wu Xie?

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
She's the maid of Song Wu Xie.

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Isn't she the maid of Song Wu Xie?

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
She's been serving you

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
before you came today.

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Greetings, General.

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Get up.

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Your Highness.

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Please change your seat.

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm the consort of His Majesty.

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can't be the maid

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
of Song Wu Xie.

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Your Highness.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Today's banquet

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
is to reward

88
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
the heroes who came back from the victory.

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Please don't take away

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
the title of general.

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Since His Majesty wants it,

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll sit beside His Majesty.

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
His Majesty arrives.

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

95
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Get up.

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You servants

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
are here.

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why didn't you tell me?

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I didn't allow you to tell me.

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What's the matter?

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You brothers and sisters are rare.

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's not a problem

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
to let people know.

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Sit down.

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Please enjoy.

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This fool

109
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
is really impossible.

110
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm honored to be here.

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'd like to thank you

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
for the banquet

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
with your wine.

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I have the opportunity

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
to meet you.

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We're a family.

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If you have time,

118
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
please come to the palace.

119
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The wine from Qinglu Hall

121
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
is really extraordinary.

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The wine is fragrant and long.

123
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It makes people talk.

124
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's very delicious.

125
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
General Zhao,

126
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
please drink it today.

127
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I have a lot of good wine.

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Although Qinglu Hall is good,

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
don't be greedy.

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Your Majesty,

131
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I haven't seen you for a long time.

132
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This time I saw you,

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I found that you had gray hair

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and a broken sleeve.

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I feel very sorry for you.

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You have a lot of achievements.

137
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You serve everyone

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
who is cold and hot.

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I want to ask you

140
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
for a favor.

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Please allow me

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
to choose a good match for you.

143
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
General Zhao is on the battlefield.

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He pacified the rebellion in the southwest.

145
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He is a meritorious official of our country.

146
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll arrange it.

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Your Highness,

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
this jade hairpin

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
is your favorite jewelry.

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No.

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because His Majesty doesn't like luxury,

153
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
you don't wear it.

154
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Why did you take it out today?

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
His Majesty is so favored.

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's not a gold hairpin that can be a trouble.

157
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Your Highness.

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Who gave you the guts

159
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
to betray Consort Jing?

160
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
In today's beef night,

161
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
you can only see beef and not the bird's nest.

162
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I deserve to die.

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Please spare my life.

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The people in the imperial kitchen said

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
that all the bird's nest

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
were taken

167
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and prepared for General Zhao.

168
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You are so shameless.

169
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Lv He,

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
it's just a bowl of bird's nest.

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let him leave.

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

173
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Your Highness,

174
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Consort Wan and Concubine Zhao

175
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
are spoiled by their family.

176
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The emperor would have been

177
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
with you

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
for meals every month.

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's okay if he doesn't come today.

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Even the servants follow the wind.

181
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's okay.

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The full moon is a loss,

183
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
the water is full.

184
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The Zhao family is proud of themselves.

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,700
They have already come to the emperor's

186
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,000
anti-murder.

187
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
They won't be satisfied for long.

188
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Your Highness.

189
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
General Zhao.

190
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Ning Yun,

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
you are so clumsy.

192
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How can you be so impolite?

193
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's okay.

194
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I was careless.

195
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Ning Yun,

196
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
you are just a servant.

197
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No matter how smart you are,

198
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
you still want to be a noble.

199
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I think you

200
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
love this maid too much.

201
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Could it be...

202
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Your Highness,

203
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I think this maid

204
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
is very sharp.

205
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I do lack

206
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
a cold and warm person.

207
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm bold enough

208
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
to ask for your grace.

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why don't you give me

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
this maid?

211
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm very grateful.

212
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Thank you for your grace.

213
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm afraid.

214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You bitch.

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
If my brother really

216
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
wants you out of the palace,

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I won't torture you.

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
General Zhao is respected.

219
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Ning Yun is just a maid.

220
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
How can she be a match for General Zhao?

221
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Or should I take Wan Fei

222
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
to choose a maid

223
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
who is a match for General Zhao?

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Your Majesty is right.

225
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
How can a servant

226
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
be a match for my brother?

227
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I didn't think it through.

228
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Please forgive me.

229
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Your Majesty is wise.

230
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You are thoughtful.

231
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Zhao Yingwan,

232
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
why are you so crazy?

233
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
How dare you give my brother the idea?

234
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't worry.

235
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
My brother has worked hard.

236
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He was just drunk last night.

237
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
How could His Majesty care about him?

238
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I think

239
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
he is a little jealous.

240
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If you want to get my brother's high position,

241
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
let's wait and see.

242
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't be so smart.

243
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
My brother has the position today.

244
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He is a military man who risked his life to come here.

245
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If you get him involved,

246
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I won't let you off.

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
How dare you!

248
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I, Chengxi Palace,

249
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
am not a place for you to be a bitch.

250
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Ridiculous.

251
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You really think you are a villain.

252
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I am the famous

253
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and honest lady of the Zhao family.

254
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You are just a beast

255
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
raised by the Zhao family.

256
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Are you crazy?

257
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Without the Zhao family,

258
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
you don't know

259
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
where to sing for others.

260
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If you dare to

261
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
speak for the beast in front of me again,

262
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I will tear you apart.

263
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Your Majesty,

264
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
please calm down.

265
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Who was so rude

266
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
to me that day

267
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and said that he would share my burden

268
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and beat that arrogant person?

269
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It was me.

270
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If I hadn't stopped you,

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
you would have been eaten by Zhao Wansong

272
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
by now.

273
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You even beat him.

274
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I think you should be beaten.

275
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Your Majesty,

276
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I am just a maid.

277
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I gave General Zhao a sister.

278
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Why are you jealous?

279
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Lingyu,

280
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I am not jealous.

281
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Lingyu,

282
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
what are you talking about?

283
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You are getting bolder.

284
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
How dare you

285
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
show off your sister to me?

286
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I think

287
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I should help you.

288
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Your Majesty,

289
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I just want to

290
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
test your loyalty.

291
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
If General Zhao

292
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
doesn't like my sister,

293
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
you can be at ease.

294
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But it's a pity

295
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
that he is so obsessed

296
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
with my beauty.

297
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Beauty?

298
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You are so shameless.

299
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Your Majesty,

300
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
can you guess

301
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
if General Zhao

302
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
has stopped thinking about me?

303
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He should.

304
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The earth is not the ground

305
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
under the sky.

306
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The soldiers are not the ministers.

307
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
As a minister,

308
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
does he want to

309
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
be a part of my harem?

310
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Your Majesty,

311
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
you are the emperor.

312
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Sometimes,

313
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
you can't see the dirt in the mud.

314
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I think

315
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
General Zhao

316
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
is thinking about me.

317
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I said

318
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I would beat him

319
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
if I wanted to.

320
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I will keep my promise.

321
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Your Majesty,

322
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
be patient.

323
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Wait and see.

324
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I really want to

325
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
cut your head off.

326
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What are you

327
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
trying to do?

328
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't have any idea.

329
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I just

330
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
have a sense of loyalty.

331
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Eunuch Tu'an said

332
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
you often work hard

333
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and can't sleep at night.

334
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So I have been

335
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
trying to

336
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
give you a good sleep.

337
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What did you eat?

338
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You are talking nonsense.

339
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

340
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What did I give you?

341
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Your Majesty,

342
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
didn't you just

343
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
give me food?

344
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You asked me

345
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
what I ate.

346
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I haven't eaten yet.

347
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm hungry.

348
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This is a gift from His Majesty.

349
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Please come and eat.

350
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You lost so many enemies in the palace.

351
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Aren't you afraid that someone

352
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
will poison your food?

353
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This is the first time

354
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
His Majesty has given me food.

355
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Even if the food is poisonous,

356
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I can't waste it.

357
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't worry.

358
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I've tried

359
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
the wine and the dishes.

360
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
They are not poisonous.

361
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Chief Steward Wu,

362
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
actually, last night,

363
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I deliberately

364
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
made Zhao Wansong drunk

365
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and showed him my beauty.

366
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But Wan Fei thought

367
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I wanted to climb on the general's bed.

368
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Why did you tell me

369
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
all these?

370
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Do you want to tell me

371
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
you have a way

372
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and a way?

373
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Or do you want to tell me

374
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
you are bold

375
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and not afraid of death?

376
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't have

377
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
any ways or ways.

378
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But I do have a little bit of boldness.

379
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
One day,

380
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I will make Wan Fei

381
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
kneel down

382
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and beg for forgiveness.

383
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Would you like to help me?

384
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
