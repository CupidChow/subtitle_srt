1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Imperial Physician

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Your Highness, you have a grand ceremony.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Today, everyone in the harem

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
is envious of you.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
His Majesty is so considerate of me.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Zhao Lian'er and the others

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
might be so angry that they can't sleep tonight.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, in the harem,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Your Highness is the most favored.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You are the only one in the harem.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
They don't even deserve to be kicked out.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Get up and return to the harem.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What is your identity?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You deserve to stand by Your Highness.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Get out of the way.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Zhao Lian'er

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
From now on,

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
you are the cleaning maid of Chengxi Palace.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Remember.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You can only clean in the yard.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Don't enter the palace.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Learn the rules.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Do your duties well.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I am the cleaning maid

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that Her Highness chose.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why did you ask me to do this simple job?

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You are wronged.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Chengxi Palace

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
is the most prestigious place in the harem.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Many people are frightened

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and can't even enter the palace.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You are not happy.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Being the cleaning maid in Chengxi Palace

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
is a blessing that you have cultivated for several lifetimes.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You should know your place

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and do your duty well.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If you break the rules of Chengxi Palace,

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
you will be killed.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I will do as you say.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Congratulations, Your Highness.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Your Highness has a long life.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Long live the emperor.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
May you live a long life.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Sit down.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Congratulations, Sister.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You are the best in the harem.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You are the only one

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
in the harem.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I envy you.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Your Highness is a genius.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
His Majesty will always be favored.

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We are so envious of you.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Your Highness is a genius.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You are not a loser.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We will all depend on you.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You are right.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you want to be favored,

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
you must be a genius.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It must be hard for you

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
to help the harem.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can see that

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
you are in a bad mood.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's a coincidence.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I got a medicine.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It can

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
soothe wrinkles on women's faces

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and make them gray.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I am still young.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't need the medicine.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I just

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
brought it

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
as a gift for you.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You are really sisters.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You are more considerate

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
than us.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You are considerate.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I am a good girl.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't need your words.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You should keep it for yourself.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't blame me for being too much.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I am old.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I am a few years older than you.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I hope you

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
can always be considerate.

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Please accept my love.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Please have some tea.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The bug!

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You bitch!

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How dare you trick me?

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How dare you

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
to throw the gift

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
of Concubine Zhao?

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Who allowed this stupid girl

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
to serve you in the palace?

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Your Highness, please forgive me.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I was sweeping the floor under the tree.

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
There might be a bug

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
on me.

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I didn't notice.

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Please forgive me.

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I am a vicious woman.

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I won't argue with you.

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But this is

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
what I have.

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You should ask for forgiveness.

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Please don't be angry.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I know my mistake.

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Please forgive me.

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Fine.

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If you want me to forgive you,

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
kneel on the broken porcelain

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and remember the past.

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Concubine Zhao,

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
today is my

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
birthday.

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How can I see blood?

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Your name is...

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I am Ling Yu.

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You may leave.

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes, Your Highness.

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Your Highness.

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't think that

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Concubine Wan has seen you.

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You are just a dancer.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Look at yourself.

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Sister, I didn't mean that.

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Everyone knows

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
that you are the most trusted person.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I dare not to be rude.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I have fought with you.

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You...

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Remember,

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
if you show up in front of Her Highness again,

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I will kill you.

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Go.

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Go to the backyard.

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Spread the herbs.

146
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Do your job well.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Be careful with your skin.

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is Zi Yan's.

149
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is Nanny Yu's.

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This is Du Juan's.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why does the wound hurt so much?

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
There is salt in the herb.

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No wonder Jin Yu sent me to make the medicine.

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is mine.

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Why does it taste different from others?

156
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I was soaked in the herb.

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This kind of poison tastes very light.

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Only a dog like me can tell the difference.

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Jin Yu,

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
you have blocked my way repeatedly.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You are so cruel.

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You are so cruel.

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You are so cruel.

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You have blocked my way repeatedly.

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You even used this on me.

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Don't blame me.

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yan Rong,

168
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
are you done?

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes, Your Highness.

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Your Highness,

171
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
this is the new bath head medicine bag.

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The un knocking house.

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
lasts for more than four hours.

174
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Can you check the bathroom?

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Go back to bed.

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
children and children

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
also inside.

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,600
Okay

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
")

180
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
mutt

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
no

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
oh

183
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
not

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's a secret.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Confuh

186
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,360
we're even now.

187
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,960
You're good at calculating.

188
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,840
I'm afraid you'll be angry with me.

189
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,600
Look.

190
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,280
I brought you a gift

191
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,440
to apologize to you.

192
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
This is the medicine bag

193
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
that Sister Jinyu gave me to wash my hair.

194
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,240
I can't bear to use it.

195
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,640
I brought it to pay respect to you.

196
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,440
A gift?

197
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,480
This is a gift from me.

198
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,080
My Lord, please keep it.

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,560
Are you trying to frame me again?

200
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
I promise

201
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,720
I won't frame you again.

202
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,400
My Lord,

203
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,840
please remember to use it.

204
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Use it tomorrow morning.

205
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
I'll take my leave.

206
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,960
Master,

207
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,600
why does he feel something is wrong?

208
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,440
What's wrong?

209
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,840
Let's see

210
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,840
what tricks he can play.

211
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,400
Your Highness, please forgive me.

212
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
My hair.

213
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,200
My hair.

214
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,520
What's wrong with it?

215
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,800
What's wrong with my hair?

216
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,840
You're going to the construction site?

217
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,200
How dare this scoundrel harm Her Highness!

218
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,160
Take her away!

219
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,360
Go.

220
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,200
Enough.

221
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,160
Take her away.

222
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,040
Take her arm.

223
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,600
Master, please forgive me.

224
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,000
Master, please forgive me.

225
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,440
Scoundrel.

226
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,000
How dare you harm me?

227
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,080
Who ordered you to come here?

228
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,280
Your Highness,

229
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,200
even if you give me ten times the courage,

230
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,920
I wouldn't dare to harm you.

231
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't know what happened.

232
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,560
And no one ordered me to do so.

233
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,840
I was wronged.

234
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Please investigate it.

235
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,240
You're a good girl.

236
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,960
You're still so stubborn.

237
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,680
You packed the medicine bag.

238
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,160
You poisoned the medicine bag that Her Highness washed her hair.

239
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,600
You ruined her hair.

240
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,120
You deserve to die.

241
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,440
I just distributed the medicine bags

242
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,680
according to the list.

243
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,400
If I poisoned her during this process,

244
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,320
I would definitely be involved.

245
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,560
How could I do such a stupid thing?

246
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,360
Your Highness, please investigate it.

247
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,480
Your Highness,

248
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,560
this scoundrel is very clever and cunning.

249
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,680
Please order me

250
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,160
to kill this scoundrel who offended you.

251
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,200
Sister Jinyu,

252
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,520
why are you so anxious to kill me?

253
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,800
Do you want to kill me?

254
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,240
You...

255
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,320
I'm from Wulin.

256
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,160
Greetings, Your Highness.

257
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,080
Get up.

258
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,960
Why are you here, Chief Wu?

259
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,920
I found that

260
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
the medicine bag that Ling Yun sent

261
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,680
was poisoned with poison.

262
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,080
Poisoning is a big taboo in the palace.

263
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,200
I dare not be rude.

264
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,400
Come and check it out.

265
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,120
You're a scoundrel.

266
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,880
You not only tried to kill Her Highness,

267
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,640
but also tried to kill Chief Wu.

268
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,680
Sister Jinyu,

269
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,840
Ling Yun just gave you the medicine bag

270
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,920
as a gift to Chief Wu.

271
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,680
If you insist on killing her,

272
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,440
Ling Yun is just trying to make up for you.

273
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,360
Scoundrel!

274
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,480
How dare you poison me?

275
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,560
Your Highness,

276
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,120
Ling Yun framed me.

277
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,400
She poisoned you.

278
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,520
Please investigate it.

279
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,880
I've never poisoned anyone.

280
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,360
Please investigate it, Your Highness.

281
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,720
We'll find out who poisoned you.

282
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,040
Zhang Yuanpan.

283
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,840
Greetings, Your Highness.

284
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,200
Your Highness,

285
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,440
it's not difficult to find out

286
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,280
who poisoned you.

287
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,040
The night grass

288
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,360
has a special smell

289
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,000
that attracts insects to eat it.

290
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,200
It's hard to wash it off

291
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,440
if you touch it.

292
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,800
Just let these two maids

293
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,920
put their hands into the insect's nest at the same time.

294
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,760
Whoever has a full insect's nest

295
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
and is bitten by it,

296
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,480
will be poisoned.

297
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,400
Bring the bedding up here.

298
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,320
Yes.

299
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,160
You two, put your hands in.

300
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,680
I want to see

301
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,240
who poisoned me.

302
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,520
Your Highness.

303
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,920
Your Highness, you know it.

304
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,640
I'm afraid of insects.

305
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,320
I'm willing to test it

306
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,640
to prove my innocence.

307
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,080
STEM

308
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,440
Somebody.

309
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:54,920
Lady,

310
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,640
press her hands in.

311
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,160
I...

312
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
Okay.

313
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,080
Luckily, when I was changing the medicine bag,

314
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,160
I didn't touch the herb with my hand.

315
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,600
Jin Yu,

316
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,480
since this is your hand,

317
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,640
then you should take it.

318
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
No.

319
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,880
Your Highness,

320
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,080
it seems that Jin Yu has poisoned you.

321
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Jin Yu,

322
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,280
it's you!

323
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,840
Why did you kill me?

324
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,640
No, it's not me, Your Highness.

325
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,240
I'm innocent.

326
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,720
I'm innocent.

327
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,920
You're as strong as a mountain.

328
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,200
How dare you call me innocent?

329
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,240
Guards,

330
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,840
send this traitor

331
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,080
to the Office of Punishments.

332
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,960
He'll be punished.

333
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,080
I don't think so.

334
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,680
I'll deal with the people around me.

335
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,760
I don't deserve to be involved.

336
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,680
I don't dare to.

337
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,760
But...

338
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,640
After all, he's from my Chengxi Palace.

339
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,960
The guard of the Wu Mansion

340
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,480
is a bit too long.

341
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,080
Guards,

342
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,840
take Jin Yu away.

343
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
At 20 o'clock,

344
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,000
the Wu Mansion

345
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,120
will be on its way.

346
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
Guards,

347
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,640
take Jin Yu away.

348
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
At 20 o'clock,

349
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
the Wu Mansion

350
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
will be on its way.

351
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
Guards,

352
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,640
take Jin Yu away.

353
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
At 20 o'clock,

354
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
the Wu Mansion

355
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
will be on its way.

356
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
Guards,

357
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
take Jin Yu away.

358
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
At 20 o'clock,

359
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
the Wu Mansion

360
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
will be on its way.

361
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Guards,

362
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
take Jin Yu away.

363
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
At 20 o'clock,

364
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
the Wu Mansion

365
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
will be on its way.

366
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
Guards,

367
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
take Jin Yu away.

368
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Guards,

369
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
take Jin Yu away.

370
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Guards,

371
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
take Jin Yu away.

372
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
Guards,

373
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,640
take Jin Yu away.

374
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Guards,
