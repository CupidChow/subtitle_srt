00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 05

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
My name is Ling Yu.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm a new maid.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Through the layers of snow,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I was selected to be a maid

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
in the incense and medicine bureau controlled by Consort Ruan.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Ling Yu,

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
look at the palace.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's so grand.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So what?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
As the saying goes,

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
once you enter the palace,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
you'll be like the sea.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
From then on,

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
you'll be a stranger.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Once you enter the palace,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
you'll only live and die.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ling Yu,

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
don't scare me.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Is the palace really that scary?

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I was wrong.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Please forgive me.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't do it again.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I was wrong.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What are you laughing at?

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Shut up.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Or I'll cut your tongue.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's great.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's great.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's not good to serve the master.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's the end.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Otherwise,

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
you'll die.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Do you remember?

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Please follow the instruction of the palace master.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hurry up.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
All of you new maids

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
listen.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The head of the incense and medicine bureau,

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Aunt Sun,

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
is a cultivating fairy.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Now,

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
give all the money and items

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
you have

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
to support Aunt Sun.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hurry up.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Give them all to her.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hurry up.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What are you hiding?

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Nothing.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Nothing.

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Guards.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hide her.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes.

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Guards.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Aunt, don't cry.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Your sister is dead.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Uncle.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm the only one

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
who can save her.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Please forgive me.

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're a maid.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
How dare you...

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Aunt,

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm punishing you

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
for your impudence and greed.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You made the gods angry.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It has nothing to do with the money.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Stop.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The god doesn't lack three incense sticks.

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why do you need to pay for the money?

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Not to mention your daughter's filial piety.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
She has already

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
handed over all the money.

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why do you

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
torture her like this?

78
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Who are you?

79
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm a new maid.

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Ling Yu.

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So you're here.

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Things have been going wrong lately.

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I've been praying to the gods day and night.

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Finally,

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
the gods have given me a wife.

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
They said that

87
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
there must be a bad news

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
coming to the world.

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What bad news?

90
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're obviously trying to steal the good and the bad.

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Nonsense.

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Come on.

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Take the bad news down.

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The evil spirit is in my body.

95
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How dare you

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
defile me?

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Qing Shan Shui.

98
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Turn around.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Look.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
See if she's

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
the evil spirit

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
that's in my body.

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Why is she

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
spitting water?

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
She's spitting water.

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Is she really dead?

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
She's really dead.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Your Highness.

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What are you doing?

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You're in a bad mood.

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Get out.

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's go.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's go.

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Get out.

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let's go.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's go.

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Get out.

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's go.

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's go.

121
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Get out.

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Get out.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Get out.

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,920
I'll avenge him.

125
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Shut up!

126
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,960
Now, Her Highness is the most favored one.

127
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,880
You're a lowly maid.

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,520
How dare you avenge him?

129
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,120
This is your destiny.

130
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,320
You have to admit it.

131
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,920
So what if I'm a lowly maid?

132
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,000
Uncle.

133
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,800
You haven't tried it yet.

134
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,640
How can you know that a lowly maid is a heartless woman?

135
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,960
I want to enter the palace.

136
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,480
Even if I have to die,

137
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,600
I want to try it.

138
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,680
I'm still a scoundrel.

139
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,080
I'll fight to the death.

140
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,560
Ling Yu.

141
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,400
Ling Yu.

142
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,920
You're awake.

143
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,480
Do you feel better?

144
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,480
You're a coward.

145
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,320
Sun Mei Zi made you like this.

146
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,280
I can't let her go.

147
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,040
Ling Yu.

148
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,560
If it wasn't for helping me,

149
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,480
you wouldn't have offended Aunt.

150
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Aunt's backer is Consort Wan.

151
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,000
We'll have a hard time in the future.

152
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,720
So what if it's Consort Wan?

153
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,440
She's been favored.

154
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,480
She's not afraid of any trouble.

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,080
She's not ungrateful.

156
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,640
It's not the time yet.

157
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,960
Ling Yu.

158
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,000
Keep your voice down.

159
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,640
If Consort Wan hears it,

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,760
we'll be in trouble.

161
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,040
Consort Wan is the most favored woman

162
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,600
in the whole harem.

163
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,080
Her brother Zhao Wan Song

164
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,560
is a high official.

165
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,120
His Majesty values her very much.

166
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,000
The other concubines in the harem,

167
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,120
no matter who they are,

168
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,840
if they make her unhappy,

169
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,400
Qing Ze will be scolded.

170
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,440
Zhong Ze will be sent to the criminal department

171
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,520
and beaten to death.

172
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,880
Isn't Consort Wan a cunning woman?

173
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,440
We're no worse than her.

174
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,120
How can His Majesty only see her?

175
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,200
Keep your voice down.

176
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,520
How dare you

177
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,920
defy Consort Wan in the back?

178
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,080
Greetings, Your Highness.

179
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,920
Greetings, Your Highness.

180
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,960
I'm sorry.

181
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,320
Please forgive me.

182
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,800
There are no rules in the harem now.

183
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,320
Jin Yu.

184
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,280
Break their mouths.

185
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,320
Yes.

186
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Please forgive me.

187
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,600
Please forgive me.

188
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,360
Please forgive me.

189
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,440
Please forgive me.

190
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,760
Please forgive me.

191
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,960
Consort Wan is so domineering.

192
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,920
No one in the harem

193
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,960
can control her?

194
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,120
I heard that

195
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,360
the head of the Fourteenth Gate, Wu Lin Fu,

196
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,240
he and Consort Wan are enemies

197
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,440
and are against each other.

198
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Wu Lin Fu?

199
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,080
He's a famous man in the harem.

200
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,200
He's in charge of the Fourteenth Gate.

201
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,960
He's honest and has the power to kill.

202
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,360
In the harem,

203
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,880
he's the most powerful person

204
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,760
besides the favored concubine.

205
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:46,560
Childe law's

206
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,480
to supervise the inner court.

207
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,120
The imperial decree is to be executed first.

208
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,680
Even if the two young masters have committed a mistake,

209
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,560
they should be punished by the Office of Penalty.

210
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,880
Why should Your Highness

211
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,440
punish the two concubines privately?

212
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,960
Not to mention the maid

213
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,320
who was with Your Highness just now.

214
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,160
How dare she take over the young master?

215
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,360
The young master is of low status.

216
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,760
She is also the mistress in the harem.

217
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,680
How can she let a servant

218
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,720
do whatever she wants

219
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,840
and do whatever she wants?

220
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,160
Take her away.

221
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,000
Who dares?

222
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,000
Chief Steward Wu,

223
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,680
Jin Yu was impulsive just now.

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,200
I will take her back to be strict with her.

225
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,480
Please forgive her.

226
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,400
She will be punished for half a year

227
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,040
and will be released.

228
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,960
Let's go back to the palace.

229
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,320
Chief Steward Wu is really powerful

230
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,440
and has great merit.

231
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,960
If we surrender to her,

232
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,880
we will have the chance

233
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,200
to deal with the third sister.

234
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,520
Let's just forget it.

235
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,960
Let's just forget it.

236
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,200
I heard from the maids

237
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,600
that Chief Steward Wu

238
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,280
is a monster who can hunt sheep.

239
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,840
The maids who entered the Shisi Yaman

240
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,520
couldn't be released alive.

241
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,920
No matter what,

242
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,720
I must take Sun Meizi

243
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,200
and become the head of the Herb-rearing Bureau.

244
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,280
This way,

245
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,960
I can get close to Wan Fei.

246
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,840
Have some water.

247
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Even if she is a monster,

248
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,880
I must get close to her for the rest of my life.

249
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,240
She is Wu Linfu, right?

250
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,200
Where is she?

251
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,400
I have seen many maids

252
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,800
who want to be the emperor's woman.

253
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,120
You are the first one

254
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,880
who gave me advice.

255
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,440
Sir, you misunderstood me.

256
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,760
I didn't mean to do that.

257
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,840
Tell me.

258
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,640
What do you want

259
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,320
to do in my room at night?

260
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,640
I just want to offer you a chance.

261
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,280
I can help you

262
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,360
to control the Herb-rearing Bureau.

263
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,160
How dare you!

264
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,520
The Herb-rearing Bureau

265
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,160
is under the supervision of Lady Wan Fei.

266
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,800
It has nothing to do with me.

267
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,800
Sir,

268
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,800
the Herb-rearing Bureau

269
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,160
is evil and vicious.

270
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,120
It is a dirty place.

271
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,280
I hope you can help us

272
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,920
to get rid of the evil.

273
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,320
I will help you to get rid of the evil.

274
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,120
In the next two days,

275
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,440
I will let the Herb-rearing Bureau

276
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,640
to do something great.

277
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,480
Just wait and see.

278
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,520
You are just a maid.

279
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,120
You are so guilty.

280
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,920
I will see what you can do.

281
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,160
Let's go.

282
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,000
Isn't this our Huo Xing?

283
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,360
Cuiwei,

284
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,240
Ling Yun is not Huo Xing.

285
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,560
Don't say that.

286
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,680
Stop talking nonsense.

287
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,960
We are not allowed

288
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,680
to live in Huo Xing.

289
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,520
Get out.

290
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,320
Cuiwei,

291
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,360
I beg you.

292
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,400
Let Ling Yun sleep in the room.

293
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,560
It's okay to let her live in the room.

294
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,720
Ling Yun,

295
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,960
you can help her to wash her feet.

296
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,200
Maybe

297
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,440
she can show mercy

298
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,720
to let you stay in the room.

299
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,520
I will help her to wash her feet.

300
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,440
No.

301
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,320
It's not enough to wash her feet.

302
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,720
She has to drink my water.

303
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,000
Why are you still standing?

304
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,120
Hurry up.

305
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,760
Hurry up.

306
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,280
You girl,

307
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,200
you really agree with my heels.

308
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,400
Hurry up.

309
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,360
The Right Madness
