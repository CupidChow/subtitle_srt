00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Concubine Yun is here.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Greetings to Concubine Yun.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Where is Chief Steward Wu?

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Replying to Your Highness, Chief Steward Wu has blood on his hands.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He should be washing his hands in his room right now.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Blood on his hands? What do you mean?

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I dare not say anything.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You should ask him yourself.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You better know what you are saying.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If I know you are talking nonsense,

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
you will suffer.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You wait here.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will go.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Wu Lingfu, I know you are inside. Open the door.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Open the door.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Open the door.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Open the door.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I will go pour the wine.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Stop.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I told you to stop.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Who are you?

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I, Wu Lingfu...

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I will ask you one last time.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Who are you?

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I am the Chief Steward of the Ten-year Palace, Wu Lingfu.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Bida,

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
do you really not know your sister?

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't understand what Your Highness is saying.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
My brother, Bida,

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
has a scar on his back.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It was when I was a kid,

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
he climbed a tree and helped me with a kite.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He fell down and got a sprain.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I saw it clearly that day.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
There is also a scar on your back.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Your Highness, you are wrong.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't have a scar on my back.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Really?

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let me see.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Bida, what are you doing?

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't be like this, Bida.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Aren't you going to see my body?

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I will let you see.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You are crazy. I am His Majesty's concubine.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't care.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let me go.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let me go.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Look at my sister.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But I never thought of being your brother.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let me go.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let me go.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let me go.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let me go.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let me go.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let me go.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
How are you?

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You are bleeding.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I am fine.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's just a small wound.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's too dangerous.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't do such a dangerous thing.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Please protect me in the future.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay?

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Why?

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Because I am your sister.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You are not my real sister.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let me go.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Otherwise, I will stab you.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I am sorry.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I am not...

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I never wanted to tell you.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But now,

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I am like this.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I am like this.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I am like this.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I am like this.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I am like this.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I am like this.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I am like this.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Do you know that

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I have been looking for you all the time?

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Even if there is only a little hope,

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
no matter what you become,

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
you are my only

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
in this world.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I am willing to

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
meet you.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I looked for you everywhere.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You are gone.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I heard from Jingfei

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
that he saved you

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and brought you to the palace.

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yes.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Jingfei adopted me later

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and brought me to the palace.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't worry.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I have been doing well these years.

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I didn't suffer much.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's good.

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Promise me.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's not be apart again.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay?

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Now,

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I have no way out.

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What happened?

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What did he say?

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You were bleeding.

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What did you do?

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Don't ask.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Did Jingfei

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
force you to do something?

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Stop it.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's too late.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
From the moment

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
you became the queen,

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I have no way out.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Why did you tell him

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
that I am his brother?

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You came to me

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
for Yunpin.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I heard that

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
he was looking for his brother.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It seems that he has found him.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you dare to admit it now?

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You saved Yunpin

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
from danger every time.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yunpin is smart.

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's not difficult to guess

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
that you are his brother.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Isn't it a good thing

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
that your brothers

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
recognize each other?

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Your Highness.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I am here to remind you.

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If you let him go,

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
he will be in trouble.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We can talk about anything.

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If you dare to touch him,

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
don't blame me for not reading the old love.

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I am a kind of person.

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I think you know it.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Good.

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Good, Wulin Buddha.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You dare to threaten me

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
for him.

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I will stop here.

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I will leave now.

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Go.

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Your Highness.

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You are here.

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Your Highness.

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Wulin Buddha is innocent.

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It was Concubine Ling who wanted to take Concubine Wan

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and forced her to help me.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Your Highness, please let Wulin Buddha go.

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Don't let him get involved

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
in the fight in the harem.

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Innocent?

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
There is no one

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
who is truly innocent in the harem.

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He just gave up

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
what he could give up

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and exchanged for what he wanted.

167
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Your Highness.

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Why should we involve

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
other people in our affairs?

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Involve others?

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You really don't know anything?

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He did this

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
for you.

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
For me?

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If Wulin Buddha didn't do this for you,

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
he would have hoped that I would take Zhao Yanwan's

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
pulse-saving device.

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Otherwise, how could he be willing to use it for me?

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Wulin Buddha thought that Concubine Wan

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
forced you to take the blood

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and hurt you.

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
In order to help you defeat Concubine Wan

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and ask me to take Concubine Wan's pulse-saving device,

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
my condition is

185
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
that she must obey me unconditionally

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and be my loyal servant.

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
She must always be by my side.

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I was wrong about you.

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You were hiding so well.

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
In the harem,

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
you can't fight without permission.

192
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
If you don't fight, you will be turned into a fish

193
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and be cut into pieces by others.

194
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
To control your own fate,

195
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
you must have a sharp knife, right?

196
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Isn't it a sharp knife?

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Is there a knife

198
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
that is more suitable than Wulin Buddha's?

199
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
How can you let him go?

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Recently, in the harem,

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Noble Lady Mu is in good shape.

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I feel a little dizzy.

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I understand.

204
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Your Majesty, it's time to flip the cards.

205
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Forget it.

206
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Wait.

207
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Concubine Yun's card is added.

208
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Your Majesty,

209
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Concubine Yun was in poor health some time ago.

210
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Now she is getting better.

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I will add her card.

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Go to Yongxiu Palace.

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yes.

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
My Lady.

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Come to me.

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This way.

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't move.

218
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Hold it.

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
De Gui.

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Where are you going?

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
This way.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Is that Noble Lady Mu?

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Look, I caught you.

224
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Your Majesty, it's Noble Lady Mu.

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This way.

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Where are you going?

227
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Mingyue.

228
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I heard your voice.

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't run.

230
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This way.

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Mingyue.

232
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Mingyue.

233
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I caught you.

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Look at me.

235
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This way.

236
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I caught you.

237
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
How about I play hide-and-seek with you?

238
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Your Majesty.

239
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Hide-and-seek.

240
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You can figure it out.

241
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I used to play with eunuchs when I was a child.

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I haven't played for a long time.

243
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I didn't expect Noble Lady Mu to be so kind to you.

244
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
If you don't mind,

245
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
let's play together.

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
How about finding your childhood memories?

247
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Okay.

248
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
My Lady.

249
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
My Lady.

250
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Where is His Majesty?

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
His Majesty went to Noble Lady Mu's palace.

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Noble Lady Mu?

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
His Majesty was coming to us.

254
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Noble Lady Mu stopped him halfway.

255
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This Noble Lady Mu is really a vixen.

256
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
She has bewitched His Majesty.

257
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't know what she did.

258
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Chengxi Palace is really a place of fortune.

259
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
There is Wan Fei and Noble Lady Mu.

260
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
My Lady.

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I heard that Noble Lady Mu is very wild.

262
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If this continues,

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
His Majesty will be locked up in Chengxi Palace every day.

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We have to find a way.

265
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Now Noble Lady Mu is a righteous slave.

266
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm afraid we can't take advantage of her.

267
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
My Lady.

268
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I heard that there is a new thing in Chengxi Palace.

269
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What is it?

270
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I heard that His Majesty has asked Noble Lady Mu to raise horses in Chengxi Palace.

271
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Now Chengxi Palace is training horses day and night.

272
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Training horses?

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
My Lady.

274
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
My Lady.

275
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I heard about it.

276
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
His Majesty went to Chengxi Palace again?

277
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes.

278
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
My Lady.

279
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You are really good at predicting things.

280
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Noble Lady Mu.

281
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What trick did you use this time?

282
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You stopped His Majesty halfway.

283
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What else?

284
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Training horses.

285
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I heard that Noble Lady Mu gave His Majesty a horse whip and a horse saddle.

286
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
At night,

287
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
did His Majesty's training horse sound in Chengxi Palace?

288
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What kind of horse is it?

289
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
His Majesty is so obsessed with it.

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Imperial Concubine Yun is here.

291
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Greetings, Imperial Concubine Yun.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I suddenly came to visit and disturbed you.

293
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What are you saying?

294
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
In the harem,

295
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
they say that you are very smart.

296
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I have the opportunity to visit you personally.

297
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm not happy yet.

298
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I heard that

299
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
you gave His Majesty a horse saddle.

300
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm not happy yet.

301
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm not happy yet.

302
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You gave me a horse saddle.

303
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm very curious.

304
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
How can there be a horse in the harem?

305
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So I want to come and see.

306
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Please wait a moment.

307
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Sister.

308
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you want to be a horse girl today

309
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
or a horse?

310
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I want to be a horse girl.

311
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I want to be a horse girl.

312
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000

I want to be a horse girl.
