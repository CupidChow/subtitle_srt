00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Untamed

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,440
Your Highness,

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,080
I have something to tell you.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,360
Your brother is the General of Jingyuan.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,280
How can a maid from the Imperial Palace

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,400
be a match for him?

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,520
He's just a lowly maid.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,880
Do you really think I would let him

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,320
become my brother's maid

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,120
and let him live a luxurious life?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He's dreaming.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,000
Keep an eye on him for the next few days.

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,360
He's very thoughtful.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,760
I think

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,240
he can't wait to find a chance

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,840
to climb on my brother's bed.

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes.

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,960
But Your Highness,

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,480
if that's the case,

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,280
aren't you afraid of getting general trouble?

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,520
My brother is a great official in this court.

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,920
His Majesty wouldn't hurt his subjects

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,560
for a maid.

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,640
Besides,

26
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,680
women are always at the top of this.

27
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,080
Men

28
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,000
are just pretending to be rich.

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,760
Zhao Yingwan lived in Chengxi Palace.

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,920
She really treats herself

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,480
as the main lady of the Zhao family.

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,600
I should have asked someone

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,120
to draw her as a dog

34
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,960
singing in the south.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,800
Your Highness,

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,720
Consort Wan asked General Zhao

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,600
to ask His Majesty for a maid.

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,840
If His Majesty gets angry,

39
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,080
General Zhao will be implicated.

40
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,800
You're very considerate of your brother.

41
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,360
Do you also want to

42
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,560
climb on my brother's bed?

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,840
I don't dare to.

44
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,920
I've been favored by General Zhao.

45
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,080
I only care about you and General Zhao.

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,680
I don't have any selfish motives.

47
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,280
Get up.

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
You're right.

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,920
Zhao Yingwan

50
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,000
is not responsible for the trouble.

51
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,040
He'll get the Zhao family involved sooner or later.

52
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,840
Now,

53
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,440
he can't even fight a maid.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,560
I must find a way to deal with Lingyun.

55
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,920
I can't let them harm my brother.

56
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,280
Your Highness,

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
you're too kind to

58
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,680
deal with Lingyun in person.

59
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,680
After I deal with Lingyun,

60
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,800
I'll settle the score with Zhao Yingwan.

61
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,680
Send someone to keep an eye on that maid these days.

62
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,280
Yes.

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,800
Will you help me, Your Grace?

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,280
I'd like to ask Your Grace

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,320
to get me a paper

66
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,440
from the Taiping Sect's general.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Your Grace.

68
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,720
Where are you from, eunuch?

69
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Raise your head.

70
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,040
Why are you here?

71
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,880
Forgive me, General.

72
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,560
I was just passing by.

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,080
Please forgive me for disturbing you.

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,200
I'm leaving.

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,200
You dressed up like this

76
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,240
and came to Taiping Sect.

77
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,000
You just passed by.

78
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,240
General,

79
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,720
why do you have to humiliate me?

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,160
Don't be so impulsive.

81
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,760
It's not good to be seen by others.

82
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,440
General, let me go.

83
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,480
Promise me

84
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,840
to come back to see me.

85
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
I won't let go.

86
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,480
排板

87
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,000
Thank you, eunuch.

88
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,680
Despite the fairies came

89
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,040
and all lords enjoy the beauty in the palace

90
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,560
out of only seven thousand 8 out of ten thousand yuan,

91
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,360
but if you want to get some,

92
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,600
just deliver your orders to them.

93
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,480
No, no, no.

94
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,640
Miss Lingyun,

95
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,360
I can't afford to take your money.

96
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,960
You are a palace maid.

97
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,320
I hope you can help me

98
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,920
with my beauty in the future.

99
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,600
Eunuch,

100
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,280
I will definitely

101
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,400
work for you

102
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,400
in the future.

103
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,280
Please take the money.

104
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,400
We are all working for you.

105
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,400
It's not easy for anyone.

106
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,120
Please exchange the rest

107
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,920
for some wine.

108
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,040
Thank you for your consideration.

109
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,400
I will take my leave then.

110
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,000
Come.

111
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,040
Your Highness,

112
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,880
I have got some news.

113
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,960
The night before last,

114
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,000
Ling Yun dressed up as a eunuch

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,640
and went to meet General Si at the Taiping Gate.

116
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,040
Yesterday,

117
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,360
he went to the Imperial Household Department

118
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,000
and spent half a year

119
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,080
buying incense for the god of heaven.

120
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,760
Today,

121
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,560
the incense is on the table

122
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
of General Wan Song.

123
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,280
Aren't you captioned

124
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
by your brother?

125
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,000
No.

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,040
долларов

127
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,120
He gives his brother

128
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,200
incense with cinnabar and peony because he likes incense.

129
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,600
This is so expensive.

130
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,520
There are only 3,000 supply of

131
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,600
qualityNOCOG per month.

132
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,720
too many outings

133
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,040
How much it is.

134
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,320
such a shorty.

135
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,680
To serve his brother,

136
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,160
I really cakes.

137
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,320
She is.

138
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,960
It seems that this woman

139
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,540
really likes

140
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,440
being general Wan Song's concubine.

141
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,240
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,800
Your Majesty,

143
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,680
you've been writing

144
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,280
the memorial for two hours.

145
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,400
The court is important,

146
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,360
but your health is also important.

147
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,880
Have some tea.

148
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,440
You're making trouble for no reason.

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
What do you want to do?

150
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,120
Your Majesty,

151
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,600
do you remember

152
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,960
I told you

153
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,080
to take a good sleep?

154
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,160
Yes.

155
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
Someone bragged that

156
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,320
he wanted to teach the people

157
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,480
who are proud of themselves

158
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,240
a good sleep.

159
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,120
Today is the time

160
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,840
to make His Majesty

161
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,120
have a good sleep.

162
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,440
Wait for me.

163
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,360
Your Majesty.

164
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,640
What does it mean?

165
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,520
Your Majesty,

166
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,480
put on your clothes.

167
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
I'll take you to a place.

168
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,120
This is the dress of the guards.

169
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,400
I'm the emperor.

170
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,960
How can I wear this?

171
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,920
It's raining outside.

172
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,280
It's almost time.

173
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,800
I can only borrow this.

174
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,640
Hurry up.

175
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,680
Just put it on and follow me.

176
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,920
Come on.

177
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,360
Lingyun,

178
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,840
what are you doing?

179
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,680
Lingyun.

180
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,200
Lingyun,

181
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,560
where are you taking me?

182
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,600
Your Majesty,

183
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,960
it's a rare opportunity.

184
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,120
Just trust me.

185
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,480
You'll know it later.

186
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,560
Help me.

187
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,440
If I have a problem,

188
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
can you afford it?

189
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,920
Your Majesty,

190
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,880
do you have blind eyes?

191
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,680
Why are you walking in a water pit?

192
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,160
How dare you!

193
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,600
Shut up.

194
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,720
Your Majesty, don't worry.

195
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,320
I'll keep your secret.

196
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,480
Lingyun.

197
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,760
Qingqing,

198
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,000
I just saw

199
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,760
that Ren Yu and a guard

200
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,320
went to the imperial garden.

201
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,200
Really?

202
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,680
That scoundrel is so cunning.

203
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,800
Did you see it clearly?

204
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,520
Your Highness,

205
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,600
I saw it clearly.

206
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,680
It must be Lingyun.

207
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,240
The guard was wearing a shawl.

208
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,600
They were holding hands and being intimate.

209
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,560
They were sneaking around.

210
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
It was raining outside.

211
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,520
There was no one in the imperial garden.

212
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,240
It was a good place to have a private meeting.

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,040
Yu'er is old.

214
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
I should stop her.

215
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,840
If it's a private meeting,

216
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,840
we'll just go along the water

217
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,960
and catch her.

218
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,480
We'll get rid of her.

219
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,600
Let's go.

220
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,080
Let's go and see

221
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,160
how the imperial maids

222
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,280
communicated with the guard.

223
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,780
Qingqing

224
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,840
Go ask that guard

225
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,760
to bring Elf-N boleh into the door.

226
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,940
As you wish.

227
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,800
Xiaoqing will be here soon.

228
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,600
We can't let her escape this time.

229
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,560
Your Highness,

230
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm watching you closely.

231
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,720
Lingying's sword is only in the hands of the guards.

232
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,720
She won't escape this time.

233
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,600
Youyun,

234
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,080
why did you bring me

235
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,320
to this boat at night?

236
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,560
Your Majesty, listen.

237
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,320
Your Majesty.

238
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,680
When I was a child,

239
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,640
I lived with my parents in Jiangnan.

240
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,880
I used to stay in the boat house for a while.

241
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,000
Every night when it rained,

242
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,360
I would hear the fishing boats

243
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,600
on the boat deck

244
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,920
making sounds and

245
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,520
falling slowly.

246
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,120
Then I would go to sleep.

247
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,040
I would sleep very soundly.

248
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,680
So from that moment on,

249
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,480
I knew

250
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,640
no matter how difficult the problem was,

251
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,440
as long as it was the night of the rainy day,

252
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,920
I wouldn't lose sleep.

253
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,080
I've never experienced

254
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,800
the kind of life you mentioned.

255
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,720
But just hearing you say it,

256
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,800
I can feel

257
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,000
the peace and relief.

258
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,440
Your Majesty,

259
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,080
I heard that you can't sleep at night.

260
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,840
So I thought

261
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,400
I must find a chance

262
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,760
to bring you to the boat of the rainy day

263
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,280
so that you can listen to the sound of the rain

264
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,000
and fall asleep.

265
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,760
You can get some rest

266
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,760
and feel

267
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,160
the peace and relief I had when I was a child.

268
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
in news of the flood

269
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,600
Your Highness.

270
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,960
Your Highness,

271
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
I got it.

272
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,480
Jingguang.

273
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,760
General Zhao did tell me about it.

274
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,360
But General Zhao is not in Taiping Sect.

275
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,480
I don't know where he is.

276
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,760
This scoundrel.

277
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,280
I can't get away with this.

278
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,920
How dare he

279
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,000
dare to die in the Imperial Garden

280
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,160
and do such a dirty thing.

281
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,680
Go.

282
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,640
Get on the boat.

283
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,120
Arrest him.
