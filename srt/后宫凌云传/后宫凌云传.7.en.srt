00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Great Hall

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,300
Episode 10

3
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,480
I bow to Your Majesty.

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,120
Greetings.

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,040
Today is the Spring Festival.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,240
I just returned from the palace.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,120
The spring flowers are blooming in the palace.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
It's very lively.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,840
Just like all the concubines in the harem,

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,960
they have their own talents and beauty.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,520
I hope you can be like the flowers in the spring

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,840
and support each other.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,040
Stay together,

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,560
support me and share my worries.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,240
I will never disappoint you.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,280
You may rise.

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,400
Sit down.

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,480
The Spring Festival

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
Your Majesty,

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,720
I will take care of the Spring Festival today.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,760
I will spend the Spring Festival

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,160
with you.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,560
I will share the prosperity with the concubines in the harem.

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,520
Thank you.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,040
Thank you for your concern.

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,720
As long as you are happy,

27
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
I will do my best.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,440
Let's begin.

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,480
The Spring Festival

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,480
Oh no.

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,320
I am still angry with Concubine Wan.

32
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,840
Lian Er.

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,360
You really won't let me down.

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,040
Go and check what's going on.

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,880
Yes.

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,040
Your Majesty.

37
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,360
Your Majesty,

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,960
Zhao Ping's five-shoes

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,320
found a slice of the blade.

40
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,280
Please bear with it, Your Highness.

41
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,480
The imperial physician will be here soon.

42
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,280
Zhao Ping is badly injured.

43
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,760
He needs to get up and move.

44
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
I'm afraid

45
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,880
I can't dance for you anymore.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,240
Those who framed me

47
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,760
are so vicious.

48
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,760
Your Majesty, please help me.

49
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,960
Don't worry, my dear.

50
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,160
I will find out the truth.

51
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,400
Your Majesty,

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,760
Wu Xie

53
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,240
was sent by Concubine Wan.

54
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,880
She asked me to dance in front of the imperial prison today.

55
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,000
She did it

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,680
to kill me.

57
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,240
Concubine Wan,

58
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,320
what's going on with the five-shoes Zhao Ping mentioned?

59
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Your Majesty,

60
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,240
as far as I know,

61
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,040
Concubine Wan arranged Zhao Ping's dance

62
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,960
and sent him the five-shoes.

63
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,080
Today, Zhao Ping's sister danced

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,120
and her foot was injured.

65
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,800
She found a slice of the blade in the five-shoes.

66
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,280
It's hard to say

67
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,760
it has nothing to do with Concubine Wan.

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,000
What do you mean, Concubine Jing?

69
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,480
Are you saying that I deliberately

70
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,280
hid the slice of the blade in the five-shoes?

71
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,040
Concubine Wan,

72
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,240
I want to hear your explanation.

73
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,560
Your Majesty, please check it carefully.

74
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,080
I did send someone

75
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,760
to send the five-shoes to Zhao Ping.

76
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,000
But if I say that I deliberately

77
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,560
killed her, I was wronged.

78
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,400
I and Zhao Ping are sisters.

79
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,800
We have our own differences,

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,440
but we are still a family.

81
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,000
Besides,

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,240
I can't

83
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,720
break my own rules

84
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,800
by such a cruel way.

85
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Maybe

86
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
it's the maid who sent the shoes.

87
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,960
Ling Yu,

88
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,560
you did a good thing.

89
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,640
You should be the one to confess.

90
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,240
You sent the five-shoes to Zhao Ping?

91
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,480
Yes.

92
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,680
Your Majesty,

93
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,840
I just followed the instructions of the master

94
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,560
and sent the five-shoes to Zhongning Palace.

95
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,560
I don't know about the rest.

96
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,720
You are a man of dirty deeds.

97
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,640
No one else

98
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,600
touched the shoes except you.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,560
If it wasn't you, who else could it be?

100
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,480
Your Highness,

101
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,120
I have no grudge with Concubine Zhao.

102
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,200
Why did you kill Concubine Zhao?

103
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,520
I was wronged.

104
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,400
Your Majesty,

105
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,800
a maid

106
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,240
would kill Concubine Zhao

107
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,760
if no one instructed her.

108
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,560
Please investigate it carefully.

109
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,920
I didn't expect that Chief Steward Wu

110
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,560
would defend a maid.

111
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,600
That's right.

112
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,360
Chief Steward Wu

113
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,520
has been close to this maid.

114
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,600
Could it be that the one who instructed her

115
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,120
was you?

116
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,240
I wouldn't dare to.

117
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,240
Your Majesty,

118
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,080
there are strict records

119
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,240
on the use of knives and sharp knives in the palace.

120
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,160
I can prove my innocence

121
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,400
by checking if I used a blade.

122
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,120
Tao An,

123
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,160
go to the House of Six

124
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,640
to check the records.

125
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,560
Yes.

126
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,840
What if someone else helped you?

127
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,640
Your Highness,

128
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,720
all the new maids

129
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,000
in Chengxi Palace

130
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,800
will not help Ling Yu.

131
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,480
If it's someone else,

132
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,440
it can only be someone from another palace.

133
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,720
Your Highness,

134
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,680
who do you suspect

135
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,160
helped me get the blade

136
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,120
and killed Concubine Zhao?

137
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,320
You're so smart and clever.

138
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,320
How dare you make excuses?

139
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,840
It seems that if I don't send you to the Office of Punishments,

140
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,080
you won't keep on working.

141
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,280
Your Majesty,

142
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,520
it's such a big matter.

143
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,120
It's impossible that a maid

144
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,920
would do it.

145
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,200
You're so anxious to deal with the maid.

146
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,720
Do you want to cover up something?

147
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,880
Why should I send you the hidden weapons

148
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,840
and disturb the Spring Sun Banquet that I personally held?

149
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,080
I'm so grateful to Your Majesty.

150
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,280
Your Majesty, please help me.

151
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,920
Your Majesty,

152
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,040
Concubine Wan is kind-hearted

153
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,080
and close to Concubine Zhao.

154
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,760
Both of you are

155
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,240
very devoted to His Majesty.

156
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,760
I think

157
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,360
someone must have done it

158
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,360
and deliberately destroyed

159
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,840
the relationship between the two concubines.

160
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,080
Now,

161
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,000
there are many people in the palace who want to get the blade.

162
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,720
If they want to find the real murderer immediately,

163
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,760
it's not easy.

164
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,040
In the process,

165
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,160
I'm afraid it will disturb the peace of the masters

166
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,800
and hurt the innocent maids.

167
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,880
I'm willing to share your worries

168
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,960
and be punished to calm this matter.

169
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,200
Your Majesty, please punish me.

170
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,480
Finally, someone knows how to take the blade to me.

171
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,040
Raise your head.

172
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,520
You're punished

173
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,600
and you're willing to take the blade.

174
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
I'll punish you

175
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,760
to go to the new storehouse.

176
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,120
What do you think?

177
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,720
I thank Your Majesty

178
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,320
for not killing me.

179
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,920
You're so mean.

180
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,040
How dare you escape from me?

181
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,520
Be gentle.

182
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,360
Your Highness,

183
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,880
why did you hurt

184
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,400
your own body?

185
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,400
You're badly injured.

186
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,840
His Majesty only punished a servant to go to the new storehouse.

187
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,240
It's really a good deal for Wan Fei.

188
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,760
His Majesty is really protecting her.

189
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,000
Your Highness,

190
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,160
His Majesty still cares about you.

191
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,080
Otherwise,

192
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,360
he wouldn't have sent someone to send the best jade and fushuang.

193
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,240
His Majesty is also afraid that your jade clan

194
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,320
will leave scars.

195
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,480
His Majesty cares about me.

196
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,440
When I'm recovered,

197
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,480
I'll get this bill

198
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,000
back from Wan Fei sooner or later.

199
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,040
Your Highness.

200
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,760
I'm the most vicious servant now.

201
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,520
I'm honored to be sent

202
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,440
to the new storehouse by the Wu Zongguan of the Fourteenth Ya Min.

203
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,880
You're so smart.

204
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,120
You're so stupid and rude in the palace.

205
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,440
I asked you to leave

206
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,120
but you insisted on staying.

207
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,520
Now you're fine.

208
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,760
You've made yourself into the new storehouse.

209
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,640
Your Excellency,

210
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,520
you're underestimating me.

211
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,120
I chose the new storehouse myself.

212
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,840
Your Excellency, you didn't see

213
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,240
His Majesty's expression at that time.

214
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,720
Both of you were so unyielding.

215
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,360
His Majesty was just one step away.

216
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
I gave it to Di Guo.

217
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,960
I saved his life and saved his life.

218
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,680
He even asked me to get off Wan Fei's back.

219
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,760
I underestimated you.

220
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
You're so scheming.

221
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,320
But

222
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,600
you should know

223
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,760
you're not always so lucky.

224
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,280
God made you fall.

225
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,160
Maybe he's just telling you

226
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,640
not to keep going.

227
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,120
I won't give up.

228
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Even if I fall, I'll get up.

229
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,080
Even if I get injured,

230
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,560
I won't be afraid.

231
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Because I have something important to do.

232
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,480
Your Excellency,

233
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,880
do you have any family outside the palace?

234
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
I have a sister.

235
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,440
I also have a brother.

236
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,080
But he's been missing for many years.

237
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,080
I don't even know if he's alive or dead.

238
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,440
How is he doing?

239
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,360
I don't want to be your brother.

240
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,280
What?

241
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,120
Nothing.

242
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,160
Let's go back to the palace.

243
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,360
Hurry up.

244
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,120
It's not good to be late

245
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,520
if we go back to Xinzhekong.

246
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,720
Take good care of that scoundrel

247
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,640
for Her Highness.

248
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,480
Of course, you'll get what you deserve.

249
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,520
Well...

250
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,920
Thank you. Thank you.

251
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,000
Ling Yun.

252
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,080
You're lucky to get back your life in the daytime.

253
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,040
But when you enter Xinzhekong,

254
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,440
it's as simple as

255
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,360
pinching a mule.

256
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,800
Thank you for reminding me.

257
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,680
Although mules are small,

258
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,400
I've never heard that

259
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,760
all mules in the world

260
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,120
are cleaned.

261
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,160
I'm not someone

262
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,760
who can be pinched to death.

263
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,560
You're so sharp-tongued.

264
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,160
Look who's here.

265
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,600
Isn't that the dog beside Her Highness?

266
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,720
What?

267
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,240
Did you get kicked out?

268
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Cuiwei.

269
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,000
The prison in Xinzhekong

270
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,640
still hasn't fixed your bad habit.

271
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,600
Ling Yun.

272
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,200
You got us into Xinzhekong.

273
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,680
Now you're here too.

274
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,800
What a good chance!

275
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,800
Just you wait.

276
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,240
I won't let you off.

277
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,400
You're here.

278
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,600
You're here.

279
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,600
You're here.

280
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,400
You're here.

281
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,000
You're here.

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're here.

283
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,960
You

284
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,600
can stay in this room.

285
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,120
Let's go.

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,600
Ruyi.

287
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Why are you here?

288
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
Who let you out?

289
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,000
The rule of Xinzhekong

290
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,600
is to be locked up for one night.

291
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,800
I didn't do anything wrong.

292
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,600
Eunuch Gao wanted my mother

293
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
to keep the jade bracelet for me.

294
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,000
I'd rather die than give it to her.

295
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,200
She said

296
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,600
I ruined her clothes.

297
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
She locked me up here

298
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,200
without saying anything.

299
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
You're a bitch.

300
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,600
How dare you beat Eunuch Gao?

301
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
How dare you beat Eunuch Gao?

302
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,800
Cuiwei.

303
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,400
You're a maid.

304
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,400
Isn't Xinzhekong

305
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,600
under the rule of the palace rules?

306
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,000
Look.

307
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,600
You're so smart.

308
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm the palace rule

309
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,600
here.

310
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Take her down.
