1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,800
You bitch!

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,240
I'll see where you run to this time.

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,880
May you be blessed with good health.

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:28,800
Li Yun,

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,760
I really admire your courage.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,360
I'm afraid there's no one else in the whole harem

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,200
who dares to do it more than you.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,120
Your Highness,

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,680
I'm just a servant.

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,840
I do what I should do.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,200
I'm not ashamed to do what you said.

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,720
Stop pretending.

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,960
You really know how to choose a place.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,400
No one will disturb you in the rainy day.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,480
This place is too suitable for you to do evil things.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,680
Today Zhuo Jian is pretending.

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,040
I'll see how you can resist.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,960
Zhuo Jian?

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,800
Your Highness, you misunderstood.

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,920
I didn't misunderstand anyone.

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,920
You're still stubborn even though you're dead.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:04,840
Shuangxi,

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,240
open the curtain for me.

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,560
I want to see

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,640
who the bitch is.

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,280
Yes.

29
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,440
No need.

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,800
I'm the bitch you said.

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,480
Your Majesty.

32
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,480
Why isn't it my brother?

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,320
It's raining.

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,880
Thank you for your hard work.

35
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,320
Concubine Zhao, you dare to catch me?

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,880
Your Majesty, I dare not.

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,520
I'm afraid there's a misunderstanding.

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,360
Misunderstanding?

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,000
I think you're deliberately embarrassing me.

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,160
Your Majesty,

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,720
how dare you give me this?

42
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,120
I dare not command you to rebuild the palace.

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,320
I really don't know you.

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,000
Please forgive me.

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,320
There are still

46
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,680
your brothers and sisters in the harem

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,000
who dare not to command.

48
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,440
Your Majesty, please calm down.

49
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,000
I know my fault.

50
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,800
Please calm down.

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,120
Send my order.

52
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,040
From now on,

53
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,640
I'll confer the title of Noble Lady

54
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,200
to the Yongxiu Palace.

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
I accept the decree.

56
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,720
Thank you for your grace.

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,680
I'll keep the palace rules

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
and do my best to serve Your Majesty.

59
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,160
Concubine Zhao, you've committed a crime.

60
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,200
You're disrespected.

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,120
You're promoted to Noble Lady.

62
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,880
You'll be punished to return to the Central Palace

63
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,160
to offer your condolences.

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,960
I...

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,640
I accept the decree.

66
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,800
You're a bitch.

67
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,080
You've been tricked again.

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,960
Your Majesty.

69
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,720
Zhao Wansong,

70
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
do you know your crime?

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,040
Your Majesty,

72
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,520
I'm afraid.

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,600
I don't know what crime I committed.

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,120
Wulin Prefecture Office, tell him.

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

76
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,800
The Ten-Fourth Office caught

77
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,440
Su Hebalu, the guard of the Imperial Court of Taiping Gate,

78
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,920
and the chief eunuch of Chengxi Palace

79
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,360
to communicate with each other.

80
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,560
After interrogation,

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,320
Su Hebalu admitted that

82
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,040
during his patrol,

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,760
he often sent messages

84
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,600
to the two bridesmaids of the two concubines

85
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,880
of Chengxi Palace and Zhongning Palace

86
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,840
on behalf of General Zhao.

87
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,200
The court officials

88
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,240
are closely in contact with the concubines of the harem.

89
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,720
As a high-ranking official,

90
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,760
your sisters live in the harem.

91
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,200
You disobey the palace rules and break the law.

92
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,920
Do you want to collude with the outside

93
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,080
and disturb the court?

94
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
You told me

95
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,200
that you don't know what crime you committed.

96
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,760
Your Majesty, I'm innocent.

97
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,320
I contacted my brother.

98
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,200
I just sent him a message to greet each other.

99
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,720
I didn't mean to collude with him.

100
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,280
Please investigate it carefully.

101
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,600
I know my fault.

102
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,800
I'm just worried that

103
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,520
my sisters live in the harem and miss their families.

104
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,960
I sometimes tell them about the death of my family

105
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,600
to ease their grief.

106
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,560
I dare not collude with the harem

107
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,720
and disturb the court.

108
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,480
Your Majesty, please investigate it carefully.

109
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,400
If so,

110
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,200
do you really need to be so secretive?

111
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,400
Zhao Wansong violated the palace rules

112
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,960
and tried to break the law.

113
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,400
Considering his military achievements,

114
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,720
he was punished by the Qing Dynasty.

115
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,320
He went to the Zongren Mansion

116
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,400
to receive 80 accounts.

117
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,840
He was punished by the Qing Dynasty for a year

118
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,080
and was exiled.

119
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,120
Concubine Wan ignored the palace rules

120
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,160
and did nothing.

121
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,120
Punish him for being confined in the Palace of Chengxi

122
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,400
and reflecting on his mistakes.

123
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,680
If he makes any mistakes,

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,920
he will be punished severely.

125
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,760
I will obey your order.

126
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,480
Your Majesty.

127
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,120
You are really good.

128
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,360
Since the day you entered the Palace of Chengxi,

129
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,280
everything has been in your plan.

130
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,960
Just you wait.

131
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,960
Concubine Wan

132
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,080
can continue to be so angry.

133
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,880
If one day someone steps on your feet,

134
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,880
you won't have a chance to be so arrogant.

135
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,960
Lingyun,

136
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
please protect your life.

137
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,240
You will never have a chance

138
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,520
to step on my head.

139
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,920
I want to know

140
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,200
if I have a chance.

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,480
Lingyun,

142
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,120
don't be rude to Concubine Wan.

143
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,400
General Zhao,

144
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,280
before you talk to me,

145
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,520
you should call me

146
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,960
Concubine Yun first.

147
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,040
His Majesty was caught

148
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,920
as the spy

149
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,000
who met Lingyun at the meeting.

150
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,440
His Majesty was angry

151
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,560
and then

152
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,160
he appointed Lingyun as the concubine.

153
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,080
Lingyun

154
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,680
really didn't let me down.

155
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,200
The previous court and the harem

156
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,240
were all turned upside down by him.

157
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,360
Your Highness,

158
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,920
you have guessed

159
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,800
that Lingyun

160
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,040
can handle Concubine Wan

161
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
and Concubine Zhao.

162
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,200
The harem is so boring every day.

163
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,840
It's hard for her to think of

164
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,040
so many tricks.

165
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,680
Not only His Majesty likes her,

166
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,080
I like her very much too.

167
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,040
Not only the Zhao sisters

168
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,920
were caught in the trap,

169
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,160
General Zhao

170
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,440
was also caught in the trap.

171
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,200
Lingyun

172
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,680
is really a good student.

173
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,400
Lingyun's good knife

174
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,760
has just been used.

175
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,280
The good show is still to come.

176
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,280
Ling muốn

177
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,000
You have come to your wishful thinking.

178
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,640
From now on,

179
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,800
you will be my servant in the palace.

180
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,880
I'm just a noble girl.

181
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,320
I just have a beginning.

182
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,160
What I want

183
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,880
is above and below the number of people.

184
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,840
In this harem,

185
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,880
don't be too busy.

186
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,760
In the future, you'll only see more

187
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,680
when you're watching.

188
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,600
You need to be careful

189
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,960
and don't do whatever you want.

190
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,880
People live

191
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,760
to live happily.

192
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,040
I've been living

193
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,320
so carelessly until now.

194
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,520
You're so lucky.

195
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,000
You can't predict the future.

196
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,280
Do you think

197
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,120
His Majesty won't be suspicious

198
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,960
of you arresting His Majesty

199
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,360
with the help of the Zhao sisters?

200
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,640
His Majesty just wants to take this opportunity

201
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,840
to beat General Zhao and the Zhao sisters

202
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,360
and stop pursuing you.

203
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,000
The seed of suspicion in His Majesty's heart

204
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,240
will sprout and sprout

205
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,120
as time goes by.

206
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,000
It may kill you at any time.

207
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,480
Thank you for your advice, Mr. Wu.

208
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,200
I have no way back.

209
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,800
I'll avenge my parents.

210
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,400
Now I've given up my freedom

211
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,720
and become His Majesty's woman.

212
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,480
Sir,

213
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,360
are you willing to help me?

214
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,360
What do you think I am?

215
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,600
A woman who knows when to come and when to go.

216
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,880
I treat you as my closest friend.

217
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,800
What if I don't want to be your friend?

218
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,920
How is my tällic y?

219
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,680
What will become our future relationship?

220
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,240
With someone else?

221
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,560
Mr. Wu.

222
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:30,400
Since when have you Pues Gilbert

223
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,040
met you?

224
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
May everything go well.

225
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

226
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,400
Greetings, Lady Yun.

227
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,320
His Majesty has specially presented a treasure for Lady Yun.

228
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
I'm here to congratulate Lady Yun.

229
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,640
Congratulations, Lady Yun,

230
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,120
for entering Yongxiu Palace.

231
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,680
Congratulations, Lady Yun.

232
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,320
Congratulations, Lady Yun.

233
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,160
You may rise.

234
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,440
You may rise.

235
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,560
This is the palace maid, Fu Xiang,

236
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,640
that Lady Yun specially asked for.

237
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,840
She will serve you from now on.

238
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,280
Greetings, Lady Yun.

239
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,280
You may rise.

240
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,560
Come here.

241
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,560
All these maids

242
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,760
are staying in Yongxiu Palace.

243
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,680
You must serve Lady Yun well from now on.

244
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,640
You must be obedient.

245
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,600
The one who breaks the rules will be punished.

246
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,080
I will obey your order.

247
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,120
I will serve you well.

248
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,920
Lady Yun,

249
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,080
I'll take my leave.

250
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,360
It's not easy to live in the harem.

251
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,400
Now I've entered Yongxiu Palace.

252
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,080
There are many eyes

253
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,160
staring at us

254
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,160
and hoping that we'll make mistakes.

255
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,240
But as long as I'm here,

256
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,880
someone will protect you.

257
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,480
You'll have a place

258
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
to rest in the harem.

259
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,840
Please support the harem

260
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,720
with me.

261
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,080
We'll help you

262
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,600
with our best efforts.

263
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,720
Thank you, Lady Yun.

264
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,480
I will be loyal

265
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,800
and never give up.

266
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,160
Lady Yun, you're so kind to us.

267
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,720
We'll be grateful to you

268
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,600
for your trust.

269
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,040
You may rise.

270
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
You may go to your rooms.

271
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,360
Yes.
