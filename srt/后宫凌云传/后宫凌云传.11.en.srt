1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Consort Jing, how is this pill?

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How is it?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not good at medicine.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I dare not say much.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Please call the imperial physician

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to check it.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's okay if Consort Jing has something to say.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Your Majesty,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I think this pill

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
is a forbidden pill in the palace.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Forbidden pill?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I just need to replenish my blood.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Isn't it too late?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I don't know, Your Highness.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I only know that you need this pill,

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
so I learned to give it to you.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How dare you!

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
When did I need this forbidden pill?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
How dare you slander me!

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I dare not!

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I dare not, Your Highness.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This pill is Ling Yun's, not mine.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Ling Yun took this pill to please Your Highness.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I also want to ask for a favor.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So I stole his pill

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and came to give it to Your Highness.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I really dare not harm Your Highness.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's Ling Yun again.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Men, bring Ling Yun here to ask questions.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
May Your Highness be blessed with good health.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Get up.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Did you get the pill

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that the maid gave to Consort Wan?

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Your Majesty,

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't know about this pill.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I only know that

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Cuiwei

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
was with Aunt Sun

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
in the herbal medicine bureau.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Then I exposed Aunt Sun.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Cuiwei was also punished to go to the new department.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Since then,

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
she has been hating me.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
She wants revenge.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Ling Yun,

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
you're not telling the truth in front of His Majesty.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You said Consort Wan was looking for this pill.

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This is obviously a gift

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
that you prepared for Consort Wan.

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
For Consort Wan?

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Where does this come from?

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What does Consort Wan need?

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This forbidden pill.

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Cuiwei,

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Consort Wan is a noble consort.

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
How could you violate the palace rules

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and use this to nourish the palace?

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You can frame me.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But you still want to slander Her Highness

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and ruin Her Highness's reputation.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Please forgive me.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I've always been loyal to you.

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I didn't want to slander you.

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
How dare you!

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
His Majesty is slandering his colleague.

71
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What crime should you be guilty of?

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Chief Steward Wu,

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
do you think this scoundrel

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
is slandering me?

75
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Please calm down, Your Highness.

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If he really slanders Consort Wan,

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
His Majesty will be punished for his death.

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Your Majesty!

79
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Your Majesty,

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I have something to report.

81
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Consort Wan...

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Consort Wan only sent

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Eunuch Shuiqi

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
to order me to kill Mingyu.

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
After the promise was made,

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
she took me out of the clinic.

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Before I poisoned her,

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I was discovered by the criminal Ruyi.

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Consort Wan ordered me

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
to kill Ruyi and silence her.

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I've confessed all my crimes.

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But this forbidden pill

93
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
really has nothing to do with me, Your Majesty.

94
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Please forgive me.

95
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I was also forced to do so.

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Your Majesty!

97
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Your Majesty!

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm a bloodthirsty person, Your Majesty.

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I've never seen her in private.

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm not good at killing people.

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Please investigate this carefully.

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Your Majesty,

103
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm a high-ranking consort.

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,880
How could I be involved in this kind of

105
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,000
slanderous servant?

106
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm innocent.

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm a maid.

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Although my status is low,

109
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm still a noble woman.

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The order of the harem

111
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
prohibits the murder of maids.

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're killing maids.

113
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
How could you

114
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
do this to the people?

115
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Your Majesty,

116
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
this bitch slanders me.

117
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
She's trying to frame me up.

118
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If there's a real evidence,

119
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm willing to fight with her with my life.

120
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Please clear my name.

121
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Please give me a good reward.

122
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Your Majesty,

123
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I've already pointed out the murderer.

124
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Please help me

125
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
to uphold justice for the dead maid.

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Your Majesty,

127
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I remember

128
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
that a few days ago,

129
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Consort Wan took the maids

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
of Chengxi Palace to the new maid's room.

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
She was so angry that

132
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
she wanted to cut Lingyun's tongue.

133
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think

134
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Consort Wan hates

135
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
this maid.

136
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Consort Wan,

137
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
what do you mean?

138
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Enough.

139
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Consort Wan,

140
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll trust you

141
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
since I allow you to assist the harem.

142
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
These maids

143
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
should be taught well.

144
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You should handle this.

145
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes.

146
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

147
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll take good care of

148
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
these maids.

149
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This maid

150
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
is narrow-minded

151
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and sharp-tongued.

152
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
She's a playboy.

153
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Let her come to the imperial study.

154
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll teach her a lesson for you.

155
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Your Majesty.

156
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Your Majesty.

157
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Lingyun,

158
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I have to admit

159
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
that you're better.

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I didn't expect you to leave the new maid's room first.

161
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Cuiwei,

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I've sent you

163
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the last batch of maids a few days ago.

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're good at teaching.

165
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Why don't you prepare

166
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
your future career?

167
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You...

168
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You need to prepare your future career.

169
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Don't think

170
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
you can do anything

171
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
if you're not in the imperial study.

172
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're a half-man, half-wolf.

173
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Haven't you heard of it?

174
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Cuiwei,

175
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Ruyi is my friend.

176
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You killed her.

177
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Do you think I'll let you go?

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The murder scene has been here since ancient times.

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is the heaven's gift.

180
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I've reminded you

181
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
that if I send the medicine out,

182
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
it can help me get out of the new maid's room.

183
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But if it's you,

184
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
you'll lose your life.

185
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Do you think I'm kidding?

186
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You knew

187
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
that I killed Ruyi.

188
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Ruyi.

189
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Ruyi.

190
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Ruyi.

191
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Ruyi.

192
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Ruyi.

193
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Ruyi.

194
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Ruyi.

195
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Ruyi.

196
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Ruyi.

197
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Eunuch Shunxi.

198
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll give you

199
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
all my money.

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll follow you from now on.

201
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Please ask for my help

202
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
in front of Her Highness.

203
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I promise

204
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
that in the future,

205
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
you'll be alone.

206
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Whatever you ask me to do,

207
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll do it.

208
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I won't break my promise.

209
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Miss Cuiwei.

210
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Your life is

211
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Her Highness' life.

212
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I can't afford it.

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I've brought you

214
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
some gifts for Her Highness.

215
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Here.

216
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Take a look.

217
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Get on the road.

218
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Your Majesty.

219
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm guilty.

220
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What crime?

221
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I bullied Your Majesty.

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I hate him very much.

223
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You're a little self-conscious.

224
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You know you hate him.

225
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I got that forbidden medicine

226
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
from Her Highness' palace.

227
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Her Highness

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
probably knew that

229
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I found her stealing the forbidden medicine

230
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
to get favor.

231
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So she wanted to kill me.

232
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
She tried to make me suffer.

233
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
She used the forbidden medicine to get favor.

234
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I know that.

235
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But you designed the little maid

236
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
to steal the forbidden medicine

237
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
from the imperial garden.

238
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You made the palace restless.

239
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You're so bold.

240
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Your Majesty is wise.

241
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So Your Majesty already knew

242
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
that Her Highness planned to steal the forbidden medicine.

243
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You also know that

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I used a trick.

245
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
At the Spring Banquet,

246
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
you almost lost your life

247
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
by stealing the sword of the five evil spirits.

248
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I saw you were deaf and dumb.

249
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I saved your life.

250
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I took you out

251
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and sent you to the new storehouse.

252
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I thought you would be calm.

253
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I didn't expect that you didn't know the truth

254
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and dared to plot against me.

255
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I think you're really sick of living.

256
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I deserve to die.

257
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But Your Majesty,

258
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm thinking

259
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
if I die because

260
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Her Highness used the forbidden medicine,

261
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
it would be a disgrace to the imperial family.

262
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So my death

263
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
can't be related to Her Highness.

264
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It can't be related to the forbidden medicine.

265
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Please give me

266
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
a good death

267
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that is fresh and decent.

268
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Are you using the reputation of the imperial family

269
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
to make fun of me?

270
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I dare not.

271
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Then kneel here and think about it.

272
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Think about a new death

273
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
that I haven't seen before.

274
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

275
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You've been kneeling for a day.

276
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
How's the new death plan?

277
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Your Majesty,

278
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I dare not say.

279
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You're not afraid of death.

280
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You dare not say.

281
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Soldiers fight to protect the country.

282
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm here to

283
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
benefit the people.

284
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The doctor's forbidden herbs

285
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
are to save the dead and heal the wounds.

286
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
These people let me admire them.

287
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Although I'm just a little maid,

288
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I want to do something useful

289
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
so that I can die.

290
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Lingyun,

291
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
you dare to compare yourself

292
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
with soldiers to protect the country

293
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and the officials to protect the people.

294
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You've never seen a shameless person

295
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
as shameless as you.

296
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Your Majesty,

297
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I know

298
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm not worthy of comparing myself

299
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
with those loyal officials and doctors.

300
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But Your Majesty,

301
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
some officials

302
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
are too proud

303
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
to remember

304
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
the grace that you gave them.

305
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Of course,

306
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I should

307
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
punish them.

308
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
How dare you,

309
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Lingyun,

310
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
defame the country

311
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and the officials.

312
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's a death penalty.

313
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If my death

314
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
can help you,

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll be able to die.

316
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Thank you, Your Majesty,

317
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
for giving me

318
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
such a good death plan.

319
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Do you think

320
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
this death plan is fresh?

321
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Fresh?

322
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's really fresh

323
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
to say that

324
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
your life is so important.

325
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
His Majesty

326
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Aiya,

327
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
you're really getting onwards.

328
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You can't even

329
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
deal with a palace maid.

330
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I heard that

331
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,200
you almost got caught

332
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,000
by Jin Yao's Ilsar yesterday.

333
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I see

334
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,500
that you've not been

335
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,000
the indicators of Her Majesty

336
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
for a long time,

337
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
you've forgotten

338
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
what we came into the palace to do.

339
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
My Lord,

340
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
of course,

341
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,200
Can you keep your position?

342
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
How dare you!

343
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,320
Even if that scoundrel Lin Yun goes to jail,

344
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,120
he won't be a threat to us.

345
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,520
Didn't I return to the court as a teacher?

346
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,920
His Majesty is holding a celebration banquet.

347
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,320
You can watch it.

348
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,720
I will make that scoundrel Lin Yun

349
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,600
die a terrible death.

350
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,400
Don't say it so early.

351
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,920
The whole harem

352
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,520
is waiting to see your joke.
