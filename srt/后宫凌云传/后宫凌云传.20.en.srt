1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Shunxi.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
My Lady.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Just now, the Consort of Wanyan

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
hit me again.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
When will you

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
give up on me?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are just like this.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We followed the wrong Master.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let's wait and see.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Shunxi.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Lord Wu.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You've been acting strangely lately.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Why have you been avoiding me?

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm different from your status.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If we meet by chance,

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that I'll be criticized

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
by someone I like.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I know.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You don't like me.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I always provoke you.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're so smart.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Didn't you notice that

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
you often target me?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
His Majesty has already been unhappy.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Between you and me,

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
His Majesty is suspicious.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
For your sake,

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
we'd better avoid each other

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and avoid each other.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So, you're avoiding me

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
because of this.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Consort Wan has been

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
highly favored in the palace.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
She has a great foundation.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
She can protect the palace

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and kill many people.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
These things

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
show that she's not simple.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
More importantly,

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
His Majesty's favor

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
can't be touched by anyone.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What are you doing?

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Consort Wan has been away for a day.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Lingyun's parents' grudges

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
can't be avenged.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The palace's servants

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
can't rest in peace for a day.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Lingyun must

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
take Consort Wan

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
to the palace.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll make her

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
be punished

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
for her crimes.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Your Grace,

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
believe me.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I've set up

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the Heavenly King for Consort Wan.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
She won't have a good life.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You didn't

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
listen to me at all.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Please help me.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If we

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
don't take her back,

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
more innocent people

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
will die

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
under her control.

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
His Majesty

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
doesn't want to

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
be involved with the Zhao family.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He won't touch Consort Wan for now.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If we

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
act rashly

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and lose our lives,

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
it's very likely that it's you.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Promise me.

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't move

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and remember it.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Come.

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're here.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What's the matter?

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I have something to ask you.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I remember

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
you were only ten years old

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
when we first met.

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You were the heir

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
of your family.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You followed me

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
when I entered the palace.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's been

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
so many years

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
since then.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're now

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
the head

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
of the Fourteenth Gate

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
that everyone respects.

99
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But since I entered the palace,

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
you've been

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
very close to me.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I thought

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
you didn't need me anymore.

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Your Grace, you're joking.

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Your Grace, you're joking.

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I can't forget

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
your kindness to me.

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's my fortune

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
to have your company

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
when I was young.

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't dare to trouble you again.

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Tell me.

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What's the matter

114
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
that you're here today?

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're the head

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
of the Fourteenth Gate.

117
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can't solve it.

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I want to ask you

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
to help Lady Yun.

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Lady Yun.

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You've always been

122
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
a man of your own.

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You never

124
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
let your power

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
to fight in the harem down.

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Now,

127
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
you're going to be in the game.

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I want to know

129
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
if you're doing this

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
for Lady Yun

131
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
or for the woman

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
you love.

133
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Both.

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're still so honest.

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But she's now

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
the emperor's woman.

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I know.

138
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So,

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
it's only because you helped her

140
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
that everything went smoothly.

141
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Only you have the power

142
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
to defeat Concubine Wan.

143
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
As long as you're willing to help,

144
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and tell her not to risk her life,

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm willing

146
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
to exchange everything for her.

147
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Please, Your Grace,

148
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
grant me my wish.

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I spent a lot of effort

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
to find the body

151
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
of Zhao Yanwan

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
when he was a horse rider.

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I have a condition.

154
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Think about it.

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
After you take this body,

156
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
you can't stand

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
what I do,

158
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
what you can't do,

159
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and what you hate.

160
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll let you do everything.

161
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I want you to be

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
the same person as me.

163
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But then,

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
you can't be

165
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
a clean person anymore.

166
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Think about it first.

167
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Come to me when you've made up your mind.

168
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Come to me when you've made up your mind.

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Greetings, My Lady.

170
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Get up.

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Why didn't you come to see me recently?

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't worry, My Lady.

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The time has not yet come.

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I've already met Consort Jing.

175
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why did you go to see Consort Jing?

176
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Consort Jing is an old lady in the palace.

177
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
She knows about the concubines in the palace.

178
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's a good breakthrough

179
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
to deal with Consort Jing.

180
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Didn't you promise me

181
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
that you would stay still

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and take action?

183
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The time has not yet come.

184
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You must not act rashly.

185
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Time?

186
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
When is the right time?

187
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Do I have to sit still?

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
My Lady,

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
hatred is like a fire.

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Before it burns others,

191
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
it will burn your heart

192
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
into a thousand holes.

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If you're obsessed with hatred,

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
you'll live in the past

195
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and can't get rid of it.

196
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I have no way out.

197
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's either he dies or I die.

198
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I have nothing to worry about.

199
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If you insist on doing so,

200
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
don't blame me for being unable to do anything.

201
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's okay.

202
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I was born from a dead man's pile.

203
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm a rotten girl.

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Even if you don't help me,

205
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
even if I'm a thousand miles away,

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm willing

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
to take a step towards it.

208
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If you're going to

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
stand aside today,

210
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
if I die one day,

211
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I hope you won't regret

212
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
your decision

213
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
for today.

214
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
My Lady, please take care.

215
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I have something to do.

216
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll take my leave.

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Your Highness, please take care.

218
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You're getting more and more handsome.

219
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
In this palace,

220
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
if you dare to force me to be beautiful,

221
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
you'll be ruined.

222
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Say something.

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
My Lady,

224
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
we...

225
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We didn't do anything illegal.

226
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Please have mercy on us.

227
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We're willing to do anything for Your Highness.

228
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We beg Your Highness to spare our lives.

229
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Your Highness.

230
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You're a cow and a horse.

231
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A horse can't grow

232
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
such a seductive face.

233
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What a youthful and lovely face!

234
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's really eye-catching.

235
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You're all laughing at me, right?

236
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's because of your existence

237
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
that you've been reminding me

238
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
that I'm old

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and that I'm no longer being favored.

240
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's all your fault.

241
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's all your fault!

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You can't get away from it!

243
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's all your fault!

244
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's all your fault!

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Your Highness.

246
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Aunt Jiang,

247
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
touch my face.

248
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Your Highness, you're too kind.

249
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Your Highness is a noble lady.

250
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
How can I touch your face?

251
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Why do I feel

252
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
that my face

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
is getting rougher?

254
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's not as smooth as before.

255
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Your Highness,

256
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
the palace is very beautiful.

257
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The flowers in the imperial garden

258
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
are all lost in front of you.

259
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Your Highness,

260
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
you're worrying too much.

261
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
His Majesty has arrived!

262
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
May Your Majesty be blessed with good health.

264
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Rise.

265
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Your Majesty

266
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
hasn't visited me for a long time.

267
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I thought Your Majesty

268
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
was angry with me.

269
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Your Majesty.

270
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I've been busy with state affairs lately.

271
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I've neglected you.

272
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Time flies.

273
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Time flies.

274
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
My beloved consort

275
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
has been out of the palace for a lifetime.

276
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Your Majesty,

277
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I've been working too hard recently.

278
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Your consort has been working too hard.

279
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You should rest more.

280
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I have something to do.

281
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I have to go to Yongxiu Palace.

282
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'll talk to you another day.

283
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Your Majesty.

284
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Go to Yongxiu Palace.

285
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You damn servant!

286
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Didn't you say that

287
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I was too tired of the harem?

288
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What are you doing?

289
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Why did Your Majesty go to Yongxiu Palace?

290
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I deserve to die.

291
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I deserve to die.

292
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Your Majesty.

293
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Your Ladyship.

294
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Shunxi and I are here together.

295
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Your Ladyship.

296
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Shunxi is tortured by Consort Wan.

297
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
She can't stand it anymore.

298
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Please, Your Ladyship.

299
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Please save me.

300
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll do my best

301
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
to report to Your Ladyship.

302
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Get up.

303
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Lingzhu has told me

304
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
that as long as you work hard,

305
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll keep you safe.

306
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

307
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Your Ladyship.

308
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Your Ladyship, what is this?

309
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You have to protect yourself tonight.

310
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Use this pig blood

311
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
to disguise as human blood

312
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and bathe Consort Wan.

313
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Your Ladyship.

314
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But the blood will be solidified after a long time.

315
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If Consort Wan finds out,

316
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
she'll kill me.

317
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
There's grass and dust in the pig blood.

318
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It won't be solidified.

319
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Your Ladyship, it can't be.

320
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The blood is a little smelly.

321
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
This way, it can be solidified.

322
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

323
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Your Ladyship, you're so generous.

324
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'll never forget it.

325
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's not time to thank you.

326
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Get up.

327
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Your Ladyship.

328
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Your Ladyship.
