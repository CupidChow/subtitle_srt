1
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,014
I don’t think I can handle it

2
00:00:07,014 --> 00:00:08,213
if both of you

3
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:09,014
are together again.

4
00:00:09,014 --> 00:00:10,514
Does she love you?

5
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:11,514
I’ve never asked about it.

6
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:12,514
I’m afraid of the answer.

7
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:15,014
And she’s never said that.

8
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,014
You also know

9
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:18,014
your true feelings.

10
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:19,814
Don’t forget to let her know.

11
00:00:19,814 --> 00:00:21,913
I’m sorry.

12
00:00:21,913 --> 00:00:23,713
I don’t know what I should do.

13
00:00:23,713 --> 00:00:25,014
No matter which one I choose,

14
00:00:25,014 --> 00:00:27,014
there’ll always be one who will be disappointed.

15
00:00:27,014 --> 00:00:27,814
Loft,

16
00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:29,514
please don’t be quiet.

17
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:35,514
I really want to talk to you.

18
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:36,913
Right now, the pool villas on the east

19
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:39,014
are now 90% complete.

20
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:40,514
The electricity system is being rechecked.

21
00:00:40,514 --> 00:00:42,514
They’ll be ready for service next week.

22
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:43,714
Well, it sounds good.

23
00:00:43,714 --> 00:00:45,514
So, please you recheck everything

24
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:47,014
for readiness.

25
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:49,014
Sure.

26
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:50,014
Hi, there.

27
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:51,014
How are things?

28
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:52,514
The functional design is really good.

29
00:00:52,514 --> 00:00:54,014
I like everything here.

30
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:57,014
Well, I’ll bring customers here for a seminar.

31
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:58,714
Uh.

32
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:00,514
Hey! That big vase is awesome.

33
00:01:00,514 --> 00:01:05,813
Where did you get it from?

34
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:07,813
From Pure.

35
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:09,014
Oh!

36
00:01:09,014 --> 00:01:11,014
Again, from your beloved lady.

37
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:13,014
Well, your facial expression

38
00:01:13,014 --> 00:01:18,313
is telling me you can’t overcome it, huh?

39
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:19,514
Oh my gosh!

40
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:20,514
How is that possible?

41
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:21,514
Is it real?

42
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,813
Really?

43
00:01:22,813 --> 00:01:26,514
I’ve seen only you asking to break up with others.

44
00:01:26,514 --> 00:01:29,014
And haven’t you guys talked to each other?

45
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:30,514
Um.

46
00:01:30,514 --> 00:01:31,514
But,

47
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:33,514
being like this

48
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:34,514
might be good.

49
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:35,514
Are you sure?

50
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:36,014
Umm.

51
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:38,014
Are you doing good?

52
00:01:39,014 --> 00:01:41,014
I don’t believe you.

53
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:45,813
Before I could finish speaking.

54
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:48,014
Are you alright?

55
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:49,514
Are you okay?

56
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:50,014
Yes, I am.

57
00:01:50,014 --> 00:01:51,014
I don’t think so.

58
00:01:51,014 --> 00:01:52,014
So pale like this.

59
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:53,514
Do you eat enough?

60
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,514
Yes.

61
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:57,514
Go take a rest!

62
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:58,514
You keep saying you’re okay,

63
00:01:58,514 --> 00:02:00,514
but your physical body says no.

64
00:02:00,514 --> 00:02:03,014
Alright, I’m taking a rest now, Mom.

65
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:05,014
You must.

66
00:02:05,014 --> 00:02:06,514
Well, Ploy!

67
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:09,514
Please supervise the tasks here also.

68
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:11,014
And …

69
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:13,514
Please tell Sis. Orn

70
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:15,014
if Pure calls,

71
00:02:15,014 --> 00:02:17,814
tell her I’m not in.

72
00:02:17,814 --> 00:02:19,014
Okay.

73
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:19,713
Thank you.
What?!

74
00:02:19,713 --> 00:02:20,514
Why?!

75
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:22,014
What happened?

76
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:22,814
Tell me now.

77
00:02:22,814 --> 00:02:25,514
Share me what’s happened.

78
00:03:09,914 --> 00:03:10,814
If she’s been making you

79
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:12,514
this much indecisive,

80
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:16,014
what’s else can it be, huh?

81
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:18,814
I haven’t been able to reach her for a week.

82
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:20,014
Umm.

83
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:22,514
Or…

84
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:24,514
she’s dated someone else?

85
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:26,014
Not too fast, huh?

86
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:27,014
What?!

87
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:28,814
When you guys had an instant spark into each other,

88
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:30,514
it didn’t take so long.

89
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:33,014
Umm.

90
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:34,014
Hey, Pure!

91
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,014
You’ve never been like this before.

92
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:38,814
You’ve never let yourself dive deep down like this.

93
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:40,514
Is she that special?

94
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:41,014
Umm.

95
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:43,014
What do you mean?

96
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,014
She’s all good.

97
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:45,514
And …

98
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:49,514
have you been feeling happier?

99
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:53,014
As she makes me happier than I used to be,

100
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:55,014
things

101
00:03:55,014 --> 00:03:57,014
have been so big like this.

102
00:03:57,014 --> 00:04:00,514
She hasn’t contacted you for a week like this.

103
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:02,514
What will you do after this?

104
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:04,014
Or shall you try being abnormal?

105
00:04:04,014 --> 00:04:05,514
You don’t choose

106
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:07,014
but look for a new one to replace.

107
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,014
Well, it sounds good to me.

108
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:11,514
Or will you return to Air?

109
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:13,014
Are you nuts?

110
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:15,514
I’ve hurt her that hard.

111
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:17,514
If we came back,

112
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:19,514
how could she trust me?

113
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:21,514
Aw!

114
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:22,514
I think

115
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:24,014
you’d better stop blaming yourself

116
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,014
about Air.

117
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:27,514
The fact is that

118
00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:28,514
you are

119
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:30,014
in love with the new one

120
00:04:30,014 --> 00:04:32,014
after breaking up with Air.

121
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:34,014
Logically speaking,

122
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:35,014
I think

123
00:04:35,014 --> 00:04:38,014
You didn’t do anything wrong.

124
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:40,514
No. It can be wrong

125
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,514
if you know who that person is.

126
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:46,014
You might be changing your thoughts.

127
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:51,014
What do you mean?

128
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:52,014
Hah?

129
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:54,014
Loft’s dating you

130
00:04:54,014 --> 00:04:57,014
who is her sister-in-law ex-girlfriend, really?

131
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:58,514
Air!?

132
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:01,514
Umm.

133
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:02,514
Umm.

134
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:06,014
Maybe, it might be fine.

135
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,514
Well,

136
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:09,014
it might be sound,

137
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:12,014
but it’s not 100% correct. You know?

138
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:14,514
What about Air? Does she know this?

139
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,014
No, she hasn’t known it yet.

140
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:18,014
She shouldn’t know it either.

141
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:19,014
OMG!

142
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:20,014
And …

143
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:22,014
when you were dating each other

144
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:24,014
everything seemed good without something off, really?

145
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:25,514
No, I knew there was something wrong.

146
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:28,014
But when I was with her,

147
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:31,014
I forget everything.

148
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:32,014
Maybe,

149
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:33,514
the uncomfortable feeling you’re having

150
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:34,514
might be a punishment

151
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:36,514
that you’ve to be responsible for.

152
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:39,014
Frankly speaking,

153
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:41,514
though you broke up with Air,

154
00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:43,014
you’ve

155
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:44,014
never left Air at all.

156
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:49,014
So, she might think you’re always the same.

157
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:50,014
Hey!

158
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:52,514
But do not live with this feeling too long.

159
00:05:52,514 --> 00:05:55,014
You can be happy.

160
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:56,514
I agree.

161
00:05:56,514 --> 00:05:57,014
All humans

162
00:05:57,014 --> 00:05:59,014
are selfish.

163
00:05:59,014 --> 00:06:01,014
But are you sure that

164
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:03,014
Loft really

165
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:06,514
love you?

166
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:13,014
So, if it’s like this,

167
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:14,514
you might know

168
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:17,014
what you want to do after this.

169
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,014
If you’ve chosen,

170
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:27,014
just go for it!

171
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:37,514
Hello. Vela Villa.

172
00:06:37,514 --> 00:06:38,014
Hello.

173
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:40,514
Can I talk to Loft?

174
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:42,014
Who’s calling, please?

175
00:06:42,014 --> 00:06:43,014
It’s Pure.

176
00:06:43,014 --> 00:06:44,514
I’m sorry.

177
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:48,514
Well, she isn’t in now.

178
00:06:48,514 --> 00:06:49,514
Well, …

179
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:51,014
if she’s back,

180
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:53,014
please tell her I’ve called.

181
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:55,014
Of course.

182
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,014
Thank you.

183
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:52,514
You’re welcome.

184
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:28,514
Are you stressed?

185
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:31,014
Is it that obvious?

186
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:32,014
Umm.

187
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:35,514
Ordering the bottle of wine for yourself like this,

188
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:38,014
you aren’t doing good, right?

189
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:42,514
What’s it about?

190
00:08:42,514 --> 00:08:44,014
It’s none of your business, surely.

191
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:45,014
Oops!

192
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:48,514
So mean!

193
00:08:48,514 --> 00:08:50,014
What about this?

194
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:52,514
Let’s find out whose problem is worse.

195
00:08:52,514 --> 00:08:55,514
Who’s having a more f**k up life,

196
00:08:55,514 --> 00:08:57,514
is a winner.

197
00:08:57,514 --> 00:09:01,014
The loser

198
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:07,014
must foot the bill.

199
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,514
Well,

200
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,514
when entering the program, I was

201
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:12,514
the top scorer.

202
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:13,514
But recently,

203
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:16,014
after the midterm exam,

204
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:20,014
I got the lowest score in class.

205
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:21,514
It’s not only about embarrassment,

206
00:09:21,514 --> 00:09:24,014
but also, it’s about my foolishness

207
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:28,014
that I messed up with the answer sheet myself.

208
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:30,514
Every time I shared this with someone,

209
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:34,014
no one believed me.

210
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:36,514
Well, I’m stressed

211
00:09:36,514 --> 00:09:39,014
because I don’t know

212
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:40,514
how to tell my mom

213
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:44,014
about her seriously silly daughter.

214
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:48,014
Am I silly?

215
00:09:48,014 --> 00:09:50,014
It’s your turn now.

216
00:09:52,014 --> 00:09:53,014
Mine?

217
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:55,014
Umm.

218
00:10:02,014 --> 00:10:05,014
Well, it’s just

219
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:07,014
that my mom has forced me

220
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:11,014
to work for my dad’s company.

221
00:10:11,014 --> 00:10:14,014
More than that, she asked me to study for a master’s degree.

222
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,514
And you know what?

223
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,014
Not a degree in Thailand

224
00:10:17,014 --> 00:10:19,014
but in UK.

225
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:22,014
She wants to see me with a high profile.

226
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:23,514
Huh.

227
00:10:23,514 --> 00:10:26,514
The worst thing is

228
00:10:26,514 --> 00:10:31,014
she’s holding an arranged marriage for me.

229
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:35,014
My life

230
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:37,014
is like a puppet show

231
00:10:37,014 --> 00:10:39,014
that’s always controlled and directed.

232
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:42,514
Huh.

233
00:10:42,514 --> 00:10:47,514
I don’t even know who truly I am now.

234
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,514
Umm.

235
00:10:50,514 --> 00:10:52,014
Well, I guess

236
00:10:52,014 --> 00:10:57,014
I’m lost.

237
00:10:57,014 --> 00:10:58,514
No need to do that.

238
00:10:58,514 --> 00:11:02,014
It’s okay.

239
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:04,514
For all, please.

240
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:06,514
I’m sorry.

241
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:09,014
So am I.

242
00:11:09,014 --> 00:11:13,514
It’s just like sharing with someone.

243
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:17,014
Well,

244
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:22,014
what do you really want to do.

245
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,014
Me?

246
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:25,514
Umm.

247
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:35,514
I want to take a break,

248
00:11:35,514 --> 00:11:38,514
to travel,

249
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:39,514
to enjoy art

250
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:42,514
at various places.

251
00:11:42,514 --> 00:11:44,514
I want to own a small gallery

252
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:47,014
where artists can come display their artworks.

253
00:11:47,014 --> 00:11:50,014
And I can also enjoy those pieces.

254
00:11:50,014 --> 00:11:52,514
Hey, you know?

255
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:56,514
We can be partners.

256
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:58,514
I’m studying Fine Art.

257
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:02,014
I’m really into sculpture.

258
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,014
And …

259
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,014
I want to have my own studio too.

260
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:08,514
But the big one.

261
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:12,514
Really.

262
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:14,014
Uh.

263
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:16,014
Let’s do it.

264
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:18,514
Could you also show me how to work on sculpture?

265
00:12:18,514 --> 00:12:20,514
Sure!

266
00:12:20,514 --> 00:12:22,514
But I forgot something.

267
00:12:22,514 --> 00:12:26,014
My name is Pure.

268
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:29,514
You can call me Air.

269
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:31,014
Oops!

270
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:32,014
So,

271
00:12:32,014 --> 00:12:35,014
when we’re together,

272
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:37,014
it becomes Pure & Air.

273
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:43,514
It’s pure air, then.

274
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:46,014
There, you’re smiling now.

275
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:47,514
You know what?

276
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:50,514
You look gorgeous,

277
00:12:50,514 --> 00:12:55,014
when smiling.

278
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:57,014
So are you.

279
00:12:57,014 --> 00:12:58,514
Sure, with the free drinks.

280
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,514
Shall we … cheers?

281
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:04,514
Sure.

282
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:17,014
Nice meeting you,

283
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:20,514
Air.

284
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:22,014
Same here.

285
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:24,014
Pure,

286
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:26,014
the artist

287
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,014
who’s accidentally failed the exam.

288
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:31,014
Hey!

289
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:33,514
What?!

290
00:15:51,614 --> 00:15:53,413
You’re driving to Petchaburi.

291
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:54,614
Right now?

292
00:15:54,614 --> 00:15:55,514
Yes.

293
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:57,214
I don’t know.

294
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:59,014
I only know that

295
00:15:59,014 --> 00:16:01,214
this time I’m not going to wait for anything.

296
00:16:22,035 --> 00:16:23,334
Hello. Vela Villa.

297
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:24,234
Hello.

298
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,635
Is Loft back?

299
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:28,435
Oh! Hello.

300
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:30,135
Well, she is …

301
00:16:30,135 --> 00:16:31,834
Isn’t she in?

302
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:33,834
Well, I’ve tried reaching her at the Bangkok house.

303
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:36,534
She’s not there either.

304
00:16:36,534 --> 00:16:40,034
I’m really worried about her.

305
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:44,934
Can you ask her to talk to me, please?

306
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:46,135
Loft! Loft!

307
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:46,934
What?!

308
00:16:46,934 --> 00:16:50,835
How long are you staying here?

309
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,135
Well, quite a while.

310
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:52,934
What’s wrong?

311
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:54,934
Are you staying here longer, huh?

312
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:56,135
I just wanted to know.

313
00:16:56,135 --> 00:17:00,635
Well. Alright.

314
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:02,434
Thank you.

315
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:05,534
Oh. You’re welcome.

316
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:11,635
This is what we can only do, you know?

317
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:16,635
What?!

318
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:17,535
Are you serious?

319
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:19,635
You’re driving to Petchaburi.

320
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:22,135
Right now?

321
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:23,934
What if she’s already had someone else?

322
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:26,135
What are you going to do?

323
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:28,635
Well, I don’t know.

324
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:30,635
But I just know that

325
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:33,635
this time I’m not going to wait for anything.

326
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:47,635
Nah.

327
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:50,934
Oh no!!!

328
00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:53,434
Are you going to get me drunk?

329
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:56,234
The previous bottle, you just sipped it very little.

330
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:59,335
I don’t like it when I wake up with the hangover feeling.

331
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:01,934
They should produce non-hangover wines.

332
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:03,635
If so, I’ll drink it every day.

333
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:04,934
Umm.

334
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:06,335
There might be,

335
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,635
but we don’t know.

336
00:18:08,635 --> 00:18:11,035
What about

337
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:13,234
Soju, Sake

338
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:14,234
Voda,

339
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:15,635
or rice whisky?

340
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:17,635
They might be fine with you.

341
00:18:17,635 --> 00:18:19,434
I’ve tried all of them.

342
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:21,234
None.

343
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,135
If not, no drinking.

344
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,834
Just quit as you told me before.

345
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:30,035
Well, actually I shouldn’t drink too much.

346
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:32,234
I’ve to take good care of my health.

347
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:34,334
Huh?

348
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:37,834
My partner and I are planning to have a kid.

349
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,435
Really?

350
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:40,935
Congratulations!

351
00:18:40,935 --> 00:18:42,535
Not yet. Please wait.

352
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:44,535
I’m afraid it’s too early.

353
00:18:44,535 --> 00:18:45,334
Wait for that day!

354
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,535
Please say Congrats again later.

355
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:49,935
Alright.

356
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:51,035
Umm.

357
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:54,635
What about you? Do you want to have a kid?

358
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,935
Before I hadn’t thought about it,

359
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,834
until Aim, my friend once told me

360
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,234
that we might not want a kid

361
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:03,234
until

362
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:05,834
we met someone we loved so much

363
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:08,834
that we wanted to see our half and the other half

364
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:13,334
developed.

365
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:15,535
She’s right.

366
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:19,834
Well, have you found that person yet?

367
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:22,635
Already.

368
00:19:22,635 --> 00:19:26,635
But it’s impossible.

369
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:28,834
Well, I’ll stop asking about it.

370
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,834
So, I’ll let you

371
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,834
congratulate me on something else instead.

372
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:36,435
What shall it be about?

373
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:38,135
Umm.

374
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,935
Then what about congratulating on …

375
00:19:39,935 --> 00:19:41,635
our no drinking campaign.

376
00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:44,035
Is that good?

377
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:46,435
But can mine be water?

378
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,635
Are you sure?

379
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:50,135
But that’s fine.

380
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:53,935
Cheers!

381
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:54,635
Easy girl!

382
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:56,635
There it is.

383
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:58,135
Oh no!

384
00:19:58,135 --> 00:19:59,234
Jeez!

385
00:19:59,234 --> 00:20:00,135
Umm.

386
00:20:00,135 --> 00:20:01,334
I’m sorry.

387
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,334
I didn’t mean to let this happen.

388
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:03,935
Oh no!

389
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:05,334
Go wash it in the toilet.

390
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:06,035
I’ll take care of the things here.

391
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:07,135
Alright. You can go.

392
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:07,935
So messy now.

393
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:09,635
Aw!

394
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:23,234
Oh!

395
00:20:23,234 --> 00:20:26,334
Such a terrible stain!

396
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:27,135
Give me your top.

397
00:20:27,135 --> 00:20:29,935
I’ll wash it.

398
00:20:29,935 --> 00:20:31,534
What?!

399
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:32,935
It’s okay.

400
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:34,935
You don’t have to.

401
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:36,334
Are you shy?

402
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:37,534
You’d better not be shy, with this terribly spilled top.

403
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:40,635
And you’ll have to walk back to the office for a while.

404
00:20:45,135 --> 00:20:45,935
Here it is.

405
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:48,435
Put this shirt on first.

406
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:49,834
Thank you.

407
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:57,135
You’re the kindest boss.

408
00:20:57,135 --> 00:20:57,935
Oh!

409
00:20:57,935 --> 00:21:00,435
Sorry!

410
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:15,034
I’m done.

411
00:21:15,034 --> 00:21:18,135
Oh!

412
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:22,135
Okay.

413
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:24,635
Your top!

414
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:25,534
Pure!

415
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:32,935
Hey!

416
00:21:32,935 --> 00:21:33,635
Excuse me.

417
00:21:33,635 --> 00:21:35,034
Hey! I’m alright.

418
00:21:35,034 --> 00:21:36,235
Pure!

419
00:21:36,235 --> 00:21:37,635
Pure!

420
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:11,435
Call Pure!

421
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:01,135
Well,

422
00:23:01,135 --> 00:23:03,834
Ploy’s a new secretary of mine.

423
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:07,635
I just asked her to talk with me.

424
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:12,635
There’s nothing complicated.

425
00:23:12,635 --> 00:23:15,635
Well, it sounds like I’m trying to make things up.

426
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:19,235
But it’s the fact.

427
00:23:19,235 --> 00:23:23,034
Why have you been avoiding me?

428
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:28,834
You want to leave me forever, huh?

429
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:30,235
If I’ve to admit

430
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:32,735
that I’m losing you,

431
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:36,834
I can’t.

432
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:42,135
Neither can I.

433
00:23:42,135 --> 00:23:46,834
I’ve to thank the secretary.

434
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:50,635
As when I saw you and her together,

435
00:23:50,635 --> 00:23:52,834
it made me know

436
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:56,235
how my true feeling.

437
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:59,635
If I hadn’t felt anything,

438
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:01,635
I would have gone back to Bangkok already.

439
00:24:04,034 --> 00:24:09,635
So, you came here instead, huh?

440
00:24:09,635 --> 00:24:12,935
Loft,

441
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:15,334
between Air and I

442
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:17,635
it’s over.

443
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:22,834
You’re saying that

444
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:24,635
I’ve been chosen, right?

445
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:35,034
It’s not only that I’ve chosen you,

446
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:37,635
but it’s also you

447
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:39,635
who always choose me.

448
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:45,335
You also know

449
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:49,235
how I feel about you.

450
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:51,635
Yes.

451
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:54,635
What I’ve done

452
00:24:54,635 --> 00:24:58,635
might hurt you so much

453
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:00,635
that you might avoid me.

454
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:12,635
Loving you

455
00:25:12,635 --> 00:25:14,335
hurts me

456
00:25:14,335 --> 00:25:16,635
the most.

457
00:25:16,635 --> 00:25:18,635
It’s real painful.

458
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:29,235
But I’ll choose

459
00:25:29,235 --> 00:25:33,635
what doesn’t hurt me later too.

460
00:26:01,135 --> 00:26:07,534
Am I right here in time?

461
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:10,635
If it was later, it would be no problem too.

462
00:26:18,135 --> 00:26:22,335
Let’s go home.

463
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:23,434
Are you alright?

464
00:26:23,434 --> 00:26:24,635
Umm.

465
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:38,835
It’s like a dream

466
00:26:38,835 --> 00:26:42,635
that you’re here with me.

467
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:44,534
I’m trying to make

468
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:49,034
our story better.

469
00:26:49,034 --> 00:26:52,135
But I’m serious about our relationship.

470
00:26:52,135 --> 00:26:54,034
After this,

471
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:58,934
what’s our relationship like?

472
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:04,835
We’re lovers.

473
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:05,635
Oops!

474
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:08,235
Like a dream, really.

475
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:09,835
Ooh!

476
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:11,235
Do you believe

477
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:13,635
it’s not a dream anymore?

478
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,335
Don’t expect too much.

479
00:27:19,335 --> 00:27:21,635
I’m a normal person

480
00:27:21,635 --> 00:27:23,635
that can’t be

481
00:27:23,635 --> 00:27:27,434
your 24-hour happiness.

482
00:27:27,434 --> 00:27:28,635
I know

483
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:30,934
that you’re a normal one

484
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:33,335
but you’re special to me as I love you.

485
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:34,635
That’s enough for me.

486
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:35,635
Umm.

487
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:36,635
Umm.

488
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:38,135
Oops!

489
00:27:38,135 --> 00:27:39,635
It seems like a dream again.

490
00:27:39,635 --> 00:27:40,635
Oh!

491
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:42,135
Still like being in a dream?

492
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:44,434
This hurts.

493
00:27:44,434 --> 00:27:47,335
Are you teasing me?

494
00:27:47,335 --> 00:27:48,434
My love.

495
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,034
My love.

496
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:50,835
What?!

497
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:51,635
My love.

498
00:27:51,635 --> 00:27:53,934
I’ll keep calling you like this.

499
00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:55,835
New toy hype, huh?

500
00:27:55,835 --> 00:27:56,635
Sure.

501
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:58,635
It’s taken me so long to have this day.

502
00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:34,135
I love you.

503
00:28:34,135 --> 00:28:36,934
I also …

504
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:40,135
I want to hear it too.

505
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,135
If you’re not ready,

506
00:28:42,135 --> 00:28:44,835
it can be later.

507
00:28:44,835 --> 00:28:49,335
I can wait.

508
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:52,934
I promise

509
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:55,635
that I won’t hurt you.

510
00:29:37,434 --> 00:29:42,835
Thank you, Lamp.

511
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:46,434
What’s wrong with you, Air?

512
00:30:17,096 --> 00:30:19,296
Oh! Please don’t stare at me.

513
00:30:19,296 --> 00:30:21,496
I can’t focus on anything now.

514
00:30:21,496 --> 00:30:24,496
You can continue coloring it without overthinking.

515
00:30:24,496 --> 00:30:27,296
I just wanted to look at you.

516
00:30:27,296 --> 00:30:32,196
It’s like I’m being inspected all the time.

517
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:33,496
Hey!

518
00:30:33,496 --> 00:30:37,496
When can you stop having negative feelings toward art teachers, huh?

519
00:30:37,496 --> 00:30:39,496
I’m not a teacher.

520
00:30:39,496 --> 00:30:43,295
But your lover.

521
00:30:43,295 --> 00:30:46,096
I like it when you say things like this.

522
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:47,496
Well.

523
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:48,696
Please keep staring at me.

524
00:30:48,696 --> 00:30:52,996
I’m pleased to continue now.

525
00:30:52,996 --> 00:30:55,496
Uh.

526
00:30:55,496 --> 00:30:57,295
Finished!

527
00:30:57,295 --> 00:31:01,496
Well, can I have a look?

528
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:03,996
Ba-dum!

529
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,496
Ah.

530
00:31:08,496 --> 00:31:09,496
Oh!

531
00:31:09,496 --> 00:31:11,496
Well,

532
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:14,996
I’m not an artist.

533
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:17,496
It’s good enough for me.

534
00:31:17,496 --> 00:31:20,295
But I attentively worked on this.

535
00:31:31,496 --> 00:31:37,996
This is a reward for your good attempt.

536
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:38,996
Huh.

537
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:41,496
Looking at me like this,

538
00:31:41,496 --> 00:31:45,496
haven’t you been kissed before?

539
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:47,496
You know it well.

540
00:31:47,496 --> 00:31:48,996
But,

541
00:31:48,996 --> 00:31:52,996
it was quite exciting.

542
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,496
You really enjoy

543
00:31:55,496 --> 00:32:00,496
excitement, huh?

544
00:32:00,496 --> 00:32:01,496
Umm.

545
00:32:01,496 --> 00:32:03,496
Can I ask you something?

546
00:32:03,496 --> 00:32:05,996
Huh?

547
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:08,496
With Air,

548
00:32:08,496 --> 00:32:09,996
how was the ending like?

549
00:32:18,496 --> 00:32:22,496
Apologies.

550
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:25,996
Crying.

551
00:32:25,996 --> 00:32:28,496
Telling her it can’t be the same.

552
00:32:33,496 --> 00:32:36,496
If it wasn’t Air,

553
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,496
how would our story be?

554
00:32:47,496 --> 00:32:49,996
Talking about Air,

555
00:32:49,996 --> 00:32:54,496
she treats everything easily for the sake of others

556
00:32:54,496 --> 00:32:55,996
while her matters are

557
00:32:55,996 --> 00:32:58,496
always difficult.

558
00:32:58,496 --> 00:33:01,496
Because she loves you.

559
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:09,996
Pure,

560
00:33:09,996 --> 00:33:11,496
are you okay?

561
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:19,496
Well,

562
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:25,496
Air hasn’t known about us.

563
00:33:25,496 --> 00:33:27,496
So,

564
00:33:27,496 --> 00:33:30,496
are you telling her soon?

565
00:33:34,496 --> 00:33:37,496
Or you can let me do so.

566
00:33:37,496 --> 00:33:39,496
I feel guilty.

567
00:33:39,496 --> 00:33:43,996
I don’t want to have you secretly.

568
00:33:43,996 --> 00:33:45,496
How?

569
00:33:45,496 --> 00:33:50,496
One day, she’s going to know it.

570
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:53,496
I want to tell her myself.

571
00:33:53,496 --> 00:33:55,496
Let me have more time.

572
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,496
Lamp,

573
00:34:19,496 --> 00:34:22,496
this is actually too much for me.

574
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:24,496
Though we divorced,

575
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:27,996
this place is still yours.

576
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:29,496
It’s okay.

577
00:34:29,496 --> 00:34:30,996
I gave it to you

578
00:34:30,996 --> 00:34:33,496
as a present

579
00:34:33,496 --> 00:34:35,496
for your freedom.

580
00:34:35,496 --> 00:34:36,996
Lamp.

581
00:35:02,496 --> 00:35:05,496
Do you know

582
00:35:05,496 --> 00:35:07,496
that I’ve never been sad

583
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:10,996
once marrying you.

584
00:35:10,996 --> 00:35:12,996
But it was really my pleasure

585
00:35:12,996 --> 00:35:15,496
living with you.

586
00:35:19,496 --> 00:35:21,496
Thank you, Lamp.

587
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:32,496
What’s wrong with you, Air?

588
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:34,496
What happened?

589
00:35:34,496 --> 00:35:35,496
Don’t tell me that

590
00:35:35,496 --> 00:35:38,996
your mom is still upset.

591
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:39,996
Being upset

592
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:42,496
is part of her life now.

593
00:35:42,496 --> 00:35:43,496
She can’t do anything

594
00:35:43,496 --> 00:35:47,496
because it’s you who asked me to divorce.

595
00:35:47,496 --> 00:35:48,496
Well,

596
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:50,496
why do you look

597
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:54,996
quite sad?

598
00:35:54,996 --> 00:35:56,996
Heartbroken.

599
00:35:56,996 --> 00:35:58,496
Heartbroken?

600
00:35:58,496 --> 00:36:00,996
From Pure?

601
00:36:00,996 --> 00:36:02,496
Yes.

602
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:06,996
She’s had someone else already.

603
00:36:06,996 --> 00:36:07,996
Well,

604
00:36:07,996 --> 00:36:12,996
do you know that person?

605
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:14,996
It’s not that important.

606
00:36:14,996 --> 00:36:20,996
I couldn’t make it in time, and that’s the point.

607
00:36:20,996 --> 00:36:23,496
Air,

608
00:36:23,496 --> 00:36:27,996
I’m sorry for the delay.

609
00:36:27,996 --> 00:36:29,996
It’s okay, Lamp.

610
00:36:29,996 --> 00:36:31,996
You don’t have to blame yourself.

611
00:36:31,996 --> 00:36:33,496
Actually,

612
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:35,496
I’d thought before that it was going to

613
00:36:35,496 --> 00:36:39,996
turn out like this.

614
00:36:39,996 --> 00:36:40,996
Err.

615
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:43,496
In fact,

616
00:36:43,496 --> 00:36:46,996
you can continue working at the company if you want.

617
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:47,996
I don’t think so.

618
00:36:47,996 --> 00:36:49,996
I also have my dignity.

619
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:51,996
Your family’s agreed to provide my mom salary

620
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:53,996
from being a board committee.

621
00:36:53,996 --> 00:36:58,496
I’m really thankful.

622
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,496
Well,

623
00:37:01,496 --> 00:37:06,996
what’s next after this?

624
00:37:06,996 --> 00:37:08,496
Well,

625
00:37:08,496 --> 00:37:12,496
a friend of mine is opening a restaurant in France

626
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:13,496
next month.

627
00:37:13,496 --> 00:37:15,496
I want to help her there.

628
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:17,496
I’m looking for a permanent job too.

629
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:19,496
If I can find a good job,

630
00:37:19,496 --> 00:37:22,996
I’ll live there as long as I can.

631
00:37:22,996 --> 00:37:24,496
A long term?

632
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:24,996
So,

633
00:37:24,996 --> 00:37:29,496
aren’t you going to come back to Thailand?

634
00:37:29,496 --> 00:37:34,496
I don’t have anyone here.

635
00:37:34,496 --> 00:37:37,496
I want to restart my life

636
00:37:37,496 --> 00:37:40,496
by myself.

637
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:42,996
I want my mom to see that

638
00:37:42,996 --> 00:37:49,496
I can live without bothering others.

639
00:37:49,496 --> 00:37:51,496
Well,

640
00:37:51,496 --> 00:37:54,496
before you go

641
00:37:54,496 --> 00:37:56,496
you’d better tell Loft

642
00:37:56,496 --> 00:37:59,496
you’re leaving soon.

643
00:37:59,496 --> 00:38:00,996
I think

644
00:38:00,996 --> 00:38:03,496
Loft might want to see you face to face.

645
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:13,496
Air’s going to France.

646
00:38:13,496 --> 00:38:15,996
If I don’t talk to her now,

647
00:38:15,996 --> 00:38:18,996
things are getting worse.

648
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:19,996
France?

649
00:38:31,196 --> 00:38:33,397
I understand.

650
00:38:33,397 --> 00:38:35,197
If you’ve made up your mind,

651
00:38:35,197 --> 00:38:37,596
Congratulations!

652
00:38:37,596 --> 00:38:40,096
Well, I have something to talk to you.

653
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:41,796
Really?

654
00:38:41,796 --> 00:38:42,796
So,

655
00:38:42,796 --> 00:38:44,096
if I go see you in Petchaburi,

656
00:38:44,096 --> 00:38:46,296
is there an available room for me?

657
00:38:46,296 --> 00:38:48,197
Sure.

658
00:38:48,197 --> 00:38:50,697
When is it?

659
00:38:50,697 --> 00:38:51,296
What about tomorrow?

660
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:52,997
Is it too early?

661
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:53,697
If it’s too early,

662
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:57,096
let me revise my plan later.

663
00:38:57,096 --> 00:38:57,997
Well,

664
00:38:57,997 --> 00:38:59,597
tomorrow is okay.

665
00:38:59,597 --> 00:39:02,397
I’ll ask a maid to prepare a room for you.

666
00:39:02,397 --> 00:39:02,795
Alright.

667
00:39:02,796 --> 00:39:04,997
See you tomorrow.

668
00:39:04,997 --> 00:39:07,997
Well, Air.

669
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:11,696
Huh? Go ahead!

670
00:39:11,696 --> 00:39:13,196
Err. Nothing.

671
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:15,796
I’ll wait until we meet.

672
00:39:15,796 --> 00:39:17,397
Okay. Alright.

673
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,297
See you.

674
00:39:35,696 --> 00:39:37,196
I told you

675
00:39:37,196 --> 00:39:40,996
I’m going to talk to Air soon.

676
00:39:40,996 --> 00:39:42,397
I’m sorry

677
00:39:42,397 --> 00:39:45,897
that I didn’t ask for your opinion.

678
00:39:45,897 --> 00:39:49,797
Air’s going to France soon.

679
00:39:49,797 --> 00:39:50,397
I’m afraid that

680
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:51,797
if I don’t tell Air now,

681
00:39:51,797 --> 00:39:54,797
it can be worse.

682
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:59,297
France?

683
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,996
She’s arriving here tomorrow.

684
00:40:01,097 --> 00:40:03,397
Will you want to go back to Bangkok first?

685
00:40:09,696 --> 00:40:11,397
Or will you change your mind?

686
00:40:18,397 --> 00:40:22,897
I’ve promised

687
00:40:22,897 --> 00:40:26,096
not to hurt you anymore.

688
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,897
Alright.

689
00:43:08,997 --> 00:43:10,796
That painting

690
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,596
represents that person, right?

691
00:43:13,596 --> 00:43:14,997
Air!

692
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,796
Loft,

693
00:44:28,796 --> 00:44:31,997
I’m on my way.

694
00:45:41,997 --> 00:45:44,697
I just wanted to do the right thing.

695
00:45:44,697 --> 00:45:46,497
I’ve made a decision.

696
00:45:46,497 --> 00:45:47,596
Let’s do something

697
00:45:47,596 --> 00:45:50,397
we won’t regret it later.

698
00:45:58,997 --> 00:46:01,997
Can't it be someone else, Pure?
