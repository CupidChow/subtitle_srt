1
00:00:50,472 --> 00:00:54,472
Oh! There she is!

2
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:56,986
You look gorgeous today.

3
00:00:56,986 --> 00:00:58,064
So much glamorous…today!

4
00:00:58,064 --> 00:01:00,007
Sorry. Traffic jam.

5
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:01,047
We know.

6
00:01:01,843 --> 00:01:05,554
Soon we're going to be thirty. Going out for extra activities is alomost impossible.

7
00:01:05,554 --> 00:01:08,751
Just working is tiring enough. I'd rather spend the time sleeping.

8
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:13,243
Ugh, a grandma! Staying home all the time like this, how could you ever date someone?

9
00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:18,977
Or are you waiting for someone to knock on your door?
And when you open it - "Wow, exactly my type! You want to be my love?"

10
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:20,746
Don’t be mean! Too mean!

11
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:25,571
Maybe one day, when Timothée Chalamet visited Thailand,
he might fall for me in front of my house. Who knows?

12
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:28,496
Yeah, right! Sounds like you're totally his type.

13
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:34,298
Hey, he doesn't look for someone to meet his specs or a perfect one. But a compatible one.

14
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:42,580
Well, I agree. Looking for someone new isn’t that hard.
But finding someone right is …

15
00:01:48,564 --> 00:01:52,645
Speaking of this … do you think she is in or out with that one?

16
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:56,268
Huh! Already quit, I bet.

17
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:56,999
What?!

18
00:01:57,753 --> 00:02:01,692
That girl you leaned over at your birthday party, remember? Are you still talking to her?

19
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:05,515
My birthday? I was with you guys the whole time.

20
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:07,515
Not at all.

21
00:02:07,515 --> 00:02:10,324
No expectations, no disappointments - for real.

22
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:14,420
I can’t really remember anything. It was you, Dew.

23
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,345
That night you made me drink the whole bottle of liquor. Never again.

24
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,629
The liquor wasn’t cheap. The worst thing was I couldn’t remember anything after that.

25
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:28,897
But…I do remember that …

26
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:42,523
… P’Air

27
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:46,270
Oh, that one?
She went home right after you blew out the candles.

28
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,270
Dew!

29
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:50,595
Wait a minute.

30
00:02:50,595 --> 00:02:52,595
Hey! Where are you going?

31
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:59,285
She can’t stand it. She always reaches out and says hi.
When will you finally cut the ties, Miss?

32
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:03,725
You’re right. There are plenty of fish in the sea.
Why this one? I don’t get it.

33
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,741
A good match is hardly found, and you know it.

34
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:13,158
I haven't seen her for a long time.
I just want to say hi, as an acquaintance. Can I?

35
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:15,158
Long time? Are you sure?

36
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:17,158
I heard you guys just met last week.

37
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,405
Pure, you know it’s not okay, right?

38
00:03:26,104 --> 00:03:30,765
If I take too long, then … don’t wait.
See you later.

39
00:03:40,423 --> 00:03:43,509
Visiting my friend’s business, you want to see me, right?

40
00:03:51,626 --> 00:04:01,948
I’ve no idea. But good music and nice cocktails have brought me here.
I don’t think it’s weird.

41
00:04:03,797 --> 00:04:06,593
Who are you with here?
That one!

42
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:11,855
My sister.

43
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:15,165
Are you joking? Since when you’ve had a sister?

44
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,167
For a while. Her name is Loft.

45
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,498
Loft?

46
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,474
Lamp’s younger sister, actually.

47
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,119
OIC. Your sister-in-law.

48
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:32,044
I’ve heard her name but haven’t seen her face. I thought it was a brother.

49
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:37,718
Well, is he okay you hang out at night?

50
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:41,875
He? You mean Lamp?

51
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:51,324
Well, getting married isn’t being put in jail.

52
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:59,693
So…tonight we can leave together, right?

53
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:06,548
Sorry. No!

54
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:10,089
I’ve to drop Loft off. If not, I feel bad for her.

55
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:11,656
Don’t use her as an excuse.

56
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:16,635
Even if she wasn’t here, you wouldn’t go home with me.

57
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:25,387
I miss you.

58
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:34,619
Can I have the same one?

59
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:39,570
But I’m going for mocktails today. I’ve to drive Loft home.

60
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,175
That’s fine. I’m driving too.

61
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,167
Are you okay? Anything to share with me?

62
00:05:56,938 --> 00:05:58,938
Just some family problems.

63
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:03,173
But we’re just acquaintances now, so … I don’t know what to share.

64
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:08,779
You’re so good at finding a way to be sarcastic.

65
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:10,779
What are you guys being sarcastic about?

66
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:22,298
Oh, you’re present.

67
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:30,356
Umm... Loft, this is Pure, a close junior friend of mine.

68
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:35,007
Pure, this is Loft, Lamp’s younger sister.

69
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:36,711
Hello, P’Pure.

70
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,547
Hi, Loft.

71
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:40,573
Can I sit here?

72
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:42,496
Go ahead.

73
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:44,496
Can I have one more drink as the one before?

74
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:02,799
… right, Loft?

75
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,969
Huh?

76
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,929
That pub’s in Ekkamai, right?

77
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:12,649
Oh, yes. That’s right. But on the day that I went, it seemed like there was a private party.

78
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:14,399
So, I left early. …

79
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,891
Well, do you have any recommendations around here?

80
00:08:19,302 --> 00:08:19,947
You’re asking me?

81
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:22,289
I don’t usually go out much.

82
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:27,985
Mostly, I come here - my friend’s pub. It’s convenient and familiar to me.

83
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,007
What’s your regular drink?

84
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:36,486
What's up, Bam! Huh! What?! How are you doing?

85
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,906
Okay, stay there … I’ll go pick you up.

86
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:44,776
It’s okay, Bam. I’m going now. Bye.

87
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:46,543
What happened to her?

88
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,700
She got hit by a car. She said she’s fine, but she can’t get home herself.

89
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,947
I’ve to drive and take her home

90
00:08:57,654 --> 00:09:01,693
Well, Pure, could you please give Loft a ride home?

91
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:04,746
Oh! Don’t worry about me. I’m fine. I can get home by myself.

92
00:09:04,746 --> 00:09:06,253
No problem at all.

93
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:10,128
Such a caring person, you are. How could I let Loft go home alone?

94
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:13,130
Don’t worry about this matter.

95
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,293
So, shall we leave, Loft?

96
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:18,195
Alright.

97
00:09:19,414 --> 00:09:21,378
Loft, wait for me in front of the pub, okay?

98
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:22,883
I’ll get the car and pick you up.

99
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:23,837
Sure.

100
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:41,107
Going with Loft, please don’t hit on her, okay?

101
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:43,828
Speaking like this, are you scared?

102
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:49,157
I’m not. But I’m jealous.

103
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:54,134
Pure!

104
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:56,134
Well, I’ve just missed you a lot.

105
00:09:57,007 --> 00:09:58,071
Pure!

106
00:09:58,508 --> 00:09:59,503
What if someone sees us?

107
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:02,498
If you don’t want me to continue, say ‘stop’!

108
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:11,575
Pure!

109
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:13,575
When are you divorcing him?

110
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:17,603
Pure, please do not be like this. I’ve never asked you to …

111
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:20,158
‘…to wait’, right?

112
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,329
Pure!

113
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:26,185
It’s hard for me to wait, but I’ll wait.

114
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:29,099
But…waiting for too long might be too tough.

115
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:33,089
Pure!

116
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:35,628
Pure. Pure. Hey.

117
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:37,628
Pure, are you okay?

118
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:38,128
I’m alright.

119
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:44,354
…P' Air

120
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,555
Um…safe drive.

121
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:49,555
You too.

122
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:15,142
Loft!

123
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:37,078
Come on! Miss Minnie is a bit stubborn.

124
00:11:39,422 --> 00:11:40,429
Miss Minnie?

125
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:44,817
Yes, my car’s name.

126
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:53,010
Oh, Air and you wear the same perfume as Air.

127
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,010
Really?

128
00:12:04,873 --> 00:12:08,012
Well…it’s the ‘soft’ hit, isn’t it?

129
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:09,139
Yeah, my friend.

130
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:15,007
Just the soft hit by a motorcycle.
But I tripped over my own feet and fell into the drainage by the road.

131
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:21,524
But I'm really grateful to you, Air, for coming to pick me up.

132
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:23,049
Not at all.

133
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:27,053
It’s my pleasure. I couldn’t let Bisou come pick you up.

134
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:37,412
Though my orange cat can’t drive or pick me up,
he can make this single lady smile.

135
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:42,160
Hey...so you went drinking with just Loft?

136
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:44,777
Where was Lamp?

137
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,291
He had a party with his partners.

138
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:51,285
Oh, as a wife, don’t you have to accompany him?

139
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:55,007
I didn’t want to go. And he didn’t mind it.

140
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:59,821
Letting you wander around freely like this,
one day he’ll see you return to your ex.

141
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:06,317
Well, … actually, I met her before picking you up.

142
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:06,981
What?!?

143
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,771
Are you dating someone?

144
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:17,303
Wait! Why are you asking?

145
00:13:18,921 --> 00:13:20,164
Let me try again.

146
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,707
Can I ask if you have someone special?

147
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:29,507
Yes, you can ask. But I won’t answer it.

148
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,511
Up to you.

149
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:37,730
You’re not going to ask other people, right?

150
00:13:38,732 --> 00:13:42,446
Because you didn’t answer my question. If I want to know something,

151
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,525
I can find a way to get the answer myself.

152
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,101
Air is married.

153
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:57,257
I think you should date someone else.

154
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:03,932
Is it that obvious?

155
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:06,451
But don’t worry.

156
00:14:07,658 --> 00:14:13,578
I won’t tell anyone you guys have met
as it’s not my business.

157
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:22,869
But … I just wanted to know if you really won’t give up
while you also know she’s married.

158
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:24,330
But I was the first.

159
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,433
Oh, so fierce!

160
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,234
What are you laughing at?

161
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:34,362
Is it okay?
To keep loving someone who belongs to someone else like this.

162
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:35,007
Why?

163
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,317
You’re worried about your brother?

164
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:42,896
I’m more worried about myself.

165
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:48,595
Huh? What do you mean?

166
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,691
Why don’t you try opening your heart to someone else?

167
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:57,920
What do you mean by someone else?

168
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,867
What if it’s me?

169
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:02,398
Saying it like this, do you fall for me?

170
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:17,676
You’re saying you hang out with both Pure and Loft?

171
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:19,676
Correct.

172
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:21,676
The ex and the sister-in-law?

173
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:25,859
Right. I also asked Pure to drive Loft home.

174
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:29,138
Awesome! Super amazing!

175
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:40,217
How many years has it been? 2-3 years already, you know. 3 years now and she still doesn't have anyone else?

176
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:45,445
Loft, you’ve never opened your heart to anyone before, huh?

177
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,740
It’s not what you’ve thought.

178
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:52,619
I just haven’t met the right person yet.

179
00:15:53,514 --> 00:16:01,216
For me, it can be anyone if I want.

180
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:06,293
What about you?

181
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:09,646
Why don’t you try opening your heart to someone else?

182
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:11,339
What do you mean by someone else?

183
00:16:11,894 --> 00:16:12,553
What if it’s me?

184
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,947
Saying it like this, do you fall for me?

185
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:20,789
Isn't it clear enough?

186
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:31,085
So that means
you don’t sleep in the same bedroom with Lamp, right?

187
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:32,228
Umm.

188
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:36,066
Are you happy? – seriously asking.

189
00:16:38,618 --> 00:16:44,610
I am. Why not? I’m married to a good and rich guy.

190
00:16:45,275 --> 00:16:47,275
But is he as loving as Pure?

191
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:52,118
No one is like Pure.

192
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:56,607
So it means... you still love her?

193
00:16:58,496 --> 00:17:00,496
She's been waiting for you so seriously.

194
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:03,037
If I were here, I would have moved on in the first year.

195
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:07,277
I’ve never asked her to wait, and she probably won't wait either.

196
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:12,311
Seriously asking, Air – don’t you think she’s having someone else?

197
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,130
You always say you haven’t asked her to wait...

198
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,689
But you've been hoping that someday you'll go back to her in time, right?

199
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,447
So, what can I do?

200
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:30,783
This is probably the best thing I can do.

201
00:17:37,771 --> 00:17:40,459
Pure…you seem to love your parents a lot.

202
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:45,963
Mm, but I've grown up. They seem to love me a little less now.

203
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:51,427
No matter what, they'll always love their children.

204
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:55,853
Unlike lovers - everything can always change.

205
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,034
Is this the place?

206
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:02,955
Yes. Please just park right here.

207
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:10,939
It’s a pity! I was having such a fun talk with you.

208
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,758
Thank you for dropping  me off.

209
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:38,738
Can I get your ID?

210
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:42,246
No, please.

211
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,531
Then can we see each other again?

212
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,940
If you want to see me, ask Air for help, then.

213
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:53,359
No way. Don’t involve me if you guys want to meet each other.

214
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,950
Don’t try using me as a tool.

215
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:57,659
How about this?

216
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:01,589
If we happen to meet again, that day I'll give you my ID.

217
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:04,299
Fair enough

218
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:07,496
Then, good night for now.

219
00:19:08,295 --> 00:19:10,295
Good night.

220
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:32,010
Oh, turn lights on first.

221
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,430
It's okay. It's okay. I can handle things myself.

222
00:19:37,382 --> 00:19:38,836
Are you sure?

223
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:41,657
Certainly! Excellent! I’m okay. I’ll say hi to Bisou first.

224
00:19:41,923 --> 00:19:44,744
You go down by yourself, okay? I won’t see you off.

225
00:19:44,744 --> 00:19:46,175
No problem. Take care of yourself.

226
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:49,115
Okay, Air. Get home safely. Thank you.

227
00:20:03,474 --> 00:20:05,474
I’m home now.

228
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:21,603
Can I get to your room?

229
00:21:11,446 --> 00:21:16,000
Always perceptive, you are. There’s no one here.

230
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,682
If you’re that scared, why are you here … or do you miss me?

231
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,640
I just wanted to thank you for dropping Loft off.

232
00:21:28,947 --> 00:21:32,123
And I wanted to apologize that on your birthday, that ...

233
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:34,123
That you didn't come?

234
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:36,655
It's okay. I understand.

235
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:42,182
Your birthday - I was there... I just left early.

236
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:46,156
Really? Why can't I remember?

237
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:51,053
Maybe I drank too much.

238
00:21:56,177 --> 00:21:59,515
Well, coming to my room, you just wanted to apologize?

239
00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:10,077
You could have called... or were you afraid of secret voice recording and blackmailing?

240
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,895
In case, your husband files for divorce? Sounds good…?

241
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:20,020
Nonsense.

242
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:25,331
What? I was just kidding. Are you really leaving?

243
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,659
What about staying here?

244
00:22:30,237 --> 00:22:33,185
I can’t. I didn’t plan for this.

245
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:34,875
I’m going home now.

246
00:22:39,932 --> 00:22:41,977
Tomorrow morning I’ll order breakfast for you as usual.

247
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:55,251
She came to our birthday party?

248
00:23:00,153 --> 00:23:01,125
What happened?

249
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:04,211
That girl you leaned over at your birthday party, remember?

250
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:05,306
Are you still talking to her?

251
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,268
Hello, Mom.

252
00:23:16,268 --> 00:23:18,609
Pure, are you asleep yet?

253
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:20,543
Not yet, Mom.

254
00:23:22,783 --> 00:23:24,070
Can you drop by tomorrow?

255
00:23:25,002 --> 00:23:26,514
Your dad and I have something to discuss with you.

256
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,843
Okay. See you tomorrow.

257
00:23:58,582 --> 00:23:59,459
Oh, you’re back.

258
00:24:00,546 --> 00:24:03,541
Are you still not sleeping?

259
00:24:04,438 --> 00:24:08,699
You mom brought a new bed sheet from Italy here. She went up to the bedroom.

260
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:13,055
I told her you went out for on-site work.

261
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:16,618
Does she notice we sleep separately?

262
00:24:19,612 --> 00:24:22,287
I asked P’ Phen to manage it. They went to the master bedroom instead.

263
00:24:24,793 --> 00:24:25,569
Thank you.

264
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:34,423
You mom asked about having children again.

265
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,962
My parents have asked me too.

266
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:01,751
I don’t know how to answer them now, Air.

267
00:25:05,145 --> 00:25:08,147
You know I don’t want children, don’t you?

268
00:25:08,568 --> 00:25:13,224
I know. But they don’t.

269
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:18,379
We’ve talked this over.

270
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:25,077
Or you want me to talk to them myself.

271
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:37,659
Air, let me ask you seriously. Do you ever care about my feeling?

272
00:25:44,158 --> 00:25:45,315
You’re a good guy, Lamp.

273
00:25:47,223 --> 00:25:58,226
But if I choose someone just by goodness, I’d have loved you long ago.

274
00:26:07,481 --> 00:26:09,094
How much is this one?

275
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,330
Hello, Dad. Hello, Mom.

276
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,975
Oh, have you eaten anything yet?

277
00:26:58,975 --> 00:27:00,301
Already, Mom.

278
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:02,739
Mm, how are things, Pure?

279
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:03,735
Are you busy these days?

280
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:05,828
Same as usual, Dad.

281
00:27:06,162 --> 00:27:08,162
And how’s everything at the studio?

282
00:27:08,162 --> 00:27:09,067
It’s fine, Mom.

283
00:27:09,401 --> 00:27:12,815
There's going to be an exhibition next month. Will you come, Mom?

284
00:27:12,815 --> 00:27:15,244
Oh, I’ll go. I’ll definitely go, sweetheart.

285
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:22,868
Well, what’s next? Then, let me continue, okay?

286
00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:29,771
Pure, I’ve something to tell you.

287
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,347
Your mom and I are divorcing.

288
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:44,856
Next Monday do you have time for us? Can you witness us?

289
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:47,646
Sorry, I can’t.

290
00:27:48,004 --> 00:27:49,217
Pure…

291
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:54,595
None of you has talked to me about this before.

292
00:27:56,812 --> 00:27:58,142
You’ve lived together for a long time.

293
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,245
… Are you sure with this decision?

294
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:11,493
We want to have our own lives, sweetheart.

295
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:18,492
All this time...we both wanted to be an entire-life couple.

296
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:25,112
But we’ve tried our best all along.

297
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:29,462
…Though we won’t be living together anymore,

298
00:28:29,462 --> 00:28:32,113
We aren’t leaving you, Pure.

299
00:28:32,113 --> 00:28:33,638
We’re still here for you, my dear.

300
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:43,025
Next Monday, I don’t think I have time.

301
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:45,025
It’s all for today’s meeting, right?

302
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:48,312
I’ve to go back to work.
Goodbye.

303
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,612
Hey, why are you staying so long this time? I thought you went back already.

304
00:29:16,909 --> 00:29:19,006
It’s low season

305
00:29:19,006 --> 00:29:20,909
People don’t travel much. Let me take a break!

306
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:25,239
And you? I thought you went back already. ... Have you fought with Air?

307
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,553
What?! We haven’t fought.
These days I can barely count the words we say to each other.

308
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,462
Are you happy with this situation?

309
00:29:39,827 --> 00:29:40,756
Well, I used to think I would be.

310
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:50,269
How long are you going to keep holding on? Loving her one-sidedly like this.

311
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:53,486
In the end, you’ll only get her body, you know?

312
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:54,815
Not even her physical body.

313
00:29:54,815 --> 00:29:56,815
After getting married, she hates me much more.

314
00:29:56,815 --> 00:29:58,243
She doesn’t want to be near me at all.

315
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:08,151
So…you know that she has had a girlfriend, right?

316
00:30:18,354 --> 00:30:19,796
Hmm…I’ve a story to tell you.

317
00:30:19,796 --> 00:30:20,677
What now?!

318
00:30:21,106 --> 00:30:26,765
They say when seals are mating and another one tries to steal a partner,

319
00:30:26,765 --> 00:30:30,791
the jealous seal might jump in and bite the intruder — so badly it dies!.

320
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,440
Seals?

321
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:33,529
Are you kidding?!

322
00:30:34,554 --> 00:30:36,382
Yes, it’s not real.

323
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:39,796
You believe it! Are you crazy?

324
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,796
Do you have an academic mode?

325
00:30:49,947 --> 00:30:54,963
If you can’t take it anymore, what about breaking up?

326
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:10,045
Anyway, I’m playing tennis with Air this Saturday.

327
00:31:10,045 --> 00:31:10,879
Do you want to join?

328
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:14,688
No! I’ve never won, playing with you guys.

329
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,641
What’s the point?

330
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,901
Whatever!

331
00:31:19,784 --> 00:31:20,426
It’s late now.

332
00:31:20,426 --> 00:31:22,268
I’m going out shopping

333
00:31:22,268 --> 00:31:23,791
Do you want anything?

334
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:24,291
I’m fine.

335
00:31:25,554 --> 00:31:28,540
Well, then please enjoy house-sitting, Bro.

336
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:29,828
Sure.

337
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:32,461
Don’t forget about the seals.

338
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:33,830
Oong – Oong!

339
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,189
Ugh! Go now!

340
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:30,356
How much is this one?

341
00:32:47,971 --> 00:32:51,434
So…you must do what you’ve promised me, okay?

342
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:19,778
On time, really!

343
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:21,116
I thought you’d be late.

344
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,954
I haven’t ordered anything for you.

345
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:26,177
Being late means being complained.

346
00:33:27,226 --> 00:33:29,931
Who would do that to you? Air?

347
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:33,006
Excuse me!

348
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:43,637
Thank you.

349
00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:51,609
Mm…can I have quinoa salad

350
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:58,260
and green juice, please?

351
00:33:58,522 --> 00:33:59,236
Okay.

352
00:33:59,546 --> 00:34:02,215
Mine is deep-fried pork neck and spicy dipping.

353
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:06,356
And a chocolate milk shake with extra whip cream, please.

354
00:34:06,356 --> 00:34:08,224
Super extra, okay?

355
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:09,011
Sure.

356
00:34:09,011 --> 00:34:09,511
Thank you.

357
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,211
Deep-fried pork neck and milk shake … seriously?

358
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:17,118
I like them. So yummy!

359
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:31,378
Why are you staring at me?

360
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:33,783
You look good, you know?

361
00:34:35,213 --> 00:34:36,021
Sure, I know it.

362
00:34:36,188 --> 00:34:38,045
Oh, you do.

363
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:42,682
Hey! Now you’re talking with this tone. Are we that close?

364
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:49,513
So, do you normally live in Petchaburi?

365
00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:52,159
I go back and forth.

366
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,398
If you want to travel there, let me know, okay?

367
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:56,909
Why? Free accommodation offers?

368
00:34:57,457 --> 00:34:58,766
Mm, you can stay at my place.

369
00:34:58,957 --> 00:35:01,602
Or if you want a pickup service from Bangkok, no problem.

370
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:04,414
Full service with 5-star satisfaction guaranteed.

371
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:09,038
I’m fine. I can afford the accommodation myself.

372
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:13,233
I really like that – someone who can take care of themselves.

373
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,986
I’m serious now. Saying you like me...

374
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:23,823
Are you trying to pull me away from them? You’re planning to get Air back to your brother?

375
00:35:24,515 --> 00:35:27,734
Wow, have you read too many novels?

376
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:33,047
That she doesn’t love youdoesn’t mean she’s going to love my brother.

377
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:34,260
Right?

378
00:35:37,574 --> 00:35:45,175
I really want to know if you guys love each other this much,  why don’t you fight for it?

379
00:35:48,274 --> 00:35:49,522
Fighting for what?

380
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:52,358
Life is not easy. We can’t take everything we want.

381
00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:57,552
Air can’t do what she wants, either.

382
00:36:00,127 --> 00:36:03,628
What about you? You can fight for everything, really?

383
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:08,393
Sure. No one can force me.

384
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:10,991
Yes, I can notice that. …

385
00:36:11,747 --> 00:36:14,148
But you’re not Air.

386
00:36:15,602 --> 00:36:16,812
I know.

387
00:36:17,646 --> 00:36:21,196
And she’s not you, either.

388
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:24,579
What are you saying?

389
00:36:47,835 --> 00:36:49,752
Yummy.

390
00:36:49,752 --> 00:36:51,156
Exaggerating!

391
00:36:51,728 --> 00:36:52,757
It’s yummy!

392
00:36:55,022 --> 00:36:56,450
Thank you.

393
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,247
Thank you.

394
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,266
Please put it here.

395
00:37:07,631 --> 00:37:08,841
Thank you.

396
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:19,192
I don’t eat fries.

397
00:37:19,931 --> 00:37:22,227
Yummy. Try it!

398
00:37:23,228 --> 00:37:23,917
Just a little, then.

399
00:37:26,754 --> 00:37:27,506
How’s it?

400
00:37:29,676 --> 00:37:30,457
Not bad!

401
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,323
What’s wrong?

402
00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:14,160
What?!

403
00:38:15,348 --> 00:38:16,730
Come here. I’ll wipe it off.

404
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,730
Is it messy?

405
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,040
No difference.

406
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,015
No! Don’t…

407
00:38:21,015 --> 00:38:22,181
Stay still.

408
00:38:42,193 --> 00:38:43,671
Eww…dirty!

409
00:38:44,434 --> 00:38:45,266
Good taste.

410
00:38:47,197 --> 00:38:50,772
When you’re with me, you don’t need to act ‘so strong’ all the time.

411
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:53,708
Say it again.

412
00:38:54,471 --> 00:38:56,568
I’m washing my hands. Wait a minute.

413
00:39:01,575 --> 00:39:03,565
You don’t need to act ‘so strong’

414
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:14,013
Here it is!

415
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:17,300
Do you believe us now? You snuggled with someone that night.

416
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,706
Yeah, yeah, I believe you.

417
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:41,787
This time is on me. Next time, it’s your turn. Okay?

418
00:39:43,186 --> 00:39:46,055
No problem. So, you want to see me again?

419
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:50,925
No. I just don’t want Air to complain that I can’t take care of her sister-in-law.

420
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:53,536
When she gets moody, it’s hard to cheer her up.

421
00:39:54,596 --> 00:39:57,958
A smile rather than a frown for Air.

422
00:39:58,382 --> 00:40:01,258
Oh, no! Painful!

423
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:02,505
Fake!

424
00:40:04,604 --> 00:40:06,440
You should try opening up your heart to me.

425
00:40:07,945 --> 00:40:13,312
Because I’m not waiting for just you. If not, you’ll regret it.

426
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:16,032
I’ll regret it.

427
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:19,838
I don’t believe you. You’re just acting.

428
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,117
I mean it.

429
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:24,951
Hey! Watch out!

430
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:34,946
It’s okay.

431
00:40:44,782 --> 00:40:46,019
Are you hugging me all the way home?

432
00:40:51,487 --> 00:40:51,987
We do apologize.

433
00:40:51,987 --> 00:40:53,118
Thank you.

434
00:40:54,347 --> 00:40:55,647
Thank you for your care.

435
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:57,738
Not at all.

436
00:40:59,158 --> 00:41:00,257
Then, shall we leave?

437
00:41:12,085 --> 00:41:16,111
Well, you play so much better.

438
00:41:16,556 --> 00:41:18,029
You even have deceptive shots now.

439
00:41:18,029 --> 00:41:19,776
I could barely reach them

440
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,180
You’ve trained me yourself.

441
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,180
And it’s you who introduced me to the tennis world.

442
00:41:25,477 --> 00:41:28,643
Without you, I wouldn’t have anyone to play tennis with.

443
00:41:29,067 --> 00:41:31,405
Like my brother … Oh! Don’t mention him!

444
00:41:32,266 --> 00:41:34,187
Why don’t you ask your special one to play with?

445
00:41:34,653 --> 00:41:36,653
I’ve heard you’re so popular.

446
00:41:36,823 --> 00:41:41,181
None. No one, really. You’re a fan of fake news?

447
00:41:41,563 --> 00:41:42,249
Are you sure?

448
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:50,079
Well... actually, I’m secretly interested in someone, but it might be one sided feeling.

449
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:58,862
Unbelievable! There shouldn’t be anyone who says no to you. … But who is it?

450
00:42:03,696 --> 00:42:08,197
Just kidding. I’m not in a one-sided love situation.

451
00:42:08,197 --> 00:42:10,197
It’s a pity. I almost know your secret.

452
00:42:11,087 --> 00:42:13,466
I won’t tell you, anyway.

453
00:42:20,482 --> 00:42:22,461
Hey…is the photo on your phone?

454
00:42:27,492 --> 00:42:32,636
Here it is!

455
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:34,290
Zoom it now!

456
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:38,533
Do you believe us now? You snuggled with someone that night.

457
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:43,364
Yeah, yeah, I believe you. It was probably someone at the party.

458
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:48,035
After that, I went home to sleep. I couldn’t remember anything.

459
00:42:50,472 --> 00:42:57,311
I can only remember that she said that ‘when you’re with me … you don’t need to act so strong.

460
00:42:59,198 --> 00:43:00,944
When I think of this, it’s very strange.

461
00:43:02,407 --> 00:43:04,296
I’ve never felt like this with anyone before.

462
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,289
It’s different from Air and others.

463
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:19,970
Maybe it’s because she’s a stranger who could understand you
when no one else did... that must make you feel good.

464
00:43:21,027 --> 00:43:22,084
Really?

465
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:24,683
Safe drive, Air.

466
00:43:24,683 --> 00:43:26,487
You too. Let me know when you get home, okay?

467
00:43:26,784 --> 00:43:27,542
Bye....

468
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:32,546
I don’t know.

469
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,276
If you meet that person again, will you try it?

470
00:43:54,452 --> 00:43:56,452
You can move on with someone else, you know?

471
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:38,691
Pen, please.

472
00:44:38,797 --> 00:44:39,342
Here I am.

473
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,545
Did my mom get into this room the day before?

474
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:46,887
No, she didn’t. I took her to the master bedroom instead.

475
00:44:48,265 --> 00:44:48,765
Okay.

476
00:45:07,115 --> 00:45:11,267
...we both wanted to be an entire-life couple.

477
00:45:13,429 --> 00:45:17,761
But we’ve tried our best all along.

478
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,356
Mom, I’m going with you next Monday

479
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,098
… No problem.

480
00:46:02,582 --> 00:46:03,670
You’ve chosen. …

481
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,168
We’ve to move on, then.

482
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,177
Uh huh, right.

483
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:33,860
What?!

484
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:35,710
Loft …

485
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,985
Why don’t you wear an apron?

486
00:47:02,466 --> 00:47:04,215
Your clothes are all dirty.

487
00:47:04,215 --> 00:47:09,098
Well, calm down, please. Don’t frown, or you don’t look good.

488
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:13,218
I was trying to finish it so quickly to spend time with my love.

489
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:16,765
No more talking. Come on!

490
00:47:17,147 --> 00:47:18,575
What?!

491
00:47:18,575 --> 00:47:19,499
Already washed.

492
00:47:27,962 --> 00:47:29,072
Smells so good.

493
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,347
Maybe, you’re the only one who can bring me a good smell like this

494
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:38,771
After the pleasant smell, anything else?

495
00:47:39,852 --> 00:47:43,800
Well, you’re counted.

496
00:47:44,457 --> 00:47:45,488
So naughty, you are.

497
00:47:46,378 --> 00:47:47,408
A minute, please.

498
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,554
Let me finish this, and we’re going out.

499
00:47:55,221 --> 00:47:56,267
Hold on!

500
00:48:01,948 --> 00:48:02,739
Are you sure?

501
00:48:06,264 --> 00:48:07,302
Pure!!

502
00:48:07,931 --> 00:48:09,889
Am I good at laundry?

503
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,714
Does it smell good?

504
00:48:12,862 --> 00:48:14,455
I want to finish my work now.

505
00:48:14,455 --> 00:48:15,570
I don’t think so.

506
00:49:19,463 --> 00:49:23,590
If I had known you owned this studio, I would have come to study here long ago.

507
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:26,099
Normally, I don’t teach here myself.

508
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,603
It depends on the schedule.

509
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:35,194
Well, what if I’d like the studio owner to teach me, when is the best time to book?

510
00:49:35,194 --> 00:49:36,850
Well, I’m not coming home tonight.

511
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:39,423
… But you don’t love him at all, do you?

512
00:49:39,423 --> 00:49:44,257
It looked like you engaged with nothing.

513
00:49:44,257 --> 00:49:45,155
Oh!

514
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:47,281
Hi, Loft!

515
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:48,976
Hello, Pure.
