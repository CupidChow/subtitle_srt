1
00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:01,007


2
00:00:06,514 --> 00:00:09,014
Pure has had someone else already.

3
00:00:09,014 --> 00:00:10,414
Do you know that person?

4
00:00:10,414 --> 00:00:12,213
It’s not that important.

5
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:13,213
I couldn’t make it in time,

6
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,014
and that’s the point.

7
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,014
Are you doing good?

8
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:17,014
After this,

9
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:18,314
what’s our relationship like?

10
00:00:18,314 --> 00:00:19,713
We’re lovers.

11
00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:20,314
Oops!

12
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:23,014
It’s really like a dream.

13
00:00:25,014 --> 00:00:27,614
She’s arriving here tomorrow.

14
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:30,713
Will you want to go back to Bangkok first?

15
00:00:30,713 --> 00:00:32,114
Or will you change your mind?

16
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:39,913
Pure!

17
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:41,614
Air, please calm down.

18
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:43,313
Pure’s too drunk now.

19
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:45,913
Can you please understand her?

20
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:48,614
If you’ve chosen that person,

21
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:51,014
why are you here for?

22
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:52,714
Because…

23
00:00:52,714 --> 00:00:55,014
Because what? Say it!

24
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:57,813
Do you still love me?

25
00:00:57,813 --> 00:01:00,313
You love me, really? You can’t even surprise me with my birthday,

26
00:01:00,313 --> 00:01:01,514
you can’t hug me,

27
00:01:01,514 --> 00:01:03,214
you can’t say you love me.

28
00:01:03,214 --> 00:01:06,014
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

29
00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:08,214
I love you the most and only

30
00:01:08,214 --> 00:01:10,313
as always.

31
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:11,813
Air!

32
00:01:11,813 --> 00:01:13,214
Air!

33
00:01:13,214 --> 00:01:16,014
Air!

34
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:31,514
Loft,

35
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:33,014
I’m on my way.

36
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:26,014
Pure,

37
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:46,814
are you sure with this?

38
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,514
Won’t you change your mind?

39
00:03:58,514 --> 00:04:01,014
If I don’t do it,

40
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:05,514
you’ll be sad, right?

41
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:15,014
I just wanted to do the right thing.

42
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:17,514
But I understand you, anyway.

43
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:21,514
If you think it’s too early to …

44
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:30,014
I’ve made a decision.

45
00:04:30,014 --> 00:04:32,514
Let’s do something

46
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:35,014
we won’t regret it later.

47
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:54,514
So, please check if the other 2 rooms over there

48
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:55,514
are available or not.

49
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:56,713
Also, for the other 3 rooms over there,

50
00:05:56,713 --> 00:05:58,514
we need to inspect the electricity system.

51
00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:01,014
The pool should be fine now.

52
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:02,514
Loft,

53
00:06:02,514 --> 00:06:04,014
I’m on my way.

54
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:46,514
When did this start?

55
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:25,434
When did this start?

56
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:26,635
Pure,

57
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:29,835
say something!

58
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:31,934
Shortly after the day

59
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,335
you first introduced me

60
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:37,135
to Loft.

61
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:42,034
I had fallen for her

62
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:43,235
before I knew
11
she was your ex-girlfriend.

63
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:51,835
It’s all my fault.

64
00:07:51,835 --> 00:07:55,434
It’s me who started this.

65
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:59,135
After knowing everything,

66
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:02,934
why didn’t you stop?

67
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:05,335
I’m sorry.

68
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:07,635
I’m really sorry.

69
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:14,835
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

70
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:15,835
Yes,

71
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:19,434
I’ve been thinking about it.

72
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:21,635
But why didn’t you stop it?

73
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:30,135
Stop loving someone like Pure isn’t easy,

74
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:34,635
and you know it well.

75
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:37,635
Can you tell me

76
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:43,434
whether it’s easy?

77
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:53,934
Well,

78
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:57,335
are you really happy?

79
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:59,434
If you’re angry at me,

80
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:02,435
you can curse me!

81
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:03,535
I know well

82
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:06,234
how you’re feeling now.

83
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:08,334
I’m sorry

84
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:09,935
for the very complicated situation

85
00:09:09,935 --> 00:09:12,334
which we can’t find a solution.

86
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,334
In the past,

87
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:15,935
you might stop loving me,

88
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:17,935
you might not want to wait,

89
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:20,334
and I’ve never blamed anyone

90
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:22,435
except myself.

91
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:24,935
It’s my fault

92
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:27,435
that I didn’t choose you.

93
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:29,935
It’s my fault

94
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:33,435
that I’ve destroyed everything.

95
00:09:33,435 --> 00:09:35,435
It’s my fault

96
00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:36,834
that I’ve left you behind

97
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:38,135
and let you’ve been feeling sad and disappointed

98
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:40,935
for too long.

99
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:43,935
But this is Loft.

100
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,435
Loft, whom you know well

101
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:50,935
who she is.

102
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:53,935
Does it make sense?

103
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:55,935
Can’t it be someone else?

104
00:09:55,935 --> 00:09:58,435
If it wasn’t Loft,

105
00:09:58,435 --> 00:10:01,435
I’d wait for you

106
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,435
without moving on.

107
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:04,535
And I didn’t know

108
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:05,935
how long I would have to wait for you.

109
00:10:05,935 --> 00:10:08,935
Do you know what I mean?

110
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:14,635
Air!

111
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:18,435
What about the promise you gave me?

112
00:10:18,435 --> 00:10:21,935
Why didn’t you choose me?

113
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:23,035
If I had been able to choose,

114
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:26,935
I would have chosen you.

115
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:33,435
Loft!

116
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:36,135
It must be Pure, really?

117
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:41,435
I’d never felt like this

118
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:43,935
before I met her.

119
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,935
Never.

120
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:48,635
I’m always so happy

121
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:51,435
when I’m with her

122
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:52,435
that I

123
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:56,935
forgot everything.

124
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:59,935
Air!

125
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:00,935
Also,

126
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:02,234
forgetting my feelings,

127
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:02,935
right, Loft?

128
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:05,635
Air!

129
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:13,534
If you guys are this happy,

130
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:17,635
enjoy it!

131
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,935
Pure!

132
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,435
About us,

133
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:24,034
it’s been over since the day

134
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:25,435
you told me you had someone else to replace me.

135
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,435
I’m sorry.

136
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:35,435
Don’t cry.

137
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:39,635
And don’t feel guilty too long.
87
I’m sorry

138
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:44,635
that I’ve hurt you.

139
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:46,235
But I don’t want to

140
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:47,435
hurt Loft either.

141
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:52,635
Hurting me instead

142
00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:55,935
is much easier, right?

143
00:12:01,935 --> 00:12:04,435
Loft,

144
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:05,935
after this,

145
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,935
we can only be strangers.

146
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,135
No. Please don’t say that.

147
00:12:10,135 --> 00:12:11,834
I can’t be your sister anymore.

148
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:15,935
No. Please, Air.

149
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,435
I’m sorry

150
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:20,935
that I can’t stand

151
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:21,935
enjoying your love.

152
00:12:27,935 --> 00:12:29,435
The guilty feeling

153
00:12:29,435 --> 00:12:31,235
that you both must be responsible for

154
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:32,935
as well as

155
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:37,435
anger and sadness

156
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:40,435
of mine will slightly fade

157
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:46,935
one day.

158
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:53,435
You’d better enjoy loving each other

159
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:57,935
as you’ve chosen it already.

160
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:02,635
I can’t do anything.

161
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:04,435
Air!

162
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:08,435
Happy Birthday!

163
00:14:08,435 --> 00:14:12,435
Ba-dum!

164
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,935
Ready?

165
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:16,435
Yes, freshly baked.

166
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:18,435
Uh.

167
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:19,935
Pure&Air.

168
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:21,334
Someone said this when we first met,

169
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:23,435
right?

170
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:25,435
It’s pure air, right?

171
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:27,435
Which color is good for me?

172
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:28,935
This one.
124
Let me put it on you.

173
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:36,935
This color really looks good on you.

174
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:41,435
You too.

175
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:42,935
Uh.

176
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:48,935
I love you.

177
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:52,935
I’ll always love you.

178
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,435
Please

179
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:58,435
love me like this

180
00:14:58,435 --> 00:15:00,935
forever.

181
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:01,935
Oh!

182
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,435
No need to ask me to do so.

183
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,935
It’s always true.

184
00:15:12,935 --> 00:15:13,935
It’s dirty here.

185
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:15,934
Here as well.

186
00:15:48,934 --> 00:15:50,434
I love you

187
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:54,434
as if you were my sister sibling.

188
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,635
Who are you here with?

189
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:46,934
Air might be here

190
00:16:46,934 --> 00:16:49,934
before meeting us.

191
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:52,934
What should we do after this?

192
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,476
Air might be here

193
00:18:23,476 --> 00:18:26,575
before meeting us.

194
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:35,075
Tonight, I’ll go back to my place

195
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:37,176
if you don’t feel well.

196
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:44,575
Please stay here with me tonight.

197
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:57,776
What should we do next?

198
00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:01,976
Choose what we won’t regret later,

199
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:03,776
right?

200
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:19,076
But does it really exist?

201
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,776
The way that no one regrets.

202
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:24,776
Will you be resistant to the guilty feeling?

203
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:44,676
I’m also in pain either

204
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:48,776
when seeing you like this.

205
00:19:57,176 --> 00:20:03,776
Therefore,

206
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:07,375
shall we stop

207
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,375
our relationship?

208
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:24,476
I’m sorry.

209
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:34,975
You don’t have to say it.

210
00:20:34,975 --> 00:20:37,375
It’s me who must apologize to you.

211
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,776
I’ve to be responsible for every loss

212
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:42,276
and terrible matter.

213
00:20:42,276 --> 00:20:44,276
It’s my fault.

214
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:48,576
This might be the punishment

215
00:20:48,576 --> 00:20:52,176
for us.

216
00:20:52,176 --> 00:20:53,276
How can we become happy

217
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:57,076
when someone’s sad because of us.

218
00:20:57,076 --> 00:21:00,975
We are no longer living together.

219
00:21:00,975 --> 00:21:06,176
I want you to know that

220
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:08,776
I love you so much.

221
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:20,276
So do I.

222
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:23,975
Can you hear me?

223
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:29,076
I love you so much.

224
00:21:29,076 --> 00:21:33,776
I love you too.

225
00:24:00,475 --> 00:24:01,776
Loft!

226
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:19,776
Pure…

227
00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:22,076
It seems like

228
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:24,975
our ride has come to a stop.

229
00:25:24,975 --> 00:25:26,776
I never thought I’d ever say this, but …

230
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:37,776
I’m glad to have known you.

231
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:50,776
I was lucky enough

232
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:52,175
to have shared it

233
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:52,776
with you.

234
00:26:13,675 --> 00:26:15,175
But if faith is kind,

235
00:26:15,175 --> 00:26:18,776
maybe one day

236
00:26:18,776 --> 00:26:20,776
our path will cross again.

237
00:26:26,675 --> 00:26:28,175
The love

238
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:32,075
I spent my whole life searching for

239
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:34,776
I’ve found it in you.

240
00:26:39,276 --> 00:26:41,776
Thank you for loving me.

241
00:27:37,376 --> 00:27:39,175
Everything that happened

242
00:27:39,175 --> 00:27:41,776
I hope

243
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:43,276
someday, somehow,

244
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:45,575
you’ll find a love that you truly deserve.

245
00:27:45,575 --> 00:27:46,675
A love

246
00:27:46,675 --> 00:27:50,276
that won’t cause any pain to anyone ever again.

247
00:27:50,276 --> 00:27:52,776
I’ll always love you, Pure.

248
00:28:10,976 --> 00:28:12,476
A relationship

249
00:28:12,476 --> 00:28:14,175
that slowly lifts us

250
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:15,276
the highest

251
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,776
without us even realizing

252
00:28:23,376 --> 00:28:25,776
and in just a fleeting moment,

253
00:28:25,776 --> 00:28:26,675
it lets us

254
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:28,175
fall,

255
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:31,075
unprepared, into the emptiness below.

256
00:28:31,075 --> 00:28:33,376
Do you really like being directed, hah?

257
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:35,175
The speed

258
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:40,075
that once made my heart race,

259
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:42,476
that made me scream

260
00:28:42,476 --> 00:28:43,376
to release

261
00:28:43,376 --> 00:28:45,776
the overflowing feelings inside

262
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,175
when it all comes

263
00:28:49,175 --> 00:28:51,776
to an end,

264
00:28:51,776 --> 00:28:54,776
when I unbuckle the seatbelt

265
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,976
and step off the ride,

266
00:28:57,976 --> 00:29:00,976
all that’s left is discomfort,

267
00:29:00,976 --> 00:29:02,776
the nausea,

268
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:05,776
the dizziness,

269
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:09,075
and the unbearable torment

270
00:29:09,075 --> 00:29:11,776
that we can no longer endure it.

271
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:18,776
It leaves me scared, frightened,

272
00:29:18,776 --> 00:29:21,776
and unwilling to ever go through it again.

273
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:26,175
Thrilling like

274
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:27,776
riding a roller coaster

275
00:29:27,776 --> 00:29:29,175
that’s what it was.

276
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:55,276
What happened?

277
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:56,276
You look as if you saw a ghost.

278
00:29:56,276 --> 00:29:57,075
What?!

279
00:29:57,075 --> 00:29:58,776
It’s more than what you could imagine!

280
00:29:58,776 --> 00:29:59,776
Why?!

281
00:29:59,776 --> 00:30:00,476
What?!

282
00:30:00,476 --> 00:30:01,276
Damn it!

283
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:01,776
What?!

284
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:30,977
Can you remember

285
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:34,477
when I was terribly sad that time?

286
00:30:34,477 --> 00:30:35,777
And I got this from that period.

287
00:30:35,777 --> 00:30:36,977
OIC. That is

288
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,977
being twisted according to sensitive emotions.

289
00:30:39,977 --> 00:30:40,777
Yes.

290
00:30:40,777 --> 00:30:41,977
It’s like infinity.

291
00:30:42,277 --> 00:30:43,477
Alright. Let’s see some others.

292
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:44,477
What about this?

293
00:30:44,477 --> 00:30:45,977
What’s it?

294
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,477
This is what I co-worked with Mr. Kham.

295
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:49,477
OIC.

296
00:30:49,477 --> 00:30:51,477
I first saw this

297
00:30:51,477 --> 00:30:53,177
in Petchaburi.

298
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:54,276
And I really

299
00:30:54,776 --> 00:30:55,977
like it so much

300
00:30:55,977 --> 00:30:57,477
that I later asked Mr. Kham to collaborate with me.

301
00:31:01,477 --> 00:31:02,776
Milk and Love

302
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:03,477
are my friends.

303
00:31:03,477 --> 00:31:04,477
Hello, everyone.

304
00:31:04,477 --> 00:31:05,776
Your work is so good.

305
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:07,376
Normally, you’re based in Petchaburi, right?

306
00:31:07,376 --> 00:31:07,876
Yes, I am.

307
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:09,776
I’m always there.

308
00:31:09,777 --> 00:31:09,977
Alright.

309
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:11,977
I love it. It’s amazing.

310
00:31:11,977 --> 00:31:12,977
Thank you.

311
00:31:12,977 --> 00:31:13,677
Well,

312
00:31:13,677 --> 00:31:15,477
that I’ve been working with him.

313
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:17,977
Oh!

314
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,977
Hello, girls!

315
00:31:19,977 --> 00:31:22,477
This flower bouquet is for you. Congratulations.

316
00:31:22,477 --> 00:31:24,177
Thank you.

317
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:25,477
You’re awesome!

318
00:31:25,477 --> 00:31:27,377
I’m so proud of you.

319
00:31:27,377 --> 00:31:28,477
Thank you.

320
00:31:31,177 --> 00:31:32,977
Congratulations, my love.

321
00:31:32,977 --> 00:31:35,776
Thank you, Mom.

322
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:36,776
Dad and Mom,

323
00:31:36,776 --> 00:31:38,477
this is Mr. Kham.

324
00:31:38,477 --> 00:31:39,477
Oh. Hello.

325
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:40,477
I used to tell you about him.

326
00:31:40,477 --> 00:31:41,477
Hello.

327
00:31:41,477 --> 00:31:42,977
Your work is so amazing.

328
00:31:42,977 --> 00:31:43,776
Thank you.

329
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,477
I’d like to ask about your inspiration, really.

330
00:31:45,477 --> 00:31:47,177
It’s wonderful.

331
00:31:47,177 --> 00:31:48,276
Shall you go upstairs for more works?

332
00:31:48,276 --> 00:31:48,577
Oh.

333
00:31:48,578 --> 00:31:49,477
Please come this way.

334
00:31:49,477 --> 00:31:50,977
Of course.

335
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,977
Please take care of them, Tem.

336
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,477
Congrats, my brilliant girl.

337
00:31:55,477 --> 00:31:56,477
Thank you.

338
00:31:56,477 --> 00:31:57,977
So good.

339
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:59,477
How are you? Are you tired?

340
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:00,477
Sure, I am.

341
00:32:00,477 --> 00:32:01,977
WTF!

342
00:32:01,977 --> 00:32:02,477
What?!

343
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:04,977
You look as if you saw a ghost?

344
00:32:04,977 --> 00:32:05,977
What?!

345
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:08,977
What do you mean?

346
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:09,977
Damn it!

347
00:32:09,977 --> 00:32:11,477
What?!

348
00:32:11,477 --> 00:32:12,477
What?!

349
00:32:31,977 --> 00:32:34,677
This is from Air.

350
00:32:37,277 --> 00:32:38,977
Thank you.

351
00:32:45,977 --> 00:32:47,777
I’m sorry

352
00:32:47,777 --> 00:32:50,777
for everything.

353
00:32:50,777 --> 00:32:53,477
I’ve been

354
00:32:53,477 --> 00:32:57,477
messing up your life.

355
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:59,977
In fact,

356
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:02,977
we’ve never seriously talked to each other before.

357
00:33:02,977 --> 00:33:07,277
We hardly meet in person.

358
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,477
I admit that

359
00:33:09,477 --> 00:33:12,477
I’m really interested

360
00:33:12,477 --> 00:33:14,977
in knowing

361
00:33:14,977 --> 00:33:16,977
the reasons

362
00:33:16,977 --> 00:33:20,477
why they really love you.

363
00:33:22,477 --> 00:33:26,277
I think it’s just a coincidence.

364
00:33:28,277 --> 00:33:30,477
For me,

365
00:33:30,477 --> 00:33:34,477
coincidence doesn’t exist.

366
00:33:34,477 --> 00:33:35,977
When I interrupted the relationship

367
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:39,477
of you and Air.

368
00:33:39,477 --> 00:33:43,977
Though it was so painful,

369
00:33:43,977 --> 00:33:46,477
I’ve learned something from it.

370
00:33:46,477 --> 00:33:51,477
I now know how I should take care of my love.

371
00:33:51,477 --> 00:33:54,477
Without those days,

372
00:33:54,477 --> 00:33:56,477
I wouldn’t have understood things easily

373
00:33:56,477 --> 00:33:58,277
like nowadays.

374
00:34:01,977 --> 00:34:04,977
Well,

375
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:07,977
have you lately known something about Air?

376
00:34:07,977 --> 00:34:09,477
That she’s been working for

377
00:34:09,477 --> 00:34:12,477
her friend’s restaurant in France, right?

378
00:34:12,477 --> 00:34:16,477
I hardly texted her

379
00:34:16,477 --> 00:34:19,477
but haven’t met her at all.

380
00:34:19,477 --> 00:34:22,477
For about …

381
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,477
2 years, I guess.

382
00:34:31,477 --> 00:34:34,477
She’s just come back to Thailand

383
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,977
to manage her belongings here

384
00:34:41,977 --> 00:34:42,977
as she plans to move

385
00:34:42,977 --> 00:34:47,277
to France, permanently.

386
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:49,977
I came visit your exhibition today

387
00:34:49,977 --> 00:34:52,177
to tell you about this.

388
00:34:56,477 --> 00:34:59,977
She doesn’t want you to know,

389
00:34:59,977 --> 00:35:02,477
but I think

390
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:04,577
you should know it.

391
00:35:16,977 --> 00:35:17,977
Oh. You’re still here?

392
00:35:17,977 --> 00:35:18,977
Right.

393
00:35:18,977 --> 00:35:21,477
I’m waiting for my kids.

394
00:35:21,477 --> 00:35:22,977
Are they travelling from Petchaburi?

395
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:24,977
Yes. I’ve sent them some photos from here,

396
00:35:24,977 --> 00:35:26,977
and they are so happy.

397
00:35:26,977 --> 00:35:27,477
Oh!

398
00:35:27,477 --> 00:35:29,477
Thank you so much.

399
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:30,977
I’m so pleased

400
00:35:30,977 --> 00:35:32,977
that you had agreed to co-work with me.

401
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:34,977
Instead, it must be me who says that.

402
00:35:34,977 --> 00:35:36,477
If you hadn’t asked me to join you,

403
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:37,977
no one would have seen

404
00:35:37,977 --> 00:35:40,477
such local works of mine.

405
00:35:40,477 --> 00:35:41,477
Well,

406
00:35:41,477 --> 00:35:42,477
talking about the painting downstairs,

407
00:35:42,477 --> 00:35:44,477
won’t you sell it?

408
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:45,977
I’ve seen many interested persons

409
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,677
wanting to buy it.

410
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:52,277
Well,

411
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:55,977
it’s because I just wanted to have it shown there.

412
00:35:55,977 --> 00:35:56,977
With the hope that

413
00:35:56,977 --> 00:35:59,977
the person in the painting would come and see it one day.

414
00:35:59,977 --> 00:36:02,477
She must be so important to you.

415
00:36:02,477 --> 00:36:03,277
I guess

416
00:36:03,277 --> 00:36:04,477
if she comes and sees the painting,

417
00:36:04,477 --> 00:36:06,477
she’ll certainly be very happy

418
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:08,977
that she’s as beautiful

419
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:11,977
as art.

420
00:36:11,977 --> 00:36:15,477
As same as your daughters, right?

421
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:17,977
Dad!

422
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:18,977
There,

423
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,477
they are.

424
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:21,477
Hello!

425
00:36:21,477 --> 00:36:22,977
Excuse me.

426
00:36:22,977 --> 00:36:23,977
I’m showing them around.

427
00:36:23,977 --> 00:36:25,477
Sure.

428
00:36:29,977 --> 00:36:31,477
How is it?

429
00:36:31,477 --> 00:36:32,977
Beautiful.

430
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:34,977
They are you guys.

431
00:36:34,977 --> 00:36:36,477
Let’s go that way!

432
00:36:36,477 --> 00:37:00,977
Okay.

433
00:37:00,977 --> 00:37:03,477
This is from Air.

434
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:27,977
Can you remember these couple rings?

435
00:37:27,977 --> 00:37:29,477
The first molding works

436
00:37:29,477 --> 00:37:32,977
you taught me.

437
00:37:32,977 --> 00:37:35,477
I want you to keep them

438
00:37:38,877 --> 00:37:39,977
As the gifts

439
00:37:39,977 --> 00:37:42,477
for your latest achievement.

440
00:37:46,977 --> 00:37:49,477
From now on,

441
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:51,477
I wish you would be happy

442
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,477
for what you’ve chosen.
176
When is Air going back to France?

443
00:37:57,477 --> 00:38:00,477
Tonight.

444
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:23,977
We probably won't see each other again for a long time.

445
00:38:23,977 --> 00:38:26,977
Congratulations.

446
00:38:35,977 --> 00:38:36,977
Well,

447
00:38:36,977 --> 00:38:39,477
how’s Loft, anyway?

448
00:38:39,477 --> 00:38:40,477
I’ve never seen her with the terrible moment

449
00:38:40,477 --> 00:38:43,477
like that before.

450
00:38:43,477 --> 00:38:44,977
She hasn’t come to

451
00:38:44,977 --> 00:38:46,977
the house in Bangkok for more than a year.

452
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:48,977
But Loft is a die-hard person.

453
00:38:48,977 --> 00:38:51,477
She’ll get well soon.

454
00:39:15,977 --> 00:39:17,977
Thank you.

455
00:39:21,977 --> 00:39:23,977
Nom nom!

456
00:39:58,977 --> 00:40:03,477
Oh. Can I have a drinks menu?

457
00:40:49,477 --> 00:40:50,977
Have you been waiting for long,

458
00:40:50,977 --> 00:40:52,477
Honey?

459
00:40:58,977 --> 00:41:00,977
Hello, Pure.

460
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:28,977
You look strange.

461
00:41:28,977 --> 00:41:31,977
Why whispering, huh?

462
00:41:31,977 --> 00:41:33,477
As a lover,

463
00:41:33,477 --> 00:41:36,977
am I allowed to do so?

464
00:41:36,977 --> 00:41:39,477
Sure.

465
00:41:42,977 --> 00:41:44,977
We’ve been through so many things

466
00:41:44,977 --> 00:41:51,477
for the past couple of years.

467
00:41:51,477 --> 00:41:54,477
What?!

468
00:41:54,477 --> 00:41:55,977
Have you lately

469
00:41:55,977 --> 00:42:02,477
talked to Air?

470
00:42:02,477 --> 00:42:06,477
Hardly.

471
00:42:06,477 --> 00:42:08,477
She calls me

472
00:42:08,477 --> 00:42:12,477
to update things in general.

473
00:42:12,477 --> 00:42:14,477
But it’s about

474
00:42:14,477 --> 00:42:16,477
once a year.

475
00:42:19,477 --> 00:42:22,977
And,

476
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:25,977
she’s doing well.

477
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,477
She’s so many things

478
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:29,977
to do there.

479
00:42:29,977 --> 00:42:31,977
Also,

480
00:42:31,977 --> 00:42:34,977
she can do what she wants to do.

481
00:42:34,977 --> 00:42:38,477
Umm. It’s good to hear that.

482
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:49,477
I love you.

483
00:42:49,477 --> 00:42:52,477
I always love you.

484
00:42:52,477 --> 00:42:55,477
So do I.

485
00:43:01,977 --> 00:43:03,477
It’s getting late now.

486
00:43:03,477 --> 00:43:04,977
We shouldn’t let your parents wait.

487
00:43:04,977 --> 00:43:07,477
Let’s go back home.

488
00:43:07,477 --> 00:43:09,477
You don’t have to be in that hurry.

489
00:43:09,477 --> 00:43:11,477
No one can blame me.

490
00:43:11,477 --> 00:43:13,477
Go, now! Don’t be slow.

491
00:43:13,477 --> 00:43:14,477
Okay. Alright.

492
00:43:14,477 --> 00:43:16,977
I only give up on you.

493
00:43:21,477 --> 00:43:22,977
I’ve just had my hair styled.

494
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:25,477
It’s a mess now.

495
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,477
That’s too much.
