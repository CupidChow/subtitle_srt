1
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:07,456
What are you guys being sarcastic about?

2
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:11,367
Why don’t you try opening your heart to someone else?

3
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:12,547
What do you mean by someone else?

4
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:13,974
What if it’s me?

5
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:15,701
Do you fall for me?

6
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:17,783
If you’re that scared, why are you here …

7
00:00:17,783 --> 00:00:22,784
or were you afraid of secret voice recording and blackmailing?

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,607
How much is this one?

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,619
Saying you like me...

10
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:34,730
Are you trying to pull me away from them? You’re planning to get Air  back to your brother?

11
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:54,365
Hi, Loft.

12
00:00:54,365 --> 00:00:55,762
What are you doing?

13
00:00:55,762 --> 00:00:58,503
I’m working. What’s up?

14
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:03,726
Nothing. I just wanted to hear your voice.

15
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:13,982
Hello. Pure. Hello.

16
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:16,647
You heard my voice, didn’t you? What’s next?

17
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:21,576
You don’t want me to call you, do you?

18
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:24,738
Then I won’t call you anymore. … Bye.

19
00:01:24,738 --> 00:01:29,276
Wait! Wait! I didn’t say no.

20
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:36,207
So, can I keep calling you?

21
00:01:36,207 --> 00:01:39,080
Well, any other pieces to be delivered to the gallery?

22
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,527
Oops! I’m sorry.

23
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:46,710
You’ve to go back to work, right? So, I’m hanging up, then.

24
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:51,159
But can I call you again tomorrow?

25
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:56,133
Well, it’s up to you.

26
00:01:57,415 --> 00:02:00,007
Alright. Talk to you later.

27
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:22,997
I think we should take this and that for the Feminine Collection, okay?

28
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:25,188
Sure. This one will do.

29
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:28,171
Next, … this one.

30
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,363
Also, that one, Tem.

31
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:36,573
Can we add more seats to Zone C?

32
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,620
Is it possible? Like when entering the reception, we can see it on the opposite side and close to it.

33
00:02:41,548 --> 00:02:42,952
Okay.

34
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:47,080
So, at the moment we’re waiting for the key visual for promotion.

35
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,080
Will you use this painting?

36
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:55,853
Right. But I need a little more time to finish it.

37
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,182
Tem! It’s 8 p.m. now. Time to go home!

38
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:03,564
So, I’m going home now.

39
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:05,299
See you.

40
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:07,545
No problem. Leave it to me.

41
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,812
Girl...I’m literally sorry!

42
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:42,007
I didn’t want to be late, really.

43
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:43,516
It took so long to put my kids into bed.

44
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:46,007
P’Ben was late from work. The traffic was so terrible.

45
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:47,871
Why are you smiling?

46
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:49,407
What? No!?

47
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:51,380
Yes!! You did! seriously!

48
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,373
Normally, if I’m this late, you must complain to me until my ears are rining.

49
00:03:55,373 --> 00:03:57,373
There must be something wrong.

50
00:03:57,891 --> 00:03:59,453
You wanna order something?

51
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:01,317
Changing the subject?

52
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:03,290
I think you’ve spent too long time in Bangkok this time.

53
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,345
You’re falling for someone, aren’t you?

54
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:10,592
Well, maybe.

55
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:14,655
After getting married, you’ve left me to be lonely.

56
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:17,687
A margarita, please.

57
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:20,587
Come on! Next, who is that?

58
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:23,406
Tell me about her biodata. And do I know her?

59
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:25,188
Mother…calm down!

60
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:27,181
Alright.

61
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:31,305
She’s someone who can make me smile.

62
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:37,647
We’re not in a relationship, and I don't know if we can be or not.

63
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:38,556
Why not?

64
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:41,074
Well, she has someone else in her heart.

65
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:41,690
So?

66
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:44,863
So… Her heart isn’t welcoming me now.

67
00:04:44,863 --> 00:04:45,974
But she’s dating no one, right?

68
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:50,696
You’ve never thought too much like this before.

69
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:56,282
On the other hand, if this happened to me and I needed advice, you’d say something like this.

70
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:57,573
“Her heart isn’t free. So what?

71
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:59,874
But she has no one, seriously” … Am I right?

72
00:05:00,392 --> 00:05:01,523
Umm…you might be right.

73
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:04,642
Thank you.

74
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:06,724
Go get it!

75
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:10,128
Come on! Cheers to your next ride!

76
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:11,038
Cheers!

77
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,108
Hello. The same, please.

78
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:19,390
Hot latte with oat milk and a croissant. … To the same location, right?

79
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:22,242
Don’t you want something for breakfast?

80
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
No, I don’t. I’ve an appointment with Loft.

81
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,691
You’re almost replacing me as an older sibling of her

82
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:31,428
We’re women, so it’s simple.

83
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:33,767
Well,

84
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,095
next week, are you free, Air?

85
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:39,287
At the event, there must be a lot of seniors.

86
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:42,476
Don’t worry. I’ve managed my schedule for it.

87
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:50,502
Well, I’m not coming home tonight.

88
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,042
That’s fine as long as there’re no gossip.

89
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:57,490
How come?

90
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:01,647
The investigation with the gallery staff the day before works well.

91
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:04,411
Actually, my friend once asked me to take a course here.

92
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:08,777
But I’ve heard the queue is long until next year.

93
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:13,697
If I had known you owned this studio, I would have come to study here long ago.

94
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:17,487
Normally, I don’t teach here myself.

95
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:20,907
Some artists are hired to help teaching. It depends on the schedule.

96
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:28,742
Well, what if I’d like the studio owner to teach me, when is the best time to book?

97
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:35,541
If flirting is detected during a class, can I charge more?

98
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,589
No problem. I can pay for it.

99
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,282
I'm a hyperactive person.

100
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:47,879
So, I need to be taught by an acquaintance only.

101
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:52,308
Here, there’s only you whom I’ve known.

102
00:08:54,478 --> 00:08:59,295
Please! Please! Please! Be my teacher, please.

103
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:03,627
I’ll behave. I’m a good student here, I promise.

104
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:10,641
Okay. I’m checking my availability shortly. Wait!

105
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:24,927
The fastest class can be in the next two months.

106
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,809
But we’re closed on Sundays.

107
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,407
I can be here if you’re really interested.

108
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:42,418
Wow, this will be exclusively for me only, right?Oh, I feel so special.

109
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:45,887
To book or not to book, then?

110
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:46,578
Absolutely yes!

111
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:51,452
Wait for me, please. Teacher Pure, wait!

112
00:09:55,218 --> 00:10:00,608
Here is a storage where I keep my artworks as you can see.

113
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:02,362
Oh! Wow!

114
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:10,354
The paintings here are also for sale? I’ve seen there’re quite a lot.

115
00:10:11,052 --> 00:10:16,807
Ahh, these paintings are actually for the exhibition next month.

116
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:21,392
My paintings aren’t displayed or sold at general galleries.

117
00:10:21,392 --> 00:10:29,177
Well, mostly the paintings have been sold if someone really wants to buy them.
The ceramic works are more for sale.

118
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:38,500
That’s wonderful. Can I have a look at it?

119
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,260
The Mother Vase, right?

120
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:49,871
I gave it a name long ago.

121
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:51,487
No one wants to buy her.

122
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:56,571
But she’s the most beautiful, and that’s why she was named this way.

123
00:10:57,868 --> 00:11:04,158
You’re so good at naming things - from Miss Minnie to the Mother Vase.

124
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:06,647
Also, Pure of Loft.

125
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:08,367
What?!

126
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:12,847
Well, I mean the vase looks good. That’s it.

127
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:17,482
But it’s a bit too big for my place.

128
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:26,487
Well, can I take painting of the woman and the flowers instead?

129
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:30,392
My mom really loves sunflowers.

130
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:35,207
Umm, okay! Special price for you.

131
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,606
Really?

132
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:41,008
Another special thing makes me so happy.

133
00:11:42,177 --> 00:11:44,492
Actually, your artworks are awesome.

134
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,975
Maybe one day I’ll buy them all for my customers as gifts.

135
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,049
Umm…go ahead.

136
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:56,927
Oh, no! I’m late for an appointment.

137
00:11:57,165 --> 00:12:01,087
For that painting, I’ll let someone come and get it for me.

138
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,898
I’ve to go now.

139
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:03,889
Okay!

140
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:04,971
Bye.

141
00:12:13,411 --> 00:12:15,776
…Pure of Loft

142
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:59,927
Thanks a lot, Sis. The pastry here is so yummy.

143
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:06,266
You’re an easy person, you know? You can eat anything.

144
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:10,040
Unlike Lamp, he’s very picky.

145
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:13,575
I’m not that easy.

146
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:16,967
But I just love to try new things. Whatever, that’s yummy.

147
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:20,247
Then, if I find new places with yummy food, I’ll take you to eat.

148
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:21,483
Sure.

149
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,330
Your turn is next, okay?

150
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,647
Please, go Dutch.

151
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:32,193
No, please. I’m older and it must be on me.

152
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,692
No problem, then.

153
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:44,391
The painting’s been picked up.

154
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,435
Copied that.

155
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:49,871
Did you eat anything?

156
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:52,772
If not, are you joining me?

157
00:13:57,383 --> 00:14:00,007
Don’t you think I can eat a lot more with you
although I’m very full.

158
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,007
By the way, are you going home right away?

159
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:07,816
I’m not.

160
00:14:08,316 --> 00:14:13,345
I’m browsing things for the pool villas
and also for the maids.

161
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:17,317
Oh, you’re their favorite for sure.

162
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:21,363
Well, what are you looking for? Do you want me to help with anything?

163
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:24,945
Sure. If you’ve time for me, you can join me shopping.

164
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,964
Lamp told me you guys are going on a honeymoon trip at the end of this month, right?

165
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:32,956
Umm. Lamp’s been longing for the trip.

166
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:41,778
Well, earlier he was very busy with the company because of some changes,
but now things are getting much better.

167
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:47,326
The real reason for the trip delay isn’t really from working, is it?

168
00:14:50,218 --> 00:14:52,218
He’s been waiting for me for a long time.

169
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,407
Just 10 days from me isn’t that tough.

170
00:14:57,177 --> 00:14:59,013
Can it be only 10 days? Are you sure?

171
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:04,205
A couple must have to devote their time to each other forever. Am I right?

172
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:08,087
But are you sure if this’s going to be fine with you?

173
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,372
I’m a third party, so I couldn’t get involved with this that much.

174
00:15:17,855 --> 00:15:20,407
But I love you like you’re my sibling sister.

175
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:28,843
… But you don’t love him at all, do you?

176
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:42,007
I remember on the wedding day it looked like you engaged with nothing.

177
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:53,585
It’s fine. I’m okay. I know what I’m going to face with.

178
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:59,351
Having someone who really understands me is good enough.

179
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:04,052
Thank you, Loft.

180
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:15,511
Are you interested in a coffee machine?

181
00:16:15,838 --> 00:16:18,248
Yes. I actually have one, but it’s quite old.

182
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:21,599
This one seems good.

183
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,349
Pure…

184
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:27,567
Oh!

185
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:31,287
Pure, who are you here with?

186
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:33,083
By myself

187
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,247
…Hi, Loft!

188
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:39,765
Hello, Pure.

189
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:44,828
You’re frowning again. That lessens your beauty, you know?

190
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:46,997
Have I ever looked simple?

191
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:48,397
No. Never.

192
00:16:48,397 --> 00:16:50,397
A sweet talker, you are.

193
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,734
Well, do you drink this kind of coffee?

194
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,997
Yes. I think it’s cheaper than buying from shops.

195
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:20,744
Also, I don’t want to bother others, so making it myself maybe better.

196
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:29,511
Oh! Having it at home, you’ve to be careful not to drink too much coffee.

197
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:33,069
Are you worried about me?

198
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:36,479
What about giving me warnings at my place yourself?

199
00:17:39,194 --> 00:17:40,898
Well…you guys!

200
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:42,898
You can enjoy talking.

201
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:45,314
I’ll go and have a look at things there.

202
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:46,768
Okay.

203
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:48,010
I’ll be right back.

204
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:55,517
Try not to drink too much, you know?

205
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,422
So strict! Sigh…

206
00:17:59,054 --> 00:18:04,464
If you come to the studio to be my portrait model one day,
I’ll make the first coffee for you, okay?

207
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:11,545
You’ve already known I can’t do what I often used to do.

208
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:17,075
Well, …

209
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:22,206
I want to use the painting which you are in as the key visual in my exhibition

210
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:24,943
if you don’t mind.

211
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:30,696
Sure. Why not?

212
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:36,083
But the painting hasn’t been finished.

213
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:42,514
You’re frowning again.

214
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:45,398
That lessens your beauty, you know?

215
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:49,040
Have I ever looked simple?

216
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,061
No. Never.

217
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,502
You’re always gorgeous.

218
00:18:53,313 --> 00:18:54,356
A sweet talker, you are.

219
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,590
Hello, Loft.

220
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,105
Oh, really?

221
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:14,399
Well, I need to go home as well.

222
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:18,798
Okay. See you at home. Bye.

223
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:23,653
Loft’s in a hurry to go home. She’s to talk to her mom about something.

224
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:30,619
Well, it’s a pity that I also have an errand.

225
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:34,480
I’ve to go now.

226
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:41,006
Thank you for your concern

227
00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:42,564
… about the coffee.

228
00:19:51,746 --> 00:19:54,184
You can put it in the trunk.

229
00:19:58,303 --> 00:20:00,736
You left without saying goodbye, hah!

230
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:10,482
If one day she stops asking you to drink too much coffee,
it can be me who can replace the duty, okay?

231
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:14,355
LOL … If you can!

232
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:21,349
It was an exciting coincidence. What do you think?

233
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:29,495
It’s cold in Florence now, isn’t it?

234
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:35,474
Well, I’ve brought you a bed sheet from there.

235
00:20:35,832 --> 00:20:38,948
Their embroidery works and laces are very well known.

236
00:20:39,116 --> 00:20:40,795
Thank you so much, Sis.

237
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:43,381
It’s very beautiful.

238
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,491
There’s nothing compared to what you’ve done for my family.

239
00:20:48,507 --> 00:20:51,428
Our husbands were friends for so long.

240
00:20:51,702 --> 00:20:55,444
If he was still alive, Thod also would like us to become the same family, anyway.

241
00:20:56,028 --> 00:21:00,738
Talking about Air, she’s a perfect woman. Having Air as a wife, Lamp is so lucky.

242
00:21:03,312 --> 00:21:06,265
Oh, what are you loading here, Loft?

243
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:09,081
Hello, Auntie.

244
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:13,771
I just bought a painting. I think it’ll really suit your office, Mom.

245
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,297
Wow! It’s very beautiful!

246
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,076
Where did you get it from, anyway?

247
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:21,844
Well, I got it from a gallery near the River City, Mom.

248
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:25,466
Pureproud? …

249
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:29,550
She’s a very famous artist.

250
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,731
Loft, you’ve discerning eyes.

251
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,241
Really? Oh, it’s very good then.

252
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:42,152
So if you find more of her works, you can collect them for me.

253
00:21:42,152 --> 00:21:44,278
They can be gifts for my friends.

254
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:45,562
Sure, Mom.

255
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:01,919
Oh, whose room is that?

256
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:03,520
Err, …

257
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:07,099
Hello, Auntie.

258
00:22:07,436 --> 00:22:08,194
Hi.

259
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:10,489
Since when did you come here, Auntie?

260
00:22:10,826 --> 00:22:13,747
You’d better call me Mom. No more Auntie!

261
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:16,324
I’ve been calling you Auntie since I was young.

262
00:22:16,892 --> 00:22:19,372
All right. Air hasn’t come back yet?

263
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:23,216
Well, she’s been busy with her work and coming home late recently.

264
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:28,894
I’ve brought you guys a bedding set from Italy,
and it’s been washed and ready for use.

265
00:22:29,673 --> 00:22:30,732
Thank you so much.

266
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:32,966
Well, Phen.
Please make the bed.

267
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:33,466
Okay.

268
00:22:41,044 --> 00:22:42,819
… I’ve got an office call.

269
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,676
Please take care of it, Phen.

270
00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:46,329
Okay

271
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:47,380
Auntie …

272
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,074
Mom! Please join us dinner.

273
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,910
Don’t worry. I’ll leave when it’s done.

274
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,257
Are you sure you’re fine with it?

275
00:22:56,257 --> 00:22:57,057
Sure, I am.

276
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:59,137
So, excuse me for answering the phone.

277
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:00,042
At your convenience.

278
00:23:02,105 --> 00:23:03,688
Yes, Phat.

279
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:44,443
Purepround?!

280
00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:55,676
Very beautiful.

281
00:23:55,676 --> 00:23:57,676
Take it upstairs, then.

282
00:23:57,676 --> 00:24:00,197
Leena, I’ve to go now.

283
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:01,434
Eh?

284
00:24:04,507 --> 00:24:05,939
Loft, see you later.

285
00:24:07,307 --> 00:24:08,552
Goodbye, Auntie.

286
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:12,019
We’re meeting again on the event day, okay?

287
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:12,819
Sure.

288
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:16,777
I’ve ordered a lot of food. Please ask your friends to come and join us.

289
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:19,661
Alright. Let's start by molding the clay first.

290
00:24:20,545 --> 00:24:22,705
Okay, I'll show you how to do this first.

291
00:24:22,705 --> 00:24:24,489
We'll knead it slowly like this.

292
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:29,019
Whoa, this one. Wait! Let me help you mold it first.

293
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:32,819
What are you going to do with this one?

294
00:24:34,145 --> 00:24:36,419
Just press it down like this.

295
00:24:36,672 --> 00:24:37,993
Pure! Pure! Pure!

296
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:38,640
What’s up?

297
00:24:39,356 --> 00:24:41,356
Do you remember Ms. Jay?

298
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:44,108
The customer once asking us to send the items catalog for the birthday gift.

299
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,177
Her representative is here now to see your works.

300
00:24:47,177 --> 00:24:49,572
Really? Where’s the representative?

301
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,118
This’s Pure. She’s an artist and the studio’s owner.

302
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,507
Hello.

303
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:03,522
Hello. I’m Ms. Jay’s representative.

304
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:08,280
Ms. Jay really likes the catalog photo of the painting previously sent, and she’s buying it.

305
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:13,811
Well, the birthday owner also appreciates your artworks very much

306
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:16,916
Just put it simply, she’s a big fan of you

307
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:23,320
Ms. Jay wanted you to join the birthday party and present the painting yourself.

308
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:26,899
Would it be possible? What do you think?

309
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:34,273
Having me there to present the painting by myself?

310
00:25:35,473 --> 00:25:37,819
I’d say that coming night is a very special day.

311
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:41,861
Ms. Jay’s seriously asked me to send you the message.

312
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:46,087
If you could make it, the gift receiver would be so happy. Can you, please?

313
00:25:48,508 --> 00:25:50,045
Can you, please?

314
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:58,536
Okay. I’ll be there.

315
00:25:58,705 --> 00:25:59,553
Thank you.

316
00:25:59,911 --> 00:26:01,926
Then shall we go and discuss this in detail over there?

317
00:26:01,926 --> 00:26:02,593
Certainly.

318
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:03,394
Please.

319
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:05,675
Please take care of this.

320
00:26:17,254 --> 00:26:19,254
Tem, you haven’t left yet?

321
00:26:26,327 --> 00:26:28,374
… Oh, Air!

322
00:26:29,637 --> 00:26:30,963
What brought you here?

323
00:26:32,016 --> 00:26:33,181
Aren’t you afraid you’ve seen by someone?

324
00:26:33,623 --> 00:26:37,587
A little bit. I’ve just had a meeting nearby.

325
00:26:38,855 --> 00:26:43,112
Then I could remember … a small girl here hasn’t finished her painting yet.

326
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,848
So, I just wanted to help her out.

327
00:26:51,281 --> 00:26:58,198
When you’re smiling, that’s the best.

328
00:27:00,471 --> 00:27:04,457
Why did you say yes when I asked you to use this painting for the opening event?

329
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,710
It’s because you paint it the best ever.

330
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,604
Why did you say yes when I asked you to use this painting for the opening event?

331
00:28:17,351 --> 00:28:19,217
Because you’re not good at painting a portrait.

332
00:28:19,217 --> 00:28:20,670
Air!

333
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:26,294
Just kidding.

334
00:28:26,294 --> 00:28:28,294
It’s because you paint it the best ever.

335
00:28:29,412 --> 00:28:40,783
And if I miss the exhibition, this painting can be there to give your moral support.

336
00:29:25,803 --> 00:29:28,656
Excuse me. I’ll go and have a chat with my friends.

337
00:29:28,656 --> 00:29:30,427
Hi. How are things?

338
00:29:30,427 --> 00:29:31,507
Oh! Hi, Cream!

339
00:29:35,036 --> 00:29:37,302
It’s alright. No problem.

340
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,226
I’ll go talk to my brother.

341
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,806
Air hasn’t arrived yet?

342
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,900
Uh, she said she was on the way.

343
00:29:54,573 --> 00:29:58,387
Hey, Loft. Can you remember?

344
00:30:21,456 --> 00:30:22,332
Hello.

345
00:30:22,332 --> 00:30:23,313
Hello.

346
00:30:23,512 --> 00:30:24,717
Happy birthday!

347
00:30:24,717 --> 00:30:26,717
Thank you, Mom.

348
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:33,113
Thank you for coming.

349
00:30:33,113 --> 00:30:34,318
You’re welcome.

350
00:30:36,148 --> 00:30:38,183
They’re a perfect couple.

351
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:39,239
I agree.

352
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:10,807
I’ve arrived.

353
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:12,534
Okay, Ms. Pure. I’ll be there for you shortly.

354
00:31:12,534 --> 00:31:13,689
Okay.

355
00:31:17,747 --> 00:31:18,905
Loft’s house!?

356
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:24,115
Be careful. Slowly, please.

357
00:31:24,785 --> 00:31:26,313
Hello, Ms. Pure.

358
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:27,733
Hello.

359
00:31:28,757 --> 00:31:32,788
Please go inside. Ms. Jay’s going to start the surprise for the birthday owner shortly.

360
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:33,471
Okay.

361
00:31:41,152 --> 00:31:42,187
Let’s unwrap it now.

362
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:45,967
Be careful!

363
00:31:49,596 --> 00:31:51,869
Actually, your artworks are awesome.

364
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:56,396
Maybe one day I’ll buy them all for my customers as gifts.

365
00:31:58,073 --> 00:31:59,750
Loft ordered this painting?

366
00:32:05,427 --> 00:32:06,005
Please.

367
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:06,943
Alright.

368
00:32:16,547 --> 00:32:18,015
Here it is.

369
00:32:32,345 --> 00:32:34,345
Pure? How come she’s here?

370
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:40,780
Happy birthday, Lamp.

371
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,780
This’s for you from Air.

372
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:54,536
Purepround, this painting artist,
has been invited here to present her painting to you, Lamp.

373
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:57,902
Please Ms. Pure.

374
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:04,622
I can represent this myself.

375
00:33:05,427 --> 00:33:06,707
That’s okay, Loft.

376
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,543
I think the artist would want to make it herself.

377
00:33:09,941 --> 00:33:10,441
Mom!?

378
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,783
What’s happening, Air?

379
00:33:13,454 --> 00:33:15,827
Or it could be you who’s doing this instead?

380
00:33:20,427 --> 00:33:21,506
Lamp, are you ready?

381
00:33:22,624 --> 00:33:23,895
Please, Ms. Pure.

382
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:33,488
Happy birthday!

383
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:35,987
Thank you.

384
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:42,478
Photos, please.

385
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,027
Mind your manner!

386
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:05,726
The painting is very beautiful, really!

387
00:34:06,273 --> 00:34:08,114
Awesome! Brilliant!

388
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:20,969
Pure! Wait, Pure! Wait for me, please!

389
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:25,427
Leave me alone!

390
00:34:25,427 --> 00:34:26,234
No!

391
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,433
I won’t let you leave like this!.

392
00:34:30,247 --> 00:34:31,648
… Come here!

393
00:34:31,648 --> 00:34:33,987
What?! Where to?

394
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,998
What you’ve faced wasn’t right at all.

395
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:42,033
… Let me be with you, please.

396
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:35,123
I don’t want you to be like this at all.

397
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:44,033
If you meet someone right, please don’t wait for me any longer.

398
00:35:45,649 --> 00:35:47,227
I’ll be fine.

399
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:54,637
I haven’t been waiting for you, and you never ask me to do so.

400
00:35:58,191 --> 00:36:02,898
But it isn’t easy, you know? What can I do?

401
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:21,197
If we meet, and you feel bad like this.

402
00:36:23,872 --> 00:36:28,759
I’m not coming here for you anymore.

403
00:37:35,084 --> 00:37:36,524
Is it midnight dinner time?

404
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:38,474
I’m not taking you to dinner.

405
00:37:38,797 --> 00:37:40,427
Of course I know where I am taking you

406
00:37:41,148 --> 00:37:42,261
Hurry up!

407
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:54,205
One is enough. I don’t want to drink too much.

408
00:38:05,427 --> 00:38:07,390
…Everything seems to be very easy for Air.

409
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:11,855
You can pretend to love someone.

410
00:38:11,855 --> 00:38:13,855
But I can’t.

411
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,634
After this, F*** you! I won’t care about anything.

412
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:22,001
Enjoy your love.

413
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:29,140
I’ll stop waiting! I’ll do what I want. You’ll see it.

414
00:38:38,187 --> 00:38:40,682
Why are you looking at me like this?

415
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,952
Just wanted to know how you feel about me?

416
00:38:50,264 --> 00:38:57,130
You’re drunk. If you come with me, I don’t let you do this with others.

417
00:38:59,665 --> 00:39:01,587
Like what?!

418
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:13,079
I’m not drunk, I insist.

419
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,147
Why not?

420
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:17,688
If I’m drunk, Air will complain me.

421
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:25,041
So, you’ve never been drunk at all?

422
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:30,427
Yes, I can get drunk but with her only.

423
00:39:30,874 --> 00:39:39,883
Air is jealous. … No, I mean she used to be.

424
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:45,189
Sure. When you’re drunk, you look so sweet.

425
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,498
If I were her, I’d do the same thing.

426
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:57,062
I’m sorry for what you’ve faced.

427
00:39:58,702 --> 00:40:02,765
You must have hated my brother a lot, right?

428
00:40:03,162 --> 00:40:08,906
Yes. I hate everyone who’s been involving with this – those who’ve caused this mass.

429
00:40:09,964 --> 00:40:11,395
You brother,

430
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:13,817
your family

431
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:19,275
and also Air’s mother.

432
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:25,427
Air isn’t counted, then.

433
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,633
How can I hate her?

434
00:40:32,945 --> 00:40:34,811
Because you’ve loved her too much, right?

435
00:40:36,203 --> 00:40:38,203
But the truth is the truth.

436
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:41,735
She doesn’t belong to me anymore.

437
00:41:04,947 --> 00:41:09,373
If you’re ready, let me know, okay?

438
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,427
Loft.

439
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,420
Well, see you next time.

440
00:41:39,084 --> 00:41:40,372
Thank you, Khun Prem.

441
00:41:42,478 --> 00:41:43,412
Have a safe ride.

442
00:41:43,412 --> 00:41:44,503
Thank you.

443
00:41:53,088 --> 00:41:56,179
Mom! Mom, listen!

444
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:58,954
Why are you so mean?

445
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:03,499
You’ve known that Pure …

446
00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:06,071
What? What’s wrong?

447
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:08,758
Why are you so upset?

448
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:16,057
I just wanted to help you both understand things easily.

449
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:21,925
You should know who you are and what you must do.

450
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:29,277
Your dad left us with the failed business when he died.

451
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,907
Can you remember the time that we broke?

452
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,248
You want to have the same old feeling?

453
00:42:50,046 --> 00:42:55,433
Her paintings in your room, also! Throw them away!

454
00:42:55,433 --> 00:42:57,433
No more mourning!

455
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:17,676
Are you alright?

456
00:43:18,248 --> 00:43:19,978
Come on!

457
00:43:41,397 --> 00:43:42,399
Why are you smiling?

458
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:45,475
You’re cute when you’re drunk.

459
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:49,618
Naughty!

460
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:01,816
You’ve a lot of choices, don’t you?

461
00:44:03,304 --> 00:44:07,804
You’re this beautiful. I don’t think there’s none in your hot queue.

462
00:44:10,116 --> 00:44:15,138
I can’t stand waiting for you. That’ll be too lonely.

463
00:44:17,342 --> 00:44:21,812
Waiting but not feeling lonely. That’s fair enough.

464
00:44:23,422 --> 00:44:26,841
If you were in my shoes, you wouldn’t let yourself be in loneliness either.

465
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:29,114
How do you know?

466
00:44:29,526 --> 00:44:34,021
About what? That you’ve been waiting for your loved one?

467
00:44:34,804 --> 00:44:36,804
Or that you don’t want to feel lonely?

468
00:44:38,086 --> 00:44:39,704
Both.

469
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:42,363
Am I right, anyway?

470
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:51,145
If you’re ready, let me know, okay?

471
00:44:57,509 --> 00:44:58,211
Loft.

472
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,715
Thank you.

473
00:45:18,102 --> 00:45:18,785
No problem.

474
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,370
How come I’ve fallen for this lady?

475
00:46:28,308 --> 00:46:30,469
Loft.

476
00:46:52,506 --> 00:46:54,411
Oh, you’re up?

477
00:46:55,327 --> 00:46:56,442
Yes.

478
00:47:01,868 --> 00:47:03,525
I’m sorry for everything last night.

479
00:47:03,525 --> 00:47:10,663
That’s my mom’s style. She did it because she doesn’t want to lose anything.

480
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:16,807
She’s pitiful, actually. She always seeks happiness from others.

481
00:47:17,608 --> 00:47:19,837
When will your mom stop being bad?

482
00:47:23,294 --> 00:47:26,530
She did it because she’s known you still love me as always.

483
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:36,794
Aw, you can’t even admit you still love me.

484
00:47:41,144 --> 00:47:43,146
I can’t, Pure.

485
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:49,894
What your mom has done to me doesn’t even hurt half as much as what I’ve seen.

486
00:47:52,275 --> 00:47:56,758
However, you both … are a good match.

487
00:47:59,391 --> 00:48:01,391
But how long must I endure this?

488
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:07,501
You see? As usual, you keep quiet!

489
00:48:09,996 --> 00:48:12,078
I’ve never wanted this, Pure.

490
00:48:12,078 --> 00:48:12,819
Please leave me alone.

491
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,996
I’ve got a headache. I want to take a rest.

492
00:48:29,129 --> 00:48:33,129
Well, no more coffee or anything for me!

493
00:48:33,724 --> 00:48:35,220
I want nothing from you.

494
00:49:22,457 --> 00:49:24,045
Is this yours?

495
00:49:26,045 --> 00:49:28,434
Aw…I lost again.

496
00:49:29,602 --> 00:49:32,266
You meant it to be at first, didn’t you?

497
00:49:34,378 --> 00:49:37,337
Why don’t you tell me we had met before?

498
00:49:38,029 --> 00:49:42,726
I wanted to tell you before, but I think that night wasn’t that important.

499
00:49:43,688 --> 00:49:45,958
If it was a remarkable one, you’d get it long ago.

500
00:49:46,828 --> 00:49:52,032
Yes. That night was important for me. Very important!

501
00:49:54,527 --> 00:49:57,231
‘You don’t need to act so strong.’

502
00:49:58,742 --> 00:50:00,742
… You said it, didn’t you?

503
00:50:04,497 --> 00:50:05,739
Thank you.

504
00:50:10,134 --> 00:50:12,134
We’re starting.

505
00:50:18,452 --> 00:50:20,183
Let me help you with this.

506
00:50:21,648 --> 00:50:23,648
First, start with the head.

507
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:36,052
What if your student died here?

508
00:50:38,856 --> 00:50:39,966
What about tightening your hair?

509
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:41,221
Will you?

510
00:50:42,228 --> 00:50:45,381
You’re a tough one. Please sit down, Student!

511
00:50:51,612 --> 00:50:53,806
Stop fidgeting!

512
00:50:58,959 --> 00:51:00,060
Up!

513
00:51:03,139 --> 00:51:05,139
We’ll try kneading the soil, first.

514
00:51:18,965 --> 00:51:22,842
Try holding like this. Okay?

515
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:37,820
If you meet someone right, please don’t wait for me any longer. I’ll be fine.

516
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:46,622
I haven’t been waiting for you.

517
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,656
… and you never ask me to do so.
