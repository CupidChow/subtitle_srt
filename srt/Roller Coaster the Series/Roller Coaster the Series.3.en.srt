00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,000
Happy birthday, Lamp.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,625
This is for you, from Air.

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:14,666
You must …

4
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,541
have hated my brother a lot, right?

5
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:17,500
Yes.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,583
I hate everyone who’s been involved with this.

7
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,958
When will your mom stop being bad?

8
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,833
If you meet someone right,

9
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,083
please don’t wait for me any longer.

10
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,416
I haven’t been waiting for you,

11
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,541
and you never ask me to do so.

12
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:37,958
Air…

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,375
Anyone who marries Air will be very happy.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,625
Air, will you marry me?

15
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,875
Yes, I will.

16
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,583
You promised me.

17
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:57,166
Hello, Mom.

18
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,250
(Juthamas’s voice on the phone) : Air…your dad passed away.

19
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,250
(Juthamas’s voice on the phone) : He had a stroke.

20
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:03,791
Air…

21
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,750
(Juthamas’s voice on the phone) : He’s left us.

22
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:07,625
What happened to your dad?

23
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:11,833
Wait for me here … I’ll come back.

24
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:01,333
Is it right?

25
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,666
Try it yourself first. Carefully hold it.

26
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,000
Make it in a good balance.

27
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,916
No! Not at all. Not like that.

28
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:24,208
You’ve to hold it in for a balance.

29
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:49,416
You’re allowed to flirt, not to kiss, okay?

30
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,083
Attention! It’s going to be out of shape now.

31
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,500
Ooh!

32
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,083
Ooh, Pure!

33
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,291
What?

34
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,416
How come? Come on!

35
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,041
Why are that clean?

36
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:04,333
Miss …

37
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,083
As a teacher, I can instruct you.

38
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:07,666
Miss …

39
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,041
Stop complaining!

40
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,833
Will I finish the cup by today?

41
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,416
Have you arrived home yet?

42
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,458
Just arrived. Why?

43
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,791
Are you afraid I’m seeing someone?

44
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,916
What’s that cool on the phone, huh?

45
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,458
You came back with such big smiles on your face.

46
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:37,000
What about you? Why don’t you go back to your place?

47
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,041
Or…you had a fight with Air again?

48
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,375
Oh! Loft.

49
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,083
Air’s here?

50
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:43,458
Uh.

51
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,708
Hello.

52
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,208
Hi. You’re back.

53
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:48,666
Yes.

54
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:53,583
At first, we thought you’d been at home.

55
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,583
We just wanted to ask you to dine with Dad and Mom.

56
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,208
Oh. I got a slight change of plans.

57
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,250
I hadn’t known you guys would be here.

58
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,666
I was bored, I went out for something to eat.

59
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,458
I’m full now.

60
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,083
You went to some friends?

61
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:06,625
Right.

62
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,875
You’ve been out a lot since you came back to Bangkok this time.

63
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,875
Oh, I almost forgot that …

64
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,625
you’ve no one in Phetchaburi.

65
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,166
Why are you complaining a lot. I’m packing up my stuff upstairs.

66
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,041
I’ve to go back. Tomorrow morning, I’m having a meeting.

67
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,083
See you later, Air.

68
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,125
Safe drive, Loft.

69
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:23,916
Thank you.

70
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,750
I’ll wait for you in the car. Okay?

71
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,291
Sure.

72
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,541
Here you are, Pure.

73
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,000
Who are you waiting for?

74
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,041
Umm…a customer.

75
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,166
Customer...

76
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,750
A customer? Which one?

77
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:47,833
Customer...

78
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,000
A European customer.

79
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,125
Hmm. A European customer?

80
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,375
What about Loft’s cups? Do you want me to ship them to her?

81
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,583
I’ll take care of them.

82
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,583
Alright.

83
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,625
Err…Pure.

84
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,083
I’ll go and check some items out there.

85
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,583
I think there might be some items missing.

86
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:16,291
Sure.

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,666
You’ve missed me, so you called me, right?

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,291
You kept calling me, and you disappeared.

89
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,041
I thought there was something with you.

90
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,583
It’s the 21-day rule?

91
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,875
21 days?

92
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:13,333
I had planned to make you get used to my calling for 21 days in a row.

93
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,541
Then, you see? You’ve been trapped.

94
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,291
So…you miss me, really?

95
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,250
You want the truth?

96
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,625
Oh! With this tone of voice.

97
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,666
Maybe not. I don’t want to be disappointed.

98
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,791
Well, why are you calling?

99
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,875
Err…your cups.

100
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,458
They’ve been fired and are finished.

101
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,833
Where should they be shipped to? To the pool villa?

102
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,583
Well. It’s good to hear that.

103
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,291
But if they’re shipped,

104
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,166
I’m afraid they are broken during the shipment.

105
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,625
My LP Cups are so special to me.

106
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,500
Exaggerating!

107
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,583
Then how can I help, Miss?

108
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:59,916
What about your shipping service at the pool villa?

109
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,541
If not, you’ve to wait for my next Bangkok visit.

110
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,041
But I don’t know when.

111
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,916
Sigh…I’ve longed for using the couple cups.

112
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,166
Anyway, I just wanted to let you know there’re many vacant rooms here.

113
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,750
I just wanted to let you know there’re many vacant rooms here.

114
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,791
No girlfriend. No one. I’m alone.

115
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,083
So lonely.

116
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,083
So, keep calm and carry on.

117
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:28,125
If I have time someday, I’ll see you there.

118
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,166
But I don’t have time these days, so just leave them here.

119
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,500
Oh! Disappointing.

120
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,916
What shall I do? I’ve tried convincing and persuading.

121
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:41,750
Maybe, this is the weakness of admiring someone one-sidedly.

122
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,125
You’ve talked too much.

123
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:47,958
Well. If you miss me, please call again.

124
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,791
Enough.

125
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,541
That’s all. Bye.

126
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,083
Bye.

127
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,000
Why are you smiling, Pure?

128
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:19,916
Hello.

129
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:20,875
Pure.

130
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,958
I’ve an errand here around the studio.

131
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,333
Are you in? Can I see you there?

132
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,333
Yes, I am.

133
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,291
Do you want something to eat?

134
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:37,666
No. I’m fine. I’m not hungry. You don’t need to buy anything.

135
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,833
Alright.

136
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,250
See you.

137
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,291
So, you’re here for an idea?

138
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,250
Or for me?

139
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,583
Do you need to know?

140
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:25,029
What have you been doing around here?

141
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:28,237
Just visited a mall.

142
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:30,404
Well,

143
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:33,029
next week I’m not seeing you.

144
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:36,654
I’ve to go to France.

145
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,487
For work.

146
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:42,112
Oh, … I see.

147
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:44,112
I’ll miss you so much then.

148
00:10:49,154 --> 00:10:50,779
Have you still got the perfume left?

149
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,570
By the way,

150
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,154
I bought you a new bottle.

151
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,820
Air…

152
00:10:57,695 --> 00:11:00,445
You don’t need to buy me everything, you know?

153
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,737
By the way, this is Bam’s new product.

154
00:11:14,737 --> 00:11:17,904
She wants me to do her marketing.

155
00:11:18,737 --> 00:11:20,904
But I haven’t come up with a concept.

156
00:11:25,362 --> 00:11:27,862
So, I think I might get it after I see this on your lips.

157
00:12:13,154 --> 00:12:14,654
I got it!

158
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:19,320
This lip gloss …

159
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,612
should target those who work hard but want some good vibes.

160
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:26,404
When looking into a mirror,

161
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:28,029
they should feel fresh.

162
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:37,654
Well, are you alright?

163
00:12:37,654 --> 00:12:42,154
Yes. I’m a bit tired.

164
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:49,404
If it’s like that, you’re doing goof with the studio.

165
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:50,487
It’s a bit tiring.

166
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:52,154
But you’re still happy, right?

167
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:53,904
Our studio, not mine.

168
00:12:54,612 --> 00:12:58,987
It was you who made this happen.

169
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,195
Anyway, how’s your life?

170
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,695
Well, he and his family …

171
00:13:09,695 --> 00:13:12,195
They’re good, right?

172
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:15,737
Uh.

173
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:20,154
Good. It’s good that they’ve treated you well.

174
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:36,029
Do you like this?

175
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:44,529
So you’re here for an idea.

176
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:47,112
Or you’re here for me?

177
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,320
Just say it… that you’ve missed me.

178
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:56,154
Do you need to know?

179
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:58,070
Yes, I do.

180
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:02,445
I just wanted to hear from you.

181
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:05,987
As far as I can remember …

182
00:14:05,987 --> 00:14:08,904
it’s only me who has been

183
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:10,862
saying this.

184
00:14:13,362 --> 00:14:17,904
I miss you every day.

185
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:19,320
Pure …

186
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,820
Do you ever know?

187
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,529
Since the day you told me

188
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:27,154
you would marry me.

189
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:32,445
I’ve never forgotten it.

190
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,112
We do love each other, don’t we?

191
00:14:45,112 --> 00:14:48,112
Why has it turned out like this?

192
00:15:12,237 --> 00:15:16,029
Air, will you marry me?

193
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:18,404
Yes, I will.

194
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:18,445
Hello.

195
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:23,737
Do you find everything alright?

196
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:24,529
Yes.

197
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,320
Thank you very much. Please come back again next time.

198
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,695
Thank you.

199
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:38,112
Is everything alright?

200
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:39,612
Yes.

201
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:41,029
We’re fully booked today.

202
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:41,612
Yes.

203
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:43,487
Hello. Welcome to Vela Villa!

204
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,445
Shipment, please.

205
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:03,862
I can pay for a room, actually.

206
00:17:03,862 --> 00:17:06,362
To support your business.

207
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:09,195
You’re here because you’ve been invited. Am I right?

208
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,779
You’re not an ordinary customer, you know?

209
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:14,570
Maybe, but I don’t want to disturb you.

210
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:17,737
Sigh … You’re here for me, right?

211
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,154
You’re welcome to my place, then.

212
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:22,570
Here you are. Your room is here.

213
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:28,737
Don’t think too much.

214
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:30,862
You’re not staying with me.

215
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,654
I haven’t said anything yet.

216
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:35,362
Huh?!

217
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:41,279
Well, make yourself at home.

218
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,237
I’ve asked a maid to prepare you luncheon.

219
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:46,070
I’ll be back for dinner with you.

220
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:47,945
See you.

221
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:50,112
Uh.

222
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:51,779
Oh!

223
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:52,445
Huh?

224
00:17:52,445 --> 00:17:53,195
I almost forgot something.

225
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:55,112
What?

226
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:56,904
I miss you.

227
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,987
Enough! Go to work now!

228
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:02,904
See you!

229
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:55,904
Now, we’re in France.

230
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:58,112
Anyone wants something from here?

231
00:18:58,112 --> 00:19:01,237
Look for a good location for making a hotel there.

232
00:19:01,237 --> 00:19:05,695
Stop, Dad. He’s on a honeymoon trip.

233
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:07,695
Enjoy your trip!

234
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:08,695
Okay, Mom.

235
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:10,654
Honeymoon?

236
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,570
With that serious stare,

237
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,654
Will you join me for swimming?

238
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:19,445
Umm…

239
00:20:19,445 --> 00:20:22,695
You still look so good without makeup.

240
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:32,445
Well,

241
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:33,779
are you hungry?

242
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:36,070
Uh…not much.

243
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,904
You can enjoy swimming.

244
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,237
No, enough for me.

245
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:41,904
Can I take a shower first?

246
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:43,487
Then we can have dinner together.

247
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:45,654
Can you wait for me?

248
00:20:45,654 --> 00:20:47,237
No problem at all.

249
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:49,195
Come on. Let me help!

250
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:52,862
Oh, no!

251
00:21:29,195 --> 00:21:30,362
Thank you.

252
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:57,112
So, where are we going?

253
00:21:57,654 --> 00:21:59,279
To my hidden gem!

254
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:01,195
Here?

255
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:01,904
Uh.

256
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,052
What?

257
00:22:26,552 --> 00:22:28,427
Why are you here for?

258
00:22:28,427 --> 00:22:30,302
At first it seemed like you didn't want to come.

259
00:22:31,927 --> 00:22:35,927
I came here because someone had tried to sell the pool villa service very hard.

260
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:38,302
And I’m here for the shipment.

261
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,677
So, you’re not here as Air’s on the honeymoon trip.

262
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:51,802
So, don’t tell me …

263
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:53,969
You don’t know about the trip?

264
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:03,010
If I came here because Air was on the honeymoon trip …

265
00:23:03,677 --> 00:23:05,135
What would it be?

266
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,635
Well, I would be a bit sad.

267
00:23:08,635 --> 00:23:10,427
I don’t know.

268
00:23:10,427 --> 00:23:11,927
I don’t want to replace anyone. That’s it.

269
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:14,927
I don’t want to replace anyone. That’s it.

270
00:23:16,052 --> 00:23:17,510
Then …

271
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,302
Then … are you okay?

272
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:24,302
I think she’d been on that kind of trip long ago.

273
00:23:25,844 --> 00:23:28,052
It’s been 3 years up until now they got married.

274
00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:30,594
So, don’t you feel sad?

275
00:23:30,594 --> 00:23:33,052
No. I’ve been sad up until now.

276
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:38,927
I’m sorry.

277
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:40,885
Nothing is yummy, now.

278
00:23:40,885 --> 00:23:43,052
You don’t have to say sorry.

279
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:45,010
It’s not your fault.

280
00:23:55,344 --> 00:23:56,552
Hey!

281
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:58,010
Ooh!

282
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,385
Upset?

283
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:01,719
I’ll stop feeding you with ready-to-eat crab meat or prawns.

284
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:02,719
That’s fine.

285
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:04,385
I’ve enough here.

286
00:24:04,802 --> 00:24:06,552
Ooh! What about mine?

287
00:24:06,552 --> 00:24:08,219
My hands hurt now.

288
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:10,802
You can repeat the same things.

289
00:24:11,469 --> 00:24:13,594
No, you can’t do this to me.

290
00:24:13,594 --> 00:24:15,260
Can I share some with you?

291
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,177
There are a lot left.

292
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:17,635
The whole six prawns are mine.

293
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:19,219
The whole six prawns are mine.

294
00:24:19,635 --> 00:24:22,635
Why am I this poor. Pitiful Loft!

295
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:26,552
Thanks.

296
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:27,969
Sure.

297
00:24:50,177 --> 00:24:51,469
Well, Air.

298
00:24:51,469 --> 00:24:54,385
Shall we go for a walk around Saint-Georges?

299
00:24:54,385 --> 00:24:57,719
I’ve heard there’s an art exhibition.

300
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:59,677
You like art, don’t you?

301
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:04,094
If you really want to go, please do so.

302
00:25:04,094 --> 00:25:05,760
I want to do my work.

303
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:09,344
Air…you forget why we’re here for?

304
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:11,094
Air…you forget why we’re here for?

305
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,052
You can’t keep working while we’re here.

306
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:16,969
So, what about this?

307
00:25:16,969 --> 00:25:18,219
If you want to go somewhere,

308
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,219
you can let me know.

309
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:20,010
I’m willing to take you wherever.

310
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,844
Lamp!

311
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,219
You know?

312
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:28,552
I’m here with you as I want to please your parents.

313
00:25:28,552 --> 00:25:31,260
I don’t want to go anywhere.

314
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,594
You can enjoy it yourself.

315
00:25:32,594 --> 00:25:33,802
You don’t have to worry about me.

316
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:50,635
I don’t want to lie to my parents anymore.

317
00:25:50,635 --> 00:25:52,135
I don’t want them to think I’m happy.

318
00:25:59,469 --> 00:26:01,344
How can I be happy?

319
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,302
As long as you treat me like this.

320
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:07,260
But you’ve been in this situation for many years.

321
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,844
Yes, I’ve been enduring.

322
00:26:08,844 --> 00:26:10,677
I’ve been enduring.

323
00:26:10,677 --> 00:26:13,427
I’ve been waiting to see whether you’re turning to me someday.

324
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:16,719
For the entire period we’ve been together,

325
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:19,719
have you ever thought about my feelings?

326
00:26:20,385 --> 00:26:22,885
Have you known how terrible I have been?

327
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,094
I don’t understand you at all!

328
00:26:29,094 --> 00:26:30,719
Why do you have to endure this?

329
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:33,177
It’s because I love you.

330
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:35,177
That’s easy. Don’t you get it?

331
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,219
One-sided love, you mean?

332
00:26:39,219 --> 00:26:41,094
It’s not love, you know?

333
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:48,344
Love?

334
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:51,135
No.

335
00:26:52,302 --> 00:26:53,135
I can’t let it go.

336
00:26:53,135 --> 00:26:54,594
If we’ve got to break up.

337
00:26:54,594 --> 00:26:56,427
It must be me who says it.

338
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:57,594
What are you waiting for, then?

339
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:01,052
We’re divorcing when we get back to Thailand.

340
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:07,427
Is it that easy? Don’t you remember …

341
00:27:07,427 --> 00:27:09,594
Is it that easy? Don’t you remember …

342
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,802
you’ve earned a lot from our marriage.

343
00:27:13,594 --> 00:27:14,719
Where are you going?

344
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,802
I’m going out to work at a café down here.

345
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:17,719
But the conversation isn’t over.

346
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,635
We don’t have anything to talk about.

347
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:20,135
What about our problem?!

348
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,760
Sure. If you want to.

349
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:28,135
So, I’ll let you know something.

350
00:27:29,052 --> 00:27:30,677
What I’ve got from you.

351
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:32,219
I don’t think it’s love.

352
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:34,802
It’s all about possession.

353
00:27:34,802 --> 00:27:36,510
I think I can only be your toy

354
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,135
that you want to keep at home.

355
00:27:38,135 --> 00:27:38,677
No. Air, it’s not true.

356
00:27:38,677 --> 00:27:40,427
I can’t even choose who I can be with.

357
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:41,094
Not at all.

358
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:42,635
I’ve never had that in my head.

359
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:43,760
I love you, Air.

360
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,260
Lamp!

361
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:13,135
I’m sorry.

362
00:28:17,385 --> 00:28:19,969
Do you remember our wedding day?

363
00:28:24,177 --> 00:28:26,510
What promise did you give to me?

364
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:29,552
I promise

365
00:28:29,552 --> 00:28:31,135
I’ll take care of you,

366
00:28:31,135 --> 00:28:32,427
love you

367
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:34,219
and be with you forever.

368
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,427
Actually, you think I’m a stupid guy.

369
00:28:43,427 --> 00:28:45,094
Actually, you think I’m a stupid guy.

370
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:48,052
What I can only do is to pay your father’s debt?

371
00:28:48,052 --> 00:28:49,510
Huh?

372
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:51,594
Huh? So, go back to your ex, then.

373
00:28:51,594 --> 00:28:53,260
Whenever. Go!

374
00:28:54,135 --> 00:28:56,885
You’ve never known how terrible I have felt?

375
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:00,719
You gave me a promise. But how could you do this to me?

376
00:29:01,844 --> 00:29:03,927
You think you’re a toy?

377
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:05,719
You’re wrong. You’ve been treating me like a toy.

378
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:07,802
I’ve never been in your sight.

379
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:10,344
I’m nothing, being with you.

380
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:16,969
I used to believe that you married me

381
00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:19,177
because you might love me somehow.

382
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,885
Now, I know. I’ve been fooling myself all along.

383
00:29:27,427 --> 00:29:29,469
Your promise

384
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:31,260
is a lie,

385
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,177
is never real,

386
00:29:32,177 --> 00:29:33,177
never exists.

387
00:29:33,177 --> 00:29:34,135
Yes!

388
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:41,719
Yes!

389
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:46,844
You’re right. I’m not that good.

390
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:51,010
I know that

391
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,844
I’ve always broken promises.

392
00:29:56,385 --> 00:29:59,469
I’ve never been able to keep any promises.

393
00:30:57,594 --> 00:30:59,094
I’m sorry.

394
00:30:59,094 --> 00:31:00,344
I’m sorry, Air.

395
00:31:12,094 --> 00:31:13,760
What are you painting?

396
00:31:17,677 --> 00:31:18,552
Here it is.

397
00:31:18,552 --> 00:31:19,802
Thank you.

398
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,760
Did you have a good sleep last night?

399
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,052
Uh.

400
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:26,760
Don’t you need to take care of your business?

401
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,927
I’m working from paradise.

402
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:37,969
Oh. Such a beautiful cup, that is! I mean yours.

403
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,344
Look at my cup. It’s out of shape.

404
00:31:40,344 --> 00:31:42,135
Look at my cup. It’s out of shape.

405
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:44,885
Keep practicing. You can make it better.

406
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:47,760
So…I’ve to take more classes.

407
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,344
So…I’ve to take more classes.

408
00:31:51,802 --> 00:31:54,552
Is it possible to have you as my teacher?

409
00:31:54,552 --> 00:31:56,469
What do you think?

410
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,969
What’s your relationship with the teacher?

411
00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:02,219
Why should I be your regular teacher?

412
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:09,969
In what relationship am I allowed?

413
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,427
Oh. So quiet.

414
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,677
Cheers!

415
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:20,052
I made it myself.

416
00:32:23,385 --> 00:32:24,177
Is it good?

417
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:26,469
Yes.

418
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,927
What are you painting? Can I have a look at it?

419
00:32:29,677 --> 00:32:30,719
No.

420
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:32,469
Why not?

421
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:34,594
I chose to work from paradise for being with you, you know?

422
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:37,344
Stop!

423
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:40,510
So?

424
00:33:58,135 --> 00:33:59,802
Where are we going?

425
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:02,094
My hidden gem.

426
00:34:03,635 --> 00:34:05,969
To my hidden gem?

427
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:06,552
Uh!

428
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,927
Here we are.

429
00:34:27,302 --> 00:34:28,594
Right here?

430
00:34:28,594 --> 00:34:29,177
Uhm.

431
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:43,719
Let’s go!

432
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,427
Damn!

433
00:34:51,302 --> 00:34:53,052
From the hidden gem

434
00:34:53,052 --> 00:34:54,885
to the hidden truth.

435
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:55,885
Disappointing!

436
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,260
I just wanted to surprise you.

437
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:02,427
No problem. We can leave.

438
00:35:02,427 --> 00:35:05,344
No, I can’t. I’ve planned to take you around.

439
00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:07,677
No problem. There’s another place.

440
00:35:07,677 --> 00:35:08,594
Let’s go!

441
00:35:08,594 --> 00:35:08,844
Oh.

442
00:35:08,844 --> 00:35:09,552
Go! Go!

443
00:35:14,802 --> 00:35:15,719
How much is it?

444
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,760
Forty baht each.

445
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,510
Can I have two?

446
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,094
Two?!

447
00:35:20,094 --> 00:35:21,635
It’s yummy!

448
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,677
Oh, there’s corn in it.

449
00:35:23,677 --> 00:35:25,760
Do you know what it is called?

450
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,094
Soft golden rolls with real palm sugar.

451
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,469
You’re so good.

452
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,427
Paying with QR code scanning, okay?

453
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:41,552
It’s on me.

454
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:42,260
Do you like it?

455
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,719
Oh! I don’t know if there’s a place like this?

456
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,594
You want some photos?

457
00:35:45,594 --> 00:35:46,385
Uh.

458
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:49,844
Come on. 1 2 3.

459
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,052
The cat’s so cute.

460
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:03,802
You want some photos?

461
00:36:03,802 --> 00:36:04,677
Yes.

462
00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:21,052
Go. Let’s go.

463
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:54,719
Here … the real hidden gem.

464
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,052
Have you ever ridden a roller coaster?

465
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:06,469
The first time I rode it, I was so scared.

466
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:08,760
The first time I rode it, I was so scared.

467
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,302
But I thought maybe it could be at least once in a lifetime.

468
00:37:12,302 --> 00:37:14,885
If I didn’t try it, I wouldn’t know it.

469
00:37:14,885 --> 00:37:17,885
When it slowly climbed up,

470
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:21,927
my heart raced like it was jumping out.

471
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:24,927
When it reached its peak,

472
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:28,052
I felt like the whole world just stopped.

473
00:37:28,052 --> 00:37:30,677
I was completely quivering.

474
00:37:30,677 --> 00:37:34,844
But I thought I had come that far.

475
00:37:34,844 --> 00:37:37,385
I couldn’t go back after that.

476
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:41,010
The only way was to just go with it.

477
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,552
The more you risk,

478
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,677
the more exciting it is.

479
00:37:46,677 --> 00:37:50,427
I could remember when it was going down.

480
00:37:50,427 --> 00:37:54,219
I’d never felt so alive like that before I tried it.

481
00:37:56,135 --> 00:38:01,385
It’s risky… but worth it, right?

482
00:38:01,385 --> 00:38:04,760
What you said makes me want to try.

483
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Worth trying.

484
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,760
But you’ll need your heart to join.

485
00:38:11,844 --> 00:38:14,177
You know what?

486
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:18,260
We all know what we should and shouldn’t do.

487
00:38:20,844 --> 00:38:23,844
But sometimes you just don’t want to stop, right?

488
00:38:26,135 --> 00:38:29,594
And if I want to try it, what do I need to do?

489
00:38:29,594 --> 00:38:31,010
And if I want to try it, what do I need to do?

490
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:02,802
Not now.

491
00:39:02,802 --> 00:39:04,635
Wait.

492
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,427
You’ve made a promise.

493
00:39:12,927 --> 00:39:15,219
What’s happening at 1 a.m.?

494
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:18,177
I saw you haven’t gone to bed yet.

495
00:39:18,177 --> 00:39:21,177
So I'm here to … get the promise.

496
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:11,048
What’s happening at 1 a.m.?

497
00:40:13,382 --> 00:40:16,757
I saw you haven’t gone to bed yet.

498
00:40:17,673 --> 00:40:20,590
So I'm here to … get the promise.

499
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:26,632
That was just a moment ago. Did you forget already?

500
00:40:29,298 --> 00:40:30,757
Well,

501
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:37,132
come in.

502
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,507
You’ve allowed me.

503
00:40:52,507 --> 00:40:53,673
I can remember.

504
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:55,632
Uh.

505
00:40:57,215 --> 00:40:58,548
Are you sure?

506
00:41:31,132 --> 00:41:33,173
Just kissing.

507
00:41:33,173 --> 00:41:35,632
No more than that.

508
00:41:35,632 --> 00:41:37,215
Okay?

509
00:41:59,465 --> 00:42:02,465
The fun time is over.

510
00:42:06,548 --> 00:42:09,382
Oh, no! You really turned me on.

511
00:42:09,382 --> 00:42:10,965
No. I can’t stand this.

512
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:12,590
No. No. No.

513
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,882
Enough.

514
00:42:15,007 --> 00:42:16,007
More, please?

515
00:42:21,507 --> 00:42:22,340
Alright.

516
00:42:27,382 --> 00:42:29,923
Tomorrow, I’m getting up early.

517
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:32,590
I’m making coffee for our couple cups for the first thing.

518
00:42:34,132 --> 00:42:36,298
You really like them, huh?

519
00:42:37,173 --> 00:42:38,132
A lot.

520
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,590
You mean the cups?

521
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:45,090
Yes, the cups and you, too.

522
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,507
I like you.

523
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,340
Go to bed now!

524
00:42:57,507 --> 00:42:59,173
I don’t want to leave at all.

525
00:42:59,173 --> 00:43:00,590
Can I stay here?

526
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,673
No, you can’t. Leave now!

527
00:43:02,673 --> 00:43:05,048
Hmmm…I’m exhausted.

528
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:06,465
A moment here, please.

529
00:43:06,465 --> 00:43:07,298
Loft!

530
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:11,465
Okay. I’ll go now.

531
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,382
Good night.

532
00:43:15,132 --> 00:43:15,590
Uh.

533
00:43:24,715 --> 00:43:27,132
But, it was so exciting.

534
00:43:28,882 --> 00:43:31,507
Tonight I’m not locking the door.

535
00:43:31,507 --> 00:43:34,048
FYI, if you want to come.

536
00:43:34,923 --> 00:43:35,673
Go to bed now!

537
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:38,257
You can knock on the door whenever.

538
00:43:40,382 --> 00:43:41,215
Go!

539
00:43:42,257 --> 00:43:45,257
Don’t forget. My room is accessible.

540
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:35,840
Eh? How come? The battery ran out?

541
00:44:47,923 --> 00:44:49,923
What are you doing?

542
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:52,923
Did you eat?

543
00:44:56,882 --> 00:44:58,007
Are you in class?

544
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:02,090
Are you okay?

545
00:45:04,382 --> 00:45:08,215
Are you alright? I’m worried about you.

546
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:16,465
Well, Air.

547
00:46:18,548 --> 00:46:20,673
Today, the weather’s good.

548
00:46:21,382 --> 00:46:23,923
Shall we go out for a walk to see decorative lights around the Eiffel Tower?

549
00:46:32,507 --> 00:46:33,382
Okay.

550
00:47:57,048 --> 00:47:58,965
I really like it

551
00:47:58,965 --> 00:48:01,965
when you let me do whatever I want.

552
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:05,340
What else do you want to do?

553
00:48:16,798 --> 00:48:18,923
Did you have a good time during your honeymoon trip?
