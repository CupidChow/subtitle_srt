1
00:00:06,414 --> 00:00:08,014
If I get divorced,

2
00:00:08,014 --> 00:00:10,613
I’ll be asking

3
00:00:10,613 --> 00:00:13,014
if you’d like to be with me.

4
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:14,213
You know that

5
00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:16,014
I’ve been waiting for you.

6
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:17,314
If one day,

7
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:19,314
Air and Lamp are divorcing,

8
00:00:19,314 --> 00:00:21,314
I must disappear, right?

9
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:23,314
Will you feel sad?

10
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,614
Loft, you’d better think about this carefully.

11
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:28,213
Between the one she’s been waiting for for more than 3 years,

12
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:30,614
and the newcomer who she’s known for several months,

13
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,514
whom is she going to choose?

14
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:39,413
Air,

15
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:41,514
happy birthday!

16
00:00:41,514 --> 00:00:42,514
Air.

17
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:43,514
Pure.

18
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:44,514
Pure.

19
00:00:44,514 --> 00:00:45,514
Pure.

20
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:47,014
Pure.

21
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:48,514
Stop doing this.

22
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:51,014
If you do this again,

23
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:54,014
I won’t see you again.

24
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:58,014
Happy birthday to you!

25
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:05,014
Pure.

26
00:01:17,514 --> 00:01:18,414
I’m right in front of the pub now.

27
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:19,214
Where are you?

28
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:20,813
Loft, I can’t join you tonight.

29
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:22,714
Lila hasn’t slept.

30
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:24,514
My husband isn’t at home.

31
00:01:24,514 --> 00:01:26,514
Why don’t you call me earlier?

32
00:01:26,514 --> 00:01:28,514
Oh no! I’ve arrived.

33
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:30,014
Mommy, don’t turn off the light!

34
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:32,813
Alright. Leave it on, then!

35
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:35,313
So enjoy your duty, Mommy.

36
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:36,214
Alright. I’m here now.

37
00:01:36,214 --> 00:01:37,313
I’ll survive.

38
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:38,014
Talk to you later.

39
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,514
Air!

40
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:40,514
Air!

41
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:43,014
Oops!

42
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:46,514
Air!

43
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:47,514
Hey!

44
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:48,014
Hey!

45
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:53,014
Hey!

46
00:01:56,014 --> 00:01:57,014
Air, please be with me.

47
00:01:57,014 --> 00:01:58,014
Hey!

48
00:01:58,014 --> 00:01:59,014
Can you stay with me?

49
00:01:59,014 --> 00:02:00,014
Hey!

50
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:01,014
Are you drunk?

51
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:02,014
Hey!

52
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:03,014
Hey!

53
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:04,014
Hey!

54
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:15,514
Air,

55
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:20,014
do you ever know how hard it is?

56
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:24,014
Though I’ve been in pain,

57
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:27,014
I’ve to tell myself I’m okay,

58
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:32,014
and I’ll survive.

59
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:38,514
But it isn’t true.

60
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:44,014
I don’t want to wait for you.

61
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:48,014
I don’t know what I should do.

62
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:49,014
Well,

63
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:52,014
you don’t have to do anything.

64
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:53,514
If it’s right,

65
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:56,014
you don’t have to try that hard.

66
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:12,514
Oh! You aren’t her.

67
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:13,514
I’m sorry.

68
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:14,514
I’m okay.

69
00:03:14,514 --> 00:03:15,514
I’m alright.

70
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:16,014
I’m okay.

71
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:16,514
I’m alright.

72
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:20,014
Please sit down.

73
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:23,514
Are you okay?

74
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:26,514
It’s okay to not be okay.

75
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:30,514
Don’t lie to yourself.

76
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:32,514
When you’re with me,

77
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:34,014
you don’t need to act so strong

78
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,514
all the time.

79
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:42,514
Look.

80
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:35,014
Let me be with you.

81
00:04:35,014 --> 00:04:36,014
Loft,

82
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,014
what happened?

83
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:40,514
I just wanted to be beside you like this

84
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,514
until the end?

85
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:45,514
Loft.

86
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:49,014
I know well you still love Air.

87
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:53,014
But I also love you.

88
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:56,014
But being like this

89
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:58,514
is good enough for me.

90
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:02,514
I mean it.

91
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:21,014
Do you feel happy

92
00:05:21,014 --> 00:05:24,014
when you’re with me?

93
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:26,514
Yes.

94
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:32,514
What happened?

95
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:34,014
I just

96
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:36,514
thought

97
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:39,014
that

98
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:43,014
if you went back to Air

99
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:46,014
how could I survive?

100
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:49,014
Loft.

101
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:53,014
But you don’t have to feel guilty.

102
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:56,514
You haven’t done anything wrong.

103
00:05:56,514 --> 00:06:01,014
It’s okay that you don’t love me.

104
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:04,014
It’s my fault.

105
00:06:04,014 --> 00:06:08,014
I put myself in this matter.

106
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:12,014
No one should be blamed.

107
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:15,014
I’m …

108
00:06:15,014 --> 00:06:18,014
I’m sorry.

109
00:06:58,014 --> 00:07:04,014
Tonight’s mine.

110
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:06,014
I love you.

111
00:07:06,014 --> 00:07:07,514
I really love you.

112
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:19,014
Hello.

113
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:22,514
Aren’t you awake?

114
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:24,514
Right.

115
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:27,514
I went to bed late last night.

116
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:29,514
I thought you’re at the studio.

117
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:32,014
Can I see you at the condo?

118
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:34,514
Now?

119
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,014
I sent you some messages last night.

120
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:40,014
Haven’t you read them yet?

121
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:43,514
If you’re busy, it’s okay.

122
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:46,014
Well, I’m okay.

123
00:08:46,014 --> 00:08:46,813
Please come.

124
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:52,014
Alright. I’ll be there in 30 minutes.

125
00:08:52,014 --> 00:08:58,014
Alright.

126
00:08:58,014 --> 00:09:12,014
Loft,

127
00:09:12,014 --> 00:09:13,014
if Air sees us like this,

128
00:09:13,014 --> 00:09:15,014
things will go so big.

129
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:45,014
Will we meet again?

130
00:09:55,014 --> 00:10:00,014
I don’t think I can handle it

131
00:10:00,014 --> 00:10:01,514
when both of you

132
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:05,514
are together again.

133
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:29,014
Loft.

134
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:17,014
I don’t know what I should do.

135
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:19,014
Well.

136
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:23,514
Does Pure love you?

137
00:11:28,514 --> 00:11:30,514
Wanting a vibrant day?

138
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:33,514
Happy Sunday! Let every day be Happy Sunday!

139
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:59,315
How did you get her so fast?

140
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:02,614
I’m taking a shower first.

141
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:06,114
Can you wait a minute?

142
00:12:06,114 --> 00:12:07,315
Okay.

143
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:09,014
After you finish,

144
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:10,614
please join eating.

145
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:13,014
I’ve bought a lot of food here.

146
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:15,514
Okay.

147
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:18,415
Why did you

148
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:20,615
allow me to use the painting of you for the exhibition opening?

149
00:13:20,615 --> 00:13:25,314
Because you’re the best at painting me.

150
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:53,615
Oh!

151
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,715
This is a big meal.

152
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:59,615
I thought you just had a quick visit.

153
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:02,715
I miss you.

154
00:14:02,715 --> 00:14:06,115
So do I.

155
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:10,015
I’ve missed you

156
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,115
always.

157
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:16,015
Until that person came in, right?

158
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:28,414
You know? You’re not good at hiding your feelings at all.

159
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:37,715
Will you choose that person?

160
00:14:37,715 --> 00:14:41,414
If you make a decision,

161
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,015
it’s the end.

162
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,914
Just choose it.

163
00:14:55,914 --> 00:14:58,914
I respect your decision.

164
00:15:00,914 --> 00:15:05,715
If it’s that easy,
37
I won’t be in this situation.

165
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:26,914
Come on!

166
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:27,914
You

167
00:15:27,914 --> 00:15:30,914
wear the same perfume as Air’s.

168
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:32,615
Really?

169
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:37,215
How can I fall for this kind or person?

170
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,215
Will you hug me?

171
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:41,314
How do you know what I want?

172
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:43,715
You’re so good.

173
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:46,914
Pure!

174
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:48,715
You can order more of it.

175
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:52,414
Oh! You stole mine!

176
00:15:52,414 --> 00:15:54,315
If one day,

177
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:56,914
Air and Lamp are divorcing,

178
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,914
I must disappear, right?

179
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:05,114
Will you feel sad?

180
00:16:05,114 --> 00:16:07,015
Loft.

181
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,215
Are you thinking about Pure?

182
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:27,114
What should I do?

183
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:33,215
You’ve loved Air for a long time.

184
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:37,015
But she hasn’t.

185
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:42,015
That’s it.

186
00:16:42,015 --> 00:16:44,114
And,

187
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:46,914
does Pure love you?

188
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:49,914
I don’t know.

189
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:52,215
I’ve never asked her.

190
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:54,515
I don’t dare.

191
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,715
I’m afraid of the answer.

192
00:16:57,715 --> 00:17:00,215
And she’s never said that.

193
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:11,715
If someone we love

194
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:14,914
has never been happy at all,

195
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:18,215
how can we become happy?

196
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:22,715
Thought I’ve been told to keep fighting,

197
00:17:22,715 --> 00:17:25,114
The point is fighting with whom.

198
00:17:25,114 --> 00:17:28,715
We must only

199
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:29,914
look for someone

200
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:33,114
that we’re happy to be with the most.

201
00:17:33,114 --> 00:17:39,015
But for Air,

202
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:40,914
there’s only one person

203
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:46,215
that can be her happiness,

204
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:52,914
and it’s the same one bringing me happiness.

205
00:17:52,914 --> 00:17:54,215
Don’t tell Dad or Mom about this.

206
00:17:54,215 --> 00:17:55,914
Don’t let them know that I’m heartbroken.

207
00:17:55,914 --> 00:17:59,414
I’ll get well soon.

208
00:17:59,414 --> 00:18:02,414
Are you sure?

209
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,715
Not too long.

210
00:18:31,715 --> 00:18:33,914
What are you thinking about?

211
00:18:37,914 --> 00:18:43,914
Why do I have to choose?

212
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,414
If you don’t choose,

213
00:18:46,414 --> 00:18:50,215
how can we get to the end?

214
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:54,015
We can’t be in a triangle relationship.

215
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:56,715
Or you want it to be like this?

216
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:57,914
Are you crazy?

217
00:18:57,914 --> 00:18:58,715
Yes,

218
00:18:58,715 --> 00:19:01,315
it’s crazy.

219
00:19:01,315 --> 00:19:03,114
It’s the reason

220
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:06,215
why you must choose.

221
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:08,914
How should I choose?

222
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,614
Can you tell me, then?

223
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:14,914
It’s not easy to choose.

224
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:18,515
You’ve known this well.

225
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:28,215
I don’t know.

226
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:33,015
I’ve never had to choose between you and anyone else.

227
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:34,414
Who exactly brought me

228
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:37,715
into this situation?

229
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:40,715
If you had chosen me that day,

230
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:44,914
and hadn’t chosen to marry another guy,

231
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:49,914
would we have been in this hard situation?

232
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:54,114
Tell me, please.

233
00:19:54,114 --> 00:19:56,715
What should I do?

234
00:19:56,715 --> 00:20:03,715
Or I’ve to choose you?

235
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:06,415
Even I wanted to be your choice,

236
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,114
I’d rather want you to be happy.

237
00:20:24,114 --> 00:20:27,915
You know well

238
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:33,415
how do you feel about that person.

239
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:38,315
She’s in

240
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:41,915
the painting there, right?

241
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:46,014
Air!

242
00:20:46,014 --> 00:20:49,915
Am I right?

243
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:57,915
You’ve already chosen, actually.

244
00:20:57,915 --> 00:20:58,915
You also know

245
00:20:58,915 --> 00:21:04,114
your true feelings.

246
00:21:04,114 --> 00:21:06,415
Don’t forget to let her know.

247
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:08,915
Do you get it?

248
00:21:08,915 --> 00:21:11,715
I’m sorry.

249
00:21:11,715 --> 00:21:15,114
It’s okay.

250
00:21:15,114 --> 00:21:16,514
It’s okay, Pure.

251
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:18,915
You don’t need to cry.

252
00:21:18,915 --> 00:21:21,514
You’re the best.

253
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:46,715
Hello, Pure.

254
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:11,215
Loft.

255
00:22:18,915 --> 00:22:21,715
Please let me be here with you.

256
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:25,014
What happened, Loft?

257
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,014
Air,

258
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,915
please tell me.

259
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:32,215
Air!

260
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:34,215
Air!

261
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:36,215
I’m the first for you, aren’t I?

262
00:22:36,715 --> 00:22:38,114
Pure,

263
00:22:38,114 --> 00:22:40,415
I’ve made a decision.

264
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:43,014
No!

265
00:22:43,014 --> 00:22:46,415
Air!

266
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:28,114
Tell them you’ve changed your mind, now!

267
00:23:28,114 --> 00:23:31,114
Tell them you don’t want to divorce.

268
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:33,315
Why do I have to do that?

269
00:23:33,315 --> 00:23:34,014
Because I told you to do so.

270
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:37,014
Can you stop directing me.

271
00:24:07,256 --> 00:24:07,855
Oh!

272
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:09,456
You came back?

273
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:11,256
Did you eat anything?

274
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:12,256
Umm.

275
00:24:12,256 --> 00:24:14,456
Do you want spaghetti?

276
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:40,855
What are you reading?

277
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:43,355
Can you share it with me?

278
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:44,656
With this serious stare,

279
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:46,856
how can I continue reading, huh?

280
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:48,456
Let me read it, please.

281
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:50,356
No!

282
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:52,956
I like it when you’re with me.

283
00:24:52,956 --> 00:24:54,055
The pool villa vibes

284
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:56,255
are so good.

285
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:26,255
Hey! Do you know how to do it?

286
00:25:26,755 --> 00:25:28,456
Stay still!

287
00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:29,255
Can I have a look?

288
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:30,456
Hey, Pure!

289
00:25:34,656 --> 00:25:35,755
You’re a bad student.

290
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:37,156
No point given.

291
00:25:37,156 --> 00:25:39,755
Oh! It hasn’t finished.

292
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:41,456
It looks good, anyway.

293
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,156
Terrible!

294
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:43,255
I’ve had all.

295
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:44,055
Hey, what?!

296
00:25:44,055 --> 00:25:44,856
What?! Come on!

297
00:25:44,856 --> 00:25:45,755
Pure!

298
00:25:45,755 --> 00:25:46,456
Hey!

299
00:25:46,456 --> 00:25:47,456
Hey!

300
00:25:47,456 --> 00:25:49,255
Ooh!

301
00:25:49,255 --> 00:25:50,856
What?!

302
00:25:50,856 --> 00:25:51,956
There you go!

303
00:25:51,956 --> 00:25:54,155
What are you doing? Huh?!

304
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:56,956
Here you are!

305
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,456
Can you wait for me to finish?

306
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:53,856
You asked me to join in swimming, but you don’t swim?!

307
00:26:53,856 --> 00:26:55,856
Worse than that, you don’t share things to eat.

308
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:58,456
I just wanted you to swim. It’s my plan.

309
00:26:58,456 --> 00:26:59,155
I more enjoy

310
00:26:59,155 --> 00:27:02,256
watching your swimming.

311
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:02,856
Ah.

312
00:27:02,856 --> 00:27:07,055
Do you want this?

313
00:27:07,055 --> 00:27:09,055
Ah.

314
00:27:09,055 --> 00:27:10,356
Ah.

315
00:27:17,055 --> 00:27:18,256
Come on!

316
00:28:55,855 --> 00:28:56,655
Oh, Loft!

317
00:28:56,655 --> 00:28:59,456
You came back already?

318
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:00,855
Did you eat anything?

319
00:29:00,855 --> 00:29:02,456
Do you want me to cook?

320
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:18,456
What about pork boiled rice?

321
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:21,056
You told me you’ll be coming back next week.

322
00:29:21,056 --> 00:29:23,655
So I didn’t ask anyone to prepare any food for you.

323
00:29:23,655 --> 00:29:24,855
That’s okay.

324
00:29:24,855 --> 00:29:27,256
It’s enough for me.

325
00:29:27,256 --> 00:29:28,155
Err…well.

326
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:34,056
Why is it earlier than expected?

327
00:29:34,056 --> 00:29:34,956
Oops! I’m sorry.

328
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:38,956
I didn’t mean to ask about your personal matter.

329
00:29:38,956 --> 00:29:41,456
I’m worried about the work.

330
00:29:41,456 --> 00:29:43,056
Umm.

331
00:29:43,056 --> 00:29:43,655
So.
75
Shall I reschedule the meetings?

332
00:29:45,155 --> 00:29:46,855
They can be faster.

333
00:29:46,855 --> 00:29:47,756
Umm.

334
00:29:47,756 --> 00:29:48,756
Good.

335
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:50,056
It’s good to have you here.

336
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:53,756
I feel more comfortable.

337
00:29:54,756 --> 00:29:56,456
Well,

338
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:59,956
the maid told me you normally come back with a close friend.

339
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:01,756
Is she coming with you?

340
00:30:01,756 --> 00:30:04,756
If yes, I’m preparing her room now.

341
00:30:04,756 --> 00:30:07,456
She might not be here anymore.

342
00:30:11,056 --> 00:30:11,756
Err.

343
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:13,056
Ploy,

344
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:14,456
you don’t need to do the dish.

345
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:17,456
Leave it to the maid tomorrow.

346
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:18,855
Okay.

347
00:30:18,855 --> 00:30:20,155
If you’ve anything for me to help,

348
00:30:20,155 --> 00:30:22,456
you can let me know whenever.

349
00:30:26,855 --> 00:30:27,655
Good night.

350
00:30:27,655 --> 00:30:30,456
Good night.

351
00:30:30,456 --> 00:30:33,756
Ploy!

352
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:38,756
Yes.

353
00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:40,056
Err.

354
00:30:40,056 --> 00:30:44,056
Can you drink wine with me?

355
00:30:44,056 --> 00:30:47,456
Sure.

356
00:30:55,756 --> 00:30:56,456
You know, he …

357
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:59,456
hit me before

358
00:30:59,456 --> 00:31:03,355
right here at the ear.

359
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:05,155
Well,

360
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,956
I almost passed out.

361
00:31:06,956 --> 00:31:09,456
I fell on the ground.

362
00:31:09,456 --> 00:31:11,456
Later, I woke up with confusion.

363
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:14,756
How could he do that to me?

364
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:17,756
But there was something worse.

365
00:31:17,756 --> 00:31:18,956
Well, …

366
00:31:18,956 --> 00:31:21,956
I forgave him.

367
00:31:21,956 --> 00:31:23,456
He hit me.

368
00:31:23,456 --> 00:31:25,655
He cheated on me.

369
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:27,655
I thought he terribly did something bad to be

370
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:31,456
because of his short temper.

371
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:34,456
I think no one could stand him as much as I used to.

372
00:31:34,456 --> 00:31:37,855
I didn’t know why I took his side that much.

373
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,655
Maybe, it was because …

374
00:31:39,655 --> 00:31:41,256
because of love.

375
00:31:41,256 --> 00:31:42,956
Umm.

376
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:43,956
Yes.

377
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:46,355
Yes, it was love.

378
00:31:46,355 --> 00:31:48,855
Because I loved him.

379
00:31:48,855 --> 00:31:49,756
That’s it.

380
00:31:49,756 --> 00:31:53,456
I used to think love might change a bad one to be better.

381
00:31:53,456 --> 00:31:55,456
How did you leave him?

382
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:57,355
Umm.

383
00:31:57,355 --> 00:31:59,956
I just broke it off suddenly.

384
00:31:59,956 --> 00:32:01,956
I took all stuff

385
00:32:01,956 --> 00:32:06,756
and moved to live with my mom.

386
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:09,756
After moving on,

387
00:32:09,756 --> 00:32:11,855
it was like I was born again

388
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:13,656
with a better life.

389
00:32:13,656 --> 00:32:15,956
Okay.

390
00:32:15,956 --> 00:32:16,656
But,

391
00:32:16,656 --> 00:32:17,956
it isn’t easy.

392
00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:20,056
It’s not easy for a replacement.

393
00:32:20,056 --> 00:32:22,656
Ooh!

394
00:32:22,656 --> 00:32:24,456
You know?

395
00:32:24,456 --> 00:32:26,456
In the sea

396
00:32:26,456 --> 00:32:28,755
there’re plenty of fish.

397
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:30,956
Have you tried fishing?

398
00:32:30,956 --> 00:32:33,656
You’d better try it.

399
00:32:33,656 --> 00:32:34,456
What about you?

400
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:37,755
Have you?

401
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:44,855
Huh. It’s midnight.

402
00:32:44,855 --> 00:32:46,755
You can leave for a rest.

403
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:47,855
Thank you so much

404
00:32:47,855 --> 00:32:49,755
for being here with me.

405
00:32:49,755 --> 00:32:50,456
And …

406
00:32:50,456 --> 00:32:51,755
I’m sorry

407
00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:54,056
for talking to you until it’s late.

408
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:55,855
No problem at all.

409
00:32:55,855 --> 00:32:56,956
It’s okay.

410
00:32:56,956 --> 00:32:58,855
Are you alright?

411
00:32:58,855 --> 00:33:00,456
Sure.

412
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:02,456
Slowly, please.

413
00:33:02,456 --> 00:33:04,255
Well, Ploy!

414
00:33:04,255 --> 00:33:05,855
You can be in late tomorrow.

415
00:33:05,855 --> 00:33:06,456
But

416
00:33:06,456 --> 00:33:08,456
please tell the office that

417
00:33:08,456 --> 00:33:10,456
I’m getting in late in the afternoon.

418
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,755
Umm.

419
00:33:12,755 --> 00:33:16,056
Copied that.

420
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:17,456
Good night.

421
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:21,355
Good night.

422
00:33:21,355 --> 00:33:23,456
Walk slowly.

423
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:50,456
Tonight, Khun Lamp’s sleeping over at the main house.

424
00:33:50,456 --> 00:33:52,656
I’ve told Ms. Juthamas already that

425
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,056
you’re coming home late.

426
00:33:54,056 --> 00:33:55,456
But she’s …

427
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,355
No problem.

428
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:57,656
I’ll take care of her.

429
00:33:57,656 --> 00:33:59,456
You can take a rest, Phen.

430
00:34:05,255 --> 00:34:05,755
Air,

431
00:34:05,755 --> 00:34:08,056
you must apologize Lamp’s parents.

432
00:34:08,056 --> 00:34:09,355
You must tell them you’ve changed your mind.

433
00:34:09,355 --> 00:34:12,156
Tell them you don’t want to divorce.

434
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:14,855
Why do I have to do that?

435
00:34:14,855 --> 00:34:15,755
That’s my order.

436
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:18,755
Can you stop directing me?

437
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:20,855
Don’t you know

438
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:21,755
what I want?

439
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:23,456
Yes, I know.

440
00:34:23,456 --> 00:34:27,156
You want to go back to that woman.

441
00:34:27,156 --> 00:34:28,855
How good is she?

442
00:34:28,855 --> 00:34:30,255
Why have you longed for the return?

443
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:32,456
Yes.

444
00:34:32,456 --> 00:34:34,956
I want to go back to her.

445
00:34:34,956 --> 00:34:37,456
But congratulations, Mom!

446
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:39,056
I can’t make it.

447
00:34:39,056 --> 00:34:40,456
It’s too late.

448
00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:42,855
What are you waiting for then?

449
00:34:42,855 --> 00:34:44,255
You must return to Lamp.

450
00:34:44,255 --> 00:34:44,656
Let’s go!

451
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:46,056
Now!

452
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:47,556
That’s enough, Mom.

453
00:34:47,556 --> 00:34:49,956
I’m a human.

454
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:51,855
I’m not a robot doll.

455
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:56,656
You can’t control me.

456
00:34:56,656 --> 00:34:58,855
Do you ever know? Mom,

457
00:34:58,855 --> 00:35:01,656
if I could choose something,

458
00:35:01,656 --> 00:35:03,056
I wouldn’t want to be your child.

459
00:35:03,056 --> 00:35:04,156
What did you say?

460
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:05,456
I don’t want to be your daughter.

461
00:35:11,755 --> 00:35:16,456
Why did it turn out like this?

462
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:21,355
Since you were young, you’ve never argued with me.

463
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:23,656
Because of that woman,

464
00:35:23,656 --> 00:35:24,956
right?

465
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,656
It isn’t about Pure.

466
00:35:32,355 --> 00:35:35,255
It’s me, Mom.

467
00:35:35,255 --> 00:35:38,755
I’ve chosen it myself.

468
00:35:38,755 --> 00:35:41,956
If I had nothing left,

469
00:35:41,956 --> 00:35:46,056
I wouldn’t care about anything.

470
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:48,855
You can get mad at me, hate me or whatever.

471
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,956
Just do it!

472
00:35:50,956 --> 00:35:52,456
It’s enough for me.

473
00:36:07,255 --> 00:36:09,855
Air!

474
00:36:09,855 --> 00:36:11,755
Air!

475
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,456
Air!!!

476
00:36:19,456 --> 00:36:21,855
Where’s the painting that’s being used in the exhibition opening?

477
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:25,755
Where is it now?

478
00:36:25,755 --> 00:36:29,355
Are you alright?

479
00:36:56,897 --> 00:37:00,296
I haven’t seen you for ages. Where have you been up to?

480
00:37:00,296 --> 00:37:02,996
Have you been busy?

481
00:37:02,996 --> 00:37:03,996
Yes.

482
00:37:03,996 --> 00:37:05,697
The event is coming soon.

483
00:37:05,697 --> 00:37:09,097
There’re many things to do.

484
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:12,097
Have you overthought as well?

485
00:37:17,097 --> 00:37:19,597
Uh.

486
00:37:22,597 --> 00:37:25,996
Why ‘Eyes Never Lie’, huh?

487
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:28,896
Eyes won’t lie, Mom.

488
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:30,297
Looking into the eyes

489
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:32,097
let us perceive

490
00:37:32,097 --> 00:37:33,297
emotions,

491
00:37:33,297 --> 00:37:34,597
feelings,

492
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:36,597
And the true self of the other one

493
00:37:36,597 --> 00:37:46,097
without a word.

494
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,597
If we want to know if someone likes us or not,

495
00:37:48,597 --> 00:37:50,597
just look into the eyes of that person.

496
00:37:50,597 --> 00:37:53,597
Then you’ll know their feelings and thoughts.

497
00:37:53,597 --> 00:37:56,597
On the other hand,

498
00:37:56,597 --> 00:37:59,097
if we do something wrong,

499
00:37:59,097 --> 00:38:00,597
we don’t want anyone

500
00:38:00,597 --> 00:38:03,597
to look into our eyes.

501
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:05,597
Because we’re afraid that the other side will know

502
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:08,597
we do something bad.

503
00:38:08,597 --> 00:38:10,597
Or

504
00:38:10,597 --> 00:38:13,097
we might be afraid that

505
00:38:13,097 --> 00:38:16,097
the other person might know we aren’t as good

506
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:18,597
as it seems to be.

507
00:38:24,597 --> 00:38:29,597
Where’s the painting that’s being used in the exhibition opening?

508
00:38:33,597 --> 00:38:35,597
Are you okay?

509
00:38:44,597 --> 00:38:47,597
Mom,

510
00:38:47,597 --> 00:38:52,597
Am I bad?

511
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:55,597
What happened?

512
00:38:59,597 --> 00:39:01,597
Well,

513
00:39:01,597 --> 00:39:04,597
Air’s come back to me.

514
00:39:04,597 --> 00:39:08,597
She’s divorcing soon.

515
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,597
But I don’t love her anymore.

516
00:39:12,597 --> 00:39:13,397
Because …

517
00:39:13,397 --> 00:39:22,597
Because of Loft?

518
00:39:22,597 --> 00:39:25,597
I don’t know what I should do.

519
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:29,597
No matter which one I choose,

520
00:39:29,597 --> 00:39:34,597
there’ll always be one who will be disappointed.

521
00:39:34,597 --> 00:39:37,597
Without thinking about being guilty,

522
00:39:37,597 --> 00:39:41,597
who’s your most happiness?

523
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:43,597
It’s Loft.

524
00:39:43,597 --> 00:39:45,597
But...

525
00:39:45,597 --> 00:39:48,597
Listen to me.

526
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:50,597
If you’re thinking about the past

527
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,597
or worrying about the future,

528
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:57,597
it doesn’t help at all.

529
00:39:57,597 --> 00:40:00,597
Listen to your own heart.

530
00:40:03,597 --> 00:40:05,597
I believe time can heal everything

531
00:40:05,597 --> 00:40:12,597
in any sad and painful circumstances.

532
00:40:12,597 --> 00:40:13,597
Mom!

533
00:40:39,597 --> 00:40:44,597
She’s in

534
00:40:44,597 --> 00:40:48,597
the painting there, right?

535
00:41:34,597 --> 00:41:38,597
Loving someone who isn’t right

536
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:40,597
is like drug and liquor addiction.

537
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:43,097
You know?

538
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:46,597
It’s just exciting for a short time,

539
00:41:46,597 --> 00:41:49,597
and after that you want to throw up.

540
00:41:49,597 --> 00:41:52,597
Your stomach is upset.

541
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:53,597
Hungover.

542
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:57,597
And you repeat the same loop.

543
00:41:57,597 --> 00:41:59,597
It sounds like riding a roller coaster.

544
00:41:59,597 --> 00:42:01,597
Yes, a roller coaster.

545
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:02,597
Therefore,

546
00:42:02,597 --> 00:42:03,597
the only one way

547
00:42:03,597 --> 00:42:07,597
that helps is …

548
00:42:07,597 --> 00:42:09,597
‘Out of sight’!

549
00:42:09,597 --> 00:42:11,597
‘Out of mind’!

550
00:43:06,597 --> 00:43:08,597
Loft,

551
00:43:08,597 --> 00:43:11,597
can you pick answer the phone?

552
00:43:11,597 --> 00:43:13,597
Don’t be this quiet.

553
00:43:13,597 --> 00:43:15,597
I really want to talk to you.

554
00:44:33,097 --> 00:44:34,597
Can I talk to Loft, please?

555
00:44:34,597 --> 00:44:36,597
If Pure calls me, please tell her I’m not in,

556
00:44:36,597 --> 00:44:38,597
You can’t let go of her, right?

557
00:44:38,597 --> 00:44:39,597
Uh.

558
00:44:39,597 --> 00:44:41,597
If it’s like this, …

559
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:44,597
It’s alright.

560
00:44:44,897 --> 00:44:45,597
What happened, Air?

561
00:44:45,597 --> 00:44:47,597
Heartbroken.

562
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:49,597
Pure’s already had someone else.

563
00:44:49,597 --> 00:44:50,597
And

564
00:44:50,597 --> 00:44:53,597
do you know that person?

565
00:44:53,597 --> 00:44:55,597
She hasn’t contacted you for a week like this,

566
00:44:55,597 --> 00:44:56,597
What’s next?

567
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:57,597
I just know that

568
00:44:57,597 --> 00:45:00,597
I’m not going to wait for anything.
