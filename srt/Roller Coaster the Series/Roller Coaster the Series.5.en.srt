1
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:07,306
Please divorce me, Lamp.

2
00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:09,307
I’ve been thinking about this too.

3
00:00:09,307 --> 00:00:11,206
Are you going to divorce?

4
00:00:11,206 --> 00:00:13,106
I’m trying to do so.

5
00:00:13,106 --> 00:00:15,007
Up until now,

6
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:18,507
you’ve been trying, haven’t you?

7
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:21,507
But it never happens!

8
00:00:21,507 --> 00:00:23,007
Hey!

9
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:24,706
Where’s your necklace?

10
00:00:24,706 --> 00:00:29,406
Don’t tell me you gave it to someone special again?

11
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:30,307
Loft,

12
00:00:30,307 --> 00:00:31,706
who are you dating?

13
00:00:31,706 --> 00:00:40,507
Do I know that person?

14
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,406
Did you have a fight with your mom?

15
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:44,607
I can tell just by a sidelong glance

16
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:47,207
that you aren’t in a good mood.

17
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,007
Pure,

18
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,507
I’ve to marry him.

19
00:00:52,507 --> 00:00:54,406
I can’t let my dad’s business

20
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:56,406
become worse.

21
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:58,007
What about us?

22
00:00:58,007 --> 00:00:59,707
If I don’t do that,

23
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:01,707
my mom and I are losing everything.

24
00:01:01,707 --> 00:01:02,707
So, you agree to marry

25
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:04,507
someone you don’t love?

26
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:07,407
For money?

27
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:10,007
Okay. I’m getting married to him for money.

28
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:12,507
Do you feel good now?

29
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:13,407
I’m sorry.

30
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,007
I shouldn’t have said that.

31
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:17,507
I’m always the first for you, aren’t I?

32
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:20,207
Pure,

33
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:22,806
I’ve made a decision.

34
00:01:22,806 --> 00:01:25,407
No, I’m not okay.

35
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:34,507
Air!

36
00:02:26,507 --> 00:02:27,807
You asked me to join drinking.

37
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:29,307
But you don’t drink anything.

38
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:33,807
Why don’t you stay at home instead?

39
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:39,807
Or you just had an argument with Lamp before?

40
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:42,407
No, it wasn’t Lamp.

41
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:43,706
It was Pure instead.

42
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:45,307
What happened?!

43
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:47,507
The night before, when you slept over at my place,

44
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:49,007
you looked worried.

45
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:51,106
You didn’t share anything with me.

46
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:53,407
I asked Pure to wait.

47
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,307
She’s been waiting for you for so long, hasn’t she?

48
00:02:56,307 --> 00:03:00,307
I used to think like that.

49
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:03,706
But when I seriously asked her.

50
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:06,807
Pure isn’t good at hiding her feelings.

51
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:09,407
When she’s pleased,

52
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:10,407
down,

53
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:11,807
sad,

54
00:03:11,807 --> 00:03:13,706
or happy,

55
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:16,206
I can easily tell how she’s feeling.

56
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:17,007
At that time,

57
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:20,007
what could you see in her?

58
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,606
She was pretending to be happy.

59
00:03:22,606 --> 00:03:25,007
Pretending to be happy?

60
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:26,007
So, you’re telling me that

61
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:27,507
she isn’t pleased

62
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,706
after you’ve seriously asked her to wait?

63
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:31,606
Why is that?

64
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:35,407
Or has she got someone else already?

65
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:37,706
I don’t know.

66
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:41,206
Hey! The truth might not be that bad.

67
00:03:41,206 --> 00:03:42,307
She might be like …

68
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:43,507
happy and

69
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:44,706
surprised.

70
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:49,407
She might be so surprised that she couldn’t say anything.

71
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:53,807
You might get her wrong.

72
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:57,007
No way.

73
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:59,706
I’ve been with Pure for many years.

74
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:04,407
If there’s something wrong, I surely notice it.

75
00:04:04,407 --> 00:04:06,507
So, it can’t help.

76
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:10,307
Although I told her not to wait anymore,

77
00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:15,007
I’ve been hurt, actually.

78
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:17,406
It’s so painful, Bam.

79
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:19,307
Air,

80
00:04:19,307 --> 00:04:22,307
I think you shouldn’t overthink now.

81
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:23,007
So, what about this?

82
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:25,007
To make it clear, you’d better ask her

83
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:26,007
if she’s got someone else

84
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:27,706
or not.

85
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:28,706
If yes,

86
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:31,607
who’s that person?

87
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:33,307
It might hurt,

88
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:44,406
but at least everything will be clear.

89
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:45,307
Well. Ploy,

90
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:46,906
please take care of the meeting minute,

91
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:48,706
and the agency

92
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,107
who’s been booking for Filipino customers.

93
00:04:50,107 --> 00:04:52,007
Also, the new building site inspection.

94
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:53,607
The subcontractor is new to us,

95
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:55,007
so I don’t feel very confident.

96
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:55,906
Okay.

97
00:04:55,906 --> 00:04:57,406
I’ll take care of them.

98
00:04:57,406 --> 00:04:59,607
Alright.

99
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:00,307
Anyway,

100
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:01,507
thank you so much.

101
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:03,507
In case of emergency, please ring me anytime.

102
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:04,406
Sure.

103
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:08,706
See you. Bye for now.

104
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:11,406
Ooh!

105
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:12,507
I want to know

106
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:16,206
whether you regularly select a secretary by appearance?

107
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:17,807
Don’t tell me that

108
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:19,007
she is the one you’re dating, huh?

109
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:20,507
No, not at all!

110
00:05:20,507 --> 00:05:21,906
She’s so smart that I’ve hired her.

111
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:24,007
Don’t talk too much.

112
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:24,807
Are you sure?

113
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:29,507
Uh!

114
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:31,406
Yeah, I talked to him last week,

115
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:33,607
and he said the architect will come check out the site

116
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:34,406
by the end of the month.

117
00:05:34,406 --> 00:05:36,206
But I think that's kind of late for summer, you know?

118
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:39,206
'cause there'll be a lot of guests staying over.

119
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,507
Bye. Bye.

120
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,007
Seriously though.

121
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:43,206
What?

122
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:45,007
You’re this busy.

123
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:46,706
Why do you need to come to Bangkok?

124
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:48,206
I’m meeting my friend.

125
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:50,007
A friend?

126
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:52,507
Or a girlfriend?

127
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:55,007
I’ve been longing to be more than a friend.

128
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:57,206
But I’m waiting for the fortune.

129
00:05:57,206 --> 00:05:58,507
But at this time,

130
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:00,406
it’s good enough for me.

131
00:06:00,406 --> 00:06:01,706
Well,

132
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:02,706
do I know

133
00:06:02,706 --> 00:06:05,007
the one you’re talking about?

134
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:09,307
I told you before you don’t know her.

135
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:10,807
Well, I think I’m getting off here.

136
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:12,307
Huh? You mean now?

137
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:14,307
Umm. The traffic is bad.

138
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,307
I’ll ride a sky train instead.

139
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:17,507
See you at home.

140
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:18,607
Bye. Bye.

141
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:21,007
Well, please let me get off right in front over there.

142
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:54,406
We don’t have a deposit service here.

143
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:56,507
If you arrived here a little late,

144
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:59,107
this would be thrown away.

145
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:01,906
You’re so mean.

146
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:04,507
Why are you back so early?

147
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,607
I couldn’t stand missing you.

148
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:09,206
So, I hurriedly came back here.

149
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:11,007
Why do you work hard like this,

150
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:15,307
Miss Studio Owner.

151
00:07:15,307 --> 00:07:16,406
By the way,

152
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:18,307
you’ve been traveling frequently like this,

153
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:20,906
don’t you feel tired?

154
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:23,206
Not seeing you in person

155
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:26,406
is more tiring.

156
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:28,607
We haven’t met for a long time.

157
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:31,507
Don’t you miss me?

158
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:35,507
Uh.

159
00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:37,406
I somehow miss you.

160
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:38,206
Ooh!

161
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:41,906
Somehow?

162
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:44,507
Without the word ‘somehow’, please.

163
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:46,507
Please.

164
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:59,906
I miss you.

165
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:01,706
Will you need a hug?

166
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:04,007
How could you know what I want?

167
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:06,007
So smart.

168
00:08:12,307 --> 00:08:16,007
Will you leave right away?

169
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:16,706
Umm.

170
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:17,706
I finished working.

171
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:21,507
I’m going home.

172
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:22,206
Oh!

173
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:23,507
Can I go with you?

174
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:27,607
Are you asking for permission to visit my place?

175
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,007
Or are you going to sleep over with me?

176
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:32,607
Well, you’d better consider this situation.

177
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:34,707
Will you let me go back home alone

178
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:37,007
and be lonely in my bedroom by myself?

179
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:39,507
I think it’s unfair.

180
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:40,507
Umm.

181
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:44,306
Okay. A night for you.

182
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:45,007
Wow!

183
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:07,207
If one day,

184
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:10,007
Air and Lamp are divorcing,

185
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:14,707
so, I must have to disappear, right?

186
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:29,542
What are you doing?

187
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:37,643
I just helped take your shoes off.

188
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:46,542
What are you thinking about?

189
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:51,643
Nothing.

190
00:10:51,643 --> 00:10:54,542
I’m okay if you think about it.

191
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:57,743
Because I also thought about it.

192
00:10:57,743 --> 00:10:58,542
Well,

193
00:10:58,542 --> 00:10:59,943
you’d better wash your hands

194
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:01,743
for hygiene.

195
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:04,643
The restroom’s over there. Go!

196
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:01,342
Can I take a bath with you?

197
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:51,642
Are you awake?

198
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:53,442
Uh.

199
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:55,243
Well, I’ve to go.

200
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:58,243
Next time, if you’re busy,

201
00:16:58,243 --> 00:17:02,243
you don’t have to come.

202
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:05,642
Do you want something to eat?

203
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:07,142
No, thank you.

204
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,243
You can go back to sleep.

205
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:11,743
I’m okay.

206
00:17:11,743 --> 00:17:13,043
I’ll make something for you to eat.

207
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:15,743
It doesn’t take too long.

208
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:35,942
Your pyjamas aren’t proper, you know?

209
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:37,142
I’m at home.

210
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:39,642
I can wear whatever.

211
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:43,942
Aren’t you afraid I won’t be able to take it anymore?

212
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:45,043
I’m not afraid at all

213
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,243
as you must hold yourself back.

214
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:53,243
Thank you.

215
00:17:53,243 --> 00:17:56,243
When you are home safely, let me know.

216
00:18:01,142 --> 00:18:04,142
Are you okay?

217
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:08,343
I’m alright.

218
00:18:08,343 --> 00:18:10,743
You’re not a professional liar.

219
00:18:10,743 --> 00:18:12,542
If you don’t want to tell me,

220
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:15,943
that’s fine.

221
00:18:15,943 --> 00:18:17,042
I just feel

222
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:19,743
a little bit sad

223
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:21,743
that when I see you,

224
00:18:21,743 --> 00:18:25,243
I can be with you only for a short time and then leave.

225
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:27,142
If possible,

226
00:18:27,142 --> 00:18:29,343
I’d want to be with you much longer.

227
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:30,943
When are you coming back again?

228
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,743
Maybe, next week.

229
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:35,743
But I’ll

230
00:18:35,743 --> 00:18:38,343
come and see you first.

231
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:40,042
Ahem!

232
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:42,743
Don’t you plan to go back to your own home?

233
00:18:42,743 --> 00:18:45,443
The house is always there.

234
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:49,542
But if it’s you here, I’m not sure.

235
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,443
If one day,

236
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:56,042
Air and Lamp are divorcing.

237
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:58,243
So, I must disappear, right?

238
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:08,943
Will you feel sad?

239
00:19:08,943 --> 00:19:12,743
Sure, I will.

240
00:19:12,743 --> 00:19:16,042
But you don’t have to worry about me.

241
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:24,642
VIP guests are checking in this evening.

242
00:19:24,642 --> 00:19:27,943
I’ve to leave now to get things ready to welcome them.

243
00:19:27,943 --> 00:19:31,042
See you next week.

244
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:32,243
Uh.

245
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:34,243
See you.

246
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,743
You’ve discussed this with the latest supplier, right?

247
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:44,743
Well, Miss Air.

248
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:47,243
Miss Juthamas would like to see you here.

249
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:51,243
You came back from the trip for a long time.

250
00:19:51,243 --> 00:19:52,542
What have you been up to?

251
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:54,142
I’ve called you many times.

252
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:57,243
Lamp was bothered with your absence.

253
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:01,943
How was it?

254
00:20:01,943 --> 00:20:03,943
Any updates?

255
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:05,642
What are you asking about?

256
00:20:05,642 --> 00:20:09,943
You know what I meant.

257
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:12,142
Well,

258
00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:14,343
we’re not ready to have a kid.

259
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:16,343
You’re getting older and older.

260
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:19,443
Having a kid when you’re old is risky and tiring, you know?

261
00:20:19,443 --> 00:20:20,743
Yes, I know.

262
00:20:20,743 --> 00:20:23,343
You guys have been married for many years.

263
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:25,042
Are you sure

264
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:27,743
you’ve been a good wife?

265
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:33,443
If you’re talking about producing a kid,

266
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:35,142
I failed, then.

267
00:20:35,142 --> 00:20:36,743
Stop being sarcastic!

268
00:20:36,743 --> 00:20:38,542
Don’t you think Lamp is pitiful?

269
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:40,243
Why are you so selfish?

270
00:20:40,243 --> 00:20:42,542
Am I selfish? Are you sure?

271
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:49,142
Is that all

272
00:20:49,142 --> 00:20:52,142
that you’re here for?

273
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:55,042
How many times have we talked about this?

274
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:57,243
It’s you who chose Lamp.

275
00:20:57,243 --> 00:20:59,243
Or it was you, Mom

276
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:01,443
who forced me to choose!

277
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:04,943
I think

278
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:07,343
we shouldn’t talk about this anymore.

279
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:10,642
If there’s nothing else,

280
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:11,943
I think you might want to leave.

281
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:13,943
Don’t you get smart with me!?

282
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:16,042
The dependent person who needs family support like you

283
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,243
must watch your words!

284
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,943
For your whole life,

285
00:21:19,943 --> 00:21:22,142
you’ve never faced any difficulties

286
00:21:22,142 --> 00:21:24,142
because of me. Don’t you remember?

287
00:21:24,142 --> 00:21:25,642
Without Lamp’s support,

288
00:21:25,642 --> 00:21:28,542
your dad’s unsuccessful business

289
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:30,943
would have put us in a homeless status.

290
00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:32,642
Well, it wasn’t me

291
00:21:32,642 --> 00:21:35,743
who caused the bankrupted business.

292
00:21:35,743 --> 00:21:37,343
I’ve to be responsible for everything

293
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:39,343
right here right now.

294
00:21:39,343 --> 00:21:42,142
Isn’t it enough?

295
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:44,142
I don’t know.

296
00:21:44,142 --> 00:21:48,443
You’ve no choice. You’ve to do what I want.

297
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:51,542
Mom,

298
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:54,243
I’ve something to tell you.

299
00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:02,243
You need to apologize to him.

300
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:03,943
Don’t let this happen.

301
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:06,642
What if he wouldn’t give any financial support to us.

302
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:07,743
No, Mom.

303
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,642
I’m ready for anything.

304
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:10,743
But it’s about your future.

305
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:12,443
Or your own future, Mom?

306
00:22:12,443 --> 00:22:13,542
Air!

307
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,142
No! No! No!

308
00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:16,042
No way!

309
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:17,743
I can’t let it end like this.

310
00:22:30,943 --> 00:22:31,743
Yes, Miss Air.

311
00:22:31,743 --> 00:22:32,642
Kat, please.

312
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,443
Cancel all the afternoon meetings

313
00:22:34,443 --> 00:22:36,443
of mine.

314
00:22:36,443 --> 00:22:37,943
I don’t feel well.

315
00:22:37,943 --> 00:22:41,843
Err. But …

316
00:22:41,843 --> 00:22:47,243
Do you have anything to tell me?

317
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:48,443
Well, nothing.

318
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:50,542
I’ll manage it right now.

319
00:23:05,243 --> 00:23:07,443
Oh! Hello.

320
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:08,743
Long time no see.

321
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:10,042
Are you here to meet Pure?

322
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:10,943
Right.

323
00:23:10,943 --> 00:23:12,542
Here you are.

324
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,042
I brought you your favorites.

325
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:16,443
Oh! Thank you so much.

326
00:23:16,443 --> 00:23:18,042
Can you wait a minute?

327
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:19,443
Pure’s finishing up soon.

328
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:21,743
No problem.

329
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:23,243
Well, this should be alright.

330
00:23:23,243 --> 00:23:24,743
With this wrist position.

331
00:23:24,743 --> 00:23:27,243
With this degree.

332
00:23:49,743 --> 00:23:52,142
Did you have a fight with your mom?

333
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:56,142
I can guess.

334
00:23:56,142 --> 00:23:59,243
Are you comforting me?

335
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:17,133
Why can you be here

336
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:19,833
at this time?

337
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,933
Don’t you have to work?

338
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:23,433
I skipped work.

339
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:24,933
Huh?

340
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:27,433
Are you serious?

341
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:31,033
Skipping work?

342
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:36,033
Is there something wrong?

343
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:39,332
Can I just see you without a reason?

344
00:24:39,332 --> 00:24:41,433
Did you have a fight with your mom?

345
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:47,033
I can guess.

346
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:51,232
Are you comforting me?

347
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:55,433
What’s it about?

348
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:57,433
There’s nothing much.

349
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:09,232
How can I comfort you

350
00:25:09,232 --> 00:25:12,433
as we can’t do

351
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:19,433
what we used to do.

352
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:22,433
I’m sorry

353
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:25,433
for making everything

354
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:35,433
so complicated.

355
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:42,133
Air,

356
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:43,933
that’s fine.

357
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:59,433
Pure,

358
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:03,433
For the divorce,

359
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:11,433
Soon it will be over.

360
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:15,433
Lamp’s going to divorce me.

361
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:21,433
You forced him, I know.

362
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:22,433
Mom,

363
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:24,433
Lamp has dignity

364
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:26,433
and he can make a decision for his life too.

365
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:27,433
Because you don’t behave,

366
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:29,433
he’s going to divorce you,

367
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:31,433
right?

368
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:32,433
But everything we’ve done

369
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:34,433
is for your future.

370
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:36,433
Air,

371
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:38,433
listen to me.

372
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:39,433
You must apologize to him.

373
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:43,433
You’ve to make him change his mind.

374
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:45,433
Don’t you feel embarrassed?

375
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:46,433
You’ve just got married,

376
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:48,433
but you are asked for a divorce.

377
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:49,132
If he wants to completely end the relationship with you,

378
00:26:49,132 --> 00:26:49,933
and quit all financial support,

379
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:50,933
how can we survive?

380
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:52,933
No, Mom.

381
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:54,433
I’m done.

382
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:56,433
But it’s for your future.

383
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:58,433
Or it’s for your own future, Mom?

384
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:01,433
Air!

385
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:03,433
Mom, please listen to me.

386
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:04,933
You don’t have to worry about the financial matter.

387
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:06,933
I’ll talk to Lamp.

388
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:07,933
I’ll ask him to support you

389
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:09,933
as usual.

390
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:11,433
Mom,

391
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:14,433
if we had nothing left,

392
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,433
I wouldn’t leave you behind.

393
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:18,433
Mom, please don’t panic.

394
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:20,433
No! No! No!

395
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:21,433
No way!

396
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:28,433
I can’t let it end like this.

397
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:45,433
What else can you do, Mom?

398
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:51,433
If I get divorced,

399
00:27:51,433 --> 00:27:55,433
I’ll be asking

400
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:59,433
if you’d like to be with me.

401
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:02,433
You know well

402
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:06,433
I’ve been waiting for you.

403
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:09,433
Yes, I know.
70
But the last time we talked about this

404
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:15,433
you were different.

405
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:16,433
Well,
73
if I divorce him

406
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,433
one day,

407
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,433
and you change your mind,

408
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:29,433
just let me know.

409
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:34,433
If I’ve someone else,

410
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:44,433
will it be okay for you?

411
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:53,433
So, you do have someone now, don’t you?

412
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:57,433
Am I right?

413
00:28:57,433 --> 00:29:01,433
Someone who has been your happiness

414
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:06,433
when I’m not here for you.

415
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:11,433
Is it my fault?

416
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,433
It’s you who told me

417
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:17,433
not to wait for you.

418
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:20,433
But actually,

419
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:35,433
no one can replace you.

420
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:39,433
You don’t have to give me a final answer now.

421
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:44,433
But I want you to know

422
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:49,433
up until now

423
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:55,433
I’ve had only you in my heart.

424
00:29:55,433 --> 00:29:58,433
But you know what?

425
00:29:58,433 --> 00:30:01,433
Actions speak louder than words.

426
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:25,433
I just asked you out to have an easy meal.

427
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:28,433
Why do you need those heels and be this beautiful?

428
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:29,332
I’ve changed my mind.

429
00:30:29,332 --> 00:30:30,832
It’s fashionable.

430
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:34,832
I’ll eat here instead.

431
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:37,033
Well, I’ve been here before.

432
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:37,733
Sure.

433
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:40,832
I took you to the pub over there once.

434
00:30:40,832 --> 00:30:41,733
I mean I’d been here before that night.

435
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:48,832
I’ve been here with …

436
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,832
Why did you arrive faster this time?

437
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:53,832
You drove fast, huh?

438
00:30:53,832 --> 00:30:55,832
No, it’s normal.

439
00:30:55,832 --> 00:30:56,832
Or …

440
00:30:56,832 --> 00:30:57,832
it’s my physical body

441
00:30:57,832 --> 00:31:00,832
hurriedly wanting to see you.

442
00:31:00,832 --> 00:31:01,832
It’s dangerous.

443
00:31:01,832 --> 00:31:04,832
Are you worried about me?

444
00:31:04,832 --> 00:31:05,832
Sure.

445
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:06,832
In case of emergency,

446
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:09,832
your sister …

447
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:12,832
If you want to continue mentioning Air,

448
00:31:12,832 --> 00:31:14,832
I’m fine.

449
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,832
But

450
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:17,832
before Air

451
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:21,832
hadn’t you been in a relationship with anyone?

452
00:31:21,832 --> 00:31:22,832
Uh.

453
00:31:22,832 --> 00:31:25,832
No, it’s my 5-year relationship with Air.

454
00:31:25,832 --> 00:31:29,832
So, it’s hard to quit.

455
00:31:29,832 --> 00:31:31,832
I’m sorry that

456
00:31:31,832 --> 00:31:33,832
I’ve missed some of you calls.

457
00:31:33,832 --> 00:31:36,832
So, we haven’t talked often.

458
00:31:36,832 --> 00:31:37,832
I’ve been

459
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:38,832
a bit busy.

460
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:44,832
We aren’t in that serious relationship, I know.

461
00:31:44,832 --> 00:31:46,832
Well,

462
00:31:46,832 --> 00:31:51,832
are you sleeping over at my place tonight?

463
00:31:51,832 --> 00:31:55,832
I’m afraid not.

464
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,832
After the meal,

465
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:00,832
I’m going home to see my family.

466
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:01,832
Whenever I’m in Bangkok,

467
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:04,832
they hardly see me in person.

468
00:32:04,832 --> 00:32:06,832
I thought you’d avoid meeting me.

469
00:32:06,832 --> 00:32:10,832
Like what you’ve done? Avoiding me?

470
00:32:10,832 --> 00:32:11,832
Hey!

471
00:32:11,832 --> 00:32:13,832
Why do you always twist things around?

472
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:16,832
Well, are you going to finishing the whole fried pork by yourself?

473
00:32:16,832 --> 00:32:17,832
You don’t eat it, anyway.

474
00:32:17,832 --> 00:32:19,832
How do you know I don’t eat it?

475
00:32:19,832 --> 00:32:23,832
By appearance, it just looks plain.

476
00:32:27,832 --> 00:32:28,832
Hey!

477
00:32:28,832 --> 00:32:29,832
How come? It’s so yummy!

478
00:32:29,832 --> 00:32:30,832
I told you.

479
00:32:30,832 --> 00:32:32,832
But you can only have one.

480
00:32:32,832 --> 00:32:34,832
The rest is mine.

481
00:32:34,832 --> 00:32:36,832
You didn’t order an extra for me.

482
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:37,832
Pure!

483
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:38,332
It’s mine.

484
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:39,832
Hey, you’ve got 3 dishes already.

485
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:40,832
I’ve only one.

486
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:42,832
You can order more.

487
00:32:42,832 --> 00:32:45,832
Oh! You stole mine.

488
00:33:12,832 --> 00:33:13,433
Are you busy at work?

489
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:15,832
Huh.

490
00:33:15,832 --> 00:33:17,832
It’s okay, Dad.

491
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:21,832
Why isn’t Air here with you?

492
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:24,832
She’s busy with her work now.

493
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:25,832
Lamp,

494
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:27,832
I think

495
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:28,633
you’d better have Air

496
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:29,832
stop working.

497
00:33:29,832 --> 00:33:31,133
Only taking care of household matters

498
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:32,832
is too much.

499
00:33:32,832 --> 00:33:34,832
As a man,

500
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:35,832
you shouldn’t

501
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:37,832
let your beloved wife

502
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:38,832
work too hard.

503
00:33:38,832 --> 00:33:39,832
Alright, Dad.

504
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:41,832
Because of working hard,

505
00:33:41,832 --> 00:33:43,832
Air’s stressed,

506
00:33:43,832 --> 00:33:44,832
and she isn’t fit for having a kid.

507
00:33:44,832 --> 00:33:46,832
Uh.

508
00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:47,133
Well,

509
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:47,832
Another thing,

510
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:49,832
I think

511
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:51,832
our family and Air’s

512
00:33:51,832 --> 00:33:52,832
have been in a long-lasting relationship

513
00:33:52,832 --> 00:33:54,832
and our businesses

514
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,832
need the next generation to take care of them.

515
00:33:56,832 --> 00:33:59,832
ถ้ายังขืนใช้ชีวิตเรื่อยเปื่อยแบบเนี้ย If you guys live like this,

516
00:33:59,832 --> 00:34:00,832
it might be too late.

517
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:08,832
Well, Dad, I don’t think things can be easily like what you’ve thought.

518
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:12,832
I’ve made a decision

519
00:34:12,832 --> 00:34:15,832
that I’m divorcing Air.

520
00:34:15,832 --> 00:34:17,832
What happened?

521
00:34:17,832 --> 00:34:19,832
If you guys have problems,

522
00:34:19,832 --> 00:34:22,832
you’d better talk to each other.

523
00:34:22,832 --> 00:34:27,832
The problem is

524
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,832
Air has never loved me, Mom.

525
00:34:30,832 --> 00:34:32,832
What do you mean?

526
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,832
You’ve been married for many years.

527
00:34:34,832 --> 00:34:35,832
But she’s just known she doesn’t love you?

528
00:34:35,832 --> 00:34:37,832
It’s not Air’s fault.

529
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:38,832
But why now?

530
00:34:38,832 --> 00:34:42,832
It’s …

531
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:44,832
Dad, you’ve told me

532
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:48,832
that a man mustn’t hurt a woman.

533
00:34:48,832 --> 00:34:49,832
I can’t hurt Air’s feelings

534
00:34:49,832 --> 00:34:52,832
any longer, Dad.

535
00:34:52,832 --> 00:34:54,832
I’m so sorry, Dad and Mom

536
00:34:54,832 --> 00:35:09,832
that I disappointed you.

537
00:35:09,832 --> 00:35:13,832
Well, since things have come this far,

538
00:35:13,832 --> 00:35:15,832
you’ve to manage everything properly.

539
00:35:15,832 --> 00:35:16,832
You should know

540
00:35:16,832 --> 00:35:18,832
what you should do.

541
00:35:18,832 --> 00:35:24,832
You’re mature. You’re a man.

542
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,832
I agree with Dad.

543
00:35:26,832 --> 00:35:31,832
Take care of everything.

544
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:33,832
Don’t let it be too long.
215
If not,

545
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:40,832
you both will be more depressed.

546
00:35:40,832 --> 00:35:52,832
Okay, Mom.

547
00:35:52,832 --> 00:35:54,832
I know everything.

548
00:35:54,832 --> 00:35:57,832
What is it about?!

549
00:35:57,832 --> 00:36:00,832
About you and Pure!

550
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:36,348
Why are you back so early?

551
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:37,848
I thought you’re sleeping over

552
00:36:37,848 --> 00:36:39,649
at your parents’ place.

553
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:42,048
Well, it’s because

554
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:44,848
I’ve something to talk to you.

555
00:36:44,848 --> 00:36:50,149
Sure.

556
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:53,948
I’ve made a decision.

557
00:36:53,948 --> 00:37:02,249
We’re going to divorce.

558
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:08,948
Lamp,

559
00:37:08,948 --> 00:37:11,448
Well, as we’re going to completely separate,

560
00:37:11,448 --> 00:37:13,149
I’d like to sleep here. Can I?

561
00:37:19,248 --> 00:37:22,849
I’ve told my parents about the decision.

562
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:24,849
What did they say?

563
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:26,448
They’re okay.

564
00:37:26,448 --> 00:37:27,649
They didn’t complain about it.

565
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:34,649
Are they welcoming another daughter?

566
00:37:37,649 --> 00:37:39,948
I also told my mom

567
00:37:39,948 --> 00:37:42,149
that you were asking me for a divorce.

568
00:37:42,149 --> 00:37:44,349
But for my mom,

569
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:46,149
it might take a long time

570
00:37:46,149 --> 00:37:48,149
to make her believe

571
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:51,849
that you want to divorce me.

572
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:55,448
Loft’s known this already.

573
00:37:55,448 --> 00:37:57,349
She’s in Bangkok?

574
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:58,849
Um.

575
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:03,649
Well, …

576
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:05,149
Huh?

577
00:38:16,149 --> 00:38:20,149
Did you eat anything?

578
00:38:20,149 --> 00:38:21,549
Not yet.

579
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,949
After leaving the office,

580
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:24,049
I came straight home.

581
00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:24,848
Do you want something to eat?

582
00:38:24,848 --> 00:38:26,649
I’ll make it for you.

583
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:27,949
Lamp,

584
00:38:27,949 --> 00:38:29,049
you can cook, really?

585
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:30,449
No, I can’t,

586
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:32,949
but I’m the best at preparing instant noodles. Don’t you know?

587
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:34,348
That’s the only thing

588
00:38:34,348 --> 00:38:35,848
I can show off to others.

589
00:38:35,848 --> 00:38:37,649
The only thing I can claim is that I’m better than Loft, anyway.

590
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,848
Why are you smiling.

591
00:38:49,848 --> 00:38:51,348
Nothing,

592
00:38:51,348 --> 00:38:53,149
You should wait at the table.

593
00:38:53,149 --> 00:38:54,949
I’ll serve you when it’s ready.

594
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:56,649
Uh.

595
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:04,649
Oh,

596
00:39:04,649 --> 00:39:06,949
The work from the office.

597
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:08,149
Oh!

598
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:10,649
Alright.

599
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:05,049
Place your arm next to your ear.

600
00:40:05,049 --> 00:40:08,649
Bend your body to the left.

601
00:40:08,649 --> 00:40:10,649
Okay.

602
00:40:10,649 --> 00:40:13,949
If Air comes back to Pure,

603
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:15,549
and then?

604
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:17,848
What should I do?

605
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,248
Things are changing.

606
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:20,449
Is it real?

607
00:40:25,949 --> 00:40:27,848
Loft, you’ve a coming call.

608
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:29,649
Are you answering the call?

609
00:40:29,649 --> 00:40:31,048
No, I’m not.

610
00:40:31,048 --> 00:40:32,048
Let it be.

611
00:40:32,048 --> 00:40:33,649
It will stop shortly.

612
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:37,848
Or you can take a break.

613
00:40:37,848 --> 00:40:39,048
It’s okay.

614
00:40:39,048 --> 00:40:41,348
Or shall I stop seeing Pure?

615
00:40:41,348 --> 00:40:43,249
Sigh! What should I do?

616
00:40:43,249 --> 00:40:45,348
Why do I have to stop?

617
00:40:45,348 --> 00:40:46,548
I feel about Pure

618
00:40:46,548 --> 00:40:48,048
the same way as Air does.

619
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:50,149
Ooh! Loft, are you okay?

620
00:40:50,149 --> 00:40:51,249
Are you alright?

621
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,348
I’m okay.

622
00:40:52,348 --> 00:40:54,348
I think it should be enough for today.

623
00:40:54,348 --> 00:40:55,449
Well, I’m taking …

624
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:56,548
some ice for relieving the pain.

625
00:40:56,548 --> 00:40:57,249
Thank you.

626
00:40:57,249 --> 00:40:58,149
Slowly.

627
00:40:59,149 --> 00:41:00,149
Ouch!

628
00:41:00,149 --> 00:41:01,449
I’m sorry.

629
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:02,449
Ow! That’s alright.

630
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:04,649
I was overthinking about something else.

631
00:41:09,649 --> 00:41:12,149
Your new girlfriend’s kept calling.

632
00:41:12,149 --> 00:41:13,949
Yes.

633
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:15,048
Your new girlfriend’s name

634
00:41:15,048 --> 00:41:17,149
is Ploy?

635
00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:18,048
Oh!

636
00:41:18,048 --> 00:41:20,649
She’s my secretary.

637
00:41:20,649 --> 00:41:22,649
Oh.

638
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:24,048
Well, Loft.

639
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,048
What?

640
00:41:25,048 --> 00:41:31,048
You’ve known Lamp’s divorcing me, right?

641
00:41:31,048 --> 00:41:32,149
Yes.

642
00:41:32,149 --> 00:41:35,649
Lamp told me already.

643
00:41:35,649 --> 00:41:37,949
I’m having a meeting today.

644
00:41:37,949 --> 00:41:39,649
I’ve to go now.

645
00:41:39,649 --> 00:41:41,449
If it swells,

646
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:42,348
tell me. Okay?

647
00:41:42,348 --> 00:41:43,649
I’m taking you to hospital.

648
00:41:43,649 --> 00:41:44,449
Okay.

649
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:45,848
Don’t worry!

650
00:41:45,848 --> 00:41:47,649
Thank you for your care.

651
00:41:47,649 --> 00:41:49,048
No problem.

652
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,348
Now, Loft you can continue putting ice on it.

653
00:41:50,348 --> 00:41:53,449
Thank you.

654
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:54,649
I’ve to leave now.

655
00:41:54,649 --> 00:41:56,149
Umm.

656
00:42:03,149 --> 00:42:04,149
What's the matter, huh?

657
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:04,949
Ouch!

658
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:07,149
Why did you stare at her like that?

659
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,949
Anything interesting?

660
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:10,949
She looks obviously happy, and it’s not normal.

661
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:13,949
I also noticed skin-ship and touching.

662
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:17,149
You’re divorcing, aren’t you?

663
00:42:17,149 --> 00:42:19,249
Because of the divorce,

664
00:42:19,249 --> 00:42:23,149
she seems to have less concern.

665
00:42:23,149 --> 00:42:24,649
Sigh! Well,

666
00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:27,449
are you really okay?

667
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:30,149
Uh.

668
00:42:30,149 --> 00:42:32,949
Maybe, it’s the best thing for her.

669
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:40,249
I’ve known about it.

670
00:42:40,249 --> 00:42:43,249
What is it about?

671
00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:44,649
About you and Pure!

672
00:43:03,149 --> 00:43:04,649
Air doesn’t know about this, does she?

673
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:05,848
Not yet.

674
00:43:05,848 --> 00:43:08,649
But Air’s free now.

675
00:43:08,649 --> 00:43:10,848
Loft, you’d better think about this carefully.

676
00:43:10,848 --> 00:43:13,548
Between the one she’s been waiting for for more than 3 years,

677
00:43:13,548 --> 00:43:16,348
and the newcomer who she’s known for several months,

678
00:43:16,348 --> 00:43:18,649
whom is she going to choose?

679
00:43:32,149 --> 00:43:35,649
Are you going to sleep over here?

680
00:43:35,649 --> 00:43:37,848
Can I?

681
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:40,649
Sure.

682
00:43:55,649 --> 00:43:57,649
Let me be here with you, please.

683
00:43:57,649 --> 00:43:58,949
Loft,

684
00:43:58,949 --> 00:44:00,649
what happened?

685
00:44:00,649 --> 00:44:03,649
I just wanted to be beside you like this

686
00:44:03,649 --> 00:44:05,649
until the end.

687
00:44:05,649 --> 00:44:08,649
Loft!

688
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:11,649
I know well you still love Air.

689
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:15,449
But I also love you.

690
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:18,249
But being like this

691
00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:20,649
is good enough for me.

692
00:44:20,649 --> 00:44:21,649
I mean it.

693
00:44:23,649 --> 00:44:25,649
Loft!

694
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:55,149
You kissed me while I was sleeping?

695
00:44:55,149 --> 00:44:58,149
I can’t forgive it.

696
00:44:58,149 --> 00:44:59,649
You aren’t okay.

697
00:44:59,649 --> 00:45:03,149
What will you do then?

698
00:45:03,149 --> 00:45:05,649
What about this?

699
00:45:09,948 --> 00:45:11,649
Are you hungry?

700
00:45:11,649 --> 00:45:14,448
I’ll cook you something to eat downstairs.

701
00:45:14,448 --> 00:45:16,249
Umm.

702
00:45:16,249 --> 00:45:17,448
Maybe not. I’m fine.

703
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:21,649
We can go downstairs together.

704
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:41,649
What are you looking at?

705
00:45:41,649 --> 00:45:43,149
Are you embarrassed?

706
00:45:43,149 --> 00:45:44,649
I’ve seen everything clearly.

707
00:45:44,649 --> 00:45:47,649
Naughty!

708
00:45:53,649 --> 00:45:55,649
What?!

709
00:45:55,649 --> 00:45:57,649
Nothing.

710
00:45:57,649 --> 00:46:00,649
Are you going downstairs to eat?

711
00:46:00,649 --> 00:46:02,649
Okay. I’m hungry now, Chef!

712
00:46:02,649 --> 00:46:05,149
Well, let me go then.

713
00:46:05,149 --> 00:46:05,948
No.

714
00:46:05,948 --> 00:46:06,948
I’ve changed my mind.

715
00:46:06,948 --> 00:46:07,948
What?

716
00:46:07,948 --> 00:46:09,649
I’ll have you instead.

717
00:46:11,149 --> 00:46:12,149
Come on!

718
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,149
It’s my turn.

719
00:47:23,649 --> 00:47:25,149
What happened, Loft?

720
00:47:25,149 --> 00:47:27,149
I’ve just thought that

721
00:47:27,149 --> 00:47:29,649
if you went back to Air,

722
00:47:29,649 --> 00:47:31,448
how could I survive?

723
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:32,649
Loft!

724
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:34,149
I miss you.

725
00:47:34,149 --> 00:47:35,649
So do I.

726
00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:37,649
I’ve missed you

727
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,149
always.

728
00:47:39,149 --> 00:47:42,149
Until that person came in, right?

729
00:47:42,149 --> 00:47:44,649
Why do I have to choose?
