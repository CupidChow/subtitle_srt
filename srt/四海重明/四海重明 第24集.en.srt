[Love's Rebellion]

[Episode 24]

4
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,860
Since you're willing to be the scapegoat,

5
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,620
I'll give you a ride.

6
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,229
Something's added to this candle.

7
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,740
Dawn herb

8
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,259
in powdered form.

9
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,600
It helps keep the fire burning.

10
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,510
So the annual sacrificial ritual

11
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,370
is all about these evil tricks.

12
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,600
Demonic cultivator!

13
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,060
Today, the sacrificial ritual begins.

14
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,590
The demonic cultivator won't give up easily.

15
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,890
Since Heaven has given us a bait,

16
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,000
let them fight for it.

17
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,910
The bride

18
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,940
will be decided by Evil Lord.

19
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,280
If the candle goes out,

20
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,550
you must leave the cave immediately.

21
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,870
Don't fight

22
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,020
and hurt each other.

23
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,010
Go in.

24
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,410
Don't worry.

25
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,780
I'll be out soon.

26
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,240
Jiao Niang.

27
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,080
Welcome, Chief Nan.

28
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,649
Congratulations, Chief Nan.

29
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,670
Chief Nan, I heard you're engaged

30
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,529
and will marry your beloved soon.

31
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,710
Recently, mermaid spirits

32
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,680
have been causing trouble nearby and hurting people.

33
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,390
The court has ordered for a mermaid hunt

34
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,720
and finally caught one.

35
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,810
The mermaid spirit's plight

36
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,450
can be considered compensation for her sins.

37
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,390
The mermaid spirit deserves to die.

38
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,550
If we take its silver mermaid pearl alive,

39
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,830
we'll get a ray of precious light

40
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,110
that's priceless.

41
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,100
Let's kill her now.

42
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,360
But the heaven and earth are watching.

43
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,190
I'm willing to use my humble skill

44
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,930
to let it die without pain.

45
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,610
I hope everyone

46
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,790
doesn't seize her elixir alive.

47
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,350
Young Lord Nan, you're famous for your qin skills.

48
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,190
You specially made a trip here.

49
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,710
I dare not disobey.

50
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,590
It's also part of the mermaid spirit's fate

51
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,780
that she gets to

52
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,290
die happily to this magical tune.

53
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,860
Yes.

54
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,510
We can take the elixir now.

55
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,370
Hurry up.

56
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,480
We can finally take the elixir.

57
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,330
Hurry up.

58
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,450
Get the elixir!

59
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,350
Hurry up! Get it!

60
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,210
That's right.

61
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,100
As expected, it's not mortal.

62
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,740
Back then, for my own selfish reasons,

63
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,680
I hurt Jiao Niang

64
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,610
and caused big trouble.

65
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,360
That's why things ended up like this.

66
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,150
It's a serious crime to release

67
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,280
a spirit privately.

68
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,200
Haven't you thought of the consequences?

69
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,530
Sir.

70
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,690
Have you ever regretted it?

71
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,640
After seeing you today,

72
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,180
I know you

73
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,150
can tell right from wrong.

74
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,860
You must've had your reasons

75
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,710
for the matter

76
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,909
in Linglong Capital.

77
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,460
To save her clansmen,

78
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,470
Yin Ya did what she did despite knowing it's impossible.

79
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,670
I know all the righteous sects

80
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,470
hate spirits.

81
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,690
But they are my flesh and blood.

82
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,120
How can I watch

83
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,360
innocent spirits get hurt

84
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
and do nothing?

85
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Even if I let you into the formation,

86
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,230
you'll have to pay a huge price

87
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,630
to force the Spirit-Subduing Tablet open.

88
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,750
Even if I'm obliterated,

89
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,730
I won't regret it.

90
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,920
I'm joining you!

91
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,550
You have a big family and business.

92
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,670
Why are you joining me?

93
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,270
It's none of your business.

94
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,350
I said I'm joining you and that's that.

95
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,840
Wait...

96
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,280
Enough, enough.

97
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,560
Young and foolish.

98
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,520
Fine.

99
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,429
If the fox spirits live in seclusion

100
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,760
and vow never to do evil,

101
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,390
I...

102
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,390
am willing to help.

103
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,080
But I can only

104
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,570
sustain it for 30 minutes.

105
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,750
I've never entered this formation before.

106
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,750
I can't guide you.

107
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,400
You've to rely on your wits.

108
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,010
-They're out.
-They're out.

109
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,650
Evil Lord didn't take a fancy to me.

110
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,990
It's Heaven's will.

111
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,860
Maybe your mother

112
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,850
doesnâ€™t want you to get married.

113
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,220
Chief.

114
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,380
It seems

115
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,760
you have so much love

116
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,820
for your clansmen.

117
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,010
I have no other wish in my life.

118
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,250
As long as the fort

119
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,530
is in peace,

120
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,500
I'd have lived up to my ancestors' wishes.

121
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,070
In that case,

122
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,950
why do you send people to die every year?

123
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,640
This is the rule.

124
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,270
Rules are created by people.

125
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,930
They can be flexibly changed.

126
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,860
Every year today,

127
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,720
it must be agonizing for you too.

128
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,350
So what?

129
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,290
If Evil Lord is provoked,

130
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,660
Chidi Fort will really be destroyed.

131
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,410
Foolish.

132
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,790
What does

133
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,370
a foreigner know?

134
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,820
Stop there.

135
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,290
How dare you!

136
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,520
You tampered with my wife's

137
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,490
candle.

138
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,920
Aren't you afraid I'll kill your whole clan?

139
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,750
What are you talking about?

140
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,450
The so-called Evil Lord's choice

141
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,950
is just to choose a red candle

142
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,350
and set up a secret spell.

143
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,550
The chosen one

144
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,800
is destined

145
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,670
to die.

146
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,600
You...

147
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,440
You tampered with the candle

148
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,840
you gave Nan Yan.

149
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,070
You want to protect your clansmen

150
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,900
with Nan Yan's life, right?

151
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,870
Don't forget

152
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,280
you willingly chose

153
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,640
to participate in this.

154
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,540
Count yourself lucky this time.

155
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,130
Your attempt to outwit us

156
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,250
is exactly what I want.

157
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,750
What do you want?

158
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
After today,

159
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,390
there will be no Evil Lord in Chidi Fort.

160
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,970
The Queen is coming out.

161
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,500
Welcome, Queen.

162
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,390
Welcome, Queen.

163
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,180
Why is it Su?

164
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,080
I really didn't expect

165
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,160
it to be her.

166
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,550
Su is an orphan.

167
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,130
She's really becoming the queen?

168
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:10,750
When did she

169
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,960
become so capable?

170
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,830
Ba Jiao.

171
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,190
Help your sister.

172
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,120
Evil Lord has bad taste.

173
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,490
Looks like I have to spend an eternity

174
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,860
with my wife.

175
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,780
I'm not meant to be the queen.

176
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,370
I'll just have to admit defeat.

177
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,950
Queen, please enter the formation.

178
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,440
Yan.

179
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,240
Why is your candle

180
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,510
burning so intensely?

181
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,190
What she's holding

182
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,150
is no ordinary candle.

183
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,950
Who are you?

184
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,550
The bride of Evil Lord.

185
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,550
We still don't know

186
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,740
who will win.

187
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,400
She's not Su.

188
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,980
Su can't talk.

189
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,200
Give it to me.

190
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,950
It's just the title of Queen.

191
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,750
If you want it,

192
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,030
I'll give it to you.

193
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,350
Don't you want it?

194
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,100
I'm already married to someone else.

195
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,870
How can I marry Evil Lord?

196
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,820
I was just curious today,

197
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,920
so I got Huo Wuji

198
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,510
to let me in to have a tour.

199
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,200
Here.

200
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,830
Are you okay, Huixiang?

201
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,560
When we go out,

202
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,760
don't say anything.

203
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,540
I will protect you.

204
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,440
Trust me.

205
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,510
Let's go.

206
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,620
Password.

207
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,870
This formation was created by the Great Path.

208
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,800
Is this password

209
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,640
about

210
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,200
flattering the Great Path?

211
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,280
Wrong password.

212
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,930
Two more chances left.

213
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,230
It seems we shouldn't say

214
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,430
the word "password".

215
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,350
Wrong password.

216
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,230
One more chance left.

217
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,110
Get it wrong again

218
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,990
and the formation will be sealed

219
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,060
and annihilated instantly.

220
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,790
This won't do.

221
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,030
We lost two chances.

222
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,730
There's only one chance left.

223
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,720
Do you think we can just break into it?

224
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,240
We canâ€™t use

225
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,550
our spiritual power here.

226
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,390
If a fight broke out,

227
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,350
we'd be doomed.

228
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,120
Plus, these guards

229
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,240
don't look like

230
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,630
they have keys on their waists.

231
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,870
If the formation is sealed,

232
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,460
our efforts will be in vain.

233
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,829
I have an idea.

234
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,440
I used this

235
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,050
to exorcise Nan Yan.

236
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,040
It didn't work then,

237
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,300
but it might this time.

238
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,589
Watch me.

239
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,750
Oh Heaven, Oh Earth.

240
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,430
I'm the best at exorcism.

241
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,020
Oh Heaven, Oh Earth.

242
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,610
I'm the best at exorcism.

243
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,170
I'm the best! I'm the best!

244
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,480
Hurry up.

245
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,040
Oh Heaven, Oh Earth.

246
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,770
I'm the best at exorcism.

247
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,300
Oh Heaven, Oh Earth.

248
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,110
I'm the best at exorcism.

249
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,610
Oh Heaven, Oh Earth.

250
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,260
I'm the best at exorcism.

251
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,900
I'm the best! I'm the best!

252
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,550
Oh Heaven, Oh Earth.

253
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,640
Oh Heaven, Oh Earth.

254
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,160
I'm the best at exorcism.

255
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,280
Go on!

256
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,940
Stop!

257
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,610
Have a taste of

258
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,230
the dragons' ultimate move!

259
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,860
That's it?

260
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,240
That's right.

261
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,070
I'm the ultimate move.

262
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,980
It's time.

263
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,970
Enter the bridal chamber.

264
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,750
Demonic cultivator.

265
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,060
You came after all.

266
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,630
Chief.

267
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,010
The fort's people have all been captured.

268
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,470
I'll go

269
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,570
meet your Evil Lord.

270
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,060
If you don't want to die,

271
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,520
behave yourself.

272
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,680
If you offend Evil Lord,

273
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,270
you will be punished.

274
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,290
Punished?

275
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,160
Punished?

276
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,070
Test me, and I'll kill each

277
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,280
and every one of you

278
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,690
to feed Yin Zhu inside.

279
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,210
Don't bother.

280
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,010
Your Blood Phoenix Hairpin is fake.

281
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,050
Evil Path Chief.

282
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,870
We've been waiting for you.

283
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,490
There's demonic aura.

284
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,360
It's her?

285
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,780
The Seven Sins Manual in my body

286
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,670
can detect demonic cultivators within 100 meters.

287
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,230
The fox's tail has been exposed.

288
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,290
For our next moves,

289
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,930
I'll listen to you, my lady.

290
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,370
She's poorly cultivated,

291
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,750
so she wonâ€™t cause any trouble

292
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,450
by infiltrating the fort.

293
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,940
Why don't we play

294
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,960
the long game?

295
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:43,910
The mastermind will show up

296
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,990
when the formation opens tomorrow.

297
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,710
Who are you?

298
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,960
Chief.

299
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,080
It's them.

300
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,740
Three years ago, at Filth Valley,

301
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,270
they fought for the Seven Sins Manual with us.

302
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,670
So it is

303
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,260
you two babies.

304
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,180
I didnâ€™t kill you then.

305
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,090
Isnâ€™t it good to be alive?

306
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,770
Why have you come to die today?

307
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,110
I've been thinking

308
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,650
about you too, Chief Li.

309
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,820
You're finally here today.

310
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,480
How could I not meet you?

311
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,830
I didn't expose you,

312
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,140
as I was waiting for you to walk into the trap

313
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,190
to annihilate you once and for all.

314
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,710
You're lucky to have survived

315
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,710
till today.

316
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,930
But Ji Yang must be avenged

317
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,970
with your blood.

318
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,490
Who do you think you are, kid?

319
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,280
Bloody-handed Asura?

320
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,370
Move!

321
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,450
Chief, be careful!

322
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,330
Brother!

323
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,570
Yin Zhu?

324
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,030
Take the people outside the cave away.

325
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,040
How can you control Yin Zhu?

326
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,720
Well done.

327
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,630
I'll kill them

328
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,170
for you now.

329
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,730
Get lost!

330
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,280
This and that; perceptions and thoughts.

331
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,920
Sacrifice my soul and blood to that body.

332
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,840
Soul Transference Technique?

333
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,500
He asked for it.

334
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,190
He can't bear

335
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,700
this body of mine.

336
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,040
Sen Luo...

337
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,610
Grandmaster...

338
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:39,820
I really didn't know it was you.

339
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,630
I was...

340
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,020
I was wrong.

341
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,590
Please spare my life.

342
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,890
L-Let me go.

343
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,820
This is the day I've been waiting for.

344
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,130
My dear disciple.

345
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,690
Give his body to me.

346
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,520
I've been waiting for this day.

347
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,830
We can

348
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:12,070
finally put an end to this today.

349
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,130
This and that; perceptions and thoughts.

350
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,610
Sacrifice my soul and blood to that body.

351
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,580
This and that; perceptions and thoughts.

352
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,020
Sacrifice my soul and blood to that body.

353
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,960
Nan Yan.

354
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,190
Ji Yang.

355
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,440
Ji Yang.

356
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,550
I'm fine.

357
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,710
Brother!

358
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,890
Brother.

359
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,560
Tell me.

360
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,190
Who asked you to seize the prison?

361
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,850
Kill me if you want.

362
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,490
Please!

363
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,390
No!

364
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,010
What do you know?

365
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,320
Shut... up!

366
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,160
He was wearing a mask from the beginning

367
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,740
and never showed his face.

368
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,960
-You wretch!
-I donâ€™t know...

369
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,140
Get lost!

370
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,230
Get lost!

371
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,440
-Brother.
-Get lost!

372
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:30,910
Brother!

373
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:31,840
Get lost!

374
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,050
I beg you, Brother.

375
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,010
Tell them what you know.

376
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,340
Get lost!

377
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:38,920
You failed today.

378
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,300
Do you think he will let you go?

379
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,140
Tell me the truth,

380
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,590
and I can keep her safe.

381
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,760
He committed suicide.

382
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,010
Brother!

383
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,460
Brother!

384
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,260
Brother.

385
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,310
Why didn't you tell them

386
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,590
who he was?

387
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,060
Why did you kill yourself?

388
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,310
Why did you abandon me?

389
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,700
I'm now alone in this world!

390
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,900
Li Chi deserved to die for his sins.

391
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,940
No.

392
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,240
No.

393
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,750
My brother was not a bad person.

394
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,650
He became demonic

395
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,310
to protect me.

396
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,640
It's all my fault.

397
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,170
For you?

398
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,010
He became demonic

399
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,870
to protect me.

400
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,630
Are you okay?

401
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,950
Here, Mian.

402
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,330
Mian.

403
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,150
Brother, run!

404
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,590
If Evil Path members catch up,

405
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,560
we'll both die.

406
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,010
No, I will protect you.

407
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,920
Get up now.

408
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,790
Get up.

409
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,020
Brother!

410
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:08,910
Mian!

411
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,480
Iâ€™ve done it.

412
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,250
Iâ€™ve done it!

413
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,700
I've become a demonic cultivator!

414
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,600
Brother.

415
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,110
Sister. Sister.

416
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,810
Brother.

417
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,470
Brother, how could you become demonic?

418
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,190
If our parents knew about this,

419
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,840
they...

420
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,430
If our parents knew about this,

421
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,120
they wouldn't want to see you being bullied.

422
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,550
Demonic cultivators attack every day.

423
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,010
If I don't become demonic,

424
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,350
who will protect you?

425
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,670
Don't worry.

426
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,950
I'm fine.

427
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,320
He killed Evil Path's chief

428
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,560
and replaced him.

429
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,450
Later,

430
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:33,070
he started to practice Soul Transference Technique.

431
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,680
Sometimes he was sober

432
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,000
and sometimes possessed.

433
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,890
Once he became bloodthirsty,

434
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,500
he couldn't stop.

435
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,450
I don't ask you to forgive me.

436
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,570
My brother's sins

437
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,900
can't be redeemed.

438
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,200
But

439
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,020
as his sister,

440
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,940
I want to bear

441
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,590
all of his karma and sins

442
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,790
for him.

443
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,520
I want

444
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,610
one more person in this world...

445
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,719
to remember he was a good person.

446
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,389
I don't want to hear this.

447
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,630
Leave now!

448
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,730
It's okay now.

449
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,490
Brother.

450
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,690
I'll take you away.

451
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,400
Thank you, our benefactors.

452
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,710
You saved every one of us

453
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,620
in the fort.

454
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,310
Thank you, our benefactors.

455
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,690
Thank you, our benefactors.

456
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,900
Thank you, our benefactors.

457
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,240
If you really want to thank me,

458
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,670
abolish the rule of the sacrificial ritual

459
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,970
forever.

460
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:56,790
What?

461
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,140
Evil Lord

462
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,810
will blame us!

463
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,100
Yes!

464
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,980
We've always been like this.

465
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,990
There is no Evil Lord in the cave.

466
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,750
It was just an evil thing

467
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,430
left behind from a century ago.

468
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,180
-Evil thing?
-Evil thing?

469
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,800
Yes.

470
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,230
It was just an evil thing?

471
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,190
We've been like this for so many years.

472
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,030
How could there be an evil thing?

473
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,230
How is that possible?

474
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,910
What about the Creeping Bloodthorn?

475
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,070
Over the past hundred years,

476
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,710
Creeping Bloodthorn had been infected by that evil thing,

477
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,880
and its bloodthirsty nature intensified.

478
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,540
So,

479
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,360
every year,

480
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,720
the girl you sacrificed

481
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,130
just quenched its thirst.

482
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,150
Then didn't the girls of our fort

483
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,960
all die in vain?

484
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,440
Daughter.

485
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,350
If I had known this,

486
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,280
I wouldn't have sent you

487
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,270
into this fire pit.

488
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,540
Itâ€™s all my fault...

489
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,750
The chief was eager to protect the fort's people.

490
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,660
I think

491
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,490
he didn't do it on purpose.

492
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,400
Creeping Bloodthorn

493
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,450
will regenerate even if it's burnt.

494
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,210
We're here

495
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,240
to get the thing out of the cave.

496
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,400
With the evil thing gone,

497
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,900
Creeping Bloodthorn could be eradicated.

498
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,210
Only then would Chidi Fort

499
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,440
avoid future troubles.

500
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,370
This is great.

501
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,420
We're finally

502
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,350
rid of the plague of our fort.

503
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,790
Great!

504
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,720
Great!

505
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,820
Thank you.

506
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,270
You don't have to do this.

507
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,270
Get up.

508
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,390
Get up.

509
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,420
Get up, everyone.

510
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,110
Yan.

511
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,840
I misunderstood you.

512
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,370
Huixiang.

513
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,110
Donâ€™t be upset.

514
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,990
Chief.

515
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,830
You gave me the candle

516
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,460
that doesn't go out.

517
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,560
I guess you didn't want

518
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,950
to see Huixiang die.

519
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,300
So from now on...

520
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,850
I understand

521
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,230
what you mean.

522
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,070
Don't worry.

523
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,970
Leave Huixiang and Ba Jiao

524
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,260
to me.

525
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,640
I also promise

526
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,310

everyone

Don't worry.

530
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,570
As long as we have a bite of rice,

531
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,700
they'll have theirs.

532
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,750
Right.

533
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,430
Right?

534
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,990
Thank you, sir and madam.

When you grow up,

537
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,210
take good care of your sister.

538
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,880
Be good.

539
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,270
Nan Yan.

540
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,870
Let's go.

541
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,300
