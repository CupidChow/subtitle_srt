No.

33

Ever since you got on the boat,

34
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,950
you've been thinking about killing demons.

35

You don't eat or sleep.

You're right.

38
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,300
I was too impatient.

39
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,930

You're restraining yourself.

53

You want to get close to her and know her.

54

59

00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,250
[I wish you a lifetime of peace, free from worry and hardship]

350
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,090
Little Fox?

351
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,870
I have to go back now.

352
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,470
I can't let him know

353
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,240
there are Yin Zhus in your body.

354
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,710
See you at the same place.

355
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,280
Sister.

356
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,110
Little Fox.

357
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,540
Where did you go?

358
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,400
Nothing.

359
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,140
Let's go.

360
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,110
I'll buy you

361
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,920
a drumstick later.

362
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,390
Sure.

363
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,840
I'll buy it all for you.

364
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,750
Little Fox?

365
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,140
Hello, old man Endurance.

366
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,660
We're safe on the whaleboat.

367
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,750
The food is good too.

368
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,360
But,

369
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,450
Nan Yan has been acting alone lately.

370
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,140
She seems to be hiding something from me.

371
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,980
Don't worry.

372
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,990
I will ask her

373
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,130
to tell me the truth.

374
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,660
Who asked you to write this?

375
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,950
I'm telling the truth.

376
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,790
Aren't you acting alone lately?

377
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,430
Aren't you hiding something

378
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,010
from me?

379
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,830
Didn't you just release a sky lantern

380
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,590
by yourself just now?

381
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,510
Give it to me.

382
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:20,850
No.

383
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,890
Give it to me.

384
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:22,750
Are you not telling me

385
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,470
the truth right now

386
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,790
because you're hiding something?

387
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,700
Give it back.

388
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:26,860
I...

389
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,070
Give it to me.

390
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,830
No!

391
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,490
See? You fell.

392
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,470
What a bunch of nonsense.

393
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,420
Come on, rewrite it.

394
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,820
Write as I say.

395
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,240
Fine.

396
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,830
What should we write?

397
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,160
Just say that

398
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,120
we've been investigating

399
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,830
the whereabouts of the reincarnated Sen Luo.

400
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,030
Everything is going well.

401
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,170
Also, wish him well.

402
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,010
That's all.

403
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,440
I don't want to wish him well.

404
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,420
Why not?

405
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,120
He tricked me

406
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,570
and grounded me for three years.

407
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,110
He even said I'd grow my seventh tail.

408
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,850
In the end,

409
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,510
I didn't grow a single new fur.

410
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,100
But you

411
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,320
have already reached the Yuanying Soul Realm.

412
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,270
Now look at me.

413
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,590
Have you ever thought that

414
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,290
you were not sincere enough?

415
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:12,880
Besides,

416
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,740
you didn't practice hard enough.

417
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,650
I was a vegetarian for three years!

418
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,800
Wasn't that enough?

419
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,710
Three years!

420
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,570
All that was missing was building a statue for him.

421
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,110
It turns out

422
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,890
he's a useless spirit.

423
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,490
Alright.

424
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,230
Hurry up.

425
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,650
If I hadn't coveted

426
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,150
your silver mermaid pearl at the

427
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,210
Xiagu Street Market three years ago,

428
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,370
all of these

429
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,120
wouldn't have happened.

430
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,900
Fate is truly

431
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,620
such a fascinating thing.

432
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,850
What are you up to now?

433
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,640
Why are you

434
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,600
suddenly being nostalgic with me?

435
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,490
Listen.

436
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,520
I'll definitely get all 9 tails.

437
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,660
Even if I'm stuck at the

438
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,990
Core Formation Realm all my life,

439
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:01,790
I will protect you to the end

440
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,720
at the expense of

441
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,340
my fox life.

442
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,500
Even though he's only at Core Formation?

443
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,370
Alright.

444
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,730
I know you're nice to me.

445
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,180
Get writing.

446
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,300
Okay.

447
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:14,950
Go ahead.

448
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,010
I'll write.

449
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,130
What's wrong with this pen?

450
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,360
Who are you?

451
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,680
Why do I feel so disappointed

452
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,420
when I can't be with her?

453
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,390
Why is my heart

454
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,640
attracted to her?

455
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,780
Just now,

456
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,010
you deliberately cast a spell

457
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,730
to tease Little Fox, right?

458
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,720
He was talking too much

459
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,900
and making too much noise.

460
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,390
So I teased him a little.

461
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,880
Who is he to you?

462
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,350
Why are you, Bloody-handed Asura,

463
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,710
hanging around with someone at the Core Formation Ream?

464
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,680
He is a good friend of mine.

465
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,500
Good friend?

466
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,510
I treat him like my own brother.

467
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,270
By the way,

468
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,040
why do you want to see me?

469
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,750
I want to ask you

470
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,620
about the massacre of the Lunar Sect.

471
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,380
The Lunar Sect...

472
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,480
I only got a glimpse of the murderer.

473
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,880
I didn't get a clear view.

474
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,760
Well,

475
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,540
before Chief Meng died,

476
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,700
did he say anything to you?

477
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,560
He said...

478
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,600
He said the demon

479
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,760
was gathering the power of the Yin Zhus

480
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,760
to disturb the cultivation realm.

481
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,380
He

482
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,590
mentioned you too.

483
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,610
What did he say about me?

484
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,220
He said you're called Nan Yan.

485
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,000
You're...

486
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
the one I'll protect forever.

487
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,440
The past you

488
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,700
did a lot for me.

489
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,990
From now on,

490
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,890
no matter you are Yin or Ji Yang,

491
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,730
I hope you can give me a chance

492
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,300
and let me protect you.

493
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,170
I have a request.

494
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,030
What?

495
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,590
They said Bloody-handed Asura

496
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,810
has the unrivaled Seven Sins Manual.

497
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,720
It can kill demons

498
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,070
and also exorcise them.

499
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,150
I want you to do me a favor.

500
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,190
You want me

501
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,300
to exorcise a demon for you?

502
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,670
Why?

503
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,980
When I woke up in Filth Valley,

504
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,870
I somehow became

505
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,130
the undying master of Huangquan Prison.

506
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,180
Unfortunately, I can no longer

507
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,480
taste any food or drinks in this world.

508
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,860
I didn't know

509
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,730
some people still remember me too.

510
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,590
It's good to be a mortal again.

511
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,730
I'll help you.

512
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,300
But what I'm carrying

513
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,170
is not an ordinary demonic aura.

514
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,320
It's not easy

515
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,800
to exorcise it.

516
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,500
I entered the Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea

517
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,590
for only one person.

518
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,050
I can overcome all demons in the world.

519
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,260
For you,

520
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,090
I'm willing to try.

521
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,040
I'm willing to help you.
