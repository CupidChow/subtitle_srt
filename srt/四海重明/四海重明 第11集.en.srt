[Episode 11]

4
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,120
So,

5
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,000
how could I let you,

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,010
a liability, stay by her side?

7
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,160
You're not killing me?

8
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,789
I'll spare your life.

9
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:32,970
I have use for you.

10
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,040
May you be safe

11
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,880
and happy.

12
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,300
Nan Yan?

13
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,430
You should

14
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,380
stay in bed.

15
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,130
Well,

16
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,140
hasn't Shao Cang come back yet?

17
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,220
He's left.

18
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,040
When the wind rises, the leaves rustle.

19
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,780
When the wind is gone, it leaves nothing behind.

20
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,400
He didn't want to implicate you

21
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
or Lunar Sect,

22
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,710
so he chose to leave alone.

23
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,230
Such a righteous man.

24
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,630
I respect him even more!

25
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,990
Now that

26
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,020
he's gone,

27
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,780
I wonder when we can see him again.

28
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,079
Maybe

29
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:24,910
when I go to Filth Valley

30
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,440
to look for the Snow Branch,

31
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,950
I can meet him again.

32
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,730
You'll go to Filth Valley too?

33
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,970
Take me with you.

34
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,260
To be honest,

35
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,360
I attract treasures.

36
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,820
It's a gift I was born with.

37
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,910
With me by your side,

38
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,300
you can definitely find…

39
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,790
find…

40
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,990
find that…

41
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,170
Show Branch.

42
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,200
It's the Snow Branch.

43
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,140
Whatever.

44
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,360
No matter what branch it is,

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,920
after we find it

46
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,390
and make the Five-Poison Heart Pill,

47
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,590
Shao Cang's heart disease can be cured.

48
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,480
By then,

49
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,710
let me take

50
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,260
some credit.

51
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,270
Don't think too much.

52
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,270
August 15th is coming.

53
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,780
Today,

54
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,130
let's have a good meal.

55
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,080
Well,

56
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,250
tomorrow is August 15th.

57
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,940
I need to go down the mountain to visit my mom.

58
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,720
Why don't you

59
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,940
go with me?

60
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,270
You're all alone.

61
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,310
You might as well celebrate

62
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,350
the festival with me.

63
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:16,790
Can I?

64
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,300
Okay.

65
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,470
My pleasure.

66
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,830
By the way,

67
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,440
where's that annoying fox?

68
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,020
I haven't seen him since I woke up.

69
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,260
He's so unreliable.

70
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,190
We agreed he'd look after you

71
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,990
when I was away getting you food.

72
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,240
He actually ran away and left you alone.

73
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,240
Ji Yang has always

74
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,270
hated Little Fox.

75
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,140
They've both disappeared.

76
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,670
Could it be that…

77
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,710
It can't be.

78
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,150
Then, when we go into Filth Valley

79
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,610
to collect the fox's body,

80
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,500
should we bring a pot

81
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,700
or a coffin?

82
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,950
A coffin.

83
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:57,880
Fox meat

84
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,710
is gamy.

85
00:04:59,390 --> 00:04:59,720
Well,

86
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,600
I'll prepare some food for you.

87
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,440
Meng Ying?

88
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,670
What's the matter?

89
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,170
Well...

90
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,560
Actually, Ji Yang

91
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,210
is not the fox spirit, right?

92
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,390
I knew it.

93
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:37,110
My dad just took

94
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,420
that fox spirit in.

95
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,470
How could it be that

96
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,470
he has your mom's heart disease too?

97
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,050
And that fox spirit

98
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,690
doesn't look like a sick man.

99
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,360
Meng Ying.

100
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,860
I can explain.

101
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,110
Alright.

102
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,620
You don't need to explain anything.

103
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,630
I swear

104
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,100
I'll never tell anyone,

105
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,150
not even my dad.

106
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,520
But I still think

107
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,310
my dad has seen through it.

108
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,670
That's why he used that fox spirit as a cover.

109
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,350
As for Ji Yang,

110
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,510
whether he is

111
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,050
Lord Shao Cang or not

112
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,670
is none of my business.

113
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,750
I just hope

114
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,970
you can stay safe.

115
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,510
Thank you.

116
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,950
By the way,

117
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,090
this is for you.

118
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,820
I made some mooncakes.

119
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,200
Happy early Mid-Autumn Festival.

120
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,110
Have a good rest.

121
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,150
I'll get going.

122
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,500
Thank you.

123
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,350
By the way,

124
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,520
I almost forgot to tell you.

125
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,820
You nailed it today.

126
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,300
Do you want a bite?

127
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,940
I already apologized.

128
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,950
Don't be so petty.

129
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,630
Shut up.

130
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,020
Smell it.

131
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,450
It smells so good.

132
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,570
I'm not hungry.

133
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,300
Take it away.

134
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,250
Stop pretending.

135
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,630
If you lose weight

136
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,310
or get sick,

137
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,310
Yan will think

138
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,390
I mistreated you.

139
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,040
She'll try to take my Internal Elixir

140
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,770
to make medicine for you again.

141
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,850
Don't worry.

142
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,860
You will never see her again.

143
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,440
Fine.

144
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,030
I won't see her again.

145
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,570
How about you?

146
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,640
You won't see her again either?

147
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,260
My Lord,

148
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,800
you're so cruel.

149
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,230
Yan was struck by lightning

150
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,590
for you.

151
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,750
But you

152
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,440
left without saying goodbye.

153
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,960
Also,

154
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,070
tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

155
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,950
People celebrate reunions on this day.

156
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,770
But now,

157
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,540
you and she are worlds apart.

158
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,830
God sent you to me,

159
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,230
but after just a few days,

160
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,810
he took you back.

161
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,660
♫The sound of rain♫

162
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,490
♫I hold my breath♫

163
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,360
♫Our promise under the umbrella♫

164
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,950
My Lord.

165
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,930
It seems

166
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,970
♫When I'm with you♫

167
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,020
you're not very good at woodwork.

168
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,570
♫It becomes clear♫

169
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,840
Master didn't teach me it.

170
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,030
♫I'll hold up for you♫

171
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,210
I taught myself.

172
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,940
♫Even if it rains heavily♫

173
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,910
Thank you.

174
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,950
♫The blurry world is now clear♫

175
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,240
It's a bit ugly,

176
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,350
but…

177
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,570
I like it very much.

178
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,380
♫I won't give up♫

179
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,650
♫I'll protect you♫

180
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,350
I know you didn't want

181
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,510
to drag me in,

182
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,330
so you left quietly.

183
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,350
But you

184
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,590
are so heartless.

185
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,560
If you had told me,

186
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,380
I would understand you.

187
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,720
Why did you leave without saying goodbye?

188
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,560
Did you come back for me

189
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,150
because you like me?

190
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,730
Say yes.

191
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,820
♫The sound of rain♫

♫Our promise under the umbrella♫

195
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,140

209
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,220
What a surprise

210
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,390
that you're waiting for me.

211
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,270
Why is it tea?

212
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,980
Wine is poison.

213
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,500
Tea is the antidote.

214
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,920
I've used poison my whole life.

215
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,420
Today,

216
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,640
I can finally cure the pain

217
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,350
in my heart.

218
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,770
Can't you just wait a little longer

219
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,890
for your daughter?

220
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,090
She's studied in Lunar Sect

221
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,050
for two years.

222
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,420
It's for you.

223
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,170
If all her efforts are in vain,

224
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,480
what can I say to comfort her?

225
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,070
At Yan's age,

226
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,710
she should be traveling around the Five States

227
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,390
to see this beautiful world.

228
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,410
But because of me,

229
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,320
she's stuck here.

230
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,830
After I pass away,

231
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,210
I don't want her

232
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,510
to become

233
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,470
as powerful as me.

234
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,310
I just wish she could find the one for her

235
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,770
and live a carefree

236
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,410
and peaceful life.

237
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,420
That's all I want for her.

238
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,130
Are you sure

239
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,020
you can entrust Yan

240
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,150
to that boy?

241
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,970
It's their fate.

242
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,140
I can't decide anything.

243
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,080
I just let nature take its course.

244
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,550
Fate is ruthless.

245
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,060
If one chooses not to feel,

246
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,550
life will become a prison.

247
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,600
If one chooses to feel,

248
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,950
they'll have to fight fate.

249
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,350
I only hope

250
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,850
they can protect

251
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,050
and look out for each other.

252
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,300
They can't be

253
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,010
a normal couple.

254
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,090
But I wish

255
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,320
they could love each other

256
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,660
till the end of their days.

257
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,770
Nan Yan.

258
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,450
What's all that?

259
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,090
We're just going down the mountain to celebrate the festival.

260
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,090
Why are you carrying so many things?

261
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,460
It's my first time meeting my godmother.

262
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,590
How can I go empty-handed?

263
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,010
That's improper.

264
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,400
Look at these things.

265
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,090
And this.

266
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,200
These are all gifts

267
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,350
for my godmother.

268
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,170
Look.

269
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
What do you think?

270
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,630
Is this gift good enough

271
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,690
for the Queen of Mahjong in the North?

272
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,380
When did my mom

273
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,940
become your godmother?

274
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,340
As the saying goes,

275
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,200
you're fatherless and I'm motherless,

276
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
so your mother will be my godmother.

277
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,860
Whatever.

278
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,430
Shao Cang

279
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,660
is like my brother.

280
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,060
He'll propose sooner or later.

281
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,070
With your mom being my godmother,

282
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,540
we'll all become family.

283
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,400
What's wrong?

284
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,790
He'll marry you sooner or later.

285
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,150
I'm helping my buddy

286
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,830
curry favor with your mom.

287
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,160
What's wrong with that?

288
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,860
Let me make it clear.

289
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,580
Don't cozy up to my mom.

290
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,510
She'll ask you to drink

291
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,630
and play dice with her

292
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,890
and win all your money.

293
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,300
Gosh.

294
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,290
It doesn't matter.

295
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,620
I don't mind losing money to my godmother.

296
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,570
Wait for me.

297
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,210
Osmanthus blooms around August 15th.

298
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,450
Why are peach trees blooming?

299
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,860
Could it be the magic of some immortal?

300
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,570
There are no immortals here.

301
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,230
Only

302
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,510
daydreams.

303
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,780
Have you never thought about ascension

304
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,600
after joining Lunar Sect?

305
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,630
I joined Lunar Sect

306
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,230
to cure my mom's disease.

307
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,830
When my mom recovers one day,

308
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,990
I'll take her

309
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,390
to travel around the Five States

310
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,760
and live a carefree life.

311
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,890
100 years is enough.

312
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,110
If one

313
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,460
lives for 500 years

314
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,690
or thousands of years

315
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,030
but doesn't have family and friends around

316
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,730
and is always alone,

317
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,170
what's the point of that?

318
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,460
You're wise.

319
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,840
We share the same view.

320
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,050
Beautiful flowers under the full moon.

321
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,910
[Mooncake]

322
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,960
My godmother

323
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,960
will be very happy.

324
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,040
[Mooncake]

325
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,260
Let's go.

326
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,650
My mom must be waiting.

327
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,660
Mom.

328
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,440
Mom.

329
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,430
Isn't she home?

330
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,069
She should be.

331
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,980
Mom, I'm back.

332
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,230
This is not right.

333
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,290
I haven't been back for so many days.

334
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,500
The house

335
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,280
should be a mess.

336
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,110
Has she

337
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,470
gone on a trip?

338
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,930
Mom.

339
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,890
Chief.

340
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,590
N-Nan Yan.

341
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,390
Why aren't you

342
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,630
r-resting

343
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,600
in the sect?

344
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,710
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

345
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,040
I came back to see my mom.

346
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,670
I'm old.

347
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,590
I actually forgot about the Mid-Autumn Festival.

348
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,390
Well,

349
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,740
your mom didn't come to play mahjong with me yesterday.

350
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,250
It's said she's gone traveling.

351
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,110
So I came

352
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,350
to check it out.

353
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,770
She's really not home.

354
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,360
She's gone traveling?

355
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
Impossible.

356
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,750
We agreed on it.

357
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,050
After I cure her heart disease,

358
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,580
I'll go traveling with her.

359
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,460
You know her temper best.

360
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,280
She's spontaneous.

361
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,340
No one can stop her.

362
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,820
How about this?

363
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,190
Your mom is not home anyway.

364
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,190
Why don't you guys

365
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,590
celebrate the festival

366
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,550
with Yingying and me?

367
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:38,950
Okay.

368
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,160
Let's go.

369
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,970
Chief.

370
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,720
Are you

371
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,880
going to visit someone's grave?

372
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,570
Who else could it be?

373
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,070
Yingying's mother.

374
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,580
No way.

375
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,300
People visit graves on Tomb-Sweeping Day

376
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,180
or during the Ghost Festival,

377
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,240
not during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

378
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,030
I just miss my wife.

379
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,660
There's no need to pick a day.

380
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,300
Chief.

381
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,350
Who told you

382
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,350
my mom went traveling?

383
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,910
Someone I play mahjong with.

384
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,940
Where did she go?

385
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,330
I didn't ask.

386
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,980
Chief.

387
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,530
My mom doesn't have many friends

388
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,680
in Lunar Town.

389
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,580
You're her only friend.

390
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,350
It's my honor.

391
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,970
All these years,

392
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,820
you've helped her a lot for me.

393
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,910
If she was going on a trip,

394
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,240
why would she

395
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,240
not tell you

396
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,740
when she was leaving

397
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,310
and where she was going?

398
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,470
Chief.

399
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,200
Where on earth

400
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,580
is my mom?

401
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,240
Your mom…

402
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,360
Chief.

403
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,520
Did something happen to her?

404
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,390
Your mom…

405
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,560
passed away.

406
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,110
Godmother.

407
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,790
Nan Yan and I

408
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,890
came to see you.

409
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,350
Although we've never met,

410
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,810
I've heard a lot about you from Nan Yan.

411
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,620
I picked these gifts

412
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,720
especially for you.

413
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,080
I hope, in the afterlife,

414
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,110
you can still be the winner

415
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,670
at every mahjong table.

416
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,410
I want to spend some time alone

417
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,200
with my mother.

418
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,260
Okay.

419
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,770
We'll wait for you at home.

420
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,590
It's getting dark.

421
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,720
Don't stay too late.

422
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,080
Why does your needle

423
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,810
look longer than before?

424
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,920
If you don't behave,

425
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,220
my needle

426
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,710
will become even longer.

427
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,790
Here we go.

428
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,550
Does it hurt?

429
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,340
I'm used to it.

430
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,110
Hang in there.

431
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,350
Yan.

432
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,210
Look at you.

433
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,930
All you think about every day

434
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,470
is poisons

435
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,580
and needles.

436
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,990
What if one day

437
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,350
a young man from Lunar Sect

438
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,680
wants to be close to you,

439
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,320
and you scare him away?

440
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,190
All I think about

441
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,400
is traveling around

442
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,640
the Five States with you

443
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,750
after you recover.

444
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,750
But I

445
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,700
can't stay with you forever.

446
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,380
Why not?

447
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,490
In the future,

448
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,700
you just need to enjoy your life.

449
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,330
I'll make sure you live a long life.

450
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,510
I'll buy you

451
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,640
your favorite steamed rice cake.

452
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,590
Wait for me here.

453
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,830
Come back soon.

454
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,230
I'm scared of being alone.

455
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,660
Okay.

456
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,420
Take it.

457
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,060
Wait for me here.

458
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,820
Mom.

459
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,130
You promised

460
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,040
to travel around the world

461
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,710
with me after you recovered.

462
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,160
Why did you break your promise?

463
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,830
Chief Nan Fang has passed away.

464
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,890
How could you leave me alone?

465
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,160
Peach trees are blossoming at the wrong season,

466
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,990
guiding seekers of truth

467
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,320
and marking the ends of the enlightened.

468
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,440
Just now,

469
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,490
I dreamed of my mom.

470
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,350
The dead can't come back to life.

471
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,100
I'm sorry.

472
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,620
You came to see me.

473
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,650
I don't want you to leave.

474
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,310
If you want to leave now,

475
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,960
it's not too late.

476
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,570
Cry it out.

477
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,470
In the past,

478
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,460
my mom kept telling me

479
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,400
she wanted to go traveling.

480
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,400
But I didn't allow her.

481
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,250
I was afraid she'd get too tired.

482
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,130
I always thought...

483
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,880
I always thought I still had time

484
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,060
to cure her.

485
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,730
Do you think…

486
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,390
Do you think she'd blame me?

487
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,550
No.

488
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,380
She would never blame you.

489
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,810
I wonder

490
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,310
what kind of person

491
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,310
my godmother was.

492
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,190
She was amazing.

493
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,770
How?

494
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,750
She drank when she could

495
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,110
and never lost at mahjong.

496
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,180
Footloose and fancy-free.

497
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,430
She had the world in her heart

498
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,360
and could see through everything.

499
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,350
She never cared about what other people said

500
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,140
and never showed any emotion.

501
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,630
She was like a god

502
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,310
who saw beyond the world.

503
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,770
It's hard to believe

504
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,960
someone like that existed.

505
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,780
It's a pity

506
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,240
I didn't get to meet her.

507
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,210
It's late.

508
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,350
Are you leaving?

509
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,250
I have to go to

510
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,860
Filth Valley.

511
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,250
Take this.

512
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,830
No.

513
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,790
Your mom left it for you.

514
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,650
I can't take it.

515
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,380
Filth Valley is dangerous.

516
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,710
This will come in handy.

517
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,950
At the street market,

518
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,810
I learned to hide my aura.

519
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,340
I can handle the Candlelight Beetles.

520
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,420
I can't take this.

521
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,680
I know

522
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,510
you may have a way to deal with the Candlelight Beetles.

523
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,110
But

524
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,550
Little Fox told me

called Yin Zhu

527
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,420
in the depths of Filth Valley.

528
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,840
It sucks people's souls.

529

♫Can you hold my hands tightly?♫

530

If you meet it,

you'll die.

You need to return it to me.

[Li Chi, Chief of the Evil Path Sect]

549
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,830
Chief, you're here.

550
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,430
Sorry for not receiving you.

551
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,800
You're injured?

552
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,350
Just a minor injury.

553
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,820
Don't worry, Chief.

554
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,220
You were hurt by the monarch of the Great Path.

555
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,780
It can't be just a minor injury.

556
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,310
Don't worry, Chief.

557
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,340
I recovered a few days ago.

558
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,260
I'm fine now.

559
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,020
It won't…

560
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,830
It won't affect

561
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,230
me serving the Evil Path.

562
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,110
Is there anything

563
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,350
I can do for you?

564
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,030
There's something

[Li Mian, Evil Path Sect]

She's the only person

568
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,990
who saw Yin Zhu

569
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,450
and lived to tell about it.

570
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,490
She has Yin Zhu's aura on her.

571
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,890
Making her into a demonic pill

572
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,870
can help us hide from Yin Zhu

573
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,730
when we go deep into Filth Valley.

574
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,910
It's the best way

575

she can serve the Demon Clan.

576
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,930

[Zhan Xian, an elder of the Evil Path Sect]

I heard that

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,520
Yin Zhu eats people's souls

581
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,180
in the depths of Filth Valley.

582
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,650
Do we have to take this risk?

583
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,220
Of course!

584
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,270
Thousands of years ago,

585
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,270
when Sen Luo, the Demon Lord, was close to success,

586
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,260
Holy Master killed him with the Seven Sins Manual,

587
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,990
a kind of demon subduing magic.

588
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,650
From then on, the Demon Clan has been in decline!

589
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,200
If we don't ruin the Seven Sins Manual,

590
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,510
the Demon Clan can never be revived!

00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,560

Ji Yang's heart disease hasn't been cured.

648

I still need to make

649

the Five-Poison Heart Pill.

650
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,710
Filth Valley

Of course.

Have you forgotten?

664
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,350
I planned to go to Filth Valley

to look for Shao Cang.

666
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,510
Now that he needs the pill

667
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,040
to treat his heart disease,

668
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,200
I'll do my best

to help Nan Yan.

670

have so many ideas.

672
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,820
Never mind.

00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:07,980
I can't stop you.

674
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,100
Keep this in mind.

675
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,790
Don't go deep into Filth Valley.

676
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,000
Once you find the Snow Branch,

677
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,720
come out immediately.

678
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,080
Don't delay any longer.

679
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,140
Understand?

680
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:20,880
Yes.

681
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,020
I'm leaving.

682
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,470
I need to go back now,

683
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,000
or Yingying will complain.

684
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:28,630
Young Lord,

685
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,630
don't forget to give the thing to her.

686
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,110
Okay.

687
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,890
What thing?

688
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,620
Your mom left this for you.

689
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:41,670
Chief found it

690
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,920
when he went through your mom's stuff.
