[Episode 31]

4
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,390
I collected spiritual aura from the North Region.

5
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,680
Now I have two spirit pearls.

6
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,870
It's enough for you to enter Bone-Deep Mirror.

7
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,640
Promise me

8
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,250
that from now on,

9
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,820
no matter what you do,

10
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,830
you can't abandon me again.

11
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,870
♫Through the storms and cold♫

12
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,850
♫Just to wait for you♫

13
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,550
♫I break through the curse of fate♫

14
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,830
♫And pierce through the dark clouds♫

15
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,910
I got it.

16
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,490
♫May heaven and earth last forever♫

17
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,370
♫May our love be eternal♫

18
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,539
♫The impermanent years have never stopped♫

19
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,350
♫We spend this lifetime hand in hand♫

20
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,810
♫Billions of light beams converge into a galaxy♫

21
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,910
♫But they still can't compare to the moment you look back♫

22
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,450
♫The past is mottled with old memories♫

23
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,630
♫As long as you're by my side♫

24

♫Over the hills, seeing through the world♫

♫I'll hold your hand till we grow old♫

26
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,790
The barrier has been disrupted.

27
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,030
If we close it by force,

28
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,560
our disciples will be hurt.

29
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,820
We have no time.

30
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,290
I can only weaken my cultivation

31
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,800
and force my way through

32
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,720
to fight the Reincarnated Sen Luo.

33
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,220
I'll go with you

34
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,730
to bring them out.

35
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,370
No need.

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,590
Stay here

37
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,000
to receive them.

38
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,710
Alright.

39
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,770
Be careful, Dragon Lord.

40
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,170
Yan.

41
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,420
Tell me

42
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,210
about Lunar Sect.

43
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,590
Big Brother

44
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,390
is a scholar.

45
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,950
The Fox is a troublemaker.

46
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,410
I thought

47
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,780
you were a pure soul.

48
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,170
I didn't expect

49
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,940
you'd become

50
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,610
vicious when we fell out.

51
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,640
After I knew you were the monarch,

52
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,770
I wanted to kick you out of my home.

53
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,530
But who know

54
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,380
you'd refused to leave.

55
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,960
You even threatened

56
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,190
to kill me.

57
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,960
After that,

58
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,060
you finally took your medicine

59
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,990
and had your meals.

60
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,860
But I didn't expect...

61
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,600
you'd be hurt

62
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,570
by a demonic cultivator.

63
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,940
I'm willing to sacrifice everything

64
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,070
in exchange for you.

65
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,290
But I know

66
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,720
you won't return.

67
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,590
Ji Yang.

68
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,790
After being separated for three years,

69
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,520
we've finally reunited.

70
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,720
Don't leave me again.

71
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,200
She

72
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,050
wants to kill you herself.

73
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,040
So I need you to gather the five prisons

74
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,440
and become the Reincarnated Sen Luo.

75
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,890
Yan.

76
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,470
I was too greedy.

77
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,610
I just wanted to

78
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:36,170
be by your side day after day.

79
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,740
But now,

80
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,909
I can’t do it.

81
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,900
My Lord!

82
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,000
Dragon Lord is here.

83
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,410
Dragon Lord.

84
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,630
Dragon Lord is here.

85
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,250
I underestimated you, Dragon Lord.

86
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,909
You chose to weaken your cultivation

87
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,250
to fight against me.

88
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,100
But the realm of the Bone-Deep Mirror

89
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,380
belongs to me.

90
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,760
What are you talking about?

91
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,620
Someone is absorbing his spiritual power.

92
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,400
Did you arrange for an accomplice?

93
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,280
Have they all been

94
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,860
killed by you?

95
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,750
I misunderstood you, Dragon Lord.

96
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,830
Dragon Lord.

97
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,490
Stay here to recuperate.

98
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,950
My Lord!

99
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,240
Something happened in Shanhai's main hall.

100
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,830
Let's go.

101
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,820
Ji Yang!

102
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,360
Ji Yang.

103
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,159
Ji Yang!

104
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,580
Yun Nian!

105
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,750
I can't hold on anymore!

106
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,480
[Ten Percepts Mountain]

107
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,820
Open up the path.

108
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,750
[Ten Percepts Mountain; Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament Ground]

109
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,990
[Ten Percepts Mountain]

110
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:16,430
[Shanhai's main hall; Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament Ground]

111
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,420
It's you?

112
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,940
So you are the masked man.

113
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,910
I finally get to see you today.

114
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,730
Sorry it took me so long.

115
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,620
Even if you're the Reincarnated Sen Luo,

116
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,830
you can't

117
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,080
ruin my plan today.

118
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,160
Pot calling the kettle black.

119
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,190
Rao?

120
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,250
Rao.

121
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,820
Silly Meng.

122
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,490
Rao?

123
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,410
Han is here too.

124
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,310
Where have you been all these years?

125
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,390
Why are you yelling at me?

126
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,940
Watch it,

127
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,770
or I'll tell Dragon Lord

128
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,070
you stole the Thunder Dragon Pestle

129
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,070
from his treasury

130
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,210
to use in fights in the Central State.

131
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,600
You...

132
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,330
What's going on?

133
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,900
So Sword Master

134
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,360
sacrified countless disciples

135
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,440
in the barrier

136
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,080
not to capture the prison

137
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,170
but to revive Chief Nan.

138
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,310
It's the forbidden resurrection technique.

139
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,680
Meng Xiaolou!

140
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,850
Are you crazy?

141
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,610
You've killed so many people.

142
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,350
If you don't stop,

143
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,650
the children here

144
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,360
will all be killed by you!

145
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,860
You're going against the right path!

146
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,190
Against the right path?

147
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,790
Rao cultivated into a god

148
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,550
but died from her heart being ripped out.

149
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,270
Do you think

150
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,830
there's still a right path in this world?

151
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:43,910
If this is

152
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,370
the so-called right path,

153
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,000
I must go against it!

154
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,840
Compared to Nan Rao,

155
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,550
those people are not important at all.

156
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,220
Meng Xiaolou.

157
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,080
I didn't expect

158
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,930
that you're so

159
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,970
secretly devoted to Rao.

160
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,450
You cultivated into a god,

161
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,570
but you went against the right path.

162
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,470
You'll plunge into the depths of the demonic path!

163
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,890
Demonic path?

164
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,100
Even if it's the depths of purgatory,

165
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,940
I'll still have Rao by my side.

166
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,420
What are you doing?

167
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,180
Rao.

168
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,190
Do you remember

169
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,770
promising to go to Tianqiao Peak with me

170
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,930
to see the frosted fireflies in the early winter?

171
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,120
Is it still valid?

172
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,410
Buddy Meng.

173
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,360
What's up?

174
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,220
I'm returning this.

175
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,390
I slept so deeply that the sun is setting.

176
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,960
Were you just standing here foolishly?

177
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,720
I heard you've always been romantic.

178
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,540
No.

179
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,970
I mean elegant.

180
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,690
It's frustrating to be bothered when in a drunken sleep.

181
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,290
So I didn't dare make a sound.

182
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,270
Romantic...

183
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,350
While some see it

184
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,180
as being amorous and vulgar,

185
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,310
naturally, there are those

186
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,970
who see it as pure and natural.

187
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,770
You and I can be good friends.

188
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,600
Thank you.

189
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,770
Anything else?

190
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,320
I've thought about it for a long time.

191
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,050
If you have time,

192
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,160
can you accompany me

193
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,250
to watch the frosted fireflies at Tianqiao Peak?

194
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,420
What do you think?

195
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Just inviting me?

196
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,720
I...

197
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,800
like you.

198
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,589
I don't know how long you've prepared

199
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,829
for this statement,

200
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,010
but I

201
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,359
already have someone in my heart.

202
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,690
It's Mu Guanghan.

203
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,030
Frosted fireflies...

204
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,130
Sure, I can join you to catch them

205
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,070
for fun.

206
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,810
Just think of

207
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,600
your last statement as a dream.

208
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,320
Rao.

209
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:48,730
Promise me.

210
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,320
I'll take you away.

211
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,540
You're joking again.

212
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:56,890
Just pretend this

213
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,970
is all just a dream.

214
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,770
Rao.

215
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,260
Rao.

216
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,060
Rao!

217
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,940
Rao!

218
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,830
Rao.

219
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,730
Chief, so you're here.

220
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,090
Is Mu Guanghan's birthday banquet over?

221
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,510
Why didn't you go celebrate?

222
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,480
Han likes such

223
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,290
nonsensical stuff.

224
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,080
I can't be bothered with them.

225
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,150
I'm really tired.

226
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,970
Then you should go back to rest.

227
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,660
Why are you here?

228
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,380
I was waiting for you.

229
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,630
What?

230
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,370
Aren't you here

231
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,560
to punish me?

232
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,610
Punish you?

233
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,850
I thought you'd remember it.

234
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,470
This smell...

235
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,800
It's Lunar Epiphyllum?

236
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,700
Is it familiar now?

237
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,870
You didn't attend any of Venerable Lord's lectures

238
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,860
last month.

239
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,680
So you went

240
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,710
to my yard then.

241
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,800
That's right.

242
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,030
I took all the Lunar Epiphyllums

243
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,540
in your yard.

244
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,960
Since I promised to gift you good wine,

245
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,040
it mustn't be shoddy.

246
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,430
After some consideration,

247
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,090
I realized your yard's Lunar Epiphyllum

248
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,240
is the best ingredient for wine making.

249
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
You actually used them to make wine?

250
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,630
This wine is called Clear Dew Sorrow.

251
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,490
Clear Dew Sorrow?

252
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,550
It's brewed from the dew

253
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,150
I gathered from cicadas' legs.

254
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,140
Try it.

255
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,390
Don't worry.

256
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,360
Your Lunar Epiphyllum isn't suitable for brewing wine.

257
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,690
It was hard to figure out the proportions.

258
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,270
But I've given Mu Guanghan

259
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,070
the wine that were brewed badly.

260
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,340
The good stuff is here.

261
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,430
Try it.

262
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,950
How is it?

263
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,450
It's refreshing

264
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,500
but strong.

265
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,520
One should drink

266
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,340
wine that suits them.

267
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,060
The moon is bright in the Central State.

268
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,870
One's heart is hard to fathom.

269
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:26,790
Rao.

270
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:40,870
Rao!

271
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,910
Rao!

272
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,590
Impossible.

273
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,160
I did everything he said.

274
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,280
How could this happen?

275
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:05,510
Going against fate is impossible since ancient times.

276
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,030
Even if you conjured

277
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,280
Nan Rao's human form,

278
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,870
it's just

279
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,140
an illusion.

280
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,340
No way.

281
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,170
It's due to a lack of spiritual power.

282
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,600
Meng Xiaolou.

283
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,850
Are you going to kill everyone?

284
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,030
I told you.

285
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,250
I don't care!

286
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,110
Meng Xiaolou!

287
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,910
When did you

288
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,510
restore the Divine Realm?

289
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,460
Mu Guanghan!

290
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,540
With one-tenth

291
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,760
of the spiritual powers of Shanhai

292
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,190
and the Bone-Deep Mirror each,

293
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,380
I can kill you.

294
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,690
Leave me alone!

295
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,420
Dragon Lord.

296
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,470
Let me tell you.

297
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,770
Meng Xiaolou

298
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,310
has a deep inner demon.

299
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,080
He absorbed too much spiritual power.

300
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,830
Both of us are no match for him.

301
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,090
Just now, I've planted

302
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,880
the fate-sharing talisman in him and myself.

303
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,470
Help me

304
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,930
perish with him.

305
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,020
This is for the benefit of the five states.

306
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:21,990
You must...

307
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,230
You must obey it.

308
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,300
Do it.

309
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,050
Do it.

310
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,670
Do it!

311
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,030
Are you okay?

312
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,080
Are you okay?

313
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:41,790
I'm fine.

314
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,550
Rao...

315
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,030
Brat.

316
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,050
You're quite something.

317
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,660
You're really not the Reincarnated Sen Luo.

318
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:32,930
Dragon Lord.

319
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,760
From now on,

320
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,570
please take care...

321
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,070
of Zhanting and Yan for me.

322
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,660
Dragon Lord.

323
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,940
Hang in there for Mu Zhanting.

324
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,640
I can't.

325
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,930
Tell him...

326
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,530
From now on...

327
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:07,390
he can write poems whenever he wants

328
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,710
and marry whomever he wants.

329
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,070
I'll relay it to him.

330
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,420
Also,

331
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,860
if Yan

332
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,040
falls in love,

333
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,000
prepare her dowry for me.

334
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,340
Give the Phoenix Crowing Sky Skirt

335
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,740
to her for me too.

336
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,370
When she wears it,

337
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,350
she'd look as pretty

338
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,030
as Nan Rao.

339
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,590
Dragon Lord.

340
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,470
Ying Zewei.

341
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,750
I was wondering why

342
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,300
I couldn't find you.

343
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,530
I asked you to drink at the banquet,

344
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,500
but you refused.

345
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,370
You sneaked all the way

346
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,470
here to find Rao!

347
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,250
Han.

348
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,000
Don't make fun of him.

349
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,990
Look at him.

350
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,850
He's scared speechless.

351
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,750
You two are

352
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,980
even drinking secretly.

353
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,630
Rao.

354
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,080
Why is your wine

355
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,550
different from

356
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,350
the wine

357
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,560
you gave me?

358
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,060
The wine I drank

359
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,170
was much more sour than this.

360
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,130
How is it different?

361
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,830
They were all made by me.

362
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,680
If it's sour, spicy, or bitter,

363
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,430
it must be your tastebuds' problem.

364
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,160
Give it back.

365
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,530
Impossible.

366
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,080
Try it. Try it.

367
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,750
This wine is really good.

368
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,180
It's much better than the wine she gave us...

369
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:53,870
No, no, no.

370
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,630
Have a sip.

371
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,790
Have a sip.

372
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,480
Look at you.

373
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,960
You're drunk.

374
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,700
I spilled it on you.

375
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,420
Take a sip.

376
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,110
-Have a taste.
-No, thanks.

377
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,230
Try it.

378
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,870
What are you doing? You're drunk.

379
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,960
The gods have fallen.

380
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,640
Father!

381
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:29,700
Father!

382
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,560
Father.

383
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:40,840
Father.

384
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,850
How could this happen?

385
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,580
How could this happen?

386
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,760
You were fine yesterday.

387
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,290
How could this happen?

388
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:00,860
Father.

389
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,460
-Master.
-Master.

390
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,410
Master.

391
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,030
Master, what's wrong?

392
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,630
Master.

393
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,370
Master!

394
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,830
It can't be. It can't be.

395
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,560
My father wouldn't die!

396
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,490
Why?

397
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,840
Ji Yang.

398
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,660
Why?

399
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,210
Ji Yang!

400
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,820
Mu Zhanting!

401
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:14,960
-Mu Zhanting!
-Big Brother!

402
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,030
-Ji Yang!
-Big Brother!

403
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:16,850
Calm down!

404
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,190
Mu Zhanting!

405
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,270
Kids, calm down.

406
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,260
Let go of me!

407
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,580
Kids, don't be impulsive.

408
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,230
Mu Zhanting!

409
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,230
Let go of me!

410
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,520
You can't get in.

411
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,700
Then I'll smash it!

412
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,320
This thing...

413
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,690
Doesn't this thing

414
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,230
let you go back to the past?

415
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,390
I want to go back.

416
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,070
I want to go back

417
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,400
to bring my father back.

418
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,310
You...

419
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,480
Fate can be reversed theoretically,

420
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,860
but it's determined.

421
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,430
If you change it for no reason,

422
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,020
you will be punished.

423
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,460
I'm not afraid of punishment!

424
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:12,910
You...

425
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,060
As hot-tempered as Dragon Lord.

426
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,850
Big Brother!

427
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,820
Mu Zhanting!

428
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,570
Big Brother.

429
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:26,810
Master.

430
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,360
How did you get in?

431
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,250
The barrier of Shanhai

432
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,260
has been on the verge of collapse.

433
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,480
My disciple,

434
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,180
keep an eye on him.

435
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,670
[Great Path Sect]

436
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:56,830
Great Path Sect?

437
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,280
What are you doing?

438
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,969
I forgot the way to Great Path Sect.

439
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:35,909
Are you new here?

440
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,440
He was scolded by Master,

441
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,580
so he's hiding here.

442
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,070
Premier's enthronement banquet is today.

443
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,070
Don't run around.

444
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,610
Yes.

445
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,190
The 42th year of Qingxu?

446
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,690
No wonder Zhu Sui can't recognize me now.

447
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,670
Great Path's main hall

448
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,870
is empty,

449
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,750
so I guessed you were here.

450
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,030
We've been

451
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,750
waiting for your sister

452
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,330
for half a day,

453
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,660
but she hasn't come out.

454
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,900
I composed a new song

455
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,440
called "Silent Night".

456
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,680
I want to co-compose it with Zewei

457
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,150
to celebrate this auspicious occasion.

458
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,890
Take the lead

459
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,270
and I'll play along.

460
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,740
What's wrong with you?

461
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,000
What took you so long?

462
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,560
One of you

463
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,800
is a musical genius,

464
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,540
while the other is gentle and elegant.

465
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,490
Virtuous and musically talented.

466
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,190
Wonderful.

467
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,200
Sister, the auspicious hour is here.

468
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,160
Let's go.

469
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,410
I've been lazy lately.

470
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,890
I won't go.

471
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,220
You guys go ahead.

472
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,250
Have a good rest.

473
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,380
Let's go.

474
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,870
Come in.

475
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,360
I won't bite.
