[Episode 34]

4
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,230
Everything in this place reminds me of you,

5
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,830
yet you're not here anymore.

6
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,510
Yan,

7
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,000
if you're my heart disease,

8
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,510
how can I cure it?

9
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,070
Isn't this

10
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,270
the wood from the ancient phoenix tree?

11
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,970
You're still so petty.

12
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:47,630
You still don't allow anyone

13
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,830
to touch your things.

14
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,670
Thank you.

15
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,060
It's ugly,

16
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,190
but…

17
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,670
I like it very much.

18
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:16,870
On the surface,

19
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,930
you tried so hard to make her hate you,

20
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,380
but deep down, you didn't want her to go.

21
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,450
It must be

22
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,800
very painful for you.

23
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,430
With her around,

24
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,420
life was hard

25
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,750
but still endurable.

26
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,870
Without her,

27
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,070
although I rule the netherworld,

28
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,930
I'm still depressed.

29
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,290
Given the current situation,

30
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,860
Nan Yan's days are numbered.

31
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,820
What's your plan?

32
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,530
It's time to set the bait.

33
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,640
Everyone says it's a cold and cruel world,

34
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,870
but I still believe there's love and kindness.

35
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,620
If I'm to be punished for being such a fool,

36
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,370
I deserve all kinds of coldness and indifference!

37
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,550
Look at you. You're wasted.

38
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,180
How inappropriate!

39
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,470
You can't protect yourself

40
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,180
with 90% brute strength and 10% luck.

41
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,910
Yet you want to protect others?

42
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,700
If you keep messing around like this,

43
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,480
I'll surely die soon!

44
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,510
For him,

45
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,170
you gave up half your life.

46
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,370
He'll definitely be grateful to you.

47
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,680
I hope so.

48
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,310
Ting,

49
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,930
you've really grown up.

50
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,530
I'm so glad.

51
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,730
My dear son.

52
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,839
I missed you so much.

53
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,230
I missed you too, Dad.

54
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,470
Guards!

55
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,750
Burn all his writing brushes, ink,

56
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,680
paper, and inkstones!

57
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,740
You're not allowed to write anymore!

58
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,470
Nothing I wrote

59
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,190
made any sense.

60
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,740
This stupid world doesn't make sense either!

61
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,520
Isn't this my sister,

62
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,900
the monarch?

63
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,810
You've been drunk for days.

64
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:33,770
Can you really

65
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,330
drown your sorrows

66
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,750
with the wine?

67
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,080
I wish I could.

68
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,790
Let me tell you.

69
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,450
People

70
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,320
are all cheap.

71
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,050
Think about it.

72
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,020
They lie to other people

73
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,909
and themselves.

74
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,550
It's good to be drunk.

75
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,810
When you're drunk,

76
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,100
you don't feel pain anymore.

77
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,150
Big Brother.

78
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,870
You feel sad.

79
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,030
Just cry it out.

80
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,630
It's okay to cry

81
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,040
in front of me.

82
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,150
Forget it.

83
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,320
After all that's happened,

84
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,450
can we still do

85
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,110
whatever we want?

86
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,940
Take you, for example.

87
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,290
Nan Yan.

88
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,670
Do you really want to be the monarch?

89
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,740
I knew it.

90
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,390
I don't want to be the Dragon Lord either.

91
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,890
But those old men

92
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,090
in the Dragon Capital

93
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,190
came to me one after another

94
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,580
and told me

95
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,890
it was for my own good

96
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,330
and I could take my time.

97
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,880
Then what happened?

98
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,640
They kept sending me

99
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,160
memorials

100
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,290
about trivial matters.

101
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,480
Like,

102
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,610
a guy was mesmerized by a cat spirit

103
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,860
and married her.

104
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,540
However, the cat spirit gave birth to a rat baby.

105
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,210
How was that any of my business?

106
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,170
If only my father were still alive.

107
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,800
Nan Yan.

108
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,310
I really miss him.

109
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,270
You've finally found your father…

110
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,360
but I've lost mine.

111
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,920
You know what?

112
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,950
My mom once said that

113
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,730
her daughter

114
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,650
should be like the sun in the sky.

115
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,580
If I'm happy and content,

116
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,820
then the world will be bright.

117
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,700
But if I feel down,

118
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,140
then the world will be overcast.

119
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,419
I think

120
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,580
your father

121
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,180
must have wished the same for you.

122
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,280
Big Brother.

123
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,500
He definitely wouldn't want to see you

124
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,430
overwhelmed with grief like this.

125
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,910
You can't drown your sorrows.

126
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,740
But I do

127
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,650
feel your pain.

128
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,920
Here.

129

Let's drink our fill

130
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,830

132
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,910
I came to you

133
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,070
to discuss

134
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,800
something important with you.

135
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:06,630
Look.

136
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,760
Isn't this Uncle's…

140
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,310
who snatched the floating star carp, right?

141
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,140
It was him.

142
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,220
It was indeed this face.

143
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,110
At that time,

144
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,610
a lot of girls fell for him.

145
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,030
We've actually

146
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,220
brushed shoulders with Sen Luo.

come again?

150
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,680
Don't panic.

151
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,230
The five states are so big.

152
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,080
Why does he have to

153
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,600
come to the whaleboat?

154
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,130
[Kill This Demon]

155
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,670
You're right.

[Notice]

160
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,040
He went to the whaleboat again?

161
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,310
What does he want?

162
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,640
What's his issue with the Dragon Capital?

163
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,240
Fortunately, no casualties.

164
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,890
But the whaleboat

165
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,770
is now an empty city on the sea.

166
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,880
I'm afraid it's easy to defend but hard to attack.

167
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,450
The Sword Sect is willing to be the vanguard.

168
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,920
I put a lot of effort

169
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,520
into training Shao Cang.

170
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,190
I know him best.

171
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,190
He doesn't like attention.

172
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,530
But this time, he showed up in the whaleboat

173
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,860
and caused quite a stir.

174
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,650
He must have set a trap

175
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,470
and is waiting for you to step into it.

176
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,560
I'll go meet him first.

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,910
Don't act rashly.

178
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,550
You're indeed my best disciple.

179
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,750
Now, you're even

180
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,620
scheming against me, your master.

181
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,150
In terms of scheming,

182
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,190
cultivation,

183
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,930
and leadership,

184
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,470
no one knows your limits.

185
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,890
I'm just

186
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,850
playing it by ear,

187
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,670
so I can beat you occasionally.

188
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,670
They're right.

189
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,310
I shouldn't have let you live.

190
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,840
You're a threat

191
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,510
with great strategic prowess

192
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,320
that everyone fears.

193
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,610
Master, you don't have to

194
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,040
pretend to be nice and tolerant to me here.

195
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,390
Today,

196
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,880
we'll settle the score.

197
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,460
I have a small question.

198
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,050
Go ahead, Master.

199
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,250
Yan and I are related by blood.

200
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,480
But no matter what,

201
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,340
she refuses to call me Father.

202
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,320
I can't understand it.

203
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,900
Shao Cang.

204
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,090
Can you tell me

205
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,910
what secret you and she are keeping?

206
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,480
She has her reasons

207
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,700
for not calling you Father.

208
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,550
What on earth have you told her?

209
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,850
Just some romantic entanglements.

210
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,820
Do you really want to know?

211
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,700
As her father,

212
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,040
I naturally care about

213
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,440
who she wants to be with.

214
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,730
If Yan pulls away from me

215
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,250
because of you

216
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,660
and gets led astray,

217
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,170
it's my duty to straighten her out!

218
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,610
Don't worry about that, Master.

219
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,550
You've calculated every move,

220
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,410
causing me to be abandoned by all.

221
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,550
I'm afraid she's the one

222
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,330
who hates me the most now.

223
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,180
Check over there.

224
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,310
Let's go over there.

225
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,150
The tea has been served.

226
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,730
Formalities have been observed.

227
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,290
Master,

228
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,120
shall we start the game now?

229
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,000
Game?

230
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,780
You must have come here

231
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,000
to take away the Yin Zhus of my three prisons.

232
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,170
They've come with you too.

233
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,550
Today, we'll bet on

234
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,410
whether you can deceive them all.

235
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,120
There's no demonic aura at all.

236
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,440
Not only that,

237
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,230
but your father has also disappeared.

238
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,510
I'm afraid he's in danger.

239
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,920
Be careful!

240
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,340
Come out and fight me if you dare!

241
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,610
Don't play

242
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,690
such dirty tricks!

243
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,940
There seems to be a fight.

244
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,320
Why did you throw fire at me?

245
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,260
Little Fox.

246
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,430
I hurried here

247
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,360
to help you out,

248
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,170
yet that's how you greeted me.

249
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,870
I didn't mean it.

250
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,350
You didn't make any sound.

251
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,300
Let's go.

252
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,580
I'm afraid Ji Yang can't hold it for long.

253
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,550
Shao Cang.

254
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,840
Do you admit you're wrong?

255
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,850
I don't know what I did wrong.

256
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,950
In the cultivation realm, power is held in the highest regard.

257
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,260
If you're not powerful enough,

258
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,170
you're wrong.

259
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,080
This jade

260
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,920
can help me take control

261
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,680
of all the Yin Zhus in your body.

262
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,770
Just surrender.

263
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,370
Father!

264
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,680
You've made one mistake after another!

265
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,320
When can you wise up?

266
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,300
Nan Yan.

267
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,240
Father.

268
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,340
Yan.

269
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,090
You finally called me Father.

270
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,060
I…

271
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,400
I know.

272
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,980
All you and Rao had was each other.

273
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,400
I've never fulfilled my duty as a father.

274
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,460
I don't deserve it.

275
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:31,870
Actually,

276
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,630
I've never blamed you.

277
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,950
However,

278
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,410
even if we're blood relatives,

279
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,650
it'll still take some time

280
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,680
for us to become close.

281
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,770
At this point,

282
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,950
I can finally understand why Rao

283
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,950
chose to live in seclusion with you.

284
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,550
Both she and Nan Yi

285
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,960
are descendants of the Red Emperor

286
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,710
but suffered one misfortune after another.

287
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,500
After all that happened to her,

288
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,770
she definitely didn't want you to get involved

289
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,430
in the power struggle in the cultivation realm.

290
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,350
All parents

291
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,530
wish for their children to be safe and sound.

292
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,510
If I were her,

293
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,200
I would've made the same choice.

294
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,450
For me,

295
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,400
Mom went through a lot.

296
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,860
I once heard that

297
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,140
when she just gave birth to me,

298
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,710
she didn't know how to raise a child.

299
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,340
One day,

300
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,020
she actually climbed over a wall in the middle of the night

301
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,090
to seek advice from a wet nurse,

302
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,120
only to nearly get thrown out.

303
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,270
After I was a bit older,

304
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,570
she promised

305
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,940
to teach me to read

306
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,610
and write.

307
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,800
However,

308
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,990
she fell asleep

309
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,830
before it was even noon.

310
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,410
When she was in the Great Path back then,

311
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,670
she always fell asleep

312
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,090
in class,

313
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,280
and I had to do her homework for her.

314
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,350
And her cooking

315
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,020
was terrible.

316
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,570
When I was young,

317
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,680
I couldn't eat the things she made.

318
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,710
After I grew up,

319
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,050
I started cooking for her.

320
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,830
Although life in the countryside was simple,

321
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,560
it was also peaceful and happy.

322
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,170
Maybe that kind of life

323
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,240
was what Rao wanted her whole life.

324
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:48,980
Yan.

325
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,220
Go to Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea immediately

326
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,950
to seek protection from the Master of Endurance.

327
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,960
Why?

328
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,490
If it's a time of peace,

329
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,940
I'll protect you your whole life

330
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,550
so that you can be as carefree

331
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,350
as before.

332
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,770
But Sen Luo has wreaked havoc on the cultivation realm.

333
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,820
He'll definitely kill all deities.

334
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,870
There's no way

335
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,610
around this for me.

336
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,920
I can't drag you in.

337
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,970
Kill all the deities?

338
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,760
That's why

339
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,710
he killed the Dragon Lord

340
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,980
and the Sword Master.

341
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,590
People call me the Master of All,

342
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,500
but they don't know the best cultivator in the cultivation realm

343
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,420
is your master.

344
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,420
Go to him.

345
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,750
He'll help you.

346
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,710
I'm not leaving.

347
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,900
After Mom passed away,

348
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:45,570
I thought

349
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,060
I had no family anymore.

350
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:48,800
Now,

351
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,440
I've finally had a home

352
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,170
and found my father

353
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,670
and my uncle.

354
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,360
I can't leave my close family behind.

355
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,670
Besides,

356
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,180
only the Seven Sins Manual

357
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,740
can weaken Yin Zhus.

358
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,430
Maybe

359
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,780
this is my fate.

360
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,250
How is he?

361
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,390
I've checked his pulse.

362
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,690
After resting for a night,

363
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,530
he's fine now.

364
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,450
But he still needs to rest for a few more days.

365
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,010
The whole cultivation realm

366
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,300
has been put in a panic.

367
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,230
If Sen Luo shows up again,

368
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,030
I'm afraid not many people

369
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,440
will dare fight him.

370
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,630
Even if we're the only ones left,

371
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,870
we still have to fight Sen Luo to the end.

372
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,270
You're girls.

373
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,150
If anyone is to take the lead,

374
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,010
it should be me.

375
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,130
No way.

376
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,620
If we die, we die together.

377
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,100
Don't jinx it.

378
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:03,690
Right.

379
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,420
We must all stay alive.

380
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,410
Especially you.

381
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Here's the thing.

382
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,420
I heard that the Great Path

383
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,130
houses a picture of the Red Emperor fighting in wars.

384
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,550
It records the moves he used

385
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,990
to kill demons and spirits back then.

386
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,140
I want to learn them.

387
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,580
That painting was drawn hundreds of years ago.

388
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,010
The moves the Red Emperor used

389
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,170
are all just myths.

390
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,630
Over the years, no one

391
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,290
has been able to decipher the secrets within.

392
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,630
I heard that the move called the Heavenly Fire

393
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,220
and the Sun Fire my father taught me

394
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,420
have the same origin.

395
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,090
Others can't learn it,

396
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,310
but I may be able to.

397
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,440
It's a good idea.

398
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,140
If you can learn it,

399
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,320
we'll have a better chance

400
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,300
of winning.

401
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,970
This is the painting in question.

402
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,750
But it's just a blank piece of paper.

403
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,170
I think

404
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,930
this is what makes it tricky.

405
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,010
Only those who can see its content

406
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,920
can learn from it.

407
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,900
I need to remind you, Dragon Lord.

408
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,540
Although it appears blank,

409
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,630
staring at this painting for too long can harm your consciousness.

410
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,290
Don't push yourself too hard.

411
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,420
Xingzheng.

412
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,120
Go gather

413
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,740
all disciples of the Great Path

414
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,870
and wait for my further instructions.

415
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:32,810
Yes.

416
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,080
This painting appears very fierce.

417
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,340
I worry that if Big Brother forces himself to understand it

418
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,540
and becomes fixated,

419
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,990
his spirit and soul may be burned by the illusions

420
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,170
in the painting.

421
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,360
Can't he give up halfway?

422
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,530
If he stops forcibly,

423
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,470
he'll get hurt as well.

424
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,920
What will happen to him?

425
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,410
His mental state will regress to that of a three-year-old.

426
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,750
A three-year-old?

427
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,310
It's not so bad

428
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,520
to be a three-year-old.

429
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,460
What matters most

430
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,150
is that he can stay alive.

431
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,190
Don't worry.

432
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,410
Big Brother has magical fire.

433
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,870
He can definitely make it.

434
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,320
Master.

435
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,150
Talk some sense into him.

436
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,150
He's crazy. He's made quite a scene.

437
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,870
Ji Yang, long time no see.

438
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,270
Thank you for saving my life.

439
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,380
I'll never forget

440
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,950
your kindness.

441
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,670
I remember telling you

442
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,110
to find a quiet place and live a peaceful life,

443
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,230
not to get involved in the affairs

444
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,030
in the cultivation realm again.

445
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,890
But you still came.

446
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,010
Live a peaceful life?

447
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,660
He set a bait

448
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,440
but ended up inviting trouble

449
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,170
and almost got himself killed.

450
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,150
Who was the bait set for?

451
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:19,800
Ying Zewei.

452
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,170
Premier?

453
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,030
Sir,

454
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,290
please let me explain.

455
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,790
Take your time,

456
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,150
young friend.

457
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,230
Tell me what you know.

458
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,710
This is what happened.

459
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,690
Although I haven't witnessed everything myself,

460
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,970
I've been there most of the time.

461
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,480
The Master of All

462
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,790
is actually a big liar.

463
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,770
He refused to release the spirits before.

464
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,970
It must have been for some other reason.

465
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,810
The Great Path

466
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,710
can't fall.

467
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,620
I was born there.

468
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,370
I once also thought

469
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,190
the Great Path couldn't fall.

470
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,280
Do you think…

471
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,550
there are gods above the sky?

472
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,780
All cultivators have wondered

473
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,750
if the realm of gods truly exists.

474
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,030
From the moment they first harness

475
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,430
spiritual power,

476
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,150
they start

477
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,690
to believe

478
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,180
they're special.

479
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,230
So,

480
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,050
they madly pursue the ultimate power,

481
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,840
thinking that

482
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,870
beyond this vast ocean of survival of the fittest,

483
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,310
there lies a realm

484
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,870
of true omnipotence.

485
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,590
You mean

486
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,270
Ying Zewei wants to seize

487
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,960
the five prisons to become a god?

488
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,490
But it won't work.

489
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:25,730
Back then, Sen Luo

490
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,230
owned the power of the five prisons

491
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,400
but was still defeated

492
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,950
by the Holy Master.

493
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,440
Getting the five prisons is just part of his plan.

494
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,890
According to Ji Yang,

495
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,440
he also wants

496
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,280
the Nirvana spirit heart

497
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,580
and the Heart of the Six Realms.

498
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,590
Have you ever heard that

499
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,050
there's another kind of heart in this world?

500
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,270
I once read about it

501
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,870
in a book about cultivation.

502
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,230
The Holy Master

503
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,890
had the Zen Heart of Brahma Bones.

504
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,310
Back then,

505
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,510
he used the power of the Zen Heart

506
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,130
to seal Sen Luo for hundreds of years.

507
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,150
With those three hearts and five prisons,

508
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,610
he can not only become a god

509
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,990
but also control the life, death, and reincarnation of every living being.

510
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,130
Life, death, and reincarnation?

511
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,100
He wants

512
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,330
to rule the whole world?

513
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,050
Sir,

514
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,350
the Zen Heart of Brahma Bones

515
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,950
has disappeared with the Holy Master for hundreds of years.

516
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,800
Why are you

517
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,210
still so worried?

518
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,890
Because that heart

519
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,470
is from the Seven Sins Manual.

520
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,730
Nan Yan?

521
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,730
Sen Luo once said

522
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,030
Nan Yan would be consumed

523
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,550
by the Seven Sins Manual.

524
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,760
Before long,

525
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,730
she'll die.

526
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,330
Being consumed

527
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,660
is a tribulation,

528
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,510
but it's also a chance

529
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,360
to cultivate the Zen Heart of Brahma Bones.

530
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,910
He even killed the one he admired

531
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,860
and his beloved disciple.

532
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,630
He will in no way spare Nan Yan.

533
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:40,870
Thank you, sir,

534
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,360
for telling me the truth.

535
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,610
I'm now determined

536
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,790
to kill him.

537
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,330
I've never seen such strange fire before.

538
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
It's transformed from the Sun Fire.

539
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,980
How is he?

540
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:27,679
He's fine.

541
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:30,429
He just obtained the Heavenly Fire.

542
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,170
He'll be fine after some rest.

543
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,400
We have to tell Nan Yan about it.

544
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,230
We can't let her

545
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,350
fall into Ying Zewei's trap.

546
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,030
Wait.

547
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,290
She definitely hates me very much now.

548
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:44,710
She won't trust me anymore.

549
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,989
Leave it to me.

550
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,560
I won't let you

551
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,590
fight alone.

552
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,910
I never thought

553
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,950
I'd kill a deity with you today.

554
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,630
Do you regret

555
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,210
being mean to me back then?

556
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,490
This battle will be extremely dangerous.

557
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,780
If…

558
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,250
If something happens to me,

559
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,430
I'll leave Nan Yan in your care.

560
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,960
What are you talking about?

561
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,660
The battle hasn't even started yet.

562
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,260
How do you know you won't win?

563
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,400
No matter what it takes,

564
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,030
I won't let him

565
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,070
get what he wants.

566
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,630
What's your plan?

567
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,900
I'll kill my way to the Great Path.

568
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:06,910
My Lady.

569
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,090
Everyone else is in place,

570
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,000
guarding every strategic point of the Great Path.

571
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,180
I'll wait here with you.

572
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,150
No need.

573
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,560
I can do it alone.

574
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,570
You have a more important task.

575
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,930
Go to my father

576
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,950
and protect him for me.

577
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,710
Three years ago,

578
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,230
I knew that deep down, you were the same kind of person

579
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,550
as Shao Cang.

580
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,970
You are the monarch now.

581
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,310
Sometimes when I look at you,

582
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,220
you remind me

583
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,910
of him back then.

584
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,850
♫No matter how far it is, we just need to face our backs to each other♫

585
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,400
♫Even if I have to wait a little bit more♫

586
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,750
♫The moment we get closer♫

587
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,180
♫We disperse♫

588
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,630
♫It's destined that we fall in love♫

589
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,490
♫At first sight♫

590
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:16,430
♫A fate that lasts three lifetimes♫

591
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,990
♫When I look back, you're already my habit♫

592
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,660
♫We entangle, saying nothing♫

593
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:29,860
♫For this first sight, we are together forever♫

594
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:36,700
Yan.

595
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,550
Do you really want to kill me?

596
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,500
Yan.

597
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,150
Move aside.

598
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,430
You treacherous demon,

599
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,430
you've undermined our righteous course.

600
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,290
You should die.

601
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,550
That's also what he taught me back then.

602
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,510
My mother died because of you.

603
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,980
Do you want my father dead too?

604
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,850
He has to die.

605
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,230
Yan.

606
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:50,680
Father.

607
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,810
Sorry.

608
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,990
I failed to kill this demon for you.

609
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,070
Don't be silly.

610
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,500
No matter how much you hate me,

611
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,230
you shouldn't have hurt Yan!

612
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,440
Master, My Lady.

613
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,560
Take Yan away for treatment.

614
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,400
Yes.

615
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,270
What a loving father and a caring daughter.

616
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,270
Master, what a great show you've put on.

617
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,190
Being hellbent on killing me

618
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,430
will only make her hate you more.

619
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,470
If I were you,

620
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,080
I would choose death as atonement.

621
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,950
I've made it this far

622
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,920
just to take your life.

623
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,320
If I can keep Yan safe

624
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,630
for just one more day,

625
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,290
it'll be worth it.

626
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,640
Yan is my daughter.

627
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,740
Of course I'll treat her well.

628
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,400
Treat her well?

629
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,110
Just like how you

630
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,270
treated Chief Nan

631
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,700
and let her know what she'd die for?

632
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,670
You're so biased

633
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,860
against me.

634
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,710
Master, have you heard of

635
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,660
the Zen Heart of Brahma Bones?

636
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,450
The Zen Heart of Brahma Bones?

637
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:21,750
Nan Yan.

638
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,140
Nan Yan.

639
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,720
How are you feeling?

640
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,150
Li Mian,

641
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:28,760
you're here too.

642
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,470
Dragon Lord sent me a message.

643
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,750
Since you're to kill that demon,

644
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,990
I must help you.

645
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,710
Okay.

646
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:38,840
Have a good rest.

647
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,390
Don't worry too much.

648
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,180
Who did this to her?

649
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,890
She was hurt by Shao Cang, that scumbag.

650
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,430
Him again?

651
00:41:59,380 --> 00:41:59,980
Oh, right.

652
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,630
Premier has ordered me

653
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,990
to treat the monarch.

654
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:04,950
Take me to him now.

655
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,390
I'll kill him today!

656
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,110
Calm down, Dragon Lord.

657
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,370
Premier is dealing with him outside.

658
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,300
What do you mean?

659
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,300
Do you think I can't defeat him?

660
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:14,370
Lead the way!

661
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,090
Wait.

662
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,920
That's not what I mean.

663
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,940
Enough. Calm down.

664
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,250
Nan Yan needs to get treatment first.

665
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,000
Then I'll leave her to you.

666
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:31,910
Don't go.

667
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,880
Come back!

668
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,480
Enough!

669
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:33,910
Take me to him!

670
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:34,670
Calm down!
