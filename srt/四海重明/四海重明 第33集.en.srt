4
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,789
Shao Cang.

5
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,880
What did you do?

6
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,680
Give me an explanation.

7
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,830
I...

8
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,520
Master,

9
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,730
I didn't do this.

10
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,480
You're the only one here.

11
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,039
They all died

12
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,789
under my personal techniques.

13
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,650
Who else

14
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,690
could it be?

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,620
Could it be me?

16
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,430
I always thought

17
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,470
you had just gone mad while practicing.

18
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,560
To protect your lifelong reputation,

19
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,590
I willingly confessed to the crime of using my fellow disciples

20
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,450
as blood sacrifices and the practice of dark magic,

21
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,910
and was willing to be deposed from the throne of the monarch,

22
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,750
cast into the Soul River,

23
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,750
and suffer the torment of the Candlelight Beetles' bone-devouring fire.

24
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,730
I even fled to the North,

25
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,079
trying to help you with exorcisms.

26
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,770
I regarded you as a father.

27
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,590
I didn't expect that all of this

28
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,080
was just my own wishful thinking.

29
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,290
Shao Cang, you finally found out. Do you remember what my first words were when I took you into the mountains?

30
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,760
you finally know.

31
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,400
Do you remember

32
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,160
what my first words were

33
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,490
when I took you into the mountain?

34
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,850
Of all things in the world,

35
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,490
one should know nine parts of ten.

36
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,270
Even knowing nine parts out of ten,

37
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,870
there is still one part left.

38
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,120
Your talent is exceptional.

39
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,040
This one part

40
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,250
is what

41
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,990
I sought from you.

42
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,120
So,

43
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,910
from the very beginning, you've been just using me?

44
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,880
What about my parents?

45
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,350
Were they also killed by you?

46
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,870
They

47
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,830
blocked my way.

48
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,710
Right.

49
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,030
All my family was schemed against by you,

50
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,940
let alone me.

51
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,709
When you took the elixir

52
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,190
from Chief Nan back then,

53
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,630
how disappointed was she?

54
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,630
Nan Rao...

55
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,730
was different.

56
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,930
You even killed your beloved one.

57
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,090
What exactly are you after?

58
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,510
You ripped out Chief Nan's

59
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,710
Nirvana spirit heart

60
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,840
and my Heart of the Six Realms,

61
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,030
and used the Sword Master

62
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,159
to refine the spiritual crystals.

63
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,370
What exactly are you trying to achieve?

64
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,890
Shao Cang,

65
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,860
you can't kill me today,

66
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,180
and you won't be able to in the future.

67
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,310
The three prisons within you will eventually belong to me

68
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,240
and help me achieve my grand cause.

69
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,640
What about Nan Yan?

70
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,070
What can you gain

71
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,920
from her?

72
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,110
I'm her father.

73
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,550
I will make it up to her.

74
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,870
You'll only hurt her!

75
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,380
Well, let's see

76
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,370
whether she will believe you

77
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,650
or me.

78
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,270
In the future,

79
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,880
when Nan Yan takes charge of the Justice Hall,

80
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,680
I will have her personally draft

81
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,390
the joint conquest decree of the cultivation realm.

82
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,850
The Reincarnated Sen Luo,

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,650
who killed Chief Nan,

84
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,280
is a cancer to the five states and four seas.

85
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,560
The demonic evil must be eradicated,

86
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,350
and thus,

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,860
the cultivation realm should unite in this effort.

88
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,260
Thank you, Master.

89
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,030
As you command.

90
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,310
Mom?

91
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,480
Mom!

92
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,440
Mom.

93
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,960
Mom!

94
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,070
Mom!

95
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,300
Mom!

96
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,200
Mom!

97
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,130
Mom!

98
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,750
Oh no.

99
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,870
The Bone-Deep Mirror is about to break.

100
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,600
It looks like it's destiny that can't be changed.

101
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,220
Are you looking for me?

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,470
You killed them?

103
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,920
Yes.

104
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,160
Why?

105
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,300
They were all sacrifices,

106
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,220
and my Yin Zhus

107
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,010
need a lot of them.

108
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,000
Their lives

109
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,030
weren't nearly enough for me.

110
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,970
Do you want everyone

111
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,480
to die for you?

112
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,750
All the souls in this world

113
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,289
will eventually be under my control.

114
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,350
Including yours.

115
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,380
This is the Great Path Sect.

116
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,850
The Great Path Sect?

117
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,140
Why am I here?

118
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,620
In the Bone-Deep Mirror,

119
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,710
your mind was in chaos

120
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,350
and haunted by nightmares and inner demons.

121
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,010
The premier brought you back.

122
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,690
Are you saying

123
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,840
Ying Zewei saved me?

124
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,390
The premier has instructed

125
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,590
that once you wake up,

126
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,920
you should go to the bamboo house and have a talk with him.

127
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,830
In the Bone-Deep Mirror,

128
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,160
why didn't you stop him?

129
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,960
Even you

130
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,590
fell into his trap this time.

131
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,290
Not to mention me.

132
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,640
What did you say?

133
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,860
You never actually meant for me

134
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,590
to become the monarch, did you?

135
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,720
You just tricked me into going in there

136
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,310
to use my life

137
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,050
to block his path.

138
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,880
A demonic cultivator

139
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,450
covets the throne of the monarch?

140
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,290
What a delusion.

141
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,780
Just kill me.

142
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,300
Wouldn't killing you be a waste

143
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,360
of your Soul Transference Technique?

144
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,560
I specifically chose

145
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,630
this body for you.

146
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,100
You should make the best use of it.

147
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,910
It's better to die

148
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,040
than to live like a dog.

149
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,810
Don't forget

150
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,350
your sister, Li Mian,

151
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,750
is still alive.

152
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,800
You are threatening me with her again?

153
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,430
I've told you before

154
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,810
that to reach the pinnacle of cultivation,

155
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,870
one must ultimately sever their emotions and desires.

156
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,080
Otherwise,

157
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,980
one will end up like you,

158
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,860
being controlled by others

159
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,260
and suffering greatly.

160
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,930
Kill Sen Luo for me,

161
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,340
and I will spare you

162
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,550
and your sister.

163
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,950
Yes.

164
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,550
Chief Song,

165
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,170
my condolences.

166
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,670
Premier, you're willing to personally preside over

167
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,970
the ritual for our master.

168
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,170
The entire Sword Sect

169
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,800
deeply appreciates that.

170
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,020
Due to the sudden nature of the arrangement,

171
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,550
preparations were rushed.

172
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,990
The premier, fearing to disturb the Sword Master's tranquility,

173
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,320
did not invite other disciples to attend.

174
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,140
Our master often said,

176
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,240
"The Pine Peak, growing on the cliffs,

177
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,300
is naturally quiet and purposeful."

178
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,550
Just as life begins in this way,

179
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,630
it

180
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,830
should end in the same manner.

181
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,350
We have prepared everything needed

182
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,280
for the funeral.

183
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,350
Chief,

184
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,320
do you have everything ready?

185
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,390
[Memorial Tablet of the Late Master Meng Xiaolou, the Sword Master]

186
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,390
[Memorial Tablet of the Late Mu Guanghan, the Dragon Lord]

187
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,630
He's already dead.

188
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,110
What's the point of these formalities?

189
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,590
Wake up.

190
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,710
Stop talking nonsense.

191
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,110
You look just like your mother.

192
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,380
Sir,

193
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,440
you know my mother?

194
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,400
Rao and I

195
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,010
were classmates.

196
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,120
I have had more

197
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
interactions with her than others.

198
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,000
A gift to Rao as an apology

199
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,690
for missing the appointment on July 7th.

200
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,510
Whose handwriting is this?

201
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,100
I've seen some of my mother's paintings

202
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,780
in Dragon Capital.

203
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,210
In one of them,

204
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,880
she is lying among Lunar Epiphyllums.

205
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,310
The painting is inscribed with a sentence:

206
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,930
"A gift to Rao as an apology

207
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,660
for missing the appointment on July 7th."

208
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,760
That day

209
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,960
was our anniversary,

210
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,110
but I arrived late

211
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,740
due to the Great Path Master's reprimand,

212
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,870
which made her angry

213
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,960
and led her to get drunk by herself.

214
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,910
Anniversary?

215
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,290
Yan,

216
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,820
I'm your father.

217
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,930
My father

218
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,770
[Memorial Tablet of the Late Mu Guanghan, the Dragon Lord]

219
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,570
was usually quite generous with his spending.

220
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,290
I'm worried he won't have enough money in the other world.

221
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,260
Is everyone here?

222
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,690
The premier still has some family matters

223
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,420
to attend to.

224
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,530
Everyone,

225
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,770
please wait a moment.

226
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,540
Wait a moment?

227
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,700
Is this the manner

228
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,030
of your Great Path Sect?

229
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,230
Are you saying

230
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,200
you are my father?

231
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,680
I have promised Rao

232
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,420
that I would protect you,

233
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,090
but I ultimately failed to do so.

234
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,890
But I never heard my mother

235
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,860
mention you.

236
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,020
Rao and I were engaged,

237
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,850
but we did not perform the wedding ceremony.

238
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,720
At that time,

239
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,250
I had already sent a betrothal proposal to Yao Palace.

240
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,520
After the wedding date was set,

241
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,180
something happened to Nan Yi.

242
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,720
Uncle?

243
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,349
At that time, I accompanied Rao

244
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,079
to many places to plead for him.

245
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,480
After Rao was punished on his behalf,

246
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,680
she was ordered to reinforce the seal in the Filth Valley.

247
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,390
As for me, due to my position as monarch,

248
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,329
I was punished

249
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,710
by the Great Path Master for favoritism

250
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,440
and had to enter seclusion for self-reflection.

251
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:26,800
After that,

252
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,970
I never heard from her again.

253
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,050
No wonder

254
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,910
Uncle blamed himself so much

255
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,410
for my mother's death.

256
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,020
You've met him?

257
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,580
I've been to the Spirit-Sealing Formation.

258
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,770
When we parted,

259
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,160
Uncle told me

260
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,140
he was going to meet an old acquaintance.

261
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,280
Nan Yi and I

262
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,720
were close friends,

263
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,230
like kindred spirits.

264
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,530
Not long ago,

265
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,130
he broke out of the Spirit-Sealing Formation.

266
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,420
I thought he would come to find me.

267
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,600
Didn't he come?

268
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,960
Before he could arrive,

269
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,870
the incident happened in Dragon Capital.

270
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,150
Where could he have gone?

271
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,320
I'm worried that he might have been injured by the formation

272
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,920
and is unable to move for now.

273
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,300
Then I need to find him.

274
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,510
You are injured

275
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,720
and still not fully recovered from the inner demon affliction.

276
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,030
You shouldn't go down the mountain just yet.

277
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,220
But don't worry.

278
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,750
I have sent people to search for him.

279
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,550
We should have news in a few days.

280
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,430
I promise you

281
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,560
that I will

282
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,030
reunite our family.

283
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,350
Uncle once said

284
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,130
that my mother died

285
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,530
from losing her heart.

286
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,710
I only learned about

287
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,550
the Nirvana spirit heart after entering

288
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,480
the Retrograde Bone-Deep Mirror.

289
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,100
But it was too late.

290
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,980
Sen Luo injured Rao

291
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,430
and used the power of that heart

292
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,780
to take away a prison.

293
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,650
Are you saying

294
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,590
that my mother's heart

295
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,580
is with him?

296
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,390
I saw it with my own eyes.

297
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,720
At that time,

298
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,350
after Rao went to the Filth Valley to reinforce the seal,

299
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,880
she suddenly went missing.

300
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,240
I deduced that

301
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,070
she must have lost her heart in the Yin Zhus' lair.

302
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,430
Sen Luo seized this opportunity

303
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,480
and was reborn a hundred years later.

304
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,910
In the Retrograde Bone-Deep Mirror,

305
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,970
he would not allow history to change.

306
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,420
I'm sorry.

307
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,180
I was too incompetent

308
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,150
to save your mother.

309
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,560
Today,

310
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,770
I am not the premier of the Great Path Sect,

311
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,310
but just a friend of two old acquaintances.

312
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,100
You two have each succeeded

313
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,360
as the lords of your respective regions.

314
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,670
From now on,

315
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,990
make sure to honor the wishes

316
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,720
of your father and your master,

317
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,860
and ensure they can rest in peace.

318
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,160
After a hundred years of friendship,

319
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,820
the time has come to part ways.

320
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,690
May my two old friends

321
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,970
rest in peace

322
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,900
and enter reincarnation soon.

323
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,910
[Memorial Tablet of the Late Master Meng Xiaolou, the Sword Master]

324
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,910
[Memorial Tablet of the Late Mu Guanghan, the Dragon Lord]

325
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,000
What are you going to do next?

326
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,350
Is Nan Yan really safe here?

327
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,720
I trust her.

328
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,650
Besides,

329
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,960
as long as she hates me,

330
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,200
Ying Zewei

331
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,630
won't do anything to her.

332
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,150
Now, with lovers turned into enemies

333
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,760
and brothers at odds,

334
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,300
this is indeed a situation where

335
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,010
the loved ones suffer and the enemies rejoice.

336
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,120
Lovers?

337
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,300
Brothers?

338
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,120
This path of mine

339
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,930
only deserves companionship with evil ghosts.

340
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,470
You have subdued the Yin Zhus from three prisons.

341
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,530
So now,

342
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,880
how many evil ghosts

343
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,910
are following us?

344
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,390
From where we stand,

345
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,710
all I can see is Hell.

346
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,450
They have all left.

347
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,910
My old bones

348
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,630
have only a hundred years left.

349
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,110
If the world beyond

350
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,200
is truly just a void,

351
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,770
and the end of the path to immortality

352
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,230
is merely waiting to die in the mortal realm,

353
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,510
why do cultivators

354
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,050
still tread this long path of cultivation?

355
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,840
I see.

356
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,790
I see.

357
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,010
Those who cultivate good karma can attain enlightenment,

358
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,430
transcend the heavenly paths, and aspire to supreme transcendence

359
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,910
beyond the cosmos.

360
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,220
[Great Path Sect]

361
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,350
Although Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament

362
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,750
was destroyed by Sen Luo,

363
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,410
the Crown of Shanhai

364
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,360
has already chosen its master.

365
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,800
Premier, are you saying

366
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,290
that a new monarch has been selected?

367
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,480
My daughter, Nan Yan,

368
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,230
is the new monarch

369
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,090
of the Great Path Sect from now on.

370
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,630
Premier,

371
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,770
is there any proof to support this claim?

372
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,410
This is a matter of great importance

373
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:59,410
and cannot be decided based on just one person's word.

374
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:01,830
Yan,

375
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,100
open your palm.

376
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,930
Nan Yan has gathered the spirits of Shanhai

377
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,230
and has left unscathed

378
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,870
from the Retrograde Bone-Deep Mirror.

379
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,930
The Seal of Shanhai

380
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,590
has already been imprinted within her.

381
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,480
Everyone,

382
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,720
you may step forward and verify this for yourselves.

383
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,950
It seems that what Premier said is true.

384
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,350
Since the Crown of Shanhai

385
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,410
has already chosen its new master on its own,

386
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,810
I have no further doubts.

387
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,980
Wait!

388
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,690
You said Nan Yan is your daughter?

389
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,870
This is a private matter of mine.

390
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,710
In the future,

391
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,380
I will clarify this to the world myself.

392
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,990
Yan,

393
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,940
as the monarch,

394
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,420
you must now

395
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,020
undertake the great responsibility

396
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,680
of upholding the law of heaven

397
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,800
and ruling the realm with justice.

398
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,880
Your first task

399
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,920
is to lead all paths in the world

400
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,720
to conquer the demons together.

401
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,560
Conquer the demons?

402
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,160
I support that.

403
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:34,830
Nan Yan,

404
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,510
before,

405
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,330
I trusted the wrong brother

406
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,300
and caused the destruction of my own family.

407
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,110
I admit it.

408
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,320
From now on,

409
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,910
I will not coexist with him, a demon.

410
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,710
Dragon Capital will definitely

411
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,810
make him pay with his blood for killing my father.

412
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,220
The Sword Sect swears

413
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,080
to vanquish the demons

414
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,860
and uphold the laws of heaven.

415
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,370
This girl

416
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,310
is the descendant of the premier

417
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,250
and endorsed by the heavens,

418
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,010
so we should support her.

419
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,120
However,

420
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,620
she has colluded with demons several times,

421
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,560
which already constitutes a grave crime against the heavens.

422
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,090
If she becomes the monarch,

423
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,200
all living beings would be at risk.

424
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,200
Premier,

425
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,380
you must not sacrifice the greater good

426
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,910
for minor considerations.

427
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,940
Indeed.

428
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,350
The Witch of the Evil Path Sect

429
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,940
has a deep connection with her.

430
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,740
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

431
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,590
Yan has been deceived by that demon.

432
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,380
If there have been any past mistakes,

433
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,660
I am willing to be punished in her place.

434
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,180
It's the Great Path Master's Sword of Reprimand.

435
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,760
No need!

436
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,400
He has committed many crimes.

437
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,610
I have...

438
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,980
I have...

439
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,410
nothing to do with him anymore.

440
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:26,850
That's right.

441
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,150
I was also deceived by him before.

442
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,180
If you want to hold me accountable,

443
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,710
I'm willing to accept that!

444
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,260
In the name of the Master of All,

445
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,390
I vouch for her position as monarch.

446
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,270
If there are any future punishments,

447
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,270
they will be on me.

448
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,650
Do any of you have objections?

449
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,670
With Premier's vouch,

450
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,320
we have no objections.

451
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,450
Well, My Lord,

452
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,430
please take on

453
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,690
this responsibility.

454
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,560
This is the decree for the extermination of demons.

455
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,650
My Lord, please issue the command

456
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,850
to eliminate Sen Luo.

457
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,800
My Lord, please issue the command

458
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,310
to eliminate Sen Luo!

459
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,550
My Lord, please issue the command

460
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,190
to eliminate Sen Luo!

461
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,170
My Lord, please issue the command

462
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,580
to eliminate Sen Luo!

463
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,830
My Lord, please issue the command

464
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,410
to eliminate Sen Luo!

465
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,430
My Lord, please issue the command

466
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,950
to eliminate Sen Luo!

467
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,090
The people outside have gone mad.

468
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,800
Everyone is looking for you.

469
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,720
You sure know how to pick a place.

470
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:21,990
Wait.

471
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,140
How do you know about the Lunar Sect?

472
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,230
Take a guess.

473
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,810
You remembered?

474
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:38,770
What?

475
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,570
Are you scared?

476
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,250
What do I have to be scared of?

477
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,830
In the past few years, it's been you bullying me.
If you want to settle old scores, fine. Let's sort it out properly.
So, you came all the way back to plant flowers for Nan Yan?

478
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,280
you've been bullying me.

479
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,110
If you want to settle old scores,

480
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,710
it's fine.

481
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,450
I'll go through everything with you one by one.

482
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,080
So you came all the way back

483
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,400
just to plant flowers for Nan Yan?

484
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,350
My Lord, you're new to the Great Path Sect.

485
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,830
How about I show you around?

486
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:35,670
Alright.

487
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,970
I clearly remember

488
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,920
what happened three years ago.

489
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,740
Do you mean

490
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,600
when we were at the Lunar Sect?

491
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,390
Since Senior Brother was accused

492
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,730
of falling into demonic ways and betraying the great path,

493
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,000
no one in the Great Path Sect

494
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,330
is allowed to mention him.

495
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,350
During the last Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament,

496
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,870
he could have taken the Crown of Shanhai

497
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,929
without a scratch,

498
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,070
but he put himself in danger

499
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,659
to save me.

500
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,750
So, from that moment on,

501
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:19,580
I never believed it.

502
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,020
What did you never believe?

503
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,270
I don't believe he killed anyone,

504
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,480
I don't believe he fell into demonic ways,

505
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,150
and I don't believe

506
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,560
all those alleged crimes.

507
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,739
I remember his face.

508
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,800
Those were definitely not the eyes

509
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,260
of someone who had fallen into demonic ways.

510
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,020
What about you?

511
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,710
Do you believe in him?

512
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,469
I do.

513
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,969
I've always believed in him.

514
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,940
But this time,

515
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:55,989
I have

516
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,350
no reason left.

517
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,660
Now that you're the monarch,

518
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,460
surely you have a way to help him.

519
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,800
What if

520
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,500
there's been some misunderstanding?

521
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,590
Why don't we sit down

522
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,480
and talk it over

523
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,930
to see if there's any room

524
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,130
for resolution?

525
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:12,990
Room for resolution?

526
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,600
But he didn't leave

527
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,830
any room for himself.

528
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,890
This room

529
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,260
was once where Shao Cang lived.

530
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,080
There are still many of his old belongings.

531
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,940
If you're interested,

532
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,390
you can take a look.

533
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,590
If you'd rather not see them,

534
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,280
you can just throw them away.

do you think the premier

will stand up for you?

556
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,040
Never mind.

557
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,390
What's causing

558
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,990
the bottleneck in your cultivation?

559
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,100
Let me take a look.

560
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,930
Focus.

561
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,660
Listen carefully.

562
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,890
I only believe in

563
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,360
the Great Cycle.

564
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,180
It's the true method

565
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,770
and extremely profound.

566
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,870
The Great Way will never perish,

567
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,200
and the guiding light will shine forever.

568
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,100
How can you learn anything

569
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,790
with such a distracted mind?

570
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,510
Tomorrow is the Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament.

571
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,870
If you still can't learn it,

572
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,200
I'll have to punish you.

573
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,680
Since you're not focused on learning

574
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,050
and curfew is approaching,

575
