00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,480
Don't worry.

178
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,010
I will clarify everything.

179
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,590
The reason I'm here at Lunar Sect

180
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,860
is because I forced you

181
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,270
to hide me here.

182
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,790
Lunar Sect was unaware.

183
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,240
This matter

184
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,040
has nothing to do with the Lunar Sect.

185
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,510
You don't have to take responsibility for me.

186
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,720
In their eyes,

187
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,950
you are a treacherous and

188
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,280
untrustworthy person.

189
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,940
If you suddenly cut us

190
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,080
off like this,

191
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,710
can't they tell that

192
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,470
you want to protect us instead?

193
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,280
If you really care about us

194
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,870
and don't want me to take the blame for you,

195
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,990
just stay here and

196
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,080
don't go anywhere.

197
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,410
You just said that

198
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,670
the Great Path Sect is hard to fool.

199
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,670
Since they are here,

200
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,070
they won't leave easily.

201
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,880
If anything happens to you,

202
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,990
I'll let them die with you.

203
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,930
If you really kill

204
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,950
Zhu Sui and the rest today,

205
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,830
you'll fall right into their hands.

206
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,390
You'd really be found guilty

207
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,070
of slaughtering your fellow disciples.

208
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,770
By then,

209
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,590
the entire cultivation realm will be your enemy.

210
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,350
There are so many people,

211
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,550
can you kill them all?

212
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,160
No matter what happens,

213
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,290
you must not show up.

214
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,650
This belongs to your mother.

215
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,660
You can't give it to outsiders.

216
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,990
You are not an outsider.

217
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,000
Miss,

218
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,890
why are you

219
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,210
in this forest alone?

220
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,350
I'm catching some venomous insects

221
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,350
to make medicine.

222
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,590
Did you plant those Vermilion flower

223
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,120
at the foot of the mountain?

224
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,660
You know poison too?

225
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,230
A fellow of the same craft.

226
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,290
I know a little.

227
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,720
May I ask

228
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,660
who lives in that room with you?

229
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,310
I've been studying poison.

230
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,500
I'm always alone.

231
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,890
Who would live with me?

232
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,310
Young Master.

233
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,150
It seems that you know poison too.

234
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,510
Why don't you stay

235
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,970
and make medicine with me?

236
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,060
What do you think?

237
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,870
I am Mo Xingzheng, a disciple of the Great Path.

238
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,730
I was ordered to search for a fugitive here.

239
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,280
If you

240
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,690
see any suspicious person,

241
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,940
please inform me.

242
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,440
A suspicious person?

243
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,830
I think you are suspicious.

244
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,270
You sneaked into the yard

245
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,650
while the master of the house was absent.

246
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,980
That's akin to a robber.

247
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,470
You asked a stranger woman

248
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,800
about her private life.

249
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,290
That's akin to a hooligan.

250
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,440
You broke into our sect

251
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,060
and wandered around as you like.

252
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,390
That's akin to a bandit.

253
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,450
You misunderstood.

254
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,400
Misunderstood?

255
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,210
If I remember correctly,

256
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,080
a few days ago,

257
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,040
you already searched the place, right?

258
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,190
In just a few days,

259
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,090
you intrude on our sect twice.

260
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,540
What?

261
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,140
Do you want to

262
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,370
ransack our sect while you're at it?

263
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,190
Unfortunately,

264
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,390
I'm so poor that

265
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,390
I only have these precious insects.

266
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,010
Have you thought it through?

267
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:52,940
Do you want them?

268
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,730
No need.

269
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,960
I shall take my leave.

270
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,430
How was it?

271
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,330
Don't worry.

272
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,520
That’s good.

273
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,890
Where is Elder Zhu?

274
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,270
Don't mention it.

275
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:36,950
Zhu

276
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,840
was so mad that he almost fainted.

277
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,310
All disciples of the Lunar Sect,

278
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,240
gather at the square immediately.

279
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,430
I have something to ask.

280
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,240
Who does he think he is?

281
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,680
He acts like he's such a big deal all the time.

282
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,480
I'll roast him with the Sun Fire.

283
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,280
Calm down.

284
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,550
He is not a good person.

285
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,810
The chief is not here now.

286
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,720
If we confront him head-on, there will only be trouble.

287
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,390
How about

288
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,410
playing it by ear?

289
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,780
We'll talk about it when Chief comes back.

290
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,000
This lucky bastard.

291
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,280
Let's go and have a look.

292
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,670
Ji Yang.

293
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,290
Where are you?

294
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,760
[Ji Yang]

295
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,820
This handwriting

296
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,600
is the same as Great Path's fugitive,

297
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,450
Shao Cang's handwriting.

298
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,540
[Ji Yang]

299
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,490
If my guess is right,

300
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,830
Ji Yang

301
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,280
is Shao Cang.

302
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,800
[Ji Yang]

303
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,220
[Ji Yang]

304
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,140
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

305
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,970
The rebel Shao Cang

306
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,150
is evil and ruthless.

307
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,430
He won't even spare the people of the same clan,

308
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,290
let alone your lot

309
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,610
who have nothing to do with him.

310
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,970
The ignorant is innocent.

311
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,120
Today,

312
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,780
whoever reveals Shao Cang’s whereabouts,

313
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,880
will not only be spared,

314
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,820
but also heavily rewarded.

315
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
If you conceal the truth on purpose,

316
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,910
the entire Lunar Sect

317
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,110
will be buried together.

318
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,510
Who is playing tricks?

319
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,280
Show yourself if you dare...

320
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,570
Was it not the fox spirit that day,

321
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,670
but Lord Shao Cang?

322
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,720
Senior!

323
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,710
Where is Ji Yang?

324
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,070
I don't know.

325
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,240
Wait!

326
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,360
Senior!

327
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,320
Senior!

328
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,450
Are you alright?

329
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,850
Elder Zhu.

330
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,330
The person you are looking for

331
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:33,990
is here.

332
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,540
Mr. Mu.

333
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,170
It's you again.

334
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,220
Are you kidding me again?

335
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,140
How can I joke with you, Elder Zhu?

336
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,390
You are the one

337
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,180
joking here.

338
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,990
Elder Zhu, look.

339
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:48,950
Here.

340
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,910
Great Path's Lord Shao Cang

341
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,530
is nowhere to be seen.

342
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,780
To be honest,

343
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,390
I wrote

344
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,750
these words.

345
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,810
[Ji Yang]

346
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,830
How is that possible?

347
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,460
Thank you for your compliment.

348
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,220
It seems that

349
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,950
my imitation of Shao Cang's handwriting

350
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,060
has reached the level

351
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,060
of being mistaken for the real deal.

352
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,010
Mr. Mu.

353
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,560
Why did you imitate Shao Cang's handwriting?

354
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,760
This must be new information for you.

355
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,130
Shao Cang’s calligraphy

356
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,680
is stylish and powerful.

357
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,750
The strokes are lively

358
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,400
and absolutely striking.

359
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:46,900
Wait.

360
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,460
What's wrong with imitating it?

361
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,510
Did I use your brush

362
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,810
or dipped your ink?

363
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,630
Seriously.

364
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,670
Mr. Mu is eloquent.

365
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,620
I admire that.

366
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,330
However,

367
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,920
who is Ji Yang?

368
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,280
Isn't he...

369
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,220
Well...

370
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,010
Who?

371
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,750
Who? He...

372
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,609
I came here to study

373
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,109
because the Lunar Sect

374
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,069
has Master Boyang's

375
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,310
Eternity Inner Canon.

376
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,869
Recorded inside

377
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,829
is a unique healing method that fights poison with poison.

378
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,990
It can cure my mother's old illness.

379
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,589
So,

380
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,650
I found a patient

381
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,990
with a similar illness

382
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,440
to my mother's.

383
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,319
This medicine tester

384
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,589
is called Ji Yang.

385
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,109
We checked her room.

386
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,220
It is indeed filled

387
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,750
with venomous insects and poisonous plants.

388
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,870
If it's a patient,

389
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,140
why doesn't anyone in the

390
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,500
sect know about it?

391
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,790
The Lunar Sect has strict rules.

392
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,190
We can't hide outsiders.

393
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,550
So this person

394
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,090
never showed up.

395
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,600
Where is he today?

396
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,370
He's not in the sect today.

397
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,170
Maybe he went down the mountain.

398
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,460
Have you

399
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,820
met this person?

400
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,200
This person?

401
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,250
No.

402
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,870
No?

403
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,920
No.

404
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,200
Really?

405
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,880
No matter how many times you ask,

406
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,030
the answer is the same.

407
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:17,830
Of course not.

408
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:22,910
Fine.

409
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,960
But

410
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,930
you have no evidence.

411
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,340
If you have a clear conscience,

412
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,920
why don't you try my

413
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,630
Celestial Lightning of Truth?

414
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,310
No way!

415
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,900
The Celestial Lightning of Truth?

416
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,500
You're the Elder of Great Path.

417
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,270
How could you do this?

418
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,390
Are you trying to force an answer out of her?

419
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,180
Mu Zhanting!

420
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,730
I've had enough of you!

421
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,840
Me too!

422
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,070
I'm not afraid of you!

423
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,110
The Dragon Roar of the Ninth Heaven!

424
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,930
Array!

425
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,960
Why isn't Father back yet?

426
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,930
Come on.

427
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,060
Here we go.

428
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,190
It's coming...

429
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,450
Coming!

430
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,790
Chief Meng.

431
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,980
I found that when

432
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,500
Nan Rao isn't here,

433
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,870
you become really

434
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,110
lucky.

435
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:39,960
Of course.

436
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,150
I didn't read the The Sparrow's Nine Verses

437
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,750
Yingying gave me for naught.

438
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,650
I told you.

439
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,310
Rao and I don't get along at the game table,

440
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,770
but you didn't believe me.

441
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,010
This is just an analysis, but,

442
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,410
were you losing to her

443
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,040
on purpose?

444
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,110
Don't tell me...

445
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,240
Are you in love with her?

446
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,330
You...

447
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,020
My card!

448
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,140
You can insult me,

449
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,970
but not my sportsmanship.

450
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,590
Yes.

451
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,430
I saw you went to the back mountain,

452
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,530
so I followed you.

453
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,560
Yan

454
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,720
went after the people from

455
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,780
Great Path, right?

456
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,690
Did she do it to lure them away?

457
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,230
Yan is in danger

458
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,490
because of you.

459
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,990
Why don't we help her?

460
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,360
If we work together,

461
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,510
I'm sure we can

462
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,990
defeat them somehow.

463
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,710
W-what's wrong?

464
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,990
You wrote that

465
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,840
anonymous letter, right?

466
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:55,630
Don't...

467
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,770
Don't kill me.

468
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,830
Nan Yan treats you as his friend.

469
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,230
Is this how you treat her?

470
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,430
Kid,

471
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,470
you should stop trying to show off

472
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,630
with your mediocre skills

473
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,710
in the future.

474
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,640
Let go of me!

475
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,050
You're shameless!

476
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,980
Let go of me!

477
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,530
Let...

478
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,340
Don't hurt him.

479
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,690
Come at me if you dare.

480
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,320
You're quite loyal.

481
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:22,550
Fine.

482
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,520
As long as you tell me where Shao Cang is,

483
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
I promise

484
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,560
I will release

485
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,350
all of you.

486
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,150
I've never seen him.

487
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,700
Why would I know where he is?

488
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,780
Nan Yan!

489
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,770
Let go of me.

490
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,020
And let you die?

491
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,390
How will I answer to Chief then?

492
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,140
Senior Fu...

493
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,620
You are really united.

494
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,100
Okay.

495
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,720
I’ll give you another chance.

496
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,580
You've really never seen Shao Cang before?

497
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,430
Elder Zhu,

498
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,580
are you deaf?

499
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,910
How many times have I told you?

500
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:00,960
No.

501
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,410
No.

502
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,590
Fine.

503
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,860
Since you are so stubborn,

504
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,900
I will grant your wish

505
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,710
and let you experience the

506
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,520
Celestial Lightning of Truth.

507
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,380
Senior.

508
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,630
What should we do?

509
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,410
Don't move.

510
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,110
Dispelling evil and warding off misfortune.

511
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,840
Invoking lightning for righteous punishments.

512
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,160
Let me ask you again.

513
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,920
Have you ever seen Shao Cang?

514
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,200
Never.

515
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,060
Fine.

516
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,330
Senior.

517
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,670
Senior, tell him to stop.

518
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,090
She will die.

519
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,080
The Celestial Lightning of Truth.

520
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,510
Nan Yan.

521
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,720
If I lie to you,

522
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,410
let me be struck by lightning.

523
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,630
This isn't good.

524
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,010
Meng Zhiguang!

525
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,770
How can a sect leader like you

526
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,450
just run away after winning?

527
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,250
How is it?

528
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,580
It doesn't feel good, does it?

529
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,970
Tell me the truth now,

530
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,090
and I can spare your life.

531
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,800
If you're inclined to be stubborn,

532
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,750
the Celestial Lightning strikes without mercy.

533
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,730
I have no idea

534
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,240
which bolt of lightning

535
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,030
will make even your soul disappear

536
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,490
when it hits you.

537
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,290
I'll tell you.

538
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,910
Speak.

539
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,270
Even if you kill me here,

540
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,310
I've still never seen him!

541
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,010
The Celestial Lightning of Truth

542
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,850
pierces the bones and devours your soul.

543
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,960
I'll ask you one last time.

544
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,680
Have you ever seen Shao Cang?

545
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,240
Bear with it.

546
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,790
Everything will be fine

547
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,420
after this time.

548
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,010
Fine.

549
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,110
Since you ask for death

550
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,870
just for a traitor who has

551
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,990
no relations with you,

552
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,700
I'll grant your wish.

553
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,290
♫Gazing at the distant sky♫

554
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,470
♫The clouds roll in as the wind rises♫

555
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,260
♫The faces we passed by♫

556
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,920
♫Met each other in fate♫

557
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,910
♫Like the vast starry sky♫

558
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,240
♫Falling into my eyes♫

559
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,080
♫Thousands of mountains apart♫

560
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,510
Ji Yang.

561
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,260
♫I hug you amongst a sea of people♫

562
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,720
♫At the Riverbank of Forgetfulness♫

563
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,910
♫I am willing to be a lone boat♫

564
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,560
♫Through the storms and cold♫

565
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,580
♫Just to wait for you♫

566
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,390
♫I break through the curse of fate♫

567
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,580
♫And pierce through the dark clouds♫

568

♫May heaven and earth last forever♫

569

♫May our love be eternal♫

570
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,260
♫The impermanent years have never stopped♫

571
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,850
♫We spend this lifetime hand in hand♫

572
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,620
♫Billions of light beams converge into a galaxy♫

573
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,660
♫But still can't compare to the moment you look back♫

574
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,130
♫The past is mottled with old memories♫

575

♫I am lucky to have you by my side♫

576
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:32,080
♫From now on we'll let time pass♫

577
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:37,820

578
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,120
♫Through the night and day♫

579
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,610
Shao Cang!

580
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,990
Shao Cang, I know it's you!

581
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,740
Come out if you dare!

582
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,660
Be a man!

583
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,420
Ji Yang.

584
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,120
Don't come out.

585
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,850
Come out if you dare to!

586
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,610
Shao Cang!

587
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,010
Fine.

588
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,740
You forced my hand.

589
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,280
Nan Yan!

590
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,750
It's you.

591
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,440
Meng Zhiguang!

592
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,040
How dare you hurt the judicial elder

593
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,540
of the Great Path Sect?

594
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,080
Name the punishments you deserve!

595
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,870
Elder Zhu,

596
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,740
you're really quite thick skinned.

597
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,740
You broke into my sect looking for a fugitive,

598
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,710
but instead you attacked my disciples

599
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,970
while I was away

600
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,030
just because you couldn't find him.

601
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,370
I've already given the one at your sect

602
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,720
enough respect by not killing you

603
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,430
with a bolt of lightning!

604
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,100
It’s the Lunar Sect who

605
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,550
hid the fugitive first.

606
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,070
You deserved it!

607
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,470
What proof do you have?

608
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,750
Proof?

609
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,760
The proof is Ji Yang

610
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,330
hiding from us.

611
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,170
So Elder Zhu

612
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,320
did indeed find something suspicious.

613
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,980
I won't hide it then.

614
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,560
Wayward disciple Ji Yang, show yourself!

615
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,010
You're a spirit!

616
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,480
Wayward disciple!

617
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,920
Hurry up and

618
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,880
greet Elder Zhu.

619
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,800
Don't blame me for hijacking you here.

620
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,050
Help our sect get through this,

621
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,720
and I'll ensure your safety.

622
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,760
I, Ji Yang,

623
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,770
greet Elder Zhu.

624
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,250
Meng Zhiguang.

625
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,160
How dare you hide

626
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,520
a spirit in your sect

627
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,340
and fraternize with him

628
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,400
as the chief of your sect?

629
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,740
This fox spirit has always been a sick man

630
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,140
and has never done anything to harm anyone.

631
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,430
Because his illness is similar to her mother's,

632
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,960
Nan Yan hid him in her quarters

633
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,770
to test treatments on him.

634
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,950
I saw that he was inherently good at heart,

635
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,470
and that he had ideal physique for cultivation,

636
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,510
so I instructed him

637
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,710
a few times secretly.

638
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,890
Firstly,

639
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,270
he's not in our sect's register.

640
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:26,970
Secondly,

641
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,500
he has never had a disciple initiation ceremony.

642
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,030
I don’t believe this counts as fraternizing.

643
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,450
Like I'll believe you.

644
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,390
If you don't believe me,

645
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,580
you can search him.

646
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,730
I left him a note

647
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,820
I wrote personally

648
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,870
to prohibit anyone in the sect

649
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,570
to hurt him.

650
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,440
Someone!

651
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,090
Take the spirit back to our sect!

652
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:15,780
Hold on.

653
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,270
Elder Zhu need not concern himself

654
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,210
with our sect's internal affairs.

655
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,130
Step away!

656
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,490
If I have to report

657
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,990
even such a small thing as

658
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,390
keeping a spirit pet to the Great Path Sect,

659
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,760
will there be anyone who dares

660
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,830
to raise chickens and livestock in the Five States?

661
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,850
Moreover,

662
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,780
the spirits have been imprisoned for hundreds of years.

663
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,080
They are no longer a threat.

664
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,540
A little spirit like him is

665
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,940
as trivial as an ant.

666
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,550
I am merely

667
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,870
giving him a way out.

668
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,730
The Great Path has always lead with virtue.

669
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,690
Are you planning to eliminate all of them?

670
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,710
If there is nothing else,

671
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,580
please leave.

672
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,810
Fu Lang, see them out.

673
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,430
Elder Zhu.

674
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,750
After you.

675
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,770
Just you wait.

676
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,630
Don't let me catch hold of

677
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,690
any evidence against the Lunar Sect.

678
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,180
You two

679
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,740
take Nan Yan back to her room.

680
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,250
I'll be there soon.

681
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,100
Father.

682
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,830
Chief,

683
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,120
you were so impressive just now.

684
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,750
You beat

685
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,110
that Elder Zhu so coolly.

686
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,310
That's right, father.

687
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,070
This is the first time

688
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,130
I've realized that

689
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,600
you are so cool.

690
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,280
Who asked you to stand out just now?

691
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,390
Do you want to die?

692
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,240
I'm your daughter.

693
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,070
How can I stand down

694
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,530
at such a critical moment?

695
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,080
No, you should.

696
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,350
Don't try to act brave anymore.

697
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,670
You scared me to death.

698
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,190
Father!

699
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,170
Chief!

700
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,760
Make me a pot of soothing tea.

701
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,090
Let me calm myself down.

702
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,260
Be careful.

703
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,270
Be careful, Chief.

704
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,470
Don't worry.

705
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,430
She will be fine.

706
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,840
But it's strange.

707
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,370
By right Nan Yan

708
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,700
shouldn't even have learnt

709
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,160
how to start cultivating,

710
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,270
but when I checked her spiritual chamber

711
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,800
I found that she has almost cultivated a core.

712
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,610
Maybe that's why the Celestial Lightning of Truth

713
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,570
did not hurt her foundation.

714
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,410
She'll be fine after taking some pills

715
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,670
and resting a few days.

716
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,480
Thank you

717
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,980
for helping me today.

718
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,580
I will never forget

719
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,230
your protection.

720
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,030
Please stop.

721
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,290
I do not dare to accept a bow from you.

722
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,550
If you really want to kill all of them,

723
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,200
are you also going to see Nan Yan

724
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,930
getting hunted by the Great Path Sect

725
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,730
for the rest of her life and never get peace?

726
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,949
No matter who comes to attack,

727
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:11,940
I have to protect her.

728
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,690
Even if you can protect her now,

729
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,460
can you

730
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,780
be by her side forever?

731
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,960
If anything happens to her,

732
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,750
can you

733
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,610
take the responsibility?

734
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,400
Shao Cang,

735
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,750
is that you?

736
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:26,060
You'd better show yourself.

737
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,909
Otherwise,

738
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,790
don't blame me for what I'll do.

739
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,239
If you show up now,

740
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,699
Nan Yan will have suffered for nothing.

741
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:39,750
If you trust me,

742
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,940
stay here.

743
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,110
I will have a way.

744
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,469
Nan Yan.

745
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,530
Nan Yan has suffered because of me

746
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,010
and nearly died.

747
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,750
Thank you for helping her in my stead.

748
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,010
Lord Shao Cang is welcome.

749
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,190
I'm just someone with very little influence.

750
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,050
I'm satisfied

751
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,740
if I can just play mahjong all day

752
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,070
and win a few more times.

753
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,800
But if,

754
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,740
someone dares to hurt my disciples,

755
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,250
I'll risk my life

756
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,430
rather than do nothing.

757
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,830
Don't worry, Chief Meng.

758
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,630
I will leave immediately

759
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,830
and never step foot into Lunar Sect again.

760
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,120
Lord Shao Cang understands where I come from.

761
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,960
That’s great.

762
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,540
Everything started because of me.

763
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,150
Nan Yan suffered too much for me,

764
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,040

How can I be at ease

with someone like you near her?

796
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,080
I suddenly realized

797
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,510
when the Great Path Elder

798
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,590
came to search for the fugitive that

799
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,690
maybe that person

800
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,140
really is Lord Shao Cang?

801
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,410
You think too much.

802
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,690
What if it's really him?

803
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,250
Chief,

804
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,600
should we conduct a thorough search again?

805
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,990
Why do you have so many what ifs?

806
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,050
This thing is over.

807
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,500
Don't mention it again.

808
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,810
I'll take my leave then.

809
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:17,730
Hold on.

810
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,720
I haven't finished asking you questions.

811
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,850
You said that someone hidden hurt you.

812
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:22,930
What's the matter?

813
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,710
I think it's most probably because

814
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,430
you ruined Nan Yan's climbing fig

815
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,250
and was taught a lesson

816
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,070
by the fox spirit, wasn't it?

817
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,990
It's not like that.

818
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,350
At that time I—

819

Do you really think that

820
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,800
I see nothing

821
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,080
just because I usually

822
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,140
turn a blind eye?

to settle the score just as it started.

what do you mean by this?

843
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,270
You lured the Great Path Sect here

844
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,070
