[Love's Rebellion]

[Episode 25]

4
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,740
Come!

5
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,509
I'll avenge Chief Meng!

6
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,980
Yan.

7
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,650
You want to leave?

8
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,350
Get lost!

9
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,030
Kid,

10
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,500
you can't escape.

11
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,829
Take charge of the Youquan Prison,

12
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,060
and sacrifice for my great cause!

13
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:10,930
Yan.

14
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,400
Farewell.

15
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,190
Ji Yang.

16
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,640
He's trying to conquer the Youquan Prison.

17
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,310
He's just seeking death.

18
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,380
You are able to summon the power of Chong Ming.

19
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,700
How are you related to Nan Rao?

20
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,570
Rao.

21
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,980
Why does she have the Blood Phoenix Hairpin?

22
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,880
It's you.

23
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,820
The power of Yin Zhu,

24
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,650
sought by all yet unattainable.

25
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,610
Now I can see why.

26
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,240
Bloody-handed Asura.

27
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,590
I had my eye on you

28
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,380
for a long time.

29
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,560
Ji Yang.

30
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,460
Nan Yan.

31
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,920
The power of the Evil Lord

32
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,350
is far scarier than you think.

33
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,670
Your soul

34
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,950
can't control it,

35
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,710
and will only

36
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,960
be corrupted by it eventually.

37
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,960
This old man

38
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,160
can only help you this far.

39
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,180
Chief.

40
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,670
Don’t waste your energy.

41
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,260
All these years,

42
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,850
I've dreamt about them

43
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,900
questioning me every night.

44
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,929
And today,

45
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,430
I finally have a chance to atone for my sins.

46
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,570
Though

47
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,890
I can never make up for my wrongs,

48
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,400
at last,

49
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,120
I might get

50
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,200
a good night's sleep

51
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,250
for once.

52
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,320
You two work well together, don't you?

53
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,040
Again!

54
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,060
My ancestors,

55
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,510
I'm here to release the fox clan from imprisonment.

56
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,240
Please give me your blessings.

57
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,970
Fox spirit, you dare to open the array

58
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,690
without permission?

59
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,530
You'll exhaust your lifespan doing so.

60
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,810
With my bloodline,

61
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,440
I call upon my kin.

62
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,350
Where do their spirits reside?

63
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,850
Lead me to them.

64
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,190
Open!

65
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,940
I'm exhausted.

66
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,950
When I say it's a killing move,

67
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,090
it is a killing move.

68
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,430
I'll never admit defeat.

69
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,400
I'll grind you down if I have to.

70
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,910
The array gate is about to close.

71
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,150
If he doesn't come out soon,

72
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,610
he'll be trapped forever.

73
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,560
It's bad.

74
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,600
Oh no.

75
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,940
Little Fox!

76
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
I'm coming!

77
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,970
It's done.

78
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,230
[Chief of the Fox Clan] [Fox Empress]

79
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,570
Ya'er.

80
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,390
Sister.

81
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,030
Sorry to keep you waiting.

82
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,950
You...

83
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,740
Sister.

84
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,670
Don't worry.

85
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,920
I'm very lucky.

86
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,120
But for now,

87
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,010
we need to leave immediately.

88
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,370
I only have 30 minutes,

89
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,390
and you can't travel freely

90
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,360
as a soul.

91
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,090
Hurry!

92
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,760
Little Fox!

93
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,090
Come out!

94
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,660
Little Fox!

95
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,400
We'll die together if we must!

96
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,570
Thanks to the ancestors.

97
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,590
Little Fox!

98
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,960
Big Brother!

99
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,550
Hurry!

100
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,950
Little Fox.

101
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,870
We might not

102
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,690
make it out of here.

103
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,540
Sorry.

104
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,920
It's all because I'm useless.

105
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,490
I've…

106
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,140
I've failed you.

107
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,720
Big Brother!

108
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,340
Big Brother! Big Brother!

109
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,430
Open!

110
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,690
Seven tails?

111
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,150
Little Fox.

112
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,900
You've ascended!

113
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,190
I, Nan Yi, will put on

114
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:12,680
the shackles of the Great Path

115
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,210
for releasing the fox clan,

116
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,349
but since I have decided to let them go,

117
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,900
I will protect them to the end.

118
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,450
Stubborn as always…

119
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,250
Senior.

120
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:36,940
It's you guys again.

121
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,160
I was wondering who was shouting here.

122
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,240
It turns out it was you losers.

123
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,470
This little fox spirit's powers

124
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,550
are remarkable.

125
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,110
You even managed to mislead the guardian of the array

126
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,540
and the Young Dragon Lord

127
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,110
to commit such treachery.

128
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,570
Everything I did was on me.

129
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,470
It has nothing to do with them.

130
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,070
Don't.

131
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,510
I'll admit

132
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,760
whatever crime you're accusing me of.

133
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,530
Since we're family,

134
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,080
we should share

135
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,550
our burdens.

136
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,470
Pardoning the fox spirit on your own accord

137
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,230
is a crime of treason.

138
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,180
Today, I'll enforce the punishment on behalf of Elder Premier.

139
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,640
Form the array!

140
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,610
This is the secret technique of the Great Path,

141
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,880
the Sky Severing Boundary.

142
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,910
But these shackles

143
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,150
have bound most of my spiritual power.

144
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,150
I can only fight back with a barrier.

145
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,820
Form!

146
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,780
Nan Yi is my old friend.

147
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,590
He’s kind and gentle.

148
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,190
Though he's committed a terrible deed,

149
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,920
it wasn't from his true nature.

150
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,690
If you insist on punishment,

151
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,220
I am willing to bear it.

152
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,900
I dare not.

153
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,170
This kid

154
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,540
has great courage.

155
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,920
You're indeed a master of the world.

156
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,030
You're a wise man.

157
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,940
Trespassing the Spirit-Sealing Formation

158
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,870
is indeed intolerable by our sect.

159
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,720
However,

160
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,990
since the fox clan has been released,

161
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,800
I believe

162
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,500
the Master of Endurance

163
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,560
is willing to vouch for the your clan.

164
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,790
Looks like the Premier's divination methods

165
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,030
have attained a level of mastery.

166
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,440
Even I,

167
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,910
can't hide from your divine eyes.

168
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,130
Master.

169
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,890
Little Fox.

170
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,920
Since when did you join the Beggar Sect?

171
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,920
There’s a fine place

172
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,830
beneath Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea.

173
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,460
I will take charge of

174
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,400
settling them and teaching them our ways.

175
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,320
No one from Great Path

176
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,060
shall touch the fox clan from now on.

177
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,320
Anyone who violates this order

178
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,320
will be executed.

179
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,000
Yes!

180
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:30,870
Yes.

181
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,420
What about the other spirits?

182
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,560
The 100 years are up.

183
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,210
They're still imprisoned.

184
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,170
The emergence of Sen Luo

185
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,300
is not just a rumor.

186
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,920
The Youquan prison had been unsealed.

187
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,910
If the spirits come out now,

188
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,050
I'm afraid Sen Luo will take advantage of the chaos.

189
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,600
Once the matters with the demons are quelled,

190
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,800
the Great Path will fulfill its promise to open the array.

191
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,770
Nan Yi.

192
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,850
Let's play a tune together sometime.

193
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,090
Thanks to your help this time,

194
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,640
I was able to lead my clan

195
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,470
out of the Spirit-Sealing Formation.

196
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,130
We're finally able to reunite

197
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,850
after a hundred years of separation.

198
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,840
Master,

199
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,190
please accept my bow of gratitude.

200
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,530
I've told you once,

201
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,430
once you attain the true teaching

202
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,320
you may step forward to challenge it.

203
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,420
This is all ordained by destiny.

204
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,800
I merely offered a small assistance.

205
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,350
Since you have entered my realm,

206
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,900
I will not stand idly by

207
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,370
and do nothing.

208
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,220
In the past, I showed disrespect

209
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,510
and rudeness towards you.

210
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,640
Please forgive me.

211
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,340
Yes.

212
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,270
A true master cannot be judged by appearances.

213
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,920
We were foolish not to see your greatness.

214
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,410
We shouldn't have called you a beggar.

215
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,850
I didn't say that!

216
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,210
[Order]

217
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,830
Thank you, Uncle, for risking your life to open the array.

218
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,100
I, Yin Ya,

219
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,350
will never forget

220
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,280
your kindness and your deed today.

221
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,340
Since I'm your uncle,

222
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,640
the fox clan is also my family.

223
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,140
Saving our own family

224
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,900
is the natural thing to do.

225
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,750
Yes.

226
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,690
Young Lord Mu,

227
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,230
Shouldn't you also be taking care

228
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,990
of your own family's business?

229
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,630
Yes.

230
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,330
Of course.

231
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,010
That is why I'm planning to go with you

232
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,900
to Sorrow Mountain and Brahma Sea

233
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,430
to help settle the fox clan.

234
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,590
That's not what the Master meant.

235
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,790
The Dragon Lord.

236
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,080
[Order]

237
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,510
Oh no!

238
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,190
This is bad.

239
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,670
My dad must've known that

240
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,510
I haven't been managing the whaleboat

241
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,240
for the time being as promised.

242
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,380
He must be trying to scold me

243
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,710
and force me to return for a match-making.

244
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,280
Over the past 100 years,

245
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,910
I've hoped many times

246
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,000
that my family

247
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,400
can scold me once again.

248
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,320
Fine.

249
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,070
[Order]

250
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,970
Young Lord,

251
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,360
please hurry back.

252
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,610
The Dragon Lord

253
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,000
is gravely ill.

254
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,820
Don't worry about the fox clan.

255
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,750
I'll come to Dragon Capital to find you

256
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,340
once we are done settling down there.

257
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,860
Okay.

258
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,500
I'll take my leave then.

259
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,480
Why hasn't she woken up?

260
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,920
I've already given her some medicine,

261
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,820
but she was pierced by Yin Zhu

262
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,410
and her spiritual power was absorbed.

263
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,230
It will take her time to recover.

264
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,930
I don’t care what you have to do

265
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,710
you must save her.

266
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,550
Although I learned the healing arts of the Evil Path

267
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,900
under the threats of my brother,

268
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,100
I only know enough to barely stop

269
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,100
his leg affliction from worsening.

270
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,940
Her injuries from Sen Luo are severe.

271
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,920
I can only do my best.

272
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,780
I can't accept

273
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,030
anything happening to her again.

274
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,880
This is all my fault.

275
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,640
Miss Nan Yan's injury

276
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,480
is too severe.

277
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,490
I'm afraid that

278
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,710
ordinary medicine

279
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,040
can only show little effect.

280
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,350
You have a way?

281
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,160
Make sure she continues taking the medicine.

282
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,110
I'll leave now.

283
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,640
Your brother's body

284
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,970
is still hidden in the stone in the forest,

285
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,000
isn't it?

286
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,040
The Evil Path has committed evil deeds

287
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,500
and has made many enemies.

288
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,410
Do you want to guess

289
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,910
what they will do with his body?

290
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,230
Don't.

291
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,910
There is indeed a prescription in the book,

292
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,340
but the catalyst is rare.

293
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,590
The elixir crafting process

294
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,450
is extremely harmful to the body.

295
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,160
At the peak of the Yin time during midnight.

296
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,230
the celestial herbs in the mountain that grow amongst

297
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,230
the spiritual aura will gather dew.

298
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,900
♫The lonely seabed♫

299
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,460

304

The dew of the celestial herb

00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,240
is a rare treasure,

306
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,420
just like you are to me.

307
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,510
I wonder what more

308
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,460
I can do for you.

309
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,180
At the zenith of noon,

310
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,630
with the dew collected at the peak of Yin,

311
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,870
combined with the sun’s brightest light as the catalyst,

312
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,520
and one's own flesh as the vessel,

313
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,100
you can brew an elixir of heaven and earth’s essence.

for the prescription.

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,050
It was my brother

348
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,710
who made you and Miss Nan Yan fall off the cliff,

349
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,440
and nearly got you guys killed.

350
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,030
What he did was indeed unforgivable,

351
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,800
but that was because he was in a demonic state.

352
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,870
He ended up not only hurting himself,

353
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,990
but also you.

354
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,820
Have you ever tried

355
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,450
to disperse your demonic powers?

356
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,180
Brother.

357
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,020
Are you practicing

358
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,320
the Soul Transference Technique?

359
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,240
Are you trying to stop me?

360
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,180
Brother!

361
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,080
Brother, what's wrong with you?

362
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,930
I see fear

363
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,550
in your eyes

364
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,830
Are you afraid of me?

365
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,430
I've become this state,

366
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,270
only because of you.

367
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,260
Do you think

368
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,800
I'm scary now?

369
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,840
Brother.

370
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,000
It's me, Li Mian.

371
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,350
Brother, wake up.

372
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,730
It’s me.

373
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,260
Wake up.

374
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,390
I'm Mian.

375
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,150
Brother.

376
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,640
I'm Mian.

377
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,870
I'm Mian, brother.

378
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,310
Mian!

379
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:55,920
Mian!

380
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,990
What’s wrong?

381
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,030
Brother.

382
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,980
You've entered a demonic state just now.

383
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,160
Didn't I tell you

384
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,190
not to come near me

385
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,610
when I'm cultivating?

386
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,670
Brother, I'm begging you.

387
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,440
Please, brother, stop.

388
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,950
If you continue with this practice,

389
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,740
it will drain your lifespan.

390
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,230
What will happen to me

391
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,510
if you’re gone?

392
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,750
It's okay, Mian.

393
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,870
Don't cry.

394
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,390
I won't die.

395
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,750
No matter what happens,

396
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,300
I will stand in front of you

397
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,010
and protect you forever.

398
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,740
Mian,

399
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,040
it’s just that

400
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,400
you are

401
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,710
too soft and kind.

402
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,580
I can protect you for a lifetime,

403
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,560
but I can't always

404
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,390
by your side all the time.

405
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,430
So...

406
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,060
You must learn to be strong,

407
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,740
okay?

408
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,780
Even if one day

409
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,350
I’m not here anymore,

410
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,450
you must be able to protect yourself.

411
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,710
No.

412
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,630
There's no "even if."

413
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,870
I don't want to hear about any "even ifs."

414
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,960
I don’t want you

415
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,760
to leave me.

416
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:08,969
No.

417
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,480
Be good.

418
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:12,179
I will never

419
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,280
leave you.

420
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:33,880
Mian.

421
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:34,639
No!

422
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,590
-Mian.
-Brother.

423
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,190
-Look at me, Mian.
-Brother.

424
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,159
Look at me.

425
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,139
Listen,

426
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,080
Li Mian!

427
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,050
Listen to me carefully.

428
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,850
From now on,

429
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,840
whether I'm by your side or not,

430
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,620
you have to remember that

431
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,420
tears are useless.

432
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,740
You have to protect yourself

433
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,010
and be strong.

434
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,910
Brother.

435
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,410
I have to become stronger.

436
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,280
Only by getting stronger can I protect you.

437
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,820
Only by getting stronger…

438
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,030
Can I protect you.

439
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,370
I’ve advised him countless times

440
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,170
to stop.

441
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,950
Since he first practiced

442
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,240
demonic arts,

443
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,920
he has gradually gone mad

444
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,350
until he eventually killed the leader of the Evil Path

445
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,410
and took his place.

446
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,220
From that moment,

447
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,840
I knew he could never turn back.

448
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,720
People always desire to become stronger,

449
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,710
and are willing to sacrifice everything for it

450
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,950
if they seize the chance to.

451
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,670
Just like the Sen Luo remnants in your body,

452
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,760
it can push you

453
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,030
beyond your limits,

454
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,430
and get you addicted to the power,

455
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,490
until you are lost.

456
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:18,090
You'll get addicted, do you understand?

457
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,390
It will be impossible

458
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,930
to resist it.

459
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,890
But the consequences are all our own.

460
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,500
The death of Huo Wuji

461
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,030
and Miss Nan Yan's injury,

462
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,110
were all Sen Luo's doing.

463
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,750
It has nothing to do with you.

464
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,830
Sen Luo is in my body.

465
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,880
It is still related to me.

466
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,830
I can't lie to myself either.

467
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,690
As long as Sen Luo remains,

468
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,290
Nan Yan will always be

469
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,520
in danger.

470
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,810
He's the Demon Lord.

471
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,180
Are you sure you want to fight him?

472
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,190
Worst case scenario, I'll just die together with him.

473
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,320
It's not like I haven't done it before.

474
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,640
I advised my brother

475
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,330
to give up his demonic powers.

476
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,600
He always told me

477
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,730
that it's his fate to do so.

478
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,930
That he can't fight fate.

479
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,210
If you really ware to fight it,

480
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,850
I really want to see with my own eyes

481
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,050
if fate can really be defied.

482
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,170
Tell me.

483
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,120
What do you need me to do?

484
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,470
Take care of Yan for me for a few days.

485
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,140
Aren't you going to wait for her to wake up before you leave?

486
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,360
Forget it.

487
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm afraid I'll change my mind

488
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,470
after she wakes up.

489
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,760
The Sword Sect won't even let us in.

490
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,270
Don't talk nonsense.

491
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,000
Every sect has their own rules.

492
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,190
What rules?

493
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,840
Looking out for prisoners?

494
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,240
Greetings, Sword Master.

495
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,650
Please rise.

496
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,520
[Chief of Sword Sect] [Meng Xiaolou]

497
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:41,970
Have a seat.

498
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,540
Chief Meng.

499
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,550
Our Sect has faced danger.

500
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,340
My father founded the Lunar Sect in the North.

501
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,000
Our sect is not large

502
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,880
as we only sought for peace

503
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,560
for the rest of our lives.

504
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,940
Unfortunately, the demonic cultivators raided us and killed everyone.

505
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,110
No one was able to escape.

506
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,670
If it weren't for the Bloody-handed Asura

507
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,600
who came to help,

508
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,940
Senior Fu Lang and I

509
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,980
wouldn't be here to seek help.

510
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:16,600
What about

511
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,110
the Blood Phoenix Hairpin?

512
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,520
It has been stolen by the demonic cultivators.

513
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,310
The hairpin

514
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,030
belongs to an old friend of mine.

515
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,920
I have been

516
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,260
out of touch with her for a long time.

517
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,370
I have another request

518
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,050
that I hope you will grant.

519
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,670
Say it.

520
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,120
I wish to become your disciple

521
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,790
to learn your demon killing techniques

522
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,850
to avenge my father

523
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,680
and my sect.

524
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,620
Taking revenge

525
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,620
is a dangerous path.

526
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,030
Are you certain?

527
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,070
Yingying,

528
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,410
The Sword Master has a point.

529
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,670
About taking revenge—

530
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,490
I have made up my mind.

531
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,550
If something happens,

532
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,290
I will face my father

533
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,840
in the underworld.

534
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,950
Please accept me as your disciple.

535
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,790
Will the Sword Master

536
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,650
please take us as your disciples.

537
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,450
Rise,

538
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,740
and follow me.

539
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,880
Is it still not working?

540
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,390
Master, even you can't

541
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,400
help my clansmen

542
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,430
to transform their spiritual form?

543
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,150
If they could enter another's state of mind,

544
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,190
it would accelerate their transformation.

545
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,390
But still,

546
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,730
this can only be practiced by the Fox Empress.

547
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,350
I will do my best

548
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,920
to summon her,

549
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,990
and let her accelerate the transformation

550
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,590
of your clan's cultivation.

551
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,960
Is that you?

552
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,080
Sister.

553
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,400
Ya'er.

554
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:37,810
I'm back.

555
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,330
Sister.
