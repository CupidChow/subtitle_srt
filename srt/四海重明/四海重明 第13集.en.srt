[Love's Rebellion]

3
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,650
[Episode 13]

4
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,750
The terrain here is so complicated.

5
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,560
How did you find me?

6
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,930
Come with me.

7
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,650
No wonder no one

8
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,800
uses this shortcut.

9
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,330
I never thought

10
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,210
there'd be monsters in the river.

11
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,080
Stinky fox!

12
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,300
Look at you.

13
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,840
You heartless fox.

14
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,910
How can you leave Lunar Sect

15
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,870
without a word?

16
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,259
How did you find me?

17
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,590
Tracking talisman?

18
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,520
Turns out Lord Shao Cang

19
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,610
was so reluctant to be separated from me.

20
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,390
I just asked you

21
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,449
to explore the way.

22
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,900
You've been standing still for so long.

23
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,400
Why didn't you go into the water?

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,590
I'm a terrestrial creature raised by Qingqiu,

25
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,960
not an aquatic beast that traverses the East Sea.

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,020
Practice

27
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,130
makes perfect

28
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,760
for floating on water.

29
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,030
If you can't overcome

30
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,990
your fear,

31
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,110
let me,

32
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,060
a frequent swimmer of the East Sea,

33
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,030
give you a kick.

34
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,760
Don't!

35
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,410
Don't you dare.

36
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,590
The dark river is unfathomable

37
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,720
and has many beasts.

38
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,650
If I sink into the river,

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,710
I'm afraid even my bones

40
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,829
will be devoured.

41
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,750
Let's not take the waterway.

42
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,950
Let's go another way.

43
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,560
It's too late.

44
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,350
I have a way to cross the river.

45
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,500
Come, give me a hand.

46
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,430
You two,

47
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,760
take this tree

48
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,650
down first.

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,370
Let me do it.

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,080
You haven't recovered from your heart disease.

51
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,880
Don't use your spiritual power.

52
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,720
You only care about

53
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,420
Lord Shao Cang.

54
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,100
But you don’t know

55
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,380
I've been living outdoors

56
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,340
and homeless,

57
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,090
so I can't carry heavy things.

58
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,120
Besides,

59
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,079
my hands

60
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,380
are weak and limp.

61
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,030
I wonder

62
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,470
what old illness it is.

63
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,030
Do you want me to

64
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,400
perform acupuncture on your skull again?

65
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,760
Nan Yan.

66
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,190
Why do you want

67
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,150
this dead wood?

68
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:48,829
Look at it.

69
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,030
It's high on both sides

70
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,280
and caved in the middle,

71
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,790
perfect for people to sit in.

72
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,320
Doesn't it look like a boat?

73
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,610
Does... it?

74
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,430
Yes.

75
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,340
It's very similar, isn't it?

76
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,510
As expected, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.

77
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,370
He agrees with whatever she says.

78
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,440
I've thought about

79
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,290
making a boat to cross the river.

80
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,990
But the danger of the dark river

81
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,550
is not only the rapid currents

82
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,270
but also...

83
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,000
Countless ferocious beasts.

84
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,370
I considered that too.

85
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,409
Look.

86
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,280
What's this?

87
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,240
It smells so bad.

88
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,190
Something to

89
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,990
make you invincible, of course.

90
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,570
This is...

91
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,630
This is Five-Poison Spiritual Juice.

92
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,159
It's a preventive measure.

93
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,909
Five-Poison Spiritual Juice.

94
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,310
Five-Poison Heart Pill.

95
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,670
How many

96
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,470
five-poison things do you have?

97
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,150
I'm steeped in the five poisons

98
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,270
and cruel.

99
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,830
You refused to acknowledge your family

100
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,030
and went against the righteous path.

101
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,710
We're

102
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,050
really compatible.

103
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,320
What a perfect match.

104
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:07,890
Nan Yan.

105
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,790
Looking at the boat,

106
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,680
I doubt it can

107
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,710
fit the four of us.

108
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,860
Find more then.

109
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,010
Sister.

110
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,650
Can I ride with you?

111
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,550
No.

112
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,930
Why?

113
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,330
She's allergic to fox fur.

114
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,230
Wait.

115
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,340
You're abandoning me like this?

116
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,560
As they say,

117
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,790
your character is influenced by the company you keep.

118
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,190
My kind Ji Yang and Nan Yan

119
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,430
must've been led astray

120
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,440
by you.

121
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,600
Have you thought

122
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,659
of the possibility

123
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,530
that they were

124
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,640
evil to begin with?

125
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,540
Nonsense!

126
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,780
Don't slander my brother and sister.

127
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,370
You treat them as your brother and sister,

128
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,170
but they think of you as a burden.

129
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,390
I still don't want to

130
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,090
share a boat with you.

131
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,470
Why don't you look at

132
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,840
your heavy arms, belly,

133
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,020
and legs?

134
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,950
I'm afraid the boat will capsize in the dark river.

135
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,670
I'm afraid of your stinky fur!

136
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,430
How about this?

137
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,960
We each find a piece of wood

138
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,910
and go our separate ways.

139
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,430
Sure.

140
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,910
The one who breaks the promise

141
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,890
is the dog.

142
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,050
Deal.

143
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,270
By the way,

144
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,740
you haven't told me

145
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,930
how you found me.

146
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,520
Seal of Romance.

147
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,280
Seal of Romance?

148
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,410
♫I'll hold it up for you♫

149
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,200
♫Even if it rains heavily♫

150
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,240
♫The blurry world is now clear♫

151
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,610
♫I won't give up♫

152
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,190
♫I'll protect you♫

153
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,960
I found it first. Let go.

154
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,520
No, I pulled it out first.

155
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,530
Let go.

156
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,230
Will it respond if you call it?

157
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,670
Why not?

158
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,150
Tree!

159
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:51,950
See?

160
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,730
Besides,

161
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,750
this tree is hollow

162
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,190
and straight in the middle, without branches.

163
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,630
I fell in love with it at first sight.

164
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,340
This tree

165
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,880
is beautiful and elegant.

166
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,010
It must be fated with my previous life.

167
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,790
Let me tell you.

168
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,320
This

169
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,420
is not a solution.

170
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,190
Look at the surrounding area.

171
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:16,830
I guess there's

172
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,760
only one piece

173
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,920
of useful dead wood.

174
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,350
How about this?

175
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,480
Let's work together

176
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,070
and carry it to the river.

177
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,790
If you can't hang on halfway,

178
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,050
you can let go anytime.

179
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,920
The one who lets go first

180
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,700
is the dog.

181
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,230
Stinky fox.

182
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,030
You can't win me, so you're playing dirty

183
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,460
and pulling me with your tail?

184
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,760
Retract your tail.

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,470
I'm busy right now.

186
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,190
If I'm pulling you, I'm the dog.

187
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,910
Dare you say

188
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,230
you didn't pull me with your tail?

189
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,350
I didn't even extend out my tail.

190
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,390
How can I pull you?

191
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,310
Are you done?

192
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,070
What are you talking about?

193
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,720
Why are you...

194
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,620
You...

195
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,500
This...

196
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,490
The elders in the clan said

197
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,500
the pagoda tree is evil.

198
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,500
It can harbor vengeful spirits.

199
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,460
Help!

200
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,580
Then...

201
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,720
you found me so quickly

202
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,030
because

203
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,230
my mother planted in you

204
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,430
this Seal of Romance?

205
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,210
Yes.

206
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,920
How long have you had

207
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,310
this Seal of Romance?

208
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,320
To be honest,

209
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,450
it should be for a long time.

210
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,420
A long time?

211
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,620
Why didn't you tell me?

212
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,110
You didn't ask me.

213
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,150
If it's been long,

214
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,400
have you heard all the bad things

215
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,850
I said about you?

216
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,070
I didn't just hear them.

217
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,510
They're unforgettable.

218
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,910
With the Seal of Romance,

219
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,150
you know what I think and feel

220
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,260
in a glance.

221
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,460
But I don't know

222
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,750
what you're thinking.

223
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,880
This is unfair.

224
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,170
I can't agree with you on this.

225
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,400
Your mother

226
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,790
made a brilliant move.

227
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,910
Then why did my mother

228
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,150
plant the Seal of Romance in you?

229
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,010
When parents love their children,

230
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,710
they'll makes plan in advance.

231
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,110
Your mother

232
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,870
should've long known

233
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,930
she couldn't be with you much longer.

234
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,210
She was afraid

235
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,070
you'd be devastated.

236
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,720
So she'd long decided on who to entrust

237
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,080
with the seal.

238
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,690
So that deep in the night,

239
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,770
you won't be alone,

240
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,140
and in times of peril,

241
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,190
someone will protect you.

242
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,430
Have you

243
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,490
ever regretted it?

244
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,070
I'm glad

245
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,520
I was chosen.

246
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,540
This is a spiritual vine.

247
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,900
It withers without water and prospers with water.

248
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,510
We are entrapped.

249
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,910
Our lives are not in danger,

250
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,060
but we can’t escape.

251
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,270
Can't my poison do anything to it?

252
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,460
It's scratching an itch through a shoe.

253
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,880
I was careless

254
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,930
and chose this spiritual tree.

255
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,380
It's not your fault.

256
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,930
I think it's a good choice.

257
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,430
How is it good?

258
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,380
It's so tight that I can't breathe.

259
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,060
Help!

260
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,600
Wait, what do you want?

261
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,470
We're good people.

262
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,750
Don't do anything stupid.

263
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,510
You took

264
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,290
my sister's Marriage Tree,

265
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,370
and now you want to steal mine?

266
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,310
In that case,

267
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,180
you can only

268
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,090
stay and keep me company.

269
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,710
Who will the sisters marry?

270
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,770
Did the parents return home?

271
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,350
It's her?

272
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,690
Chop my Marriage Tree

273
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,260
and die together.

274
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,520
Sister!

275
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,820
If you eat humans,

276
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,840
eat him first.

277
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,150
We're both spirits.

278
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:58,750
We

279
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,020
shouldn't hurt family.

280
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,390
Right?

281
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,070
Nonsense!

282
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,680
Now she's your family?

283
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,690
You stinky fox.

284
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,590
Do you call every woman

285
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,530
who can beat you up viciously

286
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,260
your sister?

287
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,600
I'll tell Nan Yan later.

288
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,760
At the brink of death,

289
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,260
there's nothing

290
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,260
I can't call her!

291
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,790
My sister told me

292
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,590
if I can't meet the fated one,

293
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,440
I've to stay

294
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,350
at this Marriage Tree.

295
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,170
But

296
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,550
you both touched my Marriage Tree.

297
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,870
So you must both be my fated ones.

298
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,390
Does she want

299
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,900
to have multiple lovers?

300
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,250
I don't want to compete with you for this.

301
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:37,520
Miss.

302
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,320
Miss. Miss.

303
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,180
Listen to me.

304
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,470
I'm the Young Dragon Lord of the East Sea.

305
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,330
If you let me go,

306
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,150
I can give you whatever

307
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,950
jewelry and treasures you want.

308
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,650
Money is an external possession.

309
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,380
I never cared for it.

310
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,230
Then what do you want?

311
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,320
Tell me!

312
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,390
What would

313
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,510
make you let us go?

314
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,490
Chop my Marriage Tree

315
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,120
and die together.

316
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,390
Dead bones lonely for long;

317
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,110
leave lovers undisturbed.

318
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,650
Dressing up at dawn and dusk;

319
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,110
solitary grave unattended.

320
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,190
Who will the sisters marry?

321
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:19,830
My mother?

322
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,150
Focus.

323
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,590
Don't be bewitched by it.

324
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,970
Dressing up at dawn and dusk;

325
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,250
solitary grave unattended.

326
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,920
Who will the sisters marry?

327
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,710
Did the parents return home?

328
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,850
Dressing up at dawn and dusk;

329
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,150
solitary grave unattended.

330
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,010
Nan Yan.

331
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,740
Nan Yan.

332
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,650
Wake up.

333
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,020
Who will the sisters marry?

334
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,070
Did the parents return home?

335
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,320
Stop singing.

336
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,510
Your soul will be stolen

337
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,710
and be reincarnated.

338
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,380
Chop my Marriage Tree

339
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,680
and die...

340
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,240
♫I weave through the crowd♫

341
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,770
♫Rain passes by, leaving traces♫

342
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,820
♫How lucky I am to meet you♫

343
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,690
♫There is endless scenery to be seen♫

344
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,160
♫There are too many topics to talk about♫

345
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:53,500
♫I'll be with you until it's sunny♫

346
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,100
Did I

347
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,910
scare her just now?

348
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,710
Why are you laughing?

349
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,609
I'm laughing at how

350
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,230
you'd have this day too.

351
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,050
What do you mean?

352
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,980
You didn't scare me just now.

353
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,690
I know

354
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,750
you did it to save me.

355
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,300
She can hear my thoughts now?

356
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,510
You're right.

357
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,560
My mother's Seal of Romance

358
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,510
is indeed a stroke of genius.

359
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,040
The Seal of Romance will allow telepathy when you fall in love

360
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,570
and erase all your memories when you break up.

361
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,890
Experience

362
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,550
the beauty of it yourselves.

363
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,670
The Seal of Romance's planted

364
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,600
in her too?

365
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,750
Is it because we just...

366
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,380
The beauty of it...

367
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,840
My Lord.

368
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,790
I've also

369
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,690
deeply felt

370
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,390
the beauty of it.

371
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,710
♫When I'm with you♫

372
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,650
♫It becomes clear♫

373
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,650
♫I'll hold it up for you♫

374
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,600
♫Even if it rains heavily♫

375
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,470
♫The blurry world is now clear♫

376
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,860
♫I won't give up♫

377
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,700
♫I'll protect you♫

378
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,720
Leave lovers undisturbed?

379
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,050
Are you two lovers?

380
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,730
-No.
-No.

381
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,170
Sister.

382
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,400
What was that?

383
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,310
Since you aren't fated in this life,

384
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,350
let's make a contract

385
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,910
to meet in the next life.

386
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,210
Goodbyes are inevitable.

387
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,710
In the next life,

388
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,690
you'll be a married couple.

389
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,470
Wait.

390
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:42,970
Wait.

391
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,040
Wait.

392
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:45,830
Help!

393
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,470
No!

394
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,210
No!

395
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,990
No!

396
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:48,970
Help!

397
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,060
I...

398
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,350
Help!

399
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,440
Help!

400
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,190
Wait.

401
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,760
How did we agree to be

402
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,090
a married couple in the next life?

403
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,390
Couldn't you just

404
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,410
take one for the team and be that vengeful spirit's lover?

405
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,950
Why didn't you do it then?

406
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,070
Don't you call yourself the Big Brother?

407
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,720
You should get

408
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,050
married first.

409
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,610
Wait, didn't you say

410
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,400
you're both spirits and family?

411
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,270
Then you

412
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,550
should've gone first.

413
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,180
I...

414
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,190
Why did you two

415
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,690
arrive earlier than us?

416
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,990
We paid

417
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,310
an unexpected price.

418
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,720
A price?

419
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,800
What price?

420
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,400
Did you two also...

421
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,190
You too?

422
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,420
We...

423
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,750
I-If I remember correctly,

424
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,370
it should be this way.

425
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,240
Once you get the Snow Branch,

426
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,970
leave Filth Valley right away.

427
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,800
Don't worry.

428
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,750
I'm with Nan Yan.

429
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,410
I'll protect her at all costs.

430
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,530
Little Fox.

431
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,910
Take good care of Lord Shao Cang.

432
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,950
If you dare harbor ill intentions,

433
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,350
I'll skin you.

434
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,600
I don't need you to tell me that.

435
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,430
Why did they leave

436
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,890
without saying anything?

437
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,210
Wait for me.

438
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,940
Remember your promise.

439
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,800
I know.

440
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,790
Know what?

441
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,030
Get out of here alive and meet outside the valley.

442
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,890
What else?

443
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,780
I'll accompany you to the street market,

444
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,270
check out Treasure Pavilion,

445
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,400
watch puppet shows,

446
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,300
and ask the question I want to.

447
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,740
As a monarch,

448
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,400
you must keep your word.

449
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,000
Of course.

450
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,100
My Lord.

451
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,190
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

452
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,240
Once you enter the inner area,

453
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,790
it's a life-and-death situation.

454
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,910
Being lovestruck

455
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,870
will only affect your speed of drawing the sword.

456
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,620
Want to test it out?

457
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,890
It's just...

458
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,400
It's just a friendly reminder.

459
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,830
Must you draw your sword?

460
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,390
Let me make it clear beforehand.

461
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,200
Once we find

462
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,250
Seven Sins Manual,

463
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,440
we'll fight for it fairly

464
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,640
without resentment.

465
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,610
You overestimate yourself.

466
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,060
Buddy,

467
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,960
let me ask you.

468
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,570
Does Dragon Lord

469
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,110
know your young lord is inside?

470
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,340
Of course.

471
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,020
Why else would he stay here?

472
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,430
How is he

473
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,830
feeling right now?

474
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,870
I'm not sure.

475
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,000
He's been sipping

476
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,630
on a cup of tea the entire day.

477
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,250
It's all my fault

478
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,270
for not stopping Young Dragon Lord.

479
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,520
Great.

480
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,060
His father is here now.

481
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,160
If anything happens to him,

482
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,980
what should I say?

483
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,500
Who are you?

484
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,070
Lunar Sect's chief, Meng Zhiguang.

485
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,470
Greetings, Dragon Lord.

486
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,110
What's the matter?

487
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,370
Please have mercy.

488
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,150
I know my measly Lunar Sect

489
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,080
isn't fit to accept a talent like him.

490
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,630
But despite trying time and again

491
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,470
to stop him,

492
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,390
the young lord still insisted on

493
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,580
training in my sect.

494
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,240
I'm a nobody,

495
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,800
so I didn't dare reject him.

496
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,410
So it's you

497
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,240
who hid my son in your sect.

498
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,990
I had to comb the five states

499
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,000
to find him.

500
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,840
Please calm down, Dragon Lord.

501
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,820
You've got some nerve.

502
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,590
This is the letter of guarantee

503
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,390
Young Lord Mu wrote.

504
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,030
Please take a look.

505
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,490
I'm fully responsible

506
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,940
for my safety.

507
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,190
If you want to kill or punish anyone,

508
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,100
come at me.

509
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,590
Written by Zhanting.

510
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,000
That's it?

511
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,910
I'm sure

512
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,190
he wrote it.

513
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,210
Everything I've said is true.

514
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,000
You've personally come to

515
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,270
take Young Lord Mu back to Dragon Capital.

516
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,190
If you teach him well,

517
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,630
he'll

518
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,550
definitely become

519
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,720
a great cultivator.

520
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,050
Him?

521
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,910
Young Lord Mu is straightforward

522
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,240
and noble in character.

523
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,740
But right now,

524
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,100
he's young, energetic, and rash.

525
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,840
Given time, through trials and tribulations,

526
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,040
he'll definitely make you proud.

527
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,510
Do you really think so?

528
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,390
Of course.

529
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,920
Like father, like son.

530
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,930
You're a legendary hero.

531
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,070
How can Young Lord Mu

532
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,130
not take after you?

533
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,530
In my opinion,

534
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,270
this trip to Filth Valley

535
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,790
came just in time.

536
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,320
Maybe your son will have

537
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,720
a fortuitous encounter.

538
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,890
Fortuitous encounter?

539
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,030
I'd be grateful if

540
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,390
he didn't go astray.

541
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,090
Don't worry, Dragon Lord.

542
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,420
I have faith in your son.

543
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,360
Why is it so cold?

544
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,560
Since it's suddenly so cold here,

545
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,750
it must be here.

546
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,740
It should be.

547
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:04,790
If I'd known,

548
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,830
we should've each grabbed

549
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,630
a handful of fox fur to stay warm.

550
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,870
Just now,

551
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,610
what happened between you two

552
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,040
in the dark river?

553
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,270
What else?

554
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,190
Just like you.

555
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,070
Just like us?

556
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,660
Are you sure?

557
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,190
Didn't you encounter

558
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,190
something dirty?

559
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,270
Then entrapped by the spiritual vine?

560
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,270
In the end, you'd no choice

561
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:31,980
but to be together,

562
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,750
right?

563
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,730
We haven't

564
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,310
gone that far.

565
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,190
Are we talking

566
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,610
about the same thing?

567
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,830
Are you a little cold?

568
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:53,840
It's fine.

569
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,680
Watch me.

570
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,870
Why doesn't

571
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,800
my Sun Fire work?

572
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:13,790
It's okay, Brother.

573
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,520
I can bear it.

574
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,300
Let's gather herbs first.

575
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:16,830
Let's go.

576
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,480
Impossible.

577
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:21,990
Right.

578
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,960
What does Snow Branch

579
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,190
look like?

580
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,660
It's strange.

581
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,880
Other herbs

582
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,130
are recorded in detail

583
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,510
in Eternity Inner Canon.

584
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,160
Only this Snow Branch

585
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,350
has no details about its appearance.

586
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,440
Maybe...

587
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,300
Maybe no one's ever

588
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,320
picked it.

589
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,340
How mysterious.

590
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,450
Let's go over there.

591
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,590
Who did this?

592
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,750
The demons?

593
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,430
It was Yin Zhu.

594
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,590
It roams around

595
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,940
searching for its prey.

596
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,230
When it detects humans,

597
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,190
it will attack.

598
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,200
Once you're devoured,

599
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,100
you'll end up like this.

600
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,470
Luckily, you have

601
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,740
the silver mermaid pearl from Yan.

602
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,110
Otherwise,

603
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,600
it'd be hard to stay alive.

604
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,560
It should be here.

605
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,700
Wait for me!

606
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,220
Why is it getting colder?

607
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,630
This place is so eerie.

608
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:01,670
In my opinion,

609
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,140
it might as well be called Unlucky Valley.

610
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,730
It just feels like bad luck!

611
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,070
Is this beast holding back

612
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,330
some formidable move?

613
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,360
Listen!

614
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,600
Don't hurt my sister!

615
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,610
It seems

616
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,960
to be bowing to you.

617
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,380
Why does it

618
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,010
look like Lord Shao Cang?

619
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,240
So capricious.

620
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,150
A second ago,

621
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,210
it looked like it wanted to devour us.

622
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,840
I remember!

623
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,390
It's that...

624
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:26,970
It...

625
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,630
It...

626
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,980
Isn't it that...

627
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,800
That mythical magical beast, Fuzhu?

628
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,430
Four horns on its head,

629
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,080
and a body glowing with seven colors.

630
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,780
It must be it! It must be!

631
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,940
Is this magical deer

632
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,820
guarding the Snow Branch?

633
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,710
Let me try.

634
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,360
Precious little deer.

635
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,790
Tell me,

636
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,340
your big brother,

637
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,710
where the Snow Branch is at.

638
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,310
You startled me!

639
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,250
Wait.

640
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,110
Why does it only submit to you?

641
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,950
I'm the Young Dragon Lord.

642
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,570

Yes.

647
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,630

Judging from the sounds,

668
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,590
it's just two or three Yin Zhus.

to enter the inner areas.
