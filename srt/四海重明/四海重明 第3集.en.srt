[Episode 3]

4
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,530
This formation...

5
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,410
Does it mean to kill?

6
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,840
Why would the formation stop working?

7
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,430
Oh no! I gotta run!

8
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:34,200
You were using me to kill her

9
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,930
so you could escape.

10
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,610
How vicious.

11
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,070
It hurts!

12
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,220
Lord, please spare my life!

13
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,750
Lord, please spare my life!

14
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,270
T-There's another way

15
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,560
to alter hosts

16
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,760
without hurting others!

17
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,400
Say it.

18
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,130
G-Go to the Filth Valley

19
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,110
and find my older brother.

20
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,510
You have an older brother?

21
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,200
Yes.

22
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,950
There is something

23
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,300
that people don't know.

24
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,740
The Seven Sins Manual

25
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,340
actually consists of twin Talisman Genies.

26
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,590
The manual is made up of two parts.

27
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,470
Only when they are combined

28
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,170
can the effects

29
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,150
of purging demon and punishing the sinful be achieved,

30
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,070
But my brother and I

31
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,400
split up long ago.

32
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,630
I'm travelling around

33
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,070
while he is guarding the Filth Valley.

34
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,600
How dare you lie to me again.

35
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,420
I'm not lying!

36
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,630
If you tame my brother

37
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,670
when the valley opens up this year,

38
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,210
you'll get what you want!

39
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,300
After all,

40
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,230
comparing your and her qualifications to be hosts,

41
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,320
your spiritual power is much stronger than hers.

42
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
I'm sure you can get me out of her body

43
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,810
and help me and my brother reunite.

44
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,510
If you dare to lie to me again,

45
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll have you and your brother meet in hell.

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,770
If I lie to you again,

47
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,670
let me be stuck here forever

48
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,630
and never see the sun!

49
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,110
Why am I here?

50
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,390
Maybe you got too tired.

51
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,750
Just now,

52
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,270
you fainted.

53
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,510
I fainted?

54
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,440
Regular pace.

55
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,890
Not too light or heavy.

56
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,960
Not too slow or fast.

57
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,940
Not too strong or weak.

58
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,640
I shouldn't have fainted.

59
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,830
Maybe I've been too tired lately.

60
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,270
I'm busy trying medicine and cooking for you

61
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,700
all day long.

62
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,000
Listen,

63
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,080
I especially

64
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,300
made those three dishes for you

65
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,700
with the heart of a snake.

66
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,330
If you are to repay my kindness,

67
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,460
you'll eat them all.

68
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,080
Do not leave a piece behind.

69
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,620
You made a tincture out of the snake's main body

70
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,470
and three dishes out of its heart.

71
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,260
You had it all planned out.

72
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,270
Not a bit of the snake went to waste.

73
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,470
Amateur,

74
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,760
you don't get it, do you?

75
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,390
When I tried medicine on you previously,

76
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,060
I found you too weak to absorb nutrition,

77
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,710
so I cooked that snake's heart for you

78
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,040
to improve your health.

79
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,750
What's wrong?

80
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,140
Are you feeling unwell?

81
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,070
Seeing how reluctant you were to take medicine,

82
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,070
I was infuriated.

83
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,390
Okay.

84
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,990
I'll eat it later.

85
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,070
You must eat it.

86
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,230
Otherwise, next time

87
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,270
when I get angry,

88
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,909
I'll marinate a raw snake heart

89
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:56,610
and put it in your mouth

90
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,610
while you're ill.

91
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,170
Nan Yan, come out here!

92
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:01,720
Nan Yan,

93
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,270
come out right away!

94
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:02,740
You poisoner!

95
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,930
Yeah, come out here right now!

96
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,500
Come out!

97
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,330
You stay put.

98
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,450
Don't go anywhere.

99
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,470
Those are dangerous villains.

100
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,200
Don't you cause me any trouble.

101
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,100
I'm fine.

102
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:11,990
You stay here.

103
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,910
Now that the Seven Sins Manual

104
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,430
can't be acquired by force,

105
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,890
I might as well hide in here

106
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,070
to recuperate

107
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,330
till the Filth Valley opens again

108
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,970
for me to get the first half of the manual.

109
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,790
Stop pretending!

110
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,990
Come down here!

111
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,560
Come out!

112
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,270
Come out!

113
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,510
Keep yelling.

114
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,920
What new stunts

115
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,990
are you pulling today?

116
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,290
We'll apologize.

117
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,020
-Let's negotiate a truce.
-Fight me one-on-one.

118
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,540
Come back when you reach an agreement.

119
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,250
The chief told us to come

120
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,630
and apologize to you.

121
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,320
I see.

122
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,550
Today, you have no choice but to cave in.

123
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,880
Tomorrow, you'll continue to provoke me.

124
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,650
What about you?

125
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,320
It takes two to create a conflict.

126
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,180
Look, let's both take a step back.

127
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,510
From now on, we'll stay out of each other's business.

128
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,510
What do you think?

129
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,010
Now, it's your turn.

130
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,470
What on earth do you want?

131
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,230
Name a price.

132
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,990
How many spirit stones do I have to pay

133
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,110
in exchange for you leaving the Lunar Sect?

134
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,110
Plus, your mother

135
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,230
must leave my dad as well.

136
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,290
Meng,

137
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,630
is there some sort of misunderstanding

138
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,030
between you and your dad?

139
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,420
Don't even try to sweet talk me.

140
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,350
You don't want to leave, right?

141
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,760
Fine.

142
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,210
Keep your hands off of the poison

143
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,670
and let's have a match using the magic tricks we know!

144
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,200
Don't be afraid.

145
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,030
Meng, fight her.

146
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,470
Yeah.

147
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,470
What's the matter?

148
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,070
Yingying,

149
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,390
what happened to you?

150
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,830
I'm fine.

151
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,420
Poisoner,

152
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,070
did you poison her again?

153
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,840
Give me the antidote.

154
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,860
I didn't get poisoned.

155
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,690
I'm just feeling a bit unwell.

156
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,350
Don't you touch her!

157
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,710
S-S-She...

158
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,670
Her spirit veins are blocked.

159
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,340
Her aura and blood are stuck in the abdomen.

160
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,990
She must have secretly practiced

161
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,750
the pill-forming trick against the master's orders.

162
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,550
That's right.

163
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,080
I poisoned her.

164
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,490
There is no antidote to it.

165
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,950
She must have figured out the truth.

166
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,310
Whenever she misbehaves,

167
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,390
the poison will kick in.

168
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,430
She'll be in enormous pain,

169
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,830
and there won't be a cure.

170
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,900
Come on, sit down.

171
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,090
How dare you hurt Yingying!

172
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,240
I'll make you pay!

173
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,210
Chubby!

174
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,270
Come on.

175
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,650
Take two pills now.

176
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,990
Then the pain will go away.

177
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,630
She didn't reveal the truth.

178
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,760
Why would she...

179
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,830
I...

180
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,710
If this happens again,

181
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,710
you can ask me for medicine anytime.

182
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,920
This is for you.

183
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,410
Medicine testers.

184
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,860
Although she is loud and noisy,

185
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,940
she does excel in practicing medicine

186
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,210
and saving lives.

187
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,800
This is more like it.

188
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,560
Come on, let me feel your pulse.

189
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,710
This snake heart can produce great medical effects.

190
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,940
Right after I tried it,

191
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,100
I could feel my aura and blood circulated better.

192
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,760
He has eaten a whole plate of it

193
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,340
but his pulse feels the same as before. Why?

194
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,530
Were you really

195
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,280
being a good boy when you waited for my return?

196
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,830
You simply asked me to wait for you.

197
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,690
You didn't tell me to be a good boy.

198
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,270
What?

199
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,390
Am I wrong?

200
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,410
It doesn't matter now.

201
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,430
If needed,

202
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,510
I'll give you a larger dose next time.

203
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,470
Those who betray the Great Path

204
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,190
shall be held in the underwater prison of the Soul River.

205
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,920
Even if they manage to escape,

206
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,150
they can never get rid

207
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,810
of the smell of the Soul River.

208
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,600
So,

209
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,830
no matter who they are

210
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,580
or where they are,

211
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,530
the Candlelight Beetles can locate them

212
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,530
by following their smell.

213
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,750
The northeast.

214
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,750
Go!

215
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,390
Spiritual aura of five elements,

216
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,650
respond to my command.

217
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,470
Fire, show up!

218
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,550
Spiritual aura of five elements,

219
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,810
respond to my command.

220
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,230
Fire, show up!

221
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,870
Nothing happened.

222
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,870
Where is the fire?

223
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,560
Are you

224
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,870
trying to start a fire to make pills?

225
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,270
What do you know, amateur?

226
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,990
To make pills with fire,

227
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,650
controlling flames is the most important part.

228
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,340
There isn't any flame here.

229
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,940
And you're talking about controlling flames?

230
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,970
Easy for you to say.

231
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,530
Do it if you know how to.

232
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,870
Baffled, aren't you?

233
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,390
Now, if you admit

234
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,310
you're unable to do it,

235
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,710
you can save yourself from embarrassment.

236
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,360
So noisy.

237
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,760
Do you even know how to do this?

238
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,690
I'd like to give it a try.

239
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,130
Search carefully.

240
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,270
If any situation comes up,

241
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,600
report it immediately.

242
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,550
Go!

243
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,600
Stop acting the hero if you can't do it.

244
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,140
As a patient,

245
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,320
you should stay relaxed.

246
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,350
The fire's big enough, right?

247
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,070
My heart-protecting pills!

248
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,230
You might get burned!

249
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,190
If you don't want to help,

250
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,200
just back off.

251
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,150
Why do you have to stir up trouble?

252
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,960
My mom has to take this medicine

253
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,110
on time every month.

254
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,250
It allows no delay!

255
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,470
Watch out!

256
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,110
Silver mermaid pearl?

257
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,280
What is her real identity?

258
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,350
Why does she have the devil-repelling

259
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,950
treasure of the spirit clan?

260
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,030
What are you doing?

261
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,390
Fortunately, the fire died out quickly.

262
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,120
Don't worry.

263
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,210
The pills are fine.

264
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,070
Practicing medicine and cooking pills require great caution.

265
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,750
Besides,

266
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,630
in the furnace,

267
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,270
there are the precious heart-protecting pills.

268
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,380
Two pills in total.

269
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,770
One is for my mom,

270
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,120
and the other is for you.

271
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,710
Elder,

272
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,830
the Candlelight Beetles reacted as usual.

273
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,900
I'm afraid

274
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,260
there aren't traces of Shao Cang

275
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,270
in the Lunar Sect.

276
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,450
All disciples,

277
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,000
assemble in the square now!

278
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,430
What happened?

279
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,670
Stop staring at it.

280
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,200
It's none of your business.

281
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,960
Come with me.

282
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,680
Get in there.

283
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,550
What do you want this time?

284
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,710
To cure your heart disease,

285
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,960
pills aren't enough.

286
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,190
Acupuncture, medicinal cuisine, and herbal steam baths

287
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,150
are all essential.

288
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,950
Just hop in it.

289
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,670
This is unnecessary, is it?

290
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,890
Unnecessary?

291
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,890
Am I the doctor,

292
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,860
or are you?

293
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,790
Get in it now

294
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,030
and have a nice steam bath.

295
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,560
I need to go to the square now

296
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,510
to get something done.

297
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,470
Before I come back.

298
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,530
you must stay here.

299
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,790
Miss!

300
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,100
Is there room for negotiation?

301
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,210
Do you need me

302
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,560
to carry you into it?

303
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,670
No need.

304
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,510
I'll get in it myself.

305
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,110
Candlelight Beetles...

306
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,000
The people of the Great Path have come here.

307
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,110
What has happened?

308
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,630
What is going on?

309
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,190
What's up?

310
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:55,750
What is this about?

311
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,570
I don't know.

312
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:57,870
Senior,

313
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,040
what happened?

314
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,670
Let's go check it out.

315
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,270
What's going on?

316
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,200
Hurry up. Hurry.

317
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,990
Go there.

318
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,590
Coming right up.

319
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,520
Come here. Come.

320
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,800
What is this about?

321
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,880
I don't know.

322
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,180
Hurry up!

323
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,240
Lord Shao Cang

324
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,160
defected to the North.

325
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,910
Just now, some people from the Great Path came here to look for him.

326
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,520
It means this traitor

327
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,390
is hiding in the Lunar Town.

328
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,150
To avoid any trouble,

329
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,590
from now on to August 17th

330
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,250
when the Filth Valley closes,

331
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,890
you must not leave the mountain without permission.

332
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,620
We can't leave the mountain...

333
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,820
You came from nowhere.

334
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,790
You should at least tell me, namely your landlord,

335
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,310
about your story, right?

336
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,440
What kind of story do you expect?

337
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,900
I can make one up right now.

338
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,850
Make up a story now?

339
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,120
You're very defensive.

340
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,140
Are you

341
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,590
hiding a secret?

342
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,550
Watch out!

343
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,119
Were the sparkles just now

344
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,849
used by the Great Path to search for that man?

345
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,569
Is he the Lord of the Great Path?

346
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,640
Lord Shao Cang indeed came to the North.

347
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,670
Moreover,

348
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,940
let me repeat this.

349
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,020
The disciples of the Lunar Sect

350
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,390
can't take in anyone without permission.

351
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,990
According to the sect rules,

352
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,010
disciples who ignore that ban

353
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,310
will be expelled.

354
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,170
If you notice anyone suspicious,

355
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,670
tell me immediately.

356
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,180
Do you hear me?

357
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,240
Yes.

358
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,150
Yes.

359
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,800
She's the most suspicious one.

360
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,670
It really is her fault.

361
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,750
Her room is a mess.

362
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,800
Maybe someone's hiding there.

363
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,930
Someone's hiding there?

364
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,060
Who's hiding there?

365
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,770
The Lord of the Great Path?

366
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,030
That makes sense.

367
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,240
Hold on. Hold on.

368
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:56,910
My gosh.

369
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,830
One by one,

370
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,410
accusing without any evidence.

371
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,870
What proof do you have?

372
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,480
Newcomer?

373
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,130
it's none of your business.

374
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,510
We have no proof.

375
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,510
So what?

376
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,910
It's a small sect.

377
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,070
But it has many

378
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,670
scumbags.

379
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,740
You're dead!

380
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:25,950
Watch out!

381
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,330
He…

382
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,200
Newcomer,

383
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,590
don't you know the rules?

384
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,190
Wait.

385
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,910
You're from the Dragon Capital of the East Sea?

386
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,650
I won't lie about who I am.

387
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,950
I'm Mu Zhanting

388
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,350
from the Dragon Capital of the East Sea.

389
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,270
Mu Zhanting?

390
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,590
Was the fire you used just now

391
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,750
the Sun Fire?

392
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,470
Good. You're not totally clueless.

393
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,000
The Sun Fire

394
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,230
was created by Dragon Lord Mu Guanghan.

395
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,790
He won't teach it to an outsider.

396
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,390
Did you steal his technique?

397
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,660
Nonsense.

398
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,870
If he hadn't forced me,

399
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,400
I wouldn't have learned it.

400
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,350
Wait.

401
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,020
Wait.

402
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,540
Is the Dragon Lord in question

403
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,030
Mu Guanghan, the only man

404
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,990
who can rival Ying Zewei,

405
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,030
the premier of the Great Path?

406
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,670
Mu Guanghan?

407
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,790
Mu Zhanting.

408
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,760
The Dragon Lord is your…

409
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,160
Let me make it clear.

410
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,190
I've long cut ties

411
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,230
with my father.

412
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,410
You're the Young Dragon Lord?

413
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,600
Is he really Mu Guanghan's son?

414
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,630
No wonder he's so arrogant.

415
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,630
The Young Dragon Lord.

416
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,760
Why is he here?

417
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,530
Young Dragon Lord.

418
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,990
Please wait.

419
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,470
Don't call me that.

420
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,680
Just call me Mu Zhanting,

421
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,840
or Mighty Dragon.

422
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,590
Mighty…

423
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,270
Mighty Dragon?

424
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,860
A grand name, right?

425
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,830
My pen name.

426
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,950
My name is Nan Yan.

427
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,640
Thank you

428
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,480
for earlier.

429
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,550
It's nothing.

430
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,630
I just can't stand those people

431
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,090
making wild accusations.

432
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,070
Do you

433
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,830
know

434
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,310
Lord Shao Cang?

435
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,080
You have no idea.

436
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,590
I don't just know him.

437
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,710
Do you know

438
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,910
what he looks like?

439
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,540
He…

440
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,110
He is nine feet tall,

441
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,610
as robust as a mighty ox.

442
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,360
With his iron countenance and bushy beard,

443
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,310
broad eyebrows and wide face,

444
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,910
it can be said that

445
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,390
he can settle the universe and vanquish evil spirit

446
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,790
with just his face.

447
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,350
Nine feet tall,

448
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,330
as robust as a mighty cow.

449
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,710
Iron countenance and bushy beard.

450
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,750
It can't be him.

451
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,450
I see.

452
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:12,950
Young Lord.

453
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,990
Why is that smoke

454
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,730
coming from your head?

455
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,190
You mean this?

456
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,190
It's an old problem.

457
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,830
I was born with an abundant and fiery power.

458
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,420
After the Sun Fire,

459
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,510
the residual warmth takes a while to fade away.

460
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,440
I'll be fine after a night's sleep.

461
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,950
Here, try this.

462
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:34,990
Eat it.

463
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,480
Just eat.

464
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,750
What is this? It tastes good.

465
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,910
Fermented pollen with dried earth dragon.

466
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,870
It can clear your heat,

467
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,070
and is good for your health.

468
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,870
Really?

469
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,070
How do you feel?

470
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,320
Amazing.

471
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,550
What are all those self-proclaimed

472
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,690
medical sages and immortals

473
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,820
in the Dragon Capital actually worth?

474
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,110
What kind of dragon

475
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,120
is the earth dragon?

476
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,410
I've never heard of it.

477
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,590
Earth Dragon.

478
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,250
They are known as earthworms.

479
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,950
Fairly good.

480
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:25,800
Very...

481
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,310
Young Lord.

482
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,770
Are you alright?

483
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,230
You're so well-behaved.

484
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,930
I'll treat you to a nice dinner this evening.

485
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,650
How's this?

486
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,710
Truly a relief.

487
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,730
You were in such a hurry.

488
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,350
Did anything happen?

489
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,590
Nothing.

490
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,860
Some people in the Sect suspect

491
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,030
that I hid someone.

492
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,920
It seems that

493
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,510
we must say goodbye now.

494
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,120
Don't go.

495
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,390
Stay here peacefully.

496
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,470
I have my ways to handle this.

497
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,030
I won't let anyone

498
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,790
drag you out.

499
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,190
Just stay here.

500
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,370
Aren't you afraid that

501
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,450
I might cause trouble for you?

502
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,350
Doctors are with compassionate hearts.

503
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,630
Saving one is saving one.

504
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,590
If I can save a pair,

505
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,920
then I have to save both.

506
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,750
May I ask if Nan Yan resides here?

507
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,110
I know you've been enduring

508
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,970
for a long time.

509
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,030
Just hold on a little longer.

510
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:27,830
Just a little bit.

511
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,590
Come on.

512
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,390
One, two, three, go.

513
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,430
Here I am.

514
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,470
What's going on?

515
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,780
This is the consultation fee from earlier.

516
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,310
Just some pollen

517
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,470
and a dried earth dragon.

518
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,910
They don't cost that much.

519
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,040
That's not the case.

520
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,160
Those quacks in the East Sea

521
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,980
have no idea

522
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,710
how many rare medicinal herbs

523
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,170
they've forced me to take.

524
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,650
Not a single one is useful.

525
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,330
Just now, I took the medicine you gave me.

526
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,380
I suddenly felt

527
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,530
my whole body loosen up,

528
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,920
much more comfortable.

529
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,190
But

530
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,150
you had your episode

531
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,270
to save me.

532
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,950
We are even.

533
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,760
You alright now?

534
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,790
If there's nothing else,

535
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,120
then I won't see you out.

536
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,380
Is there

537
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,370
anyone else here with you？

538
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,060
Of course not.

539
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,430
Fine then.

540
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,270
Since you are so interested

541
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,330
in the Monarch,

542
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,270
I presume we're kindred spirit.

543
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,410
Let me tell you.

544
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,230
The reason I came all the way

545
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,790
from the Dragon Capital to the North

546
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,630
is actually

547
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,520
to find someone.

548
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,790
To find someone?

549
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,470
Could it be Lord Shao Cang?

550
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,560
Why are you looking for him?

551
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,560
He has fallen into the ways of demon.

552
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,470
What?

553
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,190
You don't believe in him either?

554
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,130
It doesn't count if I believe him or not.

555
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,200
Of course it does.

556
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,450
I came to you

557
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,910
because I saw you being framed

558
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,170
for hurting your peers

559
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,230
and depicted as heartless and cruel.

560
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,360
I thought you could empathize with it.

561
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,120
Just like me,

562
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,330
I believe that the monarch was wronged.

563
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,760
How do you know

564
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,390
it's not that he deserves it?

565
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,470
Don't tell me...

566
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,470
You have evidence?

567
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,400
Of course I have.

568
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,190
His handwriting,

569
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:14,820
his poems,

570
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,790
everything about him

571
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,030
is solid evidence.

572
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,510
That's it?

573
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,950
It seems you don't know.

574
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,520
Lord Shao Cang

575
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,080
is not only powerful,

576
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,940
it's only a matter of time before he can turn into a demigod.

577
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,580
Besides,

578
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,180
he's good at calligraphy

579
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,790
and talented at literature.

580
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,550
As the saying goes,

581
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,670
"The style is the man himself, and the poem shows his spirit."

582
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,310
If he really has evil intentions,

583
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,230
and he's so sinister

584
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,630
that he killed his people,

585
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,890
he surely couldn't...

586
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,150
He definitely couldn't...

587
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:44,950
He mustn't...

588
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,310
He definitely couldn't write

589
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,470
such passionate characters

590
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,370
and those

591
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,680
poems of pure clarity and understanding.

592
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,130
However,

593
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,380
it's too arbitrary

594
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,230
to judge

595
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,310
a man's character

596
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,990
based on his poetry and handwriting, isn't it?

597
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,990
Believe it or not,

598
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,510
I'll find him

599
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,030
and ask him about the ins and outs

600
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,510
to clear his name.

601
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:12,950
Okay.

602
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,590
Okay.

603
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,840
Since you trust me so much,

604
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,470
I'll trust you too.

605
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,290
But

606
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,590
there's something I don't understand.

607
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,310
Why did you come to the Lunar Sect

608
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,430
to find Shao Cang?

609
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,910
I heard that people from the Great Path Sect

610
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,640
hunted all the way to the North.

611
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,630
So I guessed that

612
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,870
after the monarch

613
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,200
was aggrieved

614
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,640
and desperate,

615
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,830
he heard that there were divine powers near the Filth Valley.

616
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,070
So he came here,

617
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,670
hoping to break through the realm

618
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,320
to protect himself.

619
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,480
I see.

620
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,670
You came to the Lunar Sect

621
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,470
because you wanted to go into the Filth Valley

622
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,580
to meet Shao Cang.

623
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,070
What's that sound?

624
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,230
Why is it still ringing?

625
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:55,710
It's poisonous!

626
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,240
It's poisonous!

627
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,060
Be careful.

628
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,150
It's poisonous!

629
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,750
-Where is it?
-It's poisonous.

630
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,260
No, I mean there is...

631
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,230
Well...

632
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,830
Inside there...

633
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,160
Yeah.

634
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,950
This is my medicine vat.

635
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,400
It's full of snakes, scorpions, and venomous insects.

636
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,330
A lot of poisons.

637
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,070
It's better to stay away.

638
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,470
It's better to stay away.

639
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,620
I understand.

640
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,040
It's just the issue about Lord Shao Cang.

641
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,250
Only both of us know about it,

642
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,350
I won't tell anyone else.

643
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,320
Don't worry.

644
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,970
Are you all right?

645
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,680
I won't see you off.

646
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm going back to my poison preparation.

647
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,430
Okay.

648
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,750
I'll take my leave first.

649
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,110
One day, when you have the chance

650
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,990
to meet the monarch,

651
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,050
you'll understand what I said today.

652
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,270
Goodbye.

653
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,030
What's wrong?

654
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,150
You'd...

655
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,350
better keep this.

656
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,030
Goodbye.

657
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,890
How is it? Are you okay?

658
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,610
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

659
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,780
If I did,

660
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,550
would you still do the steam?

661
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,270
You...

662
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,460
Take your time.

663
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,740
The food will be ready soon.

664
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,430
I'll go make dinner.

665
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,560
I'll go make dinner.

666
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,070
Young Dragon Lord, how dare you!

667
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,270
Why didn't you inform me in advance

668
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,360
before coming here?

669
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,970
Let me be prepared.

670
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,790
What if the Lunar Sect gives you a poor reception?

671
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,270
No, no.

672
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,510
Everything is fine. There's nothing wrong with the hospitality.

673
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,240
Okay.

674
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,670
Young Lord, there's something you don't know.

675
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,550
Lunar Sect is lack of sources.

676
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,310
The disciples are all self-taught.

677
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,770
I'm the only teacher here.

678
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,900
I usually spend most of my time

679
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,150
on the mahjong table.

680
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,750
It is really not suitable

681
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,030
for you to study here.

682
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,010
Why don't you go somewhere else?

683
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,410
It doesn't matter.

684
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,070
I'm just trying to get an identity

685
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,270
to practice in the Filth Valley.

686
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,670
I don't care about

687
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,150
the teaching resources.

688
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,240
Fine.

689
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,910
Since

690
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,590
you insist on staying,

691
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,070
can you promise me one thing?

692
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,000
Just say it, chief.

693
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,060
If...

694
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,700
I mean

695
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,350
if anything happens to you,

696
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,550
remember to

697
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,750
write a suicide note to the Dragon Lord in advance

698
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,550
to clarify that you signed your own death warrant

699
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,950
and it has nothing to do with the Lunar Sect.

700
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,310
My father doesn't care about me.

701
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,990
If I didn't run away,

702
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,990
I would've been beaten to death.

703
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,440
Your relationship

704
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,530
is so complicated.

705
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,140
What should we do?

706
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,670
Chief,

707
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:33,880
don't worry.

708
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,910
Although my father is unreasonable,

709
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,550
he knows right from wrong.

710
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,510
He always sides with outsiders

711
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,340
against me.

712
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,510
He blames me for everything.

713
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,970
He surely won't blame you.

714
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,680
To be safe,

715
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,680
we'd better put it in black and white as evidence.

716
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,950
Okay.

717
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,940
Give me a brush.

718
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,290
You saved someone before,

719
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,720
but they framed you for hurting your fellow disciples.

720
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,050
Why didn't you explain?

721
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,480
If I explained,

722
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,810
would they believe me?

723
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,750
But, it's hard

724
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,100
to live as a black sheep.

725
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,790
You think it's hard

726
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,110
because

727
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,930
you care about your reputation.

728
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,150
But to me,

729
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,320
reputation is neither food

730
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,610
nor medicine.

731
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,050
It's meaningless.

732
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,890
I'm surprised you're so aware of that.

733
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,360
You're insightful.

734
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,730
If you don't understand,

735
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,830
it means you are very lucky.

736
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,310
Because

737
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,730
you haven't met the thing

738
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,860
that you'd rather be cursed

739
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,510
to surmount all difficulties

740
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,770
and go all out

741
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,160
to accomplish it.

742
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,950
The premier has ordered.

743
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,720
The rebel, Shao Cang,

744
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,880
has gone astray

745
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,590
and killed his fellow disciples.

746
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,280
I've been practicing for years,

747
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,240
but I failed to live up to the expectations of my master.

748
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,460
The Five-Poison Heart Pill on the wall

749
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,470
matters the most for you, right?

750
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,430
To be honest,

751
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,520
I'm here to learn alchemy.

752
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,630
I make medicine and poisons here all day long

753
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,710
just for one thing.

754
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,150
It's to cure my mother's heart disease.

755
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,680
You're quite filial.

756
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,030
Don't worry.

757
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,990
God will take care of you.

758
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,000
But,

759
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,820
you are indeed lucky.

760
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,470
You have a heart disease

761
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,800
just like my mother.

762
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,760
It doesn't make any difference

763
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,140
whether I cure

764
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,040
one person or two people.

765
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:31,860
Just take it

766
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,270
as a good deed for me,

767
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,790
picking herbs and treating people.

768
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,110
Who is her mother?

769
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,970
Why does she have the same heart disease as mine?

770
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,730
That's enough for today.

771
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,940
Rest early.

772
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:11,949
I...

773
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,530
I'll go and check

774
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,909
if the creeping fig is mature or not.

775
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,400
Greetings, senior.

776
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,050
I wonder why you asked me

777
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,070
to come over.

778
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,030
I want you

779
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,610
to have a drink with me.

780
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,000
How should I address you?

781
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,390
Drink it.

782
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,350
Clear Dew Sorrow.

783
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,280
Now you know who I am.

784
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,480
There are five demigods

785
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,630
in the world.

786
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,030
The premier of the Great Path Sect, Ying Zewei,

787
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,110
the master of the Dragon Capital, Mu Guanghan,

788
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,910
the swordsman of the Tianqiao Peak, Meng Xiaolou,

789
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,790
the Master of Endurance from the Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea,

790
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,510
and

791
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,470
Chief Nan Fang from the Yao Palace

792
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,590
who can brew the best wine, Clear Dew Sorrow,

793
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,050
in the cultivation realm.

794
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,270
Cut it out.

795
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,070
You people from the Great Path Sect

796
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,830
have got a nasty way of talking.

797
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,470
Why do you say so?

798
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,210
Do you think I can't tell

799
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,410
who your master is?

800
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,390
I wonder

801
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,590
how your master

802
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,590
could leave

803
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,190
such a talented disciple like you

804
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,310
in the Soul River.

805
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,470
Shao Cang sends regards

806
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,630
to Chief Nan Fang.

807
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,150
Candlelight Beetles

808
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,950
are like fireflies in appearance

809
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,610
but hunting dogs in behavior.

810
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,550
They go thousands of miles to chase after their prey.

811
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,680
They are poisonous.

812
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,070
Once bitten,

813
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,400
the wound is like a burnt mark

814
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,870
and its shape is similar to a spider web.

815
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:31,930
Watch out!

816
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,080
Don't tell me...

817
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,780
He's the monarch of the Great Path Sect?

818
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,460
I don't care about these formalities.

819
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,830
I didn't want to interfere

820
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,760
with you and the Great Path Sect.

821
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,810
But Yan saved you

822
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,990
and let you stay.

823
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,480
So I have to intervene.

824
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,860
Yan and I just met by chance.

825
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,050
We have nothing to do with each other.

826
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,600
Who are you trying to bluff?

827
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,800
Look at you.

828
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,380
All over your body

829
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,840
is covered with

830
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,270
the smell of Yan's herbs.

831
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,590
I've never seen her

832
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,670
spending so much money

833
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,940
on a stranger.

834
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,520
Yet you told me

835
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,850
you just met by chance?

836
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:26,880
Also,

837
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,870
you were driven into a corner

838
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,570
by the Great Path Sect.

839
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,950
But you still had the time

840
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,910
to help Yan deal with

841
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,990
the demons.

842
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,050
You call this "met by chance"?

843
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,670
Senior, I'm just...

844
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,510
Don't panic.

845
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,270
I'll read a fortune

846
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,290
for you and Yan.

847
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,910
Amazing.

848
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:22,790
An ill-fated relationship only takes a turn in desperate times.

849
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,510
Senior.

850
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,640
Why are these coins...

851
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,440
What is this?

852
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,030
It's called the Seal of Romance.

853
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,930
It comes from the ancient secret scriptures.

854
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,000
It's a vow of life and death between a cultivation couple.

855
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,130
It can't be resolved

856
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,520
until death.

857
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,520
I shoulder my own destiny,

858
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,510
and by no means do I seek help from others,

859
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,470
let alone the foreign objects.

860
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,870
It's not up to you to decide

861
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,320
whether your destiny

862
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,430
begins or ends.

863
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,390
Even if Yan is my daughter,

864
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,720
I can't decide her fate.

865
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,650
The Seal of Romance

866
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,810
is just to help you.

867
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,780
Senior.

868
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:16,830
Yan and I...

869
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,700
Senior.

870
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,890
Please take back the Seal of Romance.

871
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,910
A good relationship is easy to break, but an ill-fated relationship is hard to resolve.

872
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,950
You can't take a turn unless you're in desperate times.

873
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:39,880
From now on,

874
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,480
you are on your own.

875
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,450
By the way,

876
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,650
since it's a life-and-death vow,

877
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,120
you can't go against it.

878
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,440
If you and Yan are

879
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,950
ten miles apart in the future,

880
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,830
you will

881
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,270
die of an explosion.

882
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,440
Just kidding.

883
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,190
The Seal of Romance will bring you romance when you fall in love

884
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,720
and erase all your memories when you break up.

885
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,070
You'll see for yourselves

886
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,350
exactly how it feels.

887
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,920
The moon is high in the sky.

888
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,910
The God of Wealth is blessing me.

889
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,890
I'm going to make a fortune!

890
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,190
Remember what I said.

891
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,660
Take good care of Yan.

892
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,150
Chief Nan Fang intended to entrust Nan Yan

893
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,070
to me.

894
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,870
This is strange.

895
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,300
How many times have I told you?

896
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,230
You have heart disease. You can't drink.

897
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,790
I just took a sip.

898
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,310
I can't

899
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,270
stay with you forever.

900
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,150
Could it be...

901
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,970
Chief Nan Fang knew her hour of death was coming?

902
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,080
Yan knows nothing about

903
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,640
my identity and my past.

904
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,350
Don't mention it to her.

905
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,990
The less she knows,

906
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,350
the safer she will be.

907
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,750
It seems that Chief Nan Fang doesn't know that

908
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,920
the second half of the Talisman Genie

909
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,070
is on Nan Yan.

910
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,150
Fine.

911
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,070
I'll protect her for now.

912
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,550
After I get the whole Talisman Genie,

913
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,470
I'll leave.

914
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,400
Where have you been?

915
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:02,950
I just took a walk.

916
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:03,830
Took a walk?

917
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,990
Aren't you afraid of being discovered?

918
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,570
Discover what?

919
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,510
I mean

920
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,840
you were in

921
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,950
the Solar Sect in Xichuan.

922
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,880
But you suddenly came to the North.

923
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:19,990
Did you...

924
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:22,430
Did you make huge mistakes

925
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,220
before?

926
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:24,830
I'm now hiding you

927
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:25,940
in the sect.

928
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,870
If someone sees you,

929
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,790
I can't explain clearly to them.

930
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,480
Even if something really happened

931
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,150
in the Solar Sect

932
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,680
that involved human lives,

933
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,490
you're a kind doctor,

934
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,660
I guess

935
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,520
you won't turn away a dying man.

936
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,110
Let me take a look.

937
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:11,040
Why are you sighing?

938
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,590
Forgive my incompetence.

939
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,120
Although I'm a kind doctor,

940
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,250
I've used all my knowledge.

941
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,390
Your heart disease

942
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,650
is not getting better,

943
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,000
but even worse.

944
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,820
You were so confident back then

945
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,750
that I thought

946
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,510
you were the only one in my life.

947
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,710
Now it's only been two days,

948
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,170
and you're abandoning me?

949
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,640
Miss,

950
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:32,870
is it a bit hasty?

951
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:35,410
Previously,

952
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,190
I was just bluffing

953
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:38,670
to fool you

954
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:39,830
to stay.

955
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,110
If I leave now,

956
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,350
you have no one to test the medicine anymore,

957
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:46,610
what about your mother's heart disease?

958
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:47,790
My mother?

959
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,990
My mother?

960
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,550
God bless her.

961
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,220
Don't worry too much.

962
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:56,030
Now, the most important thing to you

963
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:56,830
is to save your life.

964
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,240
Don't waste time

965
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:59,230
because of me.

966
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:01,810
Come on. Go now.

967
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,190
But I believe in fate

968
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,150
the most.

969
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,830
Since God arranged for us

970
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:09,890
to meet each other,

971
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:12,230
no matter how many good doctors in other places,

972
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,550
I only trust you.

973
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,870
Your life is more important than the fate!

974
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,450
If anything happens to you,

975
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:20,890
I'll blame myself for it.

976
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:22,810
No need to be modest, miss.

977
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,230
It's my fault that I took in this man.

978
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:31,110
I invited my own trouble.

979
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,230
The Seal of Romance actually has an upside.

980
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:35,890
It enables me to read her mind.

981
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,800
Can she read mine as well?

982
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,110
Why is he so quiet?

983
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:43,790
Has he found out

984
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,930
I've realized that he's Shao Cang?

985
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:47,870
It seems like she can't

986
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,710
read my mind.

987
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,370
That's good for me.

988
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,620
Don't panic.

989
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:53,550
Oh, right.

990
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,320
I heard from Mu Zhanting

991
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:56,590
that the Dragon Capital of the East Sea

992
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:57,670
has many highly skilled doctors.

993
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:58,110
You can go there and...

994
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,440
I'm not going anywhere.

995
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,390
You should stay in the Lunar Sect

996
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:07,390
and treat me without worries

997
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:09,800
till

998
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,890
the Five-Poison Heart Pills are ready.
