4
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,030
What?

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,110
You're saying in three days,

6
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,110
Yin Zhu's power will explode again?

7
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,560
What if

8
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,980
he becomes a demon?

9
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
What will happen?

10
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,390
The Netherworld River will flow,

11
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,630
and he will arrive in the Netherworld Capital.

12
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,150
It would be exactly the same as Ying Zewei.

13
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,520
In three days,

14
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,080
blood moon will appear in the sky.

15
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,800
When the blood moon is consumed and the demonic star descends,

16
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,229
the five states

17
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,720
will be doomed.

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,690
He wouldn't do that.

19
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,060
This matter

20
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:00,830
is not up to him.

21
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,040
He did it for you.

22
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,310
He knows

23
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,180
a man with Seven Sins

24
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,610
will eventually die from backfire.

25
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,470
It can only be dissolved

26
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,020
with all of Yin Zhu's power.

27
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:17,910
So,

28
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,240
he took away Ying Zewei's

29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,780
Yin Zhu

30
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,740
to exchange his life

31
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,290
for yours.

32
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,829
The evil power of Seven Sins?

33
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,880
So he turned into a demon

34
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,780
for...

35
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,190
me?

36
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,540
Master.

37
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,860
Is there any solution to this?

38
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,390
Since he has made his choice,

39
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,700
there's no turning back.

40
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,730
We can only

41
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,430
kill him.

42
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,110
You want me...

43
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,890
to kill Ji Yang?

44
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,910
I disagree.

45
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,640
Me neither.

46
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,320
There must be another way.

47
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,450
This makes no sense.

48
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,329
There's no other way.

49
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,329
In the future, things that happen

50
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,410
will all be for today's calamity.

51
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,200
The calamity can be overcome,

52
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,960
but we can't go against the will of heaven.

53
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,540
This is an irreversible fate.

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,870
I can't do it.

55
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,170
Even if it's fate,

56
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,360
I can't do it!

57
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,800
Uncle...

58
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,420
If you were still here,

59
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,260
you would tell me

60
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,210
what to do.

61
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,909
Back then,

62
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,590
you killed the person you loved the most.

63
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,900
You said, if you could make the choice again,

64
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,970
you would risk your life to protect her.

65
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,770
But now...

66
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,380
I have no choice.

67
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,530
You're awake.

68
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,740

69
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,860
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,030
I hurt you just now.

71
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,730
It's fine.

72
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,210
As long as you're back.

73
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,610
Look at the sky.

The moon tonight

75
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,630
is so pretty.

76
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,230
To me,

77
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,870
the world is vast.

78
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,010
No matter when, where,

79
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,610
or why I leave,

80
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,590
I'm but a speck of dust.

81
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,850
All I care about

82
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
is you.

83

Then let the world hate me and scold me.

84
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,240
I'll go with you

85
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,630
to hell.

86
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,830
After we parted that year,

87
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,630
we each stepped on this tough path.

88

In the future,

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,400
as long as the moon

90
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,720
can be seen by the world

Don't be sad.

Don't be afraid either.

95
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,420
I'm afraid I'll regret it for the rest of my life

96
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,750
like my uncle.

97

Every day in the future

98
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,490

you will light a lantern for us.

Sir,

145
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,140
there's a taboo in our family.

146
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,370
We can't eat chickens and lambs.

147
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,510
What a pity!

148
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,230

a carefree childhood.

The mortal world is not like a cultivation realm.

156

We don't cultivate,

157

nor do we see longevity.

158

We just live a few decades.

It's all about

being happy every day.

161
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,250
My mother often said

162
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,020
such days are happier

163
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,920
than being an immortal.

164
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,890
Today,

165
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,510
let's ignore the immortals and demons

166
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,460
and be mortals.

How's that?

00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,110
Okay!

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,870
Come on.

179
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,400
Go ahead.

180
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,560
You missed. What a pity.

181
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,870
That's it for today.

182
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,870
-That's it.
-I didn't win anything.

183
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,130
Sir.

184
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,690
It's not dark yet. Why are you closing up?

185
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,510
Every time you come back,

186
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,770
you'd win my best treasures.

187
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,800
I'm closing up.

188
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,920
I won't play today.

189
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,920
Do I do it?

190
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,120
Sir,

191
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,080
have you played ring toss before?

192
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,780
No.

193
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,270
Try it.

194
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,910
Fine.

195
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,090
Come on.

196
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,650
-Which one do you want?
-I’ll take it.

197
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,580
The one in the middle.

198
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,690
Here, take it.

199
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,180
Toss it

200
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,650
at whatever you like.

201
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,550
If you manage to toss the ring onto it,

202
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,580
it's all yours.

203
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,220
Try the one above.

204
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,290
That little fox.

205
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,670
Amazing!

206
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,320
You're so amazing!

207
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,530
Are you sure you haven't played it before?

208
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,790
I'm telling the truth.

209
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,020
Brother!

210
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,230
I want that ball.

211
00:12:59,250 --> 00:12:59,940
That ball, right?

212
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,540
Yes!

213
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,310
Here.

214
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,600
The two of you are in cahoots!

215
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,660
So amazing.

216
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,370
Let's go!

217
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,220
Stop! Don't go!

218
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,390
Sir, I want that!

219
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,670
My ball!

220
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,720
Give me the ball!

221
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,640
That's mine!

222
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,630
Sir!

223
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,290
You can't go back on your word!

224
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,610
This outfit suits you well.

225
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,060
Let's buy one.

226
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,630
Sure.

227
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,720
Sir.

228
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,620
Sorry, madam.

229
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,520
The ready-made clothes are all sold out.

230
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,110
If you would like to order them now,

231
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,170
it will take three days

232
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,700
before you can pick them up.

233
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,190
Three days?

234
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,360
Yes.

235
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:32,810
It's okay.

236
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,120
I don't need it.

237
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,780
Let me take you to buy something.

238
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,480
Let's go.

239
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,450
What do you think?

240
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,450
Does it look good?

241
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,510
It's so pretty.

242
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,090
When I saw

243
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,220
this pair of earrings,

244
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,930
I knew it would look good on you.

245
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,650
What do you think?

246
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,650
Does it look good?

247
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,470
Yes.

248
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,750
I want to give you a portrait.

249
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,790
A portrait?

250
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,170
What's wrong?

251
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,950
I have something for you.

252
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,980
You remember?

253
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,230
I remembered everything.

254
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,560
From now on...

255
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,090
I'll hand my past,

256
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,780
present,

257
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,290
and future

258
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,710
all to you.

since I started my cultivation,

319
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,360
I only wished to help people,

320
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,000
demons,

321
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,880

324
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,980
I'd like to exchange it for

325

♫The past is mottled with old memories♫

349

♫I am lucky to have you by my side♫

May the five states be peaceful for a long time.

352
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,720
Yan.

353

♫From now on we'll let time pass♫

354

Second bow to our ancestors.

359
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,570
Yes.

360
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,570
I'll live a long, long life.

361
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,600
I'll watch you get married.

362
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:42,890
Mother.

363
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,350
You once said

364
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,990
you wanted to see me get married the most.

365
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,490

♫The impermanent years have never stopped♫

367
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,180
Mom,

368
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,060
♫We spend this lifetime hand in hand♫

369
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,740

♫Billions of light beams converge into a galaxy♫

371
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,130
Good relationships are easily broken,

372
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,120
and bad relationships can never be resolved.

373
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,180
Unless you're at your wits' end, let's never meet.

♫As long as you're by my side♫

379

Chief Nan.

380
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,520
You entrusted Yan to me.

381
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,520
♫Over the hills, seeing through the world♫

382

♫I'll hold your hand till we grow old♫

385
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,230
I'm willing to protect Yan

386
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,750
with my life.

387
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,640
We will both hold...

388
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,030
half of this comb.

389
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,400
From now on,

390
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,170
we'll live and die together.

391
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,130
We will live and die together.

392
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,810
In this life...

393
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,730
I couldn't bring you back onto the good path.

394
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,390
But if there's a next life,

395
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,030
I will find you

396
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,230
with the marriage engagement.

397
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,600
You can't escape.

398
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,110
At that time,

399
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,190
we can go home together

400
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,640
and live in

401
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,430
a square courtyard.

402
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,520
There will be a peach tree.

403
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,510
We won't go anywhere.

404
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,690
We will just live and die there.

405
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,430
Okay?

406
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:22,830
Yes.

407
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,590
It's them!

408
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,290
Senior.

409
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,330
Is the situation getting better?

410
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,240
The Heavenly Calamity

411
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,590
is about to begin.

412
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,350
Nan Yan!

413
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,060
[Three years later]

414
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,020
After that battle,

415
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,810
Shao Cang turned into ashes.

416
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,380
Nan Yan sacrificed all her cultivation

417
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,570
to destroy the three hearts

418
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,280
just for one person.

419
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,370
With the Nirvana spirit heart,

420
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,890
she resurrected.

421
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,580
With the Zen Heart of Brahma Bones,

422
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,600
she strengthened her foundation.

423
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,850
With the Heart of the Six Realms,

424
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,300
she cleansed the world of demons.

425
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,070
Since then,

426
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,510
the world reset.

427
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,900
She returned to her hometown

428
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,940
alone,

429
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,220
waiting for his return quietly.

430
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,470
Do you know?

431
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,130
Every time I gaze at the world,

432
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,470
seeing the bright candle lights

433
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,630
of your house

434
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,970
and your peaceful life

435
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,500
make me feel at ease.

436
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,810
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

437
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,130
It's lively all around.

438
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,570
Yan.

439
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,330
Why are you here?

440
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,870
I know you'd

441
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,420
prepare our favorite food.

442
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,760
Come on.

443
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,050
You're not busy today?

444
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,810
Though my sister gave me the position of

445
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,920
the spirit king to me,

446
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,730
causing me to be extremely busy everyday,

447
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,660
I will still spare time

448
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,240
to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival with you.

449
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,020
You're just here for the food.

450
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,880
Let me

451
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,330
open up the lid.

452
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,260
Without good wine and meat,

453
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,070
how can it be called hotpot?

454
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,350
Big Brother?

455
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,520
Big Brother.

456
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,790
Four legs are indeed faster.

457
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,700
In the blink of an eye,

458
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,840
he ran ahead of me.

459
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,610
This rascal.

460
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,380
Where are Nian and Mighty Dragon?

461
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,670
Tell me about it.

462
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,470
I

463
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,340
just put Mighty Dragon to sleep

464
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,020
and Nian kicked me out,

465
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,640
telling me to pay you a visit.

466
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,440
Here.

467
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,930
See what I brought you.

468
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,120
You published another poetry book?

469
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,330
First, there is Zhen Yuan, then there is the heavens;

470
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,600
he is more powerful than the heavens, the world, and the immortals.

471
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,840
The big brother is amazing at poetry;

472
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,580
the youngest always struggles to capture chickens for a feast.

473
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,159
It was published on 48 whaleboats

474
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,400
and is read throughout the five states.

475
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,320
Where's the second half of the poem?

476
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,050
That can

477
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,020
only be filled in by you.

478
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,989
Here.

479
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:42,150
Don't think about anything today.

480
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,780
Let's just be happy

481
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:44,570
and have fun.

482
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,310
Right?

483
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:45,850
Come on.

484
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,810
Let's get drunk!

485
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:47,920
Let's get drunk!

486
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,170
Here!

487
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,390
Sir.

488
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,050
