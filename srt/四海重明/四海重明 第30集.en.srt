Today,

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,780
I have another request.

6
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,760
What are you talking about?

7
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,170
A request, you say?

Your business is my business.

Just tell me.

I want you to

get me a jade amulet pass.

I want to participate in Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament.

13
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,550
Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament?

14
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,220
Weren't you planning to sit out?

15
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,820
Why did you change your mind?

16
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,789
Do you know that

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,470
in Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament Ground,

18
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,750
there is the Retrograde Bone-Deep Mirror?

19
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,479
I know.

20
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,640
The spiritual treasure of the Ten Percepts Mountain.

21
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,940
It is said that it can reveal matters of the past.

22
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,400
Is that what you're after?

23

I went to see Sword Master last night.

if I want to know the truth,

26
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,520
I can only enter

I'm looking for an enemy.

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,370

You really plan to take part?

33
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,150
Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament is extremely dangerous.

34
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,840
I heard that

35
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,150
every sect loses a few participants

36
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,130

So you're scared.

Who is scared?

39
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,230
I'm just not interested in being a monarch.

40
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,030
I could have used that time

41

I must attend Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament

Is there any other way?

59

00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,680
Why are you using tricks

178
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,830
like voice mimicry

179
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,810
to kill people?

180
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,260
My Lord... Let me explain.

181
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,050
There...

182
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,130
There are so many cultivators here.

183
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,200
Only a handful of them

184
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,930
can reach Shanhai's main hall.

185
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,390
There...

186
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,430
There are so many souls here.

187
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,290
I couldn't resist it for a moment.

188
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,860
So you tried to devour me?

189
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,970
This is really my first offense!

190
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,040
W-well...

191
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,000
Who would have thought that

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,860
I was unlucky and met you instead?

193
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,110
My Lord,

194
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,290
for the sake of

195
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,360
me helping you conquer

196
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,430
the Nine Calamities Sea last time,

197
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,100
please forgive me.

198
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,020
Find someone for me.

199
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,630
Who is it?

200
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,480
A descendant of Chongming.

201
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,250
Chongming Bird is the Supreme Lord of all spirits.

202
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,250
Is she also taking part in the tournament this year?

203
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,230
Find her for me

204
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,960
and take her as your master.

205
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,310
Keep her safe.

206
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,950
Do you want to see her?

207
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,670
I can give you directions.

208
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,090
If I want to see her,

209
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,350
why would I come to you?

210
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,800
You're right.

211
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,710
My Lord.

212
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,840
A fox in the north

213
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,060
is being chased by the silver silkworm.

214
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,700
It's too gamey for me, so I didn't eat it.

215
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,470
It gets very cold here at night.

216
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,230
Why don't you catch it

217
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,270
and make a fox fur coat for the mistress

218
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,210
to warm her up?

219
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,790
It'll show how caring you are.

220
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,220
Go now.

221
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,710
Trying to fool me with such lowly illusions?

222
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,890
You overestimated yourself.

223
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,190
These spirits

224
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,490
set traps with voices.

225
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,090
The moment your heart stirs,

226
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,910
she will take the chance

227
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,040
to devour your soul.

228
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,600
Was that your voice just now?

229
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,640
You hear the voice of the person

230
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,690
you desire the most.

231
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,110
Miss! Miss!

232
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,780
Miss.

233
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,030
She's the spirit lord!

234
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,280
My Lord sent me here.

235
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,950
Who are you?

236
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,380
I am the Earth Spirit.

237
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,620
This area...

238
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,380
I'm like a doorkeeper of sorts.

239
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,870
After the barrier was lifted,

240
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,170
My Lord ordered me

241
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,510
to serve you.

242
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,820
Him again?

243
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,510
Is she really a descendant of Chongming?

244
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,640
How could it be fake?

245
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,460
Why don't you release your blood

246
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,370
and let all the spirits in the Nine Calamities Sea

247
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,240
sense your spirit lord aura?

248
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,050
This way, they won't hurt you.

249
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,240
We are all spirits!

250
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
Spirits don't hurt fellow spirits!

251
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,320
If you keep chasing,

252
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,510
I'll kill you today!

253
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,090
Don't use your spiritual power.

254
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,850
If you don't move,

255
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,890
it won't hurt you.

256
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,590
Do you know what that is?

257
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,870
It looks terrifying, anyone would run from it.

258
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's go.

259
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,570
Wait.

260
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,900
I need to retrieve the spirit pearl.

261
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,980
You're the master of Shanhai.

262
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,750
You can reach Shanhai's

263
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,360
main hall in one step.

264
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,430
Why do you still need

265
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,430
the spirit pearl?

266
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,970
For Yan.

267
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,470
You want to give her the spirit pearl

268
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,510
and make her the monarch?

269
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,670
Although I don’t know

270
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,890
why she entered the tournament,

271
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,340
the monarch is

272
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,430
the master of Shanhai

273
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,980
and the future master of the cultivation realm.

274
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,640
If she can become the monarch,

275
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,970
even if I'm not by her side,

276
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,380
no one will dare to hurt her

277
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,440
with that title protecting her.

278
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,410
Looks like the Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament this year

279
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,870
will welcome a female monarch to the throne.

280
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,150
I sneaked into this tournament.

281
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,840
I believe

282
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,550
the cultivation realm is already alarmed.

283
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,280
We need to plan for Yan quickly.

284
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,880
Come on.

285
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,470
You have the blood of Chongming Bird,

286
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,530
you can naturally connect with

287
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,820
Shanhai's spiritual power.

288
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,440
We can treat you as one of us

289
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,660
and build you a territory

290
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,860
in this secret realm,

291
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,350
so that you can settle down

292
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,010
and continue your bloodline.

293
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,980
Continue what?

294
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,060
Your bloodline.

295
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,400
You are the only Chongming Bird left

296
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,460
in the world.

297
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,380
As long as you like it,

298
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,240
you can also choose a human

299
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,400
to carry on the bloodline.

300
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,210
That's right.

301
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,870
Mistress, you can

302
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,350
stay here with My Lord

303
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,470
and give birth to a bunch of children.

304
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,370
I'm new here.

305
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,090
I don't know the terrain yet.

306
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,599
Can you guide me?

307
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,430
The Nine Calamities Sea

308
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,430
is divided into four regions

309
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,310
by the four directions.

310
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,119
There are four spirit pearls in total.

311
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,670
If you want to climb the Ten Percepts Mountain,

312
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,670
you need at least half of

313
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,270
Shanhai's spiritual power.

314
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,490
I want to enter Shanhai's main hall.

315
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,030
I'm the master of the East Region.

316
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,760
I can give you my

317
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,740
spirit pearl.

318
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,240
Take it as a welcome gift.

319
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,080
Thank you.

320
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,710
Since we are from the same clan,

321
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,370
you don't have to be so polite.

322
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,990
As for the other three realms,

323
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,110
the master of the North Region,

324
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,370
the silver silkworm, is the most brutal.

325
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,390
Just now,

326
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,990
I smelled the scent of blood

327
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,850
from the north.

328
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,510
Someone must have

329
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,570
become its snack.

330
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,620
The north

331
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,290
is way too cold.

332
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,110
The south is warmer now.

333
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,170
Earth Spirit will show you the way.

334
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,500
You don't need to worry.

335
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,470
Besides,

336
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,550
you can absorb

337
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,150
the spiritual power of Shanhai.

338
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,710
Even without the spirit pearl,

339
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,200
you can scale the Ten Percepts Mountain.

340
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,860
No need to take too many risks.

341
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,400
Mistress, come with me.

342
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:35,950
Let's go.

343
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,140
He is the previous monarch.

344
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,700
The tournament grounds

345
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,960
are like no man's grounds to him.

346
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,110
He can do whatever he wants.

347
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,930
Demons are bloodthirsty.

348
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,070
The disciples inside

349
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,350
will be in danger.

350
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,180
Now,

351
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,130
my son, daughter-in-law,

352
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,950
and goddaughter are all inside.

353
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,730
If anything happens,

354
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,790
the Dragon Capital

355
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,250
will lose its successors.

356
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,360
Do you have any solutions?

357
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,760
Yu Quan, Yu Que.

358
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,150
Yes.

359
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:21,530
Yes.

360
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,750
Go to the treasury

361
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,800
and get the Tiangang Rod.

362
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,590
-Yes.
-Yes.

363
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,320
Today, I will

364
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,840
break this water mirror.

365
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,530
You want to forcibly end the tournament?

366
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,390
Once the water mirror is broken,

367
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,750
the barrier will be destroyed.

368
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,830
The Retrograde Bone-Deep Mirror

369
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,410
may be lost forever.

370
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,320
This is a major matter of the cultivation realm.

371
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,850
It's not appropriate for us

372
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,920
to make this decision.

373
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,070
Why not?

374
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,550
Do you think I'm only

375
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,010
doing this for my family?

376
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,460
You should know that today,

377
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,810
hundreds of disciples

378
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,240
from all the big and small sects

379
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,230
in the cultivation realm

380
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,000
are inside right now,

381
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,010
including people from your sect!

382
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,770
Go now!

383
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:09,970
-Yes.
-Yes.

384
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,800
This Millennium Tree Fairy

385
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,170
is the master of the South Region.

386
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,060
I secretly drank its spiritual dew once

387
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,690
and it beat me up for decades.

388
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,990
If it sees me,

389
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,620
I'd be in trouble.

390
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,610
You can go first.

391
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,850
I'll be back right after

392
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,320
you get the spirit pearl.

393
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,040
She easily broke my chains.

394
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,670
Looks like she collected more spiritual aura

395
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,680
than you.

396
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,350
Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament

397
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,710
forbids cultivators from killing each other.

398
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,750
This is the rule set by

399
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,070
the Great Path.

400
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,370
Elder Zhu,

401
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,530
have you forgotten?

402
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,830
How dare someone who has turned demonic

403
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,700
speak of the Great Path's rules

404
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,100
with me?

405
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,650
Here,

406
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,420
there's no place for you.

407
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,070
Nan Yan.

408
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,750
Go get the spirit pearl.

409
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,810
I'll stop him.

410
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,980
You'd better stay here.

411
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,580
As long as you

412
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,010
give me the spirit pearl,

413
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,720
I'll consider that you're just a woman

414
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,160
and spare your life.

415
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,720
Miss.

416
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,060
Your brother is gone.

417
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,950
Believe it or not,

418
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,740
I can kill you with one finger.

419
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,630
Elder Zhu.

420
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,380
Calm down.

421
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,990
The Premier ordered you

422
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,000
to assist me in the tournament.

423
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,070
Even if we're snatching the spirit pearl today,

424
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,180
it's not in your place to do anything.

425
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,310
Do you know

426
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,570
who you're talking to?

427
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:15,860
How dare you!

428
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,820
In the cultivation realm, only the strong command respect.

429
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,720
If you are not convinced,

430
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,770
we can compete.

431
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,740
If I lose,

432
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,500
the spirit pearl will be yours.

433
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,250
How nice.

434
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,790
In my life,

435
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,720
I'm able to witness Great Path's internal conflict.

436
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,780
No wonder the former monarch became demonic.

437
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,130
The first sect in the world

438
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,990
has fallen from its former grace.

439
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:54,110
I kill neither spirits nor women.

440
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,790
Female spirit.

441
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,670
Leave now.

442
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,240
Don't fool me

443
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,650
with Nian's appearance.

444
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,420
Did you hear my voice

445
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,940
in the illusion?

446
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,690
Of course.

447
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,650
If you hadn't tricked me

448
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,060
with Nian's voice,

449
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,730
I wouldn't be in such a mess.

450
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,200
If others knew,

451
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,620
I'd be a laughingstock.

452
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,170
You have me in your heart.

453
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,610
What are you talking about?

454
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,750
Female spirit,

455
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,270
do you have a crush on me?

456
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,290
What do you mean?

457
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,560
You still can't tell that

458
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,570
I'm real?

459
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,920
Tell me.

460
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,340
Are they really here

461
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,610
to win the tournament?

462
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,380
The Young Dragon Lord

463
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,600
was already like this in the Lunar Sect.

464
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,240
He hasn't changed for years.

465
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:45,830
Isn't that

466
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,070
a kind of luck?

467
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,260
Young Lord Mu.

468
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,950
Within the four regions,

469
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,800
three spirit pearls have been taken.

470
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,910
Now only the South Region

471
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,310
still has a spirit pearl.

472
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,610
Instead of messing around here...

473
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,490
No.

474
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,080
All three of you are real?

475
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,200
It seems that Yao Palace is determined

476
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,060
to be enemies with the Great Path.

477
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,910
Since you want to cooperate,

478
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,470
let's get straight to the point.

479
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,690
I'll be frank then.

480
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,950
I can help you

481
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,080
stop the two of them.

482
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,740
You can get the spirit pearl.

483
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,500
By then, let's split the spirit aura in the pearl.

484
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,230
You'll get 30% and I'll get 70%.

485
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,310
You're making my sister

486
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,650
fight the tree spirit for 30%?

487
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,550
You're a man.

488
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,750
Why are you so stingy?

489
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,030
Get it straight.

490
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,200
I'm protecting her.

491
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,230
Who needs protection

492
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,690
from a stingy man like you?

493
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,310
My sister!

494
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,790
The Bloody-handed Asura!

495
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
What should we do?

496
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,770
Everyone,

497
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,700
in my opinion,

498
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,560
why don't we divide it according to our strengths?

499
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,280
Let's fight the Millennial Tree together.

500
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Whoever snatches more will get it.

501
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,340
I don't need

502
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
the spirit pearl.

503
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,920
Then I don't want it either.

504
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:16,790
Stop!

505
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,920
This is not the Dragon Capital.

506
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,050
You can leave, but she has to stay.

507
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,890
Also,

508
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,110
I don't really care

509
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,440
about the spirit pearl.

510
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,750
Whoever helps me

511
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,130
kill this demonic woman

512
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,230
will receive all the

513
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,230
Shanhai spiritual aura

514
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,270
I have.

515
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:38,730
Nonsense!

516
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,690
Senior.

517
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,690
How can you put

518
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,230
personal matters before worldly matters?

519
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,610
Senior,

520
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,760
are you also

521
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,790
so enticed by the position

522
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,890
of the monarch that

523
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,630
you won't avenge

524
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,160
my father's death anymore?

525
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,500
You, on the other hand,

526
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,090
are so willing to give up on the pearl.

527
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,580
Could it be that

528
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,760
you have the strongest spirit pearl

529
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,650
from the North Region?

530
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,870
She has two pearls.

531
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,540
Why bother fighting the tree spirit?

532
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,760
We can just take one of her pearls.

533
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,290
What's the meaning of this?

534
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,010
Stay out of my business.

535
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,790
What are you talking about?

536
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,710
It's good that you're here.

537
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,430
Let me tell you.

538
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,270
These people

539
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,070
are scheming against Nan Yan.

540
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,120
Let's work together

541
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,370
to defeat all of them.

542
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,400
How are you still

543
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,410
so dense after so long?

544
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,990
Little Fox!

545
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,210
We've gathered together again!

546
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,340
It's you.

547
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:27,810
Everyone,

548
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,350
the Reincarnated Sen Luo is right in front of us.

549
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,160
A righteous man

550
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,930
should put aside the fight for the throne

551
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,660
and eliminate the demon first.

552
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,390
Nian.

553
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,250
Nian!

554
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,170
I'll always be

555
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,170
on his side.

556
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,080
Someone is forcibly closing

557
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,110
Shanhai's Forbidden Tournament Grounds.

558
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,310
We can't hold it anymore.

559
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,250
We'll leave first.

560
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,350
We haven't got the Bone-Deep Mirror yet.

561
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,740
We can't stop here.

562
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,880
It's Sen Luo.

563
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,580
He's holding the barrier with his demonic aura.

564
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,720
Take this opportunity to kill him!

565
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,110
Ji Yang!

566
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,360
Ji Yang.

567
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,350
Take him away. We'll cover you!

568
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,330
He was backfired by Shanhai's barrier.

569
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,650
Could it be that

570
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,950
I need the spiritual power of Shanhai?

571
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,990
I entered the tournament

572
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,800
to use the Bone-Deep Mirror

573
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,140
and find the truth of my mother's death.

574
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,000
It has nothing to do with you.

575
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,070
You don't have to

576
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,130
do anything for me.

577
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,980
I can't get up.

578
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,400
What's wrong?

579
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,830
Do you feel unwell?

580
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,350
You're angry at me.

581
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,640
That makes me unwell.

582
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,410
I think you're almost recovered.

583
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:30,630
Get up.

584
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,330
Actually,

585
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,390
I'm not here

586
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,850
only to protect you.

587
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,700
There's a prison I must conquer here.

588
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,260
The Bone-Deep Prison.

589
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,370
My competitor is hidden.

590
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,850
I don't know if he'll play any tricks.

591
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,830
I'm afraid that

592
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,220
I'll lose my chance if I'm late.

593
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:09,720
I know.

594
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,670
If I ask you

595
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,010
why you're conquering the prisons,

596
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,660
I'm sure you won't tell me.

597
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,020
Forget it.

598
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,330
At least this time,

599
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,520
you didn't hide

600
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,460
the plan from me.

601
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,560
Keep your secrets.

602
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,260
Considering everything you've done before...

603
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,180
If you want to conquer the prison,

604
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,900
I'll help you with it.

605
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,340
Let me see.

606
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,140
You're fine now.

607
00:32:59,130 --> 00:32:59,880
Let me see!

608
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,490
Demon-Subduing Nail?

609
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,200
You were planted with the Demon-Subduing Nail?

610
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:15,910
Don't worry.

611
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,710
Sen Luo has disappeared.

612
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:19,910
The Demon-Subduing Nail

613
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,970
doesn't affect me.

614
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,230
So...

615
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,520
So this is how you

616
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,290
got rid of Sen Luo.

617
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,640
It's okay.

618
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,500
It really doesn't affect me anymore.

619
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,260
My master told me that

620
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,790
being planted with this nail

621
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,260
hurts a hundred times more

622
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,310
than having one's bones broken.

623
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,570
It will damage your mind and body.

624
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,850
If not at his wit's end,

625
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,910
he would never have used it

626
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,070
on a mortal body.

627
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,090
I'm doing this

628
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,970
for one thing.

629
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,110
To protect you.

630
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:18,679
Why is this damn place

631
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,949
so cold at night?

632
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:22,060
Come on.

633
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,300
Watch me.

634
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:38,219
Cold, aren't you?

635
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,520
Here, let me warm your hands.

636
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,230
What are you doing? It's awkward.

637
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,909
It's nothing.

638
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,080
You look so weak.

639
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,370
I'm worried about you.

640
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,190
You should care about her too.

641
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,810
Oops, I almost forgot.

642
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:03,780
Nian.

643
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,290
I'm sorry.

644
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,590
I'm not cold.

645
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,860
I brought my medicine.

646
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,610
[Cold Remedy]

647
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,230
Don't act tough.

648
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,160
Let me do it.

649
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,670
What are you doing?

650
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,160
It's really inappropriate.

651
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,940
Wait for me.

652
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,660
Here, these are for you.

653
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,660
Hold one in your hands

654
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,060
and put one on your tummy.

655
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,690
It's so warm.

656
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,850
You're amazing.

657
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,320
This can warm the medicine too.

658
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,120
This is my family's special.

659
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,900
It'll keep you warm

660
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,260
and sleep till dawn.

661
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,760
Why don't I have one?

662
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,180
Why do you need it?

663
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,910
You have fur, remember?

664
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,200
Fine.

665
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,230
After all, I'm not

666
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,290
the Dragon Lord's daughter-in-law.

667
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,950
Shut up and enjoy your fire.

668
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,440
You're not angry now?

669
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,640
Tell me.

670
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,140
How much pain did you

671
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,690
endure to exorcise the demon this time?

672
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,840
As long as you're in my heart,

673
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,310
I don't feel any pain.

674
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,670
I even hit you that day.

675
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,660
Did it hurt?

676
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,390
Yes, it still hurts.

677
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,170
It really hurts.

678
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,440
I know

679
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,650
you must have suffered a lot.

680
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,630
By the way,

681
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,080
do you know

682
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,730
you once lost

683
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,920
an internal elixir?

684
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,830
When and where?

685
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,560
When I went to see my uncle,

686
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,310
I found out

687
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,640
my mother had cultivated

688
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,680
a spirit elixir to protect herself.

689
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,440
If not for losing the elixir,

690
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,730
she wouldn't have died

691
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,520
so easily.

692
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,420
Also, her heart condition

693
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,190
was likely

694
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,530
also due to losing the elixir.

695
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,710
You once said

696
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,920
you treated my heart disease.

697
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,130
Could it be...

698
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,390
Could it be that Chief Nan and I

699
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,590
had the same problem?

700
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Exactly the same.

701
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,510
The method is the same too.

702
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,850
Maybe it was done by the same person.

703
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,340
My mother was a deity.

704
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,730
In this world,

705
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,330
few people could hurt her.

706
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,470
Besides,

707
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,070
during the prison siege last time,

708
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,780
that person reacted strangely when he

709
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,840
snatched the Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

710
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,170
These two incidents cannot be

711
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,130
a mere coincidence.

712
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,890
You mean

713
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,900
the same person is capturing the prisons and

714
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,230
snatching the elixirs?

715
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,290
This is just my guess.

716
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,150
If I enter the Bone-Deep Mirror,

717
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,930
I must find my mother

718
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,120
and get to the bottom of this.

719
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,580
Don't act rashly.

720
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,890
If Chief Nan

721
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,640
can really reveal this person,

722
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,800
I'll deal with them somehow.

723
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,010
I'll wait for you to come out, then.

724
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:55,780
This time,

725
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,530
you must come out safely.

726
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,000
The view here is wide.

727
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,710
You just recovered from your injury.

728
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,440
You can't be in danger anymore.

729
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,430
Don't worry.

730
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,780
This is the most nourishing place

731
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,820
in this barrier.

732
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,690
Even flowers and plants can grow here.

733
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,540
And the flowers here

734
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,360
can eat human souls.

735
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,040
Others can't enter.

736
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,240
Eat human souls?

737
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,020
They dare not touch you.

738
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,090
I'm still the master of Shanhai.

739
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,380
I can command it.

740
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,780
You can command Shanhai?

741
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,070
Look.

742
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,310
A spirit pearl?

743
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,110
I collected spiritual aura from the North Region.

744
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,350
Now I have two spirit pearls.

745
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,750
It's enough for you to enter the Bone-Deep Mirror.

746
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,400
Promise me.

747
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,720
No matter what you do in the future,

748
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,160
♫A fate that lasts three lifetimes♫

749
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:38,790
don't leave me

750
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:42,470
♫When I look back, you're already my habit♫

751
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,720
alone again.

752
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,290
In other words,

753
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,130
she wants to kill you with her own hands.

754
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:46,400
♫We entangle, saying nothing♫

755
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,360
♫For this first sight, we are together forever♫

756
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,650
♫To be with you forever♫

757
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,690
Okay.

758
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,930
♫To be with you forever♫
