[Episode 16]

4
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,180
Open the door

5
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,410
and get out of here.

6
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,860
Be with him

7
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,420
and fulfill your wish.

8
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,289
Ji Yang.

9
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,310
Ji Yang...

10
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,670
No joy, no worries.

11
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,259
No anger, no hatred.

12
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,940
No fear, no desire.

13
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,230
I know

14
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,280
you lured me

15
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,230
to this place

16
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,390
to tell me that

17
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,690
because of me,

18
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,970
he was impaled by the Yin Zhus.

19
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,640
Because of me,

20
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,440
he was doomed.

21
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,520
Because of me,

22
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,640
his remains are gone.

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,110
You want me to forget him,

24
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,079
and forget

25
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,170
all the hardships.

26
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,050
Otherwise,

27
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,910
I'll fall into

28
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,480
the endless abyss forever.

29
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,000
When you forget all your emotions, you'll feel relieved.

30
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,280
Only then can you accept your fate

31
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,630
and control the power of the

32
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,690
Seven Sins Manual.

33
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,800
If you are willing,

34
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,480
I can help you.

35
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,930
But I'm unwilling.

36
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,960
So my inner demon

37
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,970
isn't Ji Yang,

38
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,180
but myself.

39
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,090
He's dead.

40
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,150
Why won't you forget him?

41
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,420
Because it takes love

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,460
to differentiate good from evil.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,190
It takes love

44
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,340
to see the world's cruelty.

45
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,060
It takes love

46
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,420
to see the suffering in the world.

47
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,710
Shouldering the seven emotions to cleanse the demons of the world

48
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,510
is the hardest path in the world.

49
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,570
Is it worth it?

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,950
I only hope that

51
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,000
no one else suffers like me.

52
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,820
Then everything

53
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,070
will be worth it.

54
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,600
Let me remind you.

55
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,150
After entering the Nine Calamities Pagoda,

56
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,640
your trial will only just begin.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,730
Dragon Lord.

58
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,830
Let me out!

59
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,030
What's he yelling about

60
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,040
in there this time?

61
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,060
Hearing that his friend passed away,

62
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,990
he has been drunk inside for 3 days.

63
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,230
Let me out!

64
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,770
Get my Dad here!

65
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,480
Let me out!

66
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,990
Get my Dad here!

67
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,530
Dad.

68
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,850
Let me out.

69
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,150
I want to find the Demon Clan.

70
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,570
I want to avenge Ji yang.

71
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,800
You want to find the Demon Clan?

72
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,440
How many lives do you have?

73
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,870
Li Chi killed my brother.

74
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,030
As long as he's alive,

75
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,280
Yin Ya and Nan Yan

76
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,170
will be targeted sooner or later.

77
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,780
As their big brother,

78
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,700
I can't just sit and watch.

79
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,790
You are

80
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,060
loyal but incompetent.

81
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,530
You can't even take three hits

82
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,450
from Zhu Sui.

83
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,070
If you meet Li Chi,

84
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,360
can you still survive?

85
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,110
Are you going to depend on your

86
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,960
lame poems?

87
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,230
Zhu Sui is nothing!

88
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,750
Aren't I fine right now?

89
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,760
Come.

90
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,470
Get up.

91
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,420
I want to avenge my friend!

92
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,630
Today, I'll fight your full power

93
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,020
with 10% of my power.

94
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,760
If you can escape

95
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,730
from me,

96
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,630
you can do whatever you want.

97
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,030
I won't stop you anymore!

98
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:43,510
Okay.

99
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,460
Okay.

100
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,860
A gentleman never

101
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,240
goes back on his word.

102
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,240
Come!

103
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,210
Zhu Sui was right.

104
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,510
I really have a good-for-nothing son.

105
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,380
Again!

106
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,210
I don't believe this.

107
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,470
You can't even protect yourself

108
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,130
with 90% brute strength and 10% luck.

109
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,900
Yet you want to protect others?

110
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,900
Again!

111
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,030
Tomorrow at noon,

112
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,830
see you at Longting Square.

113
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,070
Young Fox.

114
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,250
This is where you'll cultivate.

115
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,320
Old man,

116
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:00,990
am I

117
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,350
in your Zijin bowl?

118
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,580
Yes.

119
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,650
The elixir on the stone table

120
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,970
is a treasure with a purifying effect.

121
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,350
It's also your fate.

122
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,480
There is only one fast way

123
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,810
to break the Spirit-Sealing Formation.

124
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,830
Eat it.

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,290
Who would believe you?

126
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,380
Who knows if you will harm me?

127
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,480
Given Master's level of cultivation,

128
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,960
he can harm you without doing all of these.

129
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,650
Who are you?

130
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,340
I am Zhen Fang.

131
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,200
You should call me your senior.

132
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,390
That old man is good at naming people.

133
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,500
Your name is Zhen Fang,

134
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,520
Nan Yan is called Zhen Yuan.

135
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,620
If you want it,

136
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,460
you have to get through me.

137
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,909
You're just a kid.

138
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,060
I'll be bullying you if I use any magic.

139
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,550
Old man.

140
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,520
Why are you here?

141
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,400
Master?

142
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,930
You brat.

143
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,960
Don't force me to get serious.

144
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,830
Dad, pardon me.

145
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,900
I will get you

146
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,340
another cup next time.

147
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,390
Zhan,

148
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,890
Your Sun Fire today

149
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,150
was excellent.

150
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,070
Tell me what reward

151
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,500
you would like.

152
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:56,950
Then...

153
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,640
Can I leave now?

154
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,720
Shut up.

155
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,290
You haven't recovered yet.

156
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,910
No, but I'm already...

157
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,470
Yu Quan.

158
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,230
Get some spirit stones from the storage

159
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,830
and bring out Young Lord's treasured

160
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,870
poem selection.

161
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,540
Print a thousand copies

162
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,090
and distribute them among the 49 whaleboats.

163
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,050
Yes.

164
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,790
No, Dad.

165
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,310
When can I

166
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,350
leave?

167
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,870
S-small master,

168
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,460
can anyone really get through this?

169
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,920
The last person to get through this

170
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,520
was Yin Ruochen from the Nightmare Fox clan.

171
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,070
Who are you lying to?

172
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,710
He's the ancestor of our Fox Clan.

173
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,980
Master told me.

174
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,030
It is said that he took half a year

175
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,170
to get the elixir.

176
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,320
Why don't you

177
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
ask Master?

178
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,110
I don't want to ask him now.

179
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,530
Let's...

180
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:54,850
Try again.

181
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,120
You're on.

182
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,440
I don't feel anything.

183
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,830
Does this elixir take some time

184
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,860
to take effect?

185
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,150
Actually,

186
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,410
this elixir

187
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,070
is just an ordinary pill.

188
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,330
How dare you lie to me?

189
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,880
Old man?

190
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,630
Young friend,

191
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,790
don't you think

192
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,600
your power has improved

193
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,680
after all that training?

194
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,890
So during this period,

195
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,180
you were the one practicing with me?

196
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,360
It's just a clone.

197
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,300
You old liar.

198
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,140
I shouldn't have trusted you.

199
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,070
Where's Nan Yan?

200
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,720
Junior Zhen Yuan

201
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,560
went down the mountain a month ago.

202
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,950
There were demons nearby terrorizing the civilians.

203
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,640
She

204
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,890
killed the head of the demons

205
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,860
within half a month.

206
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,060
They called her

207
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,890
Bloody-handed Asura.

208
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,360
Bloody-handed Asura?

209
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,800
She sent word that she was

210
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,900
investigating the case of Evil Path kidnapping children

211
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,480
in Pingfeng Mountain in the North.

212
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,910
She told you to find her

213
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,070
after you get out.

214
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,810
Little Boy.

215
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,230
Just listen to half of the old man's words.

216
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,350
Don't believe it all.

217
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,070
I'm leaving.

218
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,910
See you never.

219
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,040
Master.

220
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,120
Why did he say

221
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,510
not to believe you?

222
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,520
That's because he's not smart.

223
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,230
Master,

224
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,170
you're just going to let him go?

225
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,430
What can I do?

226
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,020
His cultivation improved rapidly.

227
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,010
We can't trap him here anymore.

228
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,080
I see.

229
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,070
The old man said

230
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,500
Pingfeng Mountain right?

231
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,510
Why is no one here?

232
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:13,990
Come out.

233
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,550
They're all dead.

234
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,200
Now a fox is here.

235
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,220
You'll help with my cultivation.

236
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,910
It's rare to see a fox

237
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,870
with Core Formation cultivation.

238
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,540
I made a breakthrough?

239
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,620
That old man tricked me again!

240
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,720
Can you check me out again?

241
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,910
Are you crazy?

242
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,450
Dream on!

243
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,420
A cultivator can only attain true joy

244
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,250
by not speaking of taking lives.

245
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,690
You completed your training?

246
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,200
That demonic cultivator just now...

247
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,829
You could have just killed him.

248
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,890
Wasn't shattering him a bit too much?

249
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,390
Everything has a soul.

250
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,030
If the soul is shattered,

251
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,829
the plants can absorb it better.

252
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,810
Listen to yourself.

253
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,030
How can you say that?

254
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:27,099
Those demonic cultivators hunted on children.

255
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,190
They were sinful.

256
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
They deserved it.

257
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,330
What is your cultivation level now?

258
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,070
Yuanying.

259
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:38,890
This...

260
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:39,950
That old man

261
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,760
is too biased.

262
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,430
Did you get promoted?

263
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,960
He found an excuse

264
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,450
to imprison me for three years.

265
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,850
He even lied that I was about to be promoted.

266
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,830
You're still a six-tail?

267
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,650
It doesn't matter

268
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,810
as long as you can return to your fox form.

269
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,540
It's so cute.

270
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,130
If I can pet you,

271
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,180
I won't mind how many tails you have.

272
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,470
When I saw you killing without mercy,

273
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,720
I thought you had

274
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,100
become a whole different person.

275
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,400
But you can still joke around,

276
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,530
so I'm relieved.

277
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,880
I just detached myself from worldly desires,

278
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,340
I didn't lose my memories.

279
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,290
Well...

280
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,280
What about him?

281
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,000
Everything has passed.

282
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,920
Now,

283
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,410
I just want to follow the Holy Master's path

284
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,470
to slay the demons and save the world.

285
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,150
The rest

286
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
is not important.

287
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,050
You are really determined.

288
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,250
You let it go like you said you would.

289
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,490
What about you?

290
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,450
What's your plan now that you're out?

291
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,510
The Spirit-Sealing Formation cannot be broken

292
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,460
and even the Seven Sins Manual

293
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,430
can't break it.

294
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,720
I plan to

295
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,570
listen to that old man

296
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,650
and focus on cultivating

297
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,070
before finding a way to break the formation.

298
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,840
At worst, I'll bet on my life

299
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,530
and force a way out.

300
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,710
In that case,

301
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,240
come with me.

302
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,260
Where are we going?

303
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,660
To Lunar Sect.

304
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,240
It's been three years.

305
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,310
It's time to visit Meng.

306
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,580
It's been three years.

307
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,580
I do miss him.

308
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,940
[Huangquan Prison]

309
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,530
Where is this?

310
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,540
A human spirit in a demonic body.

311
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,010
How wonderful.

312
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,910
You're indeed

313
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,870
a rare talent.

314
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,250
A forbidden spell was cast on you,

315
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,480
but you came back from the dead.

316
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,350
Who are you?

317
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,470
You locked me in your body,

318
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,150
now you pretend you don't remember me?

319
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,870
Have you forgotten?

320
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,640
My Lord, have you forgotten

321
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,450
who you are?

322
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,510
My Lord?

323
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,210
What sect's

324
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,370
lord am I?

325
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,790
Demon Lord Sen Luo.

326
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,560
That is you.

327
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,270
A thousand years ago,

328
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,470
you absorbed the ancient evil,

329
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,090
Yin Zhu, into your body,

330
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,550
and dominated the five states.

331
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,030
Unfortunately,

332
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,470
you were ambushed by Ji Ming

333
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,090
and your body was destroyed.

334
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,390
Only a fragment of your soul was left.

335
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,950
It was imprisoned here.

336
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,930
If I'm Sen Luo,

337
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,100
who are you?

338
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,930
I'm your loyal servant, who has been

339
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,420
waiting for you for a thousand years.

340
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,820
You just said you were my prisoner.

341
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,100
You changed your mind quickly.

342
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,460
Although you sealed me,

343
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,510
I have always

344
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,990
been obedient to you,

345
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,530
waiting for this day to come

346
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,730
and help you achieve your great cause.

347
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,230
What great cause?

348
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,200
That old man Ji Ming

349
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,510
sealed the Yin Zhus around you

350
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,190
in the five prisons.

351
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,670
Huangquan Prison is one of them.

352
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,750
It's also the only prison

353
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,590
that holds your soul.

354
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,190
If you can gather

355
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,590
all the Yin Zhus in the five prisons,

356
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,990
you can control life and death in the world.

357
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,840
The world will be yours to rule.

358
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,030
So,

359
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,020
I still have something important to do.

360
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,600
Why don't I

361
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,190
kill you first?

362
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,370
Please think twice.

363
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,530
My mind is blank,

364
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,060
so you think I have lost my memories

365
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,110
and said that nonsense to me.

366
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,760
That means you're either crazy,

367
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,710
or a liar.

368
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,240
If you don't believe me,

369
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,210
you can summon the Yin Zhu in your body.

370
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,750
You'll know after a try.

371
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,680
Ancient evil beings are quite interesting.

372
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,320
However,

373
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,630
I've lost all my memories.

374
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,030
I'm not interested in becoming

375
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,400
the Demon Lord anymore.

376
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,680
Don't jump to conclusions.

377
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,710
You've been sleeping for a long time.

378
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,310
How about

379
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,350
awakening this prison first?

380
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,350
If you want to make a mark in the future,

381
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,570
I will do my best

382
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,600
to help you seize all the five prisons

383
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,630
and rule the netherworld!

384
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,860
What's the fun of being a lonely ruler?

385
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,260
I'm no longer the man I used to be.

386
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,470
Instead of having fun alone,

387
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,420
I prefer

388
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,360
to drag the whole world

389
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,340
down with me.

390
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,130
Greetings,

391
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,700
Master of Huangquan Prison.

392
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,470
What are you laughing at?

393
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,810
As a Demon Lord,

394
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,010
you gave me the Huangquan Prison just like that.

395
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,330
Yet you are still in the mood to laugh?

396
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,120
You...

397
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,240
What?

398
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,870
You're the one who

399
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,680
tried to trick a junior like me.

400
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,390
Didn't you say all that nonsense

401
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,950
just to incite me

402
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
to collect the Five Prisons for you?

403
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,470
Junior,

404
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,720
as long as my soul is still here,

405
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,010
you must obey me

406
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,550
and collect the Yin Zhus in the world for me.

407
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,450
When you are in charge of life and death...

408
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,370
Take charge of life and death?

409
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,870
I'm not interested.

410
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,660
You—

411
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,830
It's boring to stay here.

412
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,450
How about

413
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,290
going out for a tour?

414
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,780
Boss lady,

415
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,390
when is your stall opening?

416
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,870
We're all waiting

417
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,230
to be fed.

418
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,030
Yes.

419
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,690
You have to open for business.

420
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,310
Stop arguing.

421
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,110
We need to eat.

422
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,230
My stall is open every day.

423
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,430
I'm afraid the lost ghost

424
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,440
wouldn't dare to drink my wine.

425
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,470
Sir,

426
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,010
please enjoy.

427
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,160
Young sir, you are so handsome.

428
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,480
Waiter.

429
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,240
Serve him well.

430
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,000
Okay.

431
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,920
Our wine

432
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,460
is the best in the North.

433
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,010
You won't find better wine

434
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,220
anywhere else.

435
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,960
The best in the North?

436
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,060
This wine is the best in the North?

437
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,750
It's no different from water.

438
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,870
Young sir, you must be joking.

439
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,030
This wine is the strongest wine

440
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,170
in the North.

441
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,940
Have another pot.

442
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,460
If it's still tasteless,

443
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,190
I won't charge you for the drinks.

444
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,450
I told you it's tasteless.

445
00:27:58,970 --> 00:27:59,700
Take it away.

446
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,480
What happened?

447
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,030
I gave him

448
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,790
three times the dose.

449
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,020
Even a spirit would faint by now.

450
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,950
What's going on?

451
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,240
The body of a Yin Zhu has no blood or tears.

452
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,680
You don't know agony

453
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,910
and pain.

454
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,390
You cannot taste

455
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,440
anything either.

456
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,590
It's so hard to be a monster.

457
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,910
I can't even savor good wine anymore.

458
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,630
Why worry?

459
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,760
After you destroy the Five Prisons

460
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,160
and collect the Yin Zhus,

461
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,630
if you want to laugh,

462
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,070
all beings will dance in the fire to entertain you.

463
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,870
If you want to cry,

464
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,490
all seas will echo with wails of grief.

465
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,930
The mortal's mere sense of taste

466
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,740
is not worth mentioning.

467
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,790
But now, I only want a scoop of wine.

468
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,860
What's wrong, young sir?

469
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,310
Are you leaving?

470
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,800
Aren't you going to pay for the drinks?

471
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,880
Didn't you say

472
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,050
you wouldn't charge if the wine was tasteless?

473
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,840
I won't charge you for the wine.

474
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,110
But,

475
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,740
now that you're at my stall,

476
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,430
you have to pay for your life!

00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,969
can be called "master"

526
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,870
by the chief of Evil Path.

527
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,840
But Sen Luo died

528
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,860
1,000 years ago.

529
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,860
There are indeed great masters in the North.

530
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,750
Few people can take a hit from me

531
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,470
in the cultivation realm.

532
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,910
Who are you?

533
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,600
The Blood Phoenix Hairpin is the treasure of the Chongming Bird Clan.

534
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,230
When the spirit queen passed away,

535
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,230
she gave it to her

536
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,140
only daughter.

537
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,410
This item is extremely precious.

538
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,440
You have no right to keep it.

539
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,580
Give it to me.

540
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,910
I might have no right,

541
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:30,590
but you don't deserve to keep Chief Nan Fang's item either.

542
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,930
Master.

543
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,270
I'm afraid this person

544
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,230
is stalling you

545
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,550
to lure you away from what's important.

546
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,010
Senior!

547
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,780
What a lovely couple.

548
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,840
How dare you demonic cultivators

549
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,790
break into Lunar Mountain?

550
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,560
Let her go!

551
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,550
Give me the Blood Phoenix Hairpin

552
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,390
and I'll spare your lives.

553
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,800
Stop dawdling.

554
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,850
Do you want to be a couple in the Netherworld?

555
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,570
Wait.

556
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,740
I'll hand it over.

557
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,910
Let her go first.

558
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,140
Yingying.

559
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,660
Brother.

560
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,620
Since we have it,

561
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,160
let's go.

562
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,740
Mian.

563
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,270
Since I have it,

564
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,900
we have to silence him.

565
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,040
The magic of the Seven Sins Manual.

566
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,510
Bloody-handed Asura is here.

567
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,040
Retreat!

568
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:03,840
What's going on?

569
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,740
Master ordered Yingying and me

570
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,670
to send a hairpin to Tianqiao Peak.

571
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,140
Yingying, Fu Lang.

572
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,230
Remember,

573
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,340
You must deliver this

574
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,930
to Tianqiao Peak

575
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,190
and personally hand it to Sword Master

576
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,130
Meng Xiaolou.

577
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,650
The faster, the better.

578
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,730
Make no mistake.

579
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,660
We never expected

580
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,480
the Demon Clan to intercept

581
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,520
and snatch the hairpin away.

582
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,710
That demonic aura just now

583
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,680
doesn't belong to the ordinary demons.

584
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,340
Something must have happened to the Lunar Sect.

585
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,240
Let's go.

586
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,200
Aren't you bold?

587
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,510
Who are you?

588
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,240
Someone to send you on your way.

589
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,550
Ji Yang?
