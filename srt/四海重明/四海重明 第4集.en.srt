[Episode 4]

4
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,270
You should stay in the Lunar Sect

5
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,420
and treat me without worries.

6
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:13,950
Until...

7
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,310
You cultivate the Five-Poison Heart Pill.

8
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,840
Fine.

9
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,580
It's rare that you trust me so much.

10
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,630
I'll see what I can do.

11
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,600
Where are you going?

12
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,270
To...

13
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,080
To check if your Bili fruits

14
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,979
are ripe already, right?

15
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,380
Yes.

16
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,060
My Bili fruits.

17
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,530
Come on.

18
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,140
Today,

19
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,060
I'm getting rid of a thought that's bothering me

20
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,190
and testing out the card-drawing technique

21
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,590
I've been practicing.

22
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,230
Why are you the only one here?

23
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,580
You're too late.

24
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,990
The other players were eager to go home.

25
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,070
Your card-drawing technique

26
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,600
has to wait for another day.

27
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,810
Then why aren't you going home?

28
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,750
My daughter has been

29
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,480
with a young master these days.

30
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,310
She's not waiting for me at home.

31
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,440
Why should I go home?

32
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,950
Wait,

33
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,829
where did this young master come from?

34
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:37,560
Could it be

35
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,770
one of the fools from our sect?

36
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,910
Even if I can accept one of

37
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,410
those fools,

38
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,200
would the Seal of Romance accept them?

39
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,450
Are you serious?

40
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,100
Only a person with a pure heart

41
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,390
can receive the Seal of Romance.

42
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,840
Sometimes,

43
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,590
I have to admit it.

44
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,240
This is the so-called fate.

45
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,950
It's destined.

46
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,630
They are like this.

47
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,590
I'm no exception.

Ji Yang?

51
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,340
Isn't he the monarch of the Great Path Sect,

52
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:50,940
Shao Cang?

53
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,970
He's still fooling me.

54
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,210
You sure know a lot.

55
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,460
My Lord.

56
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,470
When did you know?

57
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,950
I've been making poisons and medicine since I was young.

58
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,550
I knew all the poisonous insects in the world.

59
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,600
I've heard about

60
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,920
the Candlelight Beetles too.

61
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,510
Why didn't you

62
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,360
expose me in front of the chief?

63
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,620
For my mother, of course.

64
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,150
I told you before.

65
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,030
I came to the Lunar Sect to learn

66
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,550
poison and medicine-making every day

67
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,280
to treat my mother's sickness.

68
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,830
If the chief finds out

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,170
I'm keeping you here

70
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,340
by force,

71
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,810
I'll also be guilty

72
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,170
of hiding a fugitive.

73
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,840
If that happens,

74
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,490
this sect

75
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,250
won't keep me around anymore.

76
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,180
At least you know your priorities.

77
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,230
But...

78
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,540
I tend to

79
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,760
make mistakes sometimes.

80
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,470
I might rat you out

81
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,640
one day when I'm

82
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,990
sleepwalking.

83
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,830
You won't.

84
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:03,990
Unless...

85
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,110
You want to die?

What did you do?

90
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,690
Just now,

91
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,450
I've cast a death curse on you.

92
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,030

93
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,400
What's that?

94
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,650
Don't lie to me.

95
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,150
Don't believe me?

96
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,140
Do you still dare to sleepwalk?

97
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,240
No.

98
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,290
I dare not.

99
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,000
But let me remind you.

100
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,070
The death curse will automatically be triggered

101
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,110
when you're more than 3 miles away from me.

Why does the Dragon Capital's

curse-breaking spell

164
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,200
sound like some kind of rural ritual?

What do you mean?

166
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,810
Forget it.

Thank you.

168

I'll figure it out myself.

No, no, no.

170
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,640
I have another idea.

I promise that it's effective.

172
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,550
There's another way?

173
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,720
Could it be...

174
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,010
Using a black dog's blood?

175
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,640
How did you know?

176
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,930
All right.

177
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,660
Pretend I didn't ask you anything

178
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,750
about breaking curses or exorcising evil.

179
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,810
You must not mention this

180
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,730
to anyone.

181
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,350
Understand?

182
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,470
You can't tell anyone.

183
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,230
Thank you.

184
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,710
No.

185
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,680
Did I dance wrongly?

186
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,600
No, that's exactly how Father did it.

187
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,970
Vanquish all spirits!

188
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,530
Demons and ghosts beware!

189
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,660
Nan Yan.

190
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,150
I have another idea

191
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,400
for exorcising evil.

192
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,150
I think that was...

193
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,770
My goodness, Nan Yan.

194
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,380
You're hiding someone?

195
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,750
He...

196
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,150
I know who you are.

197
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,230
What are you talking about?

198
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,990
You are...

199
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,770
Ji Yang.

200
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,110
Yes.

201
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,740
His name is Ji Yang.

202
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,840
He is a neighbor

203
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,670
from town.

204
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,370
He's not feeling well lately.

205
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,020
He came to me for treatment

206
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,040
and is trying some medicine for me.

207
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,030
No.

208
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,190
You're lying.

209
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,440
He is not

210
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,670
an ordinary patient.

211
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,750
He...

212
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,650
His handwriting

213
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,480
is full of vigor.

214
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,050
[Ji Yang]

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,730
It looks just like Lord Shao Cang's handwriting.

216
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,190
Could you be...

217
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,920
You are Shao Cang...

218
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,530
Shao Cang's fan, right?

219
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,190
You found out.

220
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,800
I found out!

221
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:07,990
Good.

222
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,850
Ji.

223
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,020
Your handwriting

224
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,920
has captured the essence of Lord Shao Cang's handwriting.

225
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,770
I'm no match for your skills.

226
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,810
Shao Cang is hated by the world.

227
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,520
I can only hide

228
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,060
my admiration for him.

229
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,440
However,

230
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,920
it's rare to meet a confidant

231
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,450
who is not afraid of rumors.

232
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,780
Yan,

233
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,700
aren't you happy for me?

234
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,630
Yan?

235
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,580
When did I become so close to you?

236
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,190
I'm happy.

237
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,660
I'm so happy.

238
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,400
I'm so excited.

239
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,390
I forgot to introduce myself.

240
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,630
I'm Mu Zhanting,

241
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,210
a classmate of Nan Yan.

242
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,360
May I know why

243
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,680
you admire Shao Cang?

244
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,130
He's really getting into character.

245
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,890
You may not know.

246
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,160
Shao Cang spoke fluently when he was six.

247
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,750
He was the champion of magic when he was eight.

248
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,630
He achieved the Yuanying Soul Realm at 13

249
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,360
and took the throne at 16.

250
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,390
His talent is beyond my generation.

251
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,200
I just hope that one day,

252
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,910
I can meet him through literature

253
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,830
and become sworn friends.

254
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,300
I agree with you.

255
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,080
I also want to witness

256
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,340
Lord Shao Cang's excellence in person.

257
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,300
Ji,

258
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,720
you may not know yet.

259
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,310
Shao Cang was framed and escaped the Great Path Sect.

260
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,150
He's in the North right now.

261
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,870
Really?

262
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,460
Ji,

263
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,000
are you willing to join me

264
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,560
and secretly support Shao Cang

265
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,360
to clear his name?

266
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,400
You sound like

267
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,600
you have a plan.

268
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,140
Of course.

269
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,260
I've asked around.

270
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,340
In the Xiagu Street Market,

271
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,580
there is a pleasure boat.

272
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,640
The boat owner is extremely well-informed

273
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,070
and specializes in selling information.

274
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,230
There must be clues to be found there.

275
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,150
I plan to leave tomorrow morning

276
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,150
to visit the boat.

277
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,100
Ji.

278
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,110
Why don't you go with me?

279
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:58,870
Of course.

280
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,220
No way!

281
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,260
He's here for treatment.

282
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,660
He can barely fend for himself,

283
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,190
let alone save anyone else.

284
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,970
Let me tell you.

285
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,070
No outsiders are allowed in the sect.

286
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,820
You have to

287
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,180
keep his presence here a secret.

288
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,550
Don't tell anyone.

289
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,150
Don't worry.

290
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,480
I'm tight-lipped.

291
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,380
Ji,

292
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,750
take care of yourself first.

293
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,550
Once the boat owner has

294
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,450
any reliable news,

295
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,730
I will let you know.

296
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,040
Goodbye.

297
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,310
Thank you.

298
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,450
Great.

299
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,790
Keep your mouth shut.

300
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,170
You heard him just now.

301
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,120
He knows nothing

302
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,390
about your identity.

303
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,860
Everyone in my sect

304
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,310
once worshipped me.

305
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,510
Did I let them go because of that?

306
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,040
So,

307
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,750
if you want him to live,

308
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,160
be good and listen to me.

309
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,990
Don't think about ridiculous things

310
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,720
like exorcising evil and breaking curses again.

311
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,600
Otherwise,

312
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,080
it won't matter if

313
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,100
I have to kill one more person.

314
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,050
The Young Dragon Lord's survival

315
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,310
depends on your performance.

316
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,180
Understood.

317
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,310
I'll go check if the Bili fruits

318
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,900
are ripe.

319
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,820
If they are,

320
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,010
I'll harvest them.

321
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:43,880
The first one

322
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,790
will be for you.

323
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,420
Senior.

324
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,590
What happened?

325
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,590
You look so happy.

326
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,360
Nothing.

327
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,110
I just pulled out some plants

328
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,190
so that poisoner's saplings

329
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,410
can grow faster.

330
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,710
That's my senior.

331
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,470
Why aren't you hiccupping anymore?

332
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,270
You're right.

333
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,290
How could this happen?

334
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,050
How could this happen?

335
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,450
Who did this?

336
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,060
Who did this?

337
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,240
No...

338
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,300
Again!

339
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,360
The Bili tree bears fruits every two years.

340
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
I don't want them to wait any longer.

341
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,890
Besides, my furnace is holding

342
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,450
precious heart-protecting pills.

343
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,589
Two pills in total.

344
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:08,890
One for my mom,

345
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,160
one for you.

346
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,710
♫I weave through the crowd♫

347
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,200
♫Rain passes by, leaving traces♫

348
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,360
♫How lucky I am to meet you♫

349
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,920
♫There is endless scenery to be seen♫

350
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,620
♫There are too many topics to talk about♫

351
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,340

You're both talented and beautiful,

It's 200 years old.

402
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,070
When consumed, it not only increases your spiritual power

403
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,800
but also improves your beauty.

404

At least you're sincere.

405
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,190
The depths of Filth Valley are extremely dangerous.

406
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,470
It's not because the terrain is rough,

407
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,990
but because a soul hunter is hiding there.

408

The hunter is called Yin Zhu,

If you carry something

415
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,620
that can conceal your breath with you,

416
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,770
it can help you hide for a while.

Something to conceal my breath?

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,810
the silver mermaid pearl?

420

You're well-informed.

If you have that,

it would be much easier to enter the valley.

the mermaids and spirits

426

were all trapped in the Spirit-Sealing Formation.

427
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,770
Since then, silver mermaid pearls have become hard to get.

What if

524
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,150
I ruin your plans?

525
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,090
I’m more worried

526
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,250
if I leave you here.

527
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,790
Our chief has his rules.

528
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,510
We cannot leave the sect's vicinity without permission.

529
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,370
Go by yourself.

530
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,360
Come back early.

531
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,540
You forgot about the death curse,

532
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,200
didn't you?

533
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,140
If you change your mind,

534
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,870
blink.

535
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,550
Let's go.

536
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,270
Why is he visiting the Xiagu Street Market?

537
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,070
Is he here to inquire about Filth Valley?

538
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,420
There's no need to drag me along for that.

539
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:29,950
Friend,

540
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,190
the Filth Valley will open soon.

541
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,120
Pick some suitable magical tools.

542
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,330
My friend,

543
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,390
you have an elegant aura.

544
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,270
It matches the Mechanical Butterfly

545
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,270
very much.

546
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,120
It's indeed of good quality.

547
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,120
How much is this?

548
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,420
100 spirit stones.

549
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,140
How can you be so generous?

550
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,110
Don't you bargain

551
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,240
when you buy things?

552
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,430
Bargain?

553
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,850
Do you think I need to bargain?

554
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,230
You're stupid and rich.

555
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,690
No wonder they target you.

556
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,270
I'll only teach you once.

557
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,270
Watch carefully.

558
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,310
Boss.

559
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,330
100 spirit stones

560
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,430
is too expensive.

561
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,070
Name your price, then.

562
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,150
As long as it's reasonable,

563
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:15,990
I'll accept it.

564
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,070
Consider it as a token of our friendship.

565
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,180
50 spirit stones.

566
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,170
How about that?

567
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,150
Miss,

568
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,390
you can't half the price right away.

569
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,510
Then we don't want it.

570
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,250
Let's go.

571
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,420
Listen to me.

572
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,400
Don't look back.

573
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,320
Just watch.

574
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,510
When I count to three,

575
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,240
he'll definitely call us back.

576
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,030
One.

577
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,910
Two...

578
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,830
Do you really like

579
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,510
that Mechanical Butterfly?

580
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,800
What do you mean?

581
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,830
Since you like it,

582
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,290
I'll put my pride aside

583
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,440
and give in a little to the seller.

584
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,510
60 spirit stones.

585
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,990
He will definitely sell it.

586
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,670
Just watch.

587
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,100
Have you made up your mind?

588
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,840
How about this, boss?

589
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,600
I'll give you 60 spirit stones.

590
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,050
Not a single stone more.

591
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,460
You got it wrong.

592
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,690
120.

593
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,070
Not a stone less.

594
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:21,940
Wait.

595
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,430
You must be mistaken.

596
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,230
Why did you raise the price?

597
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,160
In Xiagu Street Market,

598
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,390
only my stall sells the

599
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,720
Mechanical Butterfly.

600
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,840
Take it if you want.

601
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,760
First come first serve.

602
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,840
Fine.

603
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,470
120 it is.

604
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,030
Boss.

605
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,470
Let me.

606
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,030
He even raised his price.

607
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,530
Profiteer.

608
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:58,830
Let's go.

609
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:01,790
Nan Yan.

610
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,440
Why did you buy it for me?

611
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,610
You saved my Bili tree yesterday.

612
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,330
I need to return the favor.

613
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,190
It's nothing.

614
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,590
Don't think too much.

615
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,110
If I miss the Bili fruit harvest this year,

616
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,590
I'll have to wait for another two years.

617
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,000
So I have to thank you.

618
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,460
But the boss

619
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,470
must have known how much you wanted it.

620
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,910
Not only did he not give me a discount,

621
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,510
but he even raised the price.

622
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,710
I'm so angry.

623
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,180
Keep it.

624
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,020
I paid a lot for this.

625
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,110
Don't you like it?

626
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,200
Why are you giving it back to me?

627
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,730
It's for you.

628
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,360
For me?

629
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,220
Were you

630
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,190
picking out a gift for me?

631
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,750
Of course.
