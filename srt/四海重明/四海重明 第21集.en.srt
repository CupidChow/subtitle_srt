4
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,870
But why does he have the Blood Phoenix Hairpin

5
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,590
that the Lunar Sect lost?

6
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,920
How do you explain that?

7
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,680
We've been chasing the murderer all the way

8
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,190
from the Lunar Sect to the whaleboat.

9
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,830
Have you forgotten

10
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,270
the purpose of our trip

11
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,950
just because

12
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,610
he looks exactly like Ji Yang?

13
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,870
You mean the Blood Phoenix Hairpin

14
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,870
is in his hands?

15
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,130
This is not to be trifled with.

16
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,030
Before the truth is revealed,

17
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,350
we can't let others know that he has demonic aura.

18

Little Fox.

19
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,190
Trust me.

20
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,789
He is Ji Yang.

Please come with us.

23
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,190
Miss.

24
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,789
Since you know medicine,

25
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,990
do you agree with the coroner's conclusion

26
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,910
that the captain

27
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,970
died of poisoning?

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,390
His complexion is livid,

29
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,789
his eyes wouldn't close,

30
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,520
and there's blood clot between his eyebrows.

31
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,960
He did die of poisoning.

32
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,420
The captain's death was caused by demonic aura.

33
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,770
The whaleboat

34
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,070
is heavily guarded and strictly patrolled.

35
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,870
How could there be demonic aura?

36
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,510
Please forgive us, my fellow.

37
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,030
My junior has been traveling around the world with me.

38
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,950
He saw a lot of people

39
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,990
who were killed

40
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,150
by the Demon Clan's skills.

41
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,910
Their bodies

42
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,550
bore similar signs to the captain's.

43
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,150
That's why he blurted it out.

44
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,780
Well, is it true that

45
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,500
you treated the captain before,

46
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,670
Miss?

47
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,790
Yes.

48
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,390
Have you given him any medicine?

49
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:49,910
Yes.

50
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,170
Hey.

51
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,530
What do you mean by that?

52
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,710
Are you suspecting

53
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,190
that Yan was the one who poisoned the captain?

54
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,950
Can't you think about it carefully

55
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,670
with your head?

56
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,050
Why would she want to kill the captain,

57
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,829
and why would she poison him

58
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,470
in the name of treating his illness?

59
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,270
The captainâ€™s cultivation level was above Yuanying.

60
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,390
Taking his life

61
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,440
is not something ordinary people can do.

62
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,430
However,

63
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,840
he died of a severe poison attack.

64
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,810
We investigated all the people

65
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,750
who've been in contact with the captain recently.

66
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,990
She

67
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,000
is the most suspicious one.

68
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,240
Hey.

69
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,070
What on earth are you hiding?

70
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,210
I've told you just now.

71
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,130
I've been through numerous medical books,

72
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,320
and I've been a doctor for years.

73
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,410
There's no way

74
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:30,230
I misjudged the cause of death in this case.

75
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,520
According to the rules,

76
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,500
things that can easily be smuggled

77
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,880
cannot be brought on board the whaleboat.

78
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,710
Did you buy the medicine you used

79
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,150
from a pharmacy, Miss?

80
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,260
Yin.

81
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,079
Who are you?

82
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,610
Are you Ji Yang,

83
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,350
or a liar

84
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,280
wearing the mask of Ji Yang's face?

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,550
Ji Yang would never kill innocent people

86
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,530
like you did.

87
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,430
I saw with my own eyes

88
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,870
that you killed the captain with demonic aura.

89
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,670
Ji Yang. Ji Yang. Ji Yang.

90
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,000
It's Ji Yang again.

91
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,700
I'm so tired of hearing this name.

92
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,650
So you're really not him.

93
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,980
Of course not.

94
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,010
To think she's still fantasizing about you being him.

95
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,310
You people are ridiculous.

96
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,870
You'd rather accept that a whaleboat

97
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,110
can travel a thousand miles a day,

98
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,970
an ocean can turn into a farmland,

99
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,000
but you just wouldn't accept that...

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,260
That Ji Yang rebelled and became a demon?

101
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,920
Is becoming a demon something to be proud of?

102
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,240
Do you think you can do whatever you want just because you've become a demon?

103
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,070
You caused trouble,

104
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,040
then you ran away

105
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,930
and hid from it.

106
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,950
You even made Nan Yan

107
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,950
take the blame for you as a murderer.

108
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,040
Nan Yan?

109
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,630
The Ji Yang I know

110
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,730
would never let the person he loves suffer.

111
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,530
What trick did you use

112
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,250
to make her trust you so much?

113
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,840
Even in the face of everyone's suspicion,

114
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,830
she still insisted on concealing the fact

115
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,360
that you've become a demon.

116
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,290
She defended you like that,

117
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,430
but how did you treat her?

118
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,750
You dare not admit

119
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,880
what you did, right?

120
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,670
I will tell the public the truth.

121
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,520
You can tell the public,

122
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,800
but I need to remind you.

123
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,220
If you let people know I'm a demon,

124
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,440
wouldn't Nan Yan, who you want to protect,

125
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,990
be in greater danger

126
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,350
since she defended me?

[Cold Remedy]

00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:36,909
Are you sure it was

129
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,510
this lady who came here to buy drugs

130
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,570
the last two times?

131
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,390
Yes.

132
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,510
The day before yesterday,

133
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,310
you came here to buy a herb

134
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,830
called Deadly Grass.

135
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,510
Yes.

136
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,710
This herb was used

137
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,550
to treat the captain's illness.

138
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,490
Yesterday,

139
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,800
you came to buy another herb.

140
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,020
Although I don't know medicine,

141
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,410
I've heard of this herb.

142
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,390
It's said

143
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,900
to be highly poisonous.

144
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,670
If taken carelessly,

145
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,710
it can be life-threatening.

146
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,790
Where is

147
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,030
this herb now?

148
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,000
This herb has been refined into an elixir.

149
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,220
What a coincidence.

150
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,740
So what's the purpose of the elixir you made?

151
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,590
To save someone.

152
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,450
And who is that?

153
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,910
Tell me.

154
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,120
Did you

155
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,580
mix this poison into the medicine

156
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,220
and kill the captain?

157
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,290
Nonsense.

158
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,900
The coroner just confirmed that

159
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,260
the poison left in the captain's body

160
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,580
is Heart Slaying Sand.

161
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,190
What else do you have to say in your defense?

162
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,470
There's something fishy about this.

163
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,470
This must be a premeditated murder.

164
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,710
You're about to be sentenced to death, yet you still wouldn't admit it?

165
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,990
You just admitted that

166
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,470
you were the one who bought Heart Slaying Sand.

167
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,360
If it wasn't for the captain,

168
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,420
then who was it for?

169
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,550
Bring that person here.

170
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,280
I'll confront him face to face.

171
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,000
It's not the whaleboat's business

172
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,270
whose life I want to save and what kind of medicine I use to do that, right?

173
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,830
This concerns the death of the captain.

174
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,430
I'll investigate this matter to the end today.

175
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,400
If you tell me the truth

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,460
and prove your innocence,

177
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,520
I won't give you a hard time.

178
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,510
A clean hand wants no washing.

179
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,310
Why should I prove myself to you?

180
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,000
Since you refuse to confess,

181
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,360
don't blame me for being rude.

182
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,390
Guards!

183
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,419
Lock her up!

184
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,460
The captain saved my life.

185
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,080
Even if I have to risk my life,

186
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,010
I'll make the murderer

187
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,690
pay with his or her life.

188
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,930
No matter how many times you ask me,

189
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:01,950
I didn't

190
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,510
kill him.

191
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,670
If you didn't,

192
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,720
then tell me the truth.

193
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,550
Who else did you use Heart Slaying Sand on?

194
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,520
You just wouldn't admit it, right?

195
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,230
I'll ask you one last time.

196
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,750
Are you going to say it or not?

197
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,350
Do you want to die?

198
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,860
Are you hurt?

199
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,740
I'm okay.

200
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:35,700
Who

201
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,120
are you?

202
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,630
Who are you to touch her?

203
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,530
Even if she's not the one

204
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,750
who murdered the captain,

205
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,210
she must be an accomplice.

206
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,410
A life for a life.

207
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,150
Calm down!

208
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,200
Go after them!

209
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,150
We were walking fine.

210
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,350
Why did you suddenly stop?

211
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,980
What?

212
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,270
You think I'm too slow?

213
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:23,900
No.

214
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,030
I was thinking about

215
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,090
getting home soon and writing poems.

216
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,470
I heard

217
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,150
Chief Nan Fang once lived here.

218
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,720
Where did she live?

219
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,550
She...

220
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,870
Why do you ask?

221
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,080
After all,

222
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,990
she was once a member of the Yao Palace.

223
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,050
It's a family affair. Why can't I ask?

224
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,330
Right over there.

225
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,270
But that place is always locked.

226
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,930
My father never let anyone in.

227
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,110
Got it.

228
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,080
You can go.

229
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,930
I can walk by myself from here.

230
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,840
By the way, don't worry.

231
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,260
I won't tell your father.

232
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,290
Well,

233
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,100
can you not tell my father

234
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,410
about the Poetry Meeting as well?

235
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,150
Depending on my mood.

236
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,440
Wei Rui, let's go.

237
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,670
She left just like that?

238
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:19,910
My Lady.

239
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,430
Your fiancee seems to be a nice man.

240
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,490
He's simple and honest,

241
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,850
and he's very polite to you.

242
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,630
Why did you deliberately

243
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,670
embarrass him

244
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,010
and make him lose face?

245
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,160
What do you know?

246
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,830
If I keep being nice to him

247
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,870
and talking to him with a smile,

248
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,710
how could I make him

249
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,310
break off the engagement himself?

250
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,120
So you

251
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,620
did it on purpose, My Lady.

252
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,150
All right. Enough about this.

253
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,150
Let's go.

254
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,430
My Lady.

255
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,890
Where are we going?

256
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,420
We're guests here. It's inappropriate

257
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,170
to run around like this, right?

258
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,830
What's there to be scared of?

259
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,150
I forgot to tell you that

260
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,950
the real reason why I came to the Dragon Capital

261
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,950
is to visit Chief Nan Fang's old house.

262
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,990
What happened?

263
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,710
There was a raid on the whaleboat.

264
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,710
The woman who killed the captain

265
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,510
was abducted.

266
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,960
It must be Yin who did it.

267
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,390
That jinx.

268
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,230
Wouldn't it be equivalent to

269
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,830
pleading guilty for Nan Yan?

270
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,450
Don't hurt him.

271
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,200
He said I'm a jinx.

272
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:17,870
I must...

273
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,810
Come out.

274
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,680
I know you're nearby.

275
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:29,790
Yin.

276
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,390
You have a guilty conscience.

277
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,880
It's understandable that you don't dare to come out.

278
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,640
Nan Yan.

279
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,480
Even you want to avoid me?

280
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,990
Back then at the bottom of the Traceless Cliff,

281
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,290
Ji Yang would rather sacrifice himself

282
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,380
to save your life.

283
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,600
But look

284
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,630
what Yin has done.

285
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,670
He destroyed the entire Lunar Sect

286
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,770
and killed the captain.

287
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,230
He even tried to frame you.

288
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,860
Without the suppression of the Bloody-handed Asura,

289
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,110
he can recklessly escape from prison

290
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,110
with the Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

291
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,660
This is his scheme, Nan Yan.

292
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,860
Are you okay?

293
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,830
Why would you rather be tortured

294
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,040
than tell the truth?

295
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,500
Do you want

296
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,560
everyone to know

297
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,110
that you've become a demon?

298
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,010
So what?

299
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,360
What can those nobodies do to me?

300
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,050
They can't kill you,

301
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,550
but what if this matter

302
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,680
alerted Dragon Lord

303
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,610
or the entire cultivation realm?

304
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,830
Then I'll fight anyone who gets in my way,

305
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,270
whether it's a demon or a god.

306
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,150
Have you forgotten

307
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,750
what you promised me before?

308
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,310
No, I haven't.

309
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,780
I promised you that

310
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,530
I'll try my best to avoid causing trouble in the future.

311
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,070
But this time,

312
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,650
they caused you trouble.

313
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,470
But as you see,

314
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,310
I'm safe and sound, aren't I?

315
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,790
So you have to promise me that

316
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,070
you won't be so presumptuous

317
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,990
again.

318
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,610
If you don't say anything,

319
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,870
I'll take that as a yes.

320
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,110
The top priority now

321
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,710
is to find the real murderer.

322
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,580
Let's go.

323
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,530
You said she was not the real murderer.

324
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,870
Why should I believe you?

325
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,930
When the captain died,

326
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,440
I saw

327
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,730
Young Lord Yin nearby.

328
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,140
Is that true?

329
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,400
I'll help you locate them,

330
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,420
but you have to keep your promise that

331
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,160
you'll only arrest Yin

332
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
and let Nan Yan go.

333
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,030
If she really

334
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,160
is not the murderer,

335
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,270
I'll definitely clear her name.

336
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,280
You said just now that

337
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,760
you went to the crime scene

338
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,530
because

339
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,790
the captain sent you a letter saying he wanted to see you?

340
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,210
[Heavenly No. 3]

341
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,000
When I arrived,

342
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,980
the captain was already dead.

343
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,970
It seems that

344
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,610
the murderer wanted to frame you in the first place.

345
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,830
Where did that person get

346
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,120
the Heart Slaying Sand that poisoned the captain to death?

347
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,510
Oh right.

348
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,550
According to the medical book,

349
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,380
the Heart Slaying Sand

350
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,210
is made by grinding and refining volcanic stones

351
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,470
from Qisong, Xichuan.

352
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,470
It's silver-white all over,

353
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,610
and it has a graceful appearance.

354
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,120
Some people also

355
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,280
polished it into hairpins by mistake.

356
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,590
If they polished it and

357
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,830
wore it on their body,

358
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,590
they could indeed bring it on board without being noticed.

359
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,550
In that case,

360
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,950
the murderer is very likely to be a woman.

361
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,480
A woman?

362
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,920
Have I ever had contact with

363
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,020
other women besides you?

364
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,030
Are you asking me

365
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,390
or yourself?

366
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,270
If that's the case,

367
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,119
there are a lot of suspects.

368
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:11,910
Didn't you say that

369
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,990
you only had contact with three people?

370
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,550
No.

371
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,280
I mean

372
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,980
it could really be a woman.

373
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:21,589
But

374
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,150
it's not me who had contact with them.

375
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:23,609
It's...

376
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,940
It's Yuan Feng.

377
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,940
Yuan Feng?

378
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Thank you for reminding me, though.

379
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,150
This matter

380
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,750
is probably related to the Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

381
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,760
Blood Phoenix Hairpin?

382
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,000
Let's go.

383
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,070
Dad.

384
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,170
Zhanting.

385
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,980
You met Nian for the first time today.

386
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,440
What do you think of her?

387
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,990
Nian is...

388
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,690
Great.

389
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,330
She's well-educated and gentle.

390
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,960
Just as her name indicates,

391
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,990
she's indeed unforgettable.

392
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,840
Unfortunately, God doesn't favor me.

393
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,420
Now, my career is going nowhere.

394
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,810
I'm afraid I'm not good enough for Miss Yun.

395
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,410
Maybe we should talk about it

396
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,830
after I go out there and make a name for myself.

397
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,580
Why?

398
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,570
Now you regret it?

399
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,560
It's too late to regret!

400
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,410
That's okay, actually.

401
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,210
As the saying goes,

402
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,070
get married first, and then build your career.

403
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,710
You can

404
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,420
marry Nian first.

405
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,240
Take your time

406
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,790
to build your career after that.

407
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,750
It's not too late.

408
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,340
No.

409
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,190
Dad.

410
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,310
What?

411
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,160
Do you have any objections?

412
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,600
No.

413
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,440
No.

414
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,120
What you said was

415
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,400
really inspiring.

416
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,430
I was enlightened

417
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,460
all of a sudden.

418
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,470
So what have you learned?

419
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,680
As the Young Dragon Lord,

420
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,350
I indulged myself in poetry.

421
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,300
It was a huge mistake.

422
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,110
In the future,

423
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,780
I will share your burden

424
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,590
and promote the reputation of Dragon Capital together with you.

425
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,780
You're not trying to escape from marriage, are you?

426
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,150
Of course not.

427
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,030
It's just when I think about getting married,

428
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,890
I suddenly understand what responsibility means.

429
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,190
As your son, if I can't share your burden

430
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,470
and I'm unfaithful and unfilial,

431
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,430
then I won't be able to achieve anything great

432
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,350
as a husband either.

433
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,270
Therefore,

434
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:57,940
I still want to

435
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,780
experience more and let myself mature.

436
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,670
This way,

437
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,410
Nian can see how reliable her future husband is.

438
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,050
My son.

439
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,860
You've really got enlightened.

440
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,320
I'm very glad.

441
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,130
How about this?

442
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,300
I'll hand all 49 whaleboats

443
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,790
over to you.

444
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,330
49?

445
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,530
So many?

446
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,560
Didn't you say you want Nian

447
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,000
to see your endeavor?

448
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,210
They're all businesses of Dragon Capital.

449
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,300
None of them can be neglected.

450
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,640
Guards!

451
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,390
Pass my word.

452
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,520
We'll hold a grand banquet today

453
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,790
to bid farewell to Young Lord.

454
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,190
Yes.

455
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,500
Bid farewell?

456
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,570
Thank you, Dad.

457
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,230
How many times do I have to repeat myself

458
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,790
before you believe me, Young Lord?

459
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,710
This really has nothing to do with me.

460
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,510
Please let me go.

461
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,210
It was you who wrote a letter to me

462
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,630
in the name of the captain

463
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,690
in order to frame me

464
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,650
of poisoning the captain, wasn't it?

465
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,230
This letter...

466
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,000
I've never seen this letter.

467
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,530
Why did you sneer, Young Lord?

468
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,480
Your poor acting skills made me laugh.

469
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,570
Yet you tried to imitate someone else to be a spy.

470
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,230
I have no grudge against you, Young Lord.

471
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,700
Why would I frame you?

472
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,830
You do hold no grudge against me.

473
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,790
But after all, I have

474
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,340
the Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

475
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,570
Blood Phoenix Hairpin?

476
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,230
What... What are you talking about?

477
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:43,920
I...

478
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,270
I don't know that.

479
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,580
Someone stole the Blood Phoenix Hairpin

480
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,740
from Meng Ying

481
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,030
and gave it to Yuan Feng for smuggling.

482
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,260
But unexpectedly,

483
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,500
Yuan Feng defected to him.

484
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,850
The Blood Phoenix Hairpin

485
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,170
naturally fell into his hands.

486
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,930
The person behind you

487
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,620
wouldn't be assured

488
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,920
to let Yuan Feng guard it alone.

489
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,170
He'd definitely send someone else to spy on Yuan Feng.

490
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,560
It turns out that

491
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,550
Yuan Feng did drop the ball.

492
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,320
Zhao Meiji, it's really you.

493
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,020
You hid it so well.

494
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,570
I trusted you,

495
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,190
and you took so much advantage of me.

496
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,910
Bah!

497
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,420
Shameless!

498
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,390
Loser!

499
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,140
Since you already know,

500
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,740
don't blame me for being cruel.

501
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,690
Oh no!

502
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,710
She's trying to destroy the boat.

503
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,230
The jade amulet has been destroyed.

504
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,900
The whaleboat barrier is about to disappear,

505
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,150
and the boat will disintegrate and fall into the sea.

506
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,240
All of you

507
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,910
will die with me.

508
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,580
Oh no!

509
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,850
It's all over!

510
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,530
Hey, you two.

511
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,280
You are dying.

512
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,100
Why are you so calm?

513
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,910
You're about to die.

514
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,040
Why do you still dare to look at me like that?

515
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,920
Why does she

516
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,190
have to be so dramatic?

517
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,870
You're even casting sheep's eyes at each other.

518
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,990
You will be handed over to the Dragon Capital.

519
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,590
No one here

520
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,960
will die.

521
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,240
Impossible.

522
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,600
This is impossible.

523
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,430
Why hasn't the whaleboat disintegrated yet?

524
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,550
What happened?

525
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:45,890
This...

526
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,200
This is impossible.

527
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,810
This is impossible.

528
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,810
This...

529
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,300
This is impossible.

530
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,560
Excuse me.

531
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,770
So not only do you know that

532
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,120
the murderer is someone else,

533
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,890
you also know that Dragon Lord will come today.

534
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,290
No wonder you are so calm.

535
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,490
I, Young Lord,

536
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,940
am here on my father's order.

537
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,500
This token

538
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,340
can command all 49 whaleboats.

539
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,540
Seeing this token equals seeing the Dragon Lord himself.

540
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,200
I'm in charge of the whaleboat

541
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,080
today.

542
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,380
Greetings, Young Lord.

543
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,610
Even the Young Lord is here.

544
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,540
Tell me about it.

545
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,460
Nan Yan!

546
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,490
I miss you so much.

547
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,590
Nan Yan.

548
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,780
Luckily, you sent me a message in advance,

549
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,340
so I managed to get here through my father's formation.

550
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,030
Otherwise,

551
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,210
you'd all become fish food today.

552
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,970
It's you, Big Brother.

553
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,470
I've never admired you

554
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,520
so much as I do today.

555
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,310
My Big Brother.

556
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,940
You'll be my elder brother from now on.

557
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,660
Okay. Okay.

558
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,510
From now on...

559
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,590
Go away!

560
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,140
Ji Yang.

561
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,230
Ji Yang!

562
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,670
I...

563
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,540
Am I dreaming?

564
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,150
I'm not Ji Yang.

565
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,290
You're still alive.

566
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,850
You're still alive!

567
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,060
I'm not Ji Yang.

568
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,710
You're still alive!

569
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,850
Let me see.

570
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,630
Let me see.

571
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,740
I'm not Ji Yang.

572
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,320
You stinky fox!

573
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,430
How could you not tell me

574
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,430
such an important thing in advance?

575
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,310
How would I know

576
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,350
if he's the real Ji Yang?

577
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,710
I thought he killed the captain

578
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,330
and had other intentions towards Nan Yan.

579
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,050
Nonsense!

580
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,610
If he isn't Ji Yang,

581
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,940
then who is he? Zhu Yang?

582
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,810
How could you suspect him?

583
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,640
He's just very suspicious.

584
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,670
But today,

585
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,260
it proves that he has nothing to do

586
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,120
with the captain's case.

587
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,900
Yang!

588
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,330
This is great.

589
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:20,970
Yang!

590
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,430
How many more weird brothers

591
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,630
like this do you have?

592
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,570
I...

593
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,680
And you.

594
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,470
I don't care

595
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,930
what you think of me at all.

596
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,480
Let's go.

597
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,070
I'll trust you like Nan Yan does

598
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,990
for the moment.

599
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:44,710
But if you ever

600
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,830
make Nan Yan sad,

601
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,150
I'll risk my life

602
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,320
to get even with you.

603
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,990
Do you hear me?

604
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,480
You all just left like that?

605
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,230
So you're not that excited to see me.

606
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,110
[Order]

607
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,790
No one is curious about my token either.

608
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,590
Hey. If you are curious,

609
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,830
I can tell you about it.

610
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,890
It wasn't easy to get this token. I...

611
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,000
I've talked to the judicial cultivator.

612
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,870
He'll go see Zhao Meiji

613
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,330
in the next couple of days.

614
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,150
Before we get off the whaleboat,

615
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,210
we'll find out the person behind her.

616
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,230
The person behind her

617
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,680
is the one who destroyed the Lunar Sect.

618
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,230
So what are we waiting for?

619
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,750
I'm in charge of the whaleboat now.

620
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,280
Let's get it done right now.

621
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,030
There's no need to investigate anymore.

622
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,360
It's the Evil Path Sect.

623
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,070
She told you?

624
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,640
Why should we believe

625
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,990
what she said is the truth?

626
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,260
Believe it or not,

627
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,190
I don't care.

628
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,670
What did you see?

629
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,730
Before she died,

630
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,720
she begged me

631
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,310
to kill her.

632
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,490
I found something.

633
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,690
Why do I feel

634
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,610
you're different from before?

635
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,170
But it doesn't matter.

636
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,190
No matter it's the Evil Path Sect

637
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,070
or the Evil Road Sect,

638
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,400
with me and Ji Yang here,

639
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,600
we're not afraid of him.

640
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,400
I even wish

641
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,390
they could come earlier.

642
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,050
This way, we can take revenge.

643
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,760
Today,

644
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,830
let's celebrate my brother's resurrection.

645
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,290
Come on.

646
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,510
Let's start drinking.

647
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,610
Right, before we start,

648
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,210
I have something else to say.

649
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,870
We meet again after a long time.

650
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,870
Just make yourselves comfortable.

651
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,270
Drink as much and

652
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,770
sing as loudly as you want.

653
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,190
Especially you, Ji Yang.

654
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,450
You seem a bit aloof.

655
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,880
Don't drink alone.

656
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,330
Come on.

657
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,460
I'll drink with you.

658
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,550
Long time no see.

659
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,510
Who are you?

660
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,200
I...

661
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,190
Didn't I tell you?

662
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,390
After he came back to life,

663
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,720
he lost his memory completely.

664
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,170
Are you kidding me?

665
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,120
Also,

666
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,950
he's become a demon.

667
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,080
He's become a demon?

668
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,420
So,

669
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,290
you don't remember who I am?

670
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,950
The four of us lived

671
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,200
in the Lunar Sect for so long,

672
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,360
and we went to Filth Valley together.

673
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,490
I think It's safe to say

674
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,820
we're devoted friends.

675
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,480
So what if he's become a demon?

676
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,410
It's fine.

677
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,150
But the point is,

678
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,470
how could you forget

679
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,180
about our past just like that?

680
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,980
Three years ago,

681
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,860
I woke up in Dragon Capital.

682
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,920
I found out

683
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,750
you were buried under the Filth Valley alone.

684
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,730
I specially wrote

685
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,290
10 memorial poems for you.

686
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,720
I read them every day

687
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,610
and pondered them over and over again.

688
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,350
If you don't believe me,

689
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,750
I can read them to you now.

690
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,350
10 memorial poems?

691
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,710
Fine.

692
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,740
Read them to me.

693
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:18,940
Okay, I'll read.

694
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,450
Listen up.

695
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,150
Ji Yang was born with shocking talents.

696
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,370
He was murdered once he entered the Filth Valley.

697
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,580
He died a miserable death.

698
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,430
Let's continue to be brothers in the next life.

699
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,310
You are not going to tell me

700
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,670
all ten poems

701
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,770
are of this level, are you?

702
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,060
Have you really forgotten?

703
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,910
You used to know me so well!

704
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,830
Fine.

705
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,350
Even if you lost your memory,

706
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,840
and even if you don't remember us,

707
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,730
you wouldn't forget Nan Yan, right?

708
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,460
Big Brother.

709
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,680
Stop it.

710
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,170
How can I stop?

711
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,590
Nan Yan never forgot you for a moment.

712
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,000
How could you forget her?

713
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,030
Even if you forget

714
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,990
all the people in this world,

715
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,190
you can't forget her.

716
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,090
Who is she?

717
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,890
She...

718
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:16,700
She...

719
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,870
She's the person

720
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,010
who you were willing to

721
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,610
do anything, even sanitation work and fertilizing fields, for.

722
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,710
It seems that

723
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,560
the past days were not so good.

724
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,000
So do you remember

725
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,010
Nan Yan,

726
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,330
who knows you don't like spicy food

727
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,460
when eating hotpot?

728
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,030
She treated your illness.

729
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,660
Right.

730
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,990
She fed you medicine.

731
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,740
She took the brunt of thunder for you.

732
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,230
Really?

733
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,850
You've forgotten all these?

734
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,570
Even if you forget all these,

735
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,030
do you remember that

736
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,900
you were eloquent and articulate at 6,

737
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,310
you won the champion of magic at 8,

738
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,750
you reached the Yuanying Soul Realm at 13,

739
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,350
and took the throne of monarch at 16?

740
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,430
Your talent is far beyond our generation.

741
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,070
Enough!

742
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,520
I said I'm not Ji Yang.

743
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,820
I'm Yin now.

744
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,590
I don't care.

745
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,850
I don't care who you are.

746
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,870
To me,

747
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,910
you are the only Shao Cang

748
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,010
in the four seas.

749
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,740
What about you?

750
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,490
I only believe what I see with my own eyes.

751
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,960
Ji Yang may have forgotten,

752
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,990
but I still remember.

753
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,010
You've never been so slow

754
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:03,940
in poem writing.

755
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,910
Look how anxious I am.

756
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,110
There's inner heat in me. I even got a pimple.

757
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,710
See?

758
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,590
I've written poems

759
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,390
about Dragon Capital, in memory of Shao Cang,

760
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,720
and about my ambitions.

761
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,910
This is the first time.

762
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,240
I still don't know how to write poems.

763
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,310
Actually, it's not difficult to write poems.

764
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,310
Just write down what's on your mind.

765
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,370
It's either to commemorate someone

766
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,780
or to tell a story.

767
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,970
So many things happened in the Lunar Sect.

768
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,580
I don't know where to start.

769
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,500
Mr. Meng

770
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,130
was obsessed with Mahjong.

771
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,560
That's a story.

772
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,770
He took me his his disciple.

773
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,230
That's a story.

774
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,520
He wrote a life-saving letter for you.

775
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,670
That's a story.

776
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,880
Also,

777
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,510
Mr. Meng stepped forward

778
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,150
under the Celestial Lightning of Truth.

779
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,280
That's also a story.

780
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,389
When the barrier of Filth Valley closed,

781
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,820
Mr. Meng tried his best to protect you

782
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,679
and Nan Yan to leave the valley, that's also a story.

783
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,300
In that case,

784
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,830
none of us has done anything

785
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,710
for Mr. Meng.

786
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,030
Got it.

787
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,560
The Mahjong table is full of ups and downs.

788
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,270
He's the one surnamed Meng in the Lunar Sect.

789
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:43,219
Young Lord left home in pursuit of another way of life.

790
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,800
There is a place to return to on Lunar Mountain.

791
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,120
Lunar Mountain in Lunar Town.

792
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:56,000
A place to enjoy peace of mind outside the world.

793
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,540
One day, he drew his sword at the sight of injustice.

794
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:06,550
A once carefree wanderer has become an immortal.

795
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,400
There's no retraction of a chess move.

796
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,060
I'll let you

797
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,590
win this round.

798
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,110
All right.

799
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,060
Later,

800
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,910
when we go back to Lunar Mountain,

801
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,040
let's burn this poem

802
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,830
for Mr. Meng.

803
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,770
I hope there will be such a day.

804
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,840
What do you mean you hope?

805
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,420
Why did you say that?

806
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,060
The whaleboat will dock at dusk today.

807
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,390
The future is uncertain.

808
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,710
I don't know

809
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,910
if Lunar Mountain in Lunar Town

810
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,370
is a place we can go back to.

811
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,330
Alright, stop worrying,

812
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,350
Have lunch with me.

813
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,030
Today, everything on the whaleboat is on the house.

814
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:52,560
Let's go.

815
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,680
What were you thinking?

816
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,550
Zhao Meiji

817
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,970
caused such big trouble.

818
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,990
That mastermind from the Evil Path Sect

819
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,190
must have noticed.

820
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,640
At this time,

821
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,670
you still want to continue this deal?

822
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,230
This...

823
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,310
Aren't you

824
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,770
throwing me under the bus?

825
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,270
The Dragon Lord's token is in command of the whaleboat.

826
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,210
It'll ensure that the whaleboat

827
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,770
arrives on time.

828
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,030
The Evil Path Sect won't notice anything unusual.

829
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,510
You just need to tell us

830
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,670
your delivery plan.

831
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,590
Don't ask anything else.

832
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,050
Young Lord.

833
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,670
Are you thinking about getting that deal done instead of me

834
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,710
to smoke them out?

835
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,270
Alright, I won't ask.

836
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,730
Please take a look.

837
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,580
Several miles away from Nancang Pier,

838
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,940
[Yumen Inn]

839
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,140
there's a place called Yumen Inn.

840
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,920
This inn

841
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,310
will reserve

842
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,390
it's only superior room for me.

843
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,270
I'll just need to put the Blood Phoenix Hairpin

844
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,930
into the wardrobe in the room,

845
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,080
and my mission will be considered completed.

846
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,480
Food's here.

847
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,620
Salt-baked Chicken Drumsticks.

848
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,490
Braised Chicken Drumsticks.

849
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,690
What is this?

850
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,320
Garlic Chicken Drumsticks.

851
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,580
And Fried Drumsticks.

852
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,170
It's all about drumsticks today.

853
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,060
Eat as much as you want.

854
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,320
There's enough for us.

855
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,770
Why aren't you eating?

856
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,840
There are so many dishes.

857
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,870
Shouldn't we ask Nan Yan and Ji Yang

858
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,130
to come and eat with us?

859
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,370
Maybe we should leave them alone.

860
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,350
We should also discuss

861
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,990
what we'll do after the whaleboat docks with them.

862
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,310
There's no rush

863
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,370
for the time being.

864
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,100
Why do I feel

865
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,940
you've changed?

866
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,940
Is it because you stayed on the mountain for too long?

867
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,390
You've even quit drumsticks.

868
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,520
I've got inner heat,

869
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,590
but I don't care.

870
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,120
Mr. Meng has not been avenged.

871
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,050
The real murderer is unfathomable.

872
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,630
There's so much going on on my mind,

873
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,830
so I have no appetite.

874
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,470
If this happened to you

875
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,820
three years ago,

876
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,000
you'd have chosen to avoid it as much as you could.

877
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,060
That's why I always say

878
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,990
you foxes are the smartest.

879
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,270
Back then,

880
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,350
I had to do my best

881
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,730
just to survive.

882
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,190
If it weren't for you

883
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,400
and Mr. Meng,

884
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,950
I might have become a scarf a long time ago.

885
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,150
But it's the same now.

886
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,310
There's no difference.

887
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,070
You're still

888
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,230
trying your best

889
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,460
to live a more comfortable life.

890
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,790
There's wine and meat in front of us.

891
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,050
There's no need to worry about tomorrow.

892
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,190
Once you have emotions,

893
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,360
it's hard to relax.

894
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,080
And it's harder to survive.

895
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,580
Yin Ya.

896
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,100
Although it's hard

897
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,850
and tiring,

898
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,050
sincerity is precious.

899
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,410
Compared to tens of thousands of spirit stones,

900
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,910
the treasures of the four seas

901
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,440
and infinite cultivation,

902
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,000
only sincerity

903
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,750
is worth pursuing.

904
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,430
We understand your sincerity.

905
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,760
And we understand your difficulties.

906
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,150
As for Mr. Meng,

907
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,650
you have us.

908
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,990
I wanted to

909
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,470
save this sincerity

910
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,540
to save my people.

911
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,680
But now, we have to

912
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,410
break through the Spirit-Sealing Formation.

913
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,940
And we don't have a clue yet.

914
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,450
It's useless

915
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
to keep it inside.

916
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,120
It's better to take revenge with it.

917
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,670
It seems

918
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,880
I can't call you Smart Fox anymore.

919
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,870
If you don't call me Smart Fox,

920
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,760
what will you call me? Silly Fox?

921
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,820
That sounds awful.

922
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,220
I'll call you Dead Fox.

923
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,450
Are you cursing me on purpose?

924
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,020
The fox I was talking about

925
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,690
is the little fox demon

926
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,990
who drifted in the ups and downs of life.

927
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,970
He did die.

928
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,070
It's said that

929
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,420
a fox has nine lives.

930
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,470
From now on,

931
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,290
live well.

932
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,350
Show me

933
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,270
what else you can become, Yin Ya.

934
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,190
Come on.

935
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:52,970
Cheers.

936
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,070
Come on.

937
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:10,550
Take it.

938
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,680
Wait, Young Lord.

939
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,560
The reward for this deal

940
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,050
cannot be this much.

941
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,160
This is...

942
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,480
Severance payment.

943
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,840
It'll be dangerous from now on.

944
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
You don't have to follow us anymore.

945
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:26,490
This...

946
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,320
Young Lord.

947
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,000
What did I do wrong?

948
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,470
Just tell me.

949
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,030
If you want me to leave now,

950
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,510
isn't this equivalent to

951
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,150
giving my life to Evil Path Sect?

952
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,150
Young Lord.

953
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,340
After the delivery,

954
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,680
we'll spread the word

955
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,710
that Yuan Feng is dead.

956
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,330
If you have nowhere to go,

957
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,730
you can change your name

958
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,300
and go live in Lunar Town.

959
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,270
Something bad just happened there.

960
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,800
I don't think the Evil Path Sect will go there.

961
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,110
If I pretend to be dead...

962
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,590
What are you waiting for?

963
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,670
Thank her.

964
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,780
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

965
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:03,870
It's just in the future,

966
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,220
you need to change your name

967
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,160
and be more cautious.

968
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,160
If...

969
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,990
I understand.

970
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,640
You mean flirting?

971
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,780
Don't worry.

972
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,470
From now on,

973
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,990
I won't even look at girls.

974
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:20,890
Young Lord.

975
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,410
The Blood Phoenix Hairpin is extraordinary.

976
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,740
Since you get involved,

977
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,690
there will be endless trouble.

978
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,670
Please

979
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,460
be more careful in the future.
