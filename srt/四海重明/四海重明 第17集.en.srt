00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,370
I'm not the only one

6
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,980

It doesn't matter.

15
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,420
It's your fate that you cannot escape from protecting

I failed in protecting your Blood Phoenix Hairpin.

That demon covets it.

21

The purpose must be to gather the power of the Yin Zhus

can decipher them.

By following the scent of Yin Zhu,

110

we should be able to uncover the truth.

the Blood Phoenix Hairpin

114
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,320
can break the array at Youquan Prison in Nancang.

115
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,390
You must catch up with him,

116

and retrieve the hairpin.

117

121
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,030
Why bother snatching the hairpin?

122
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,870
I can just go to the next prison

If he truly is the reincarnated Sen Luo,

Hurry up, let’s go!

351
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,090
Hurry up!

352
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,750
Magnificent!

353
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,470
This whale

354
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,990
must be thousands of feet long, right?

355
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,190
With it as the escort,

356
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,460
the monsters in the sea won’t dare approach.

357
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,270
If it were

358
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,270
any smaller boat,

359
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,190
it would be swallowed up

360
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,790
as soon as it entered the sea.

361
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,410
That makes sense.

362
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,230
Let's go.

363
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,560
Let's go and take a look.

Let's go.

365
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,710
Those who want to board the whaleboat,

line up.

Let's go.

Hurry up.

370
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,110
What sect are you from?

371
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,860
I'm Chen Yu

372
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,540
from the Jingmen Sect.

373
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,220
Next.

374
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,790
How dare you, a demon, try to deceive us?

375
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,430
Demon?

376
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,700
He's a demon.

377
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,310
Do you think you can frame others at will

378
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,120
just because you're from Dragon Capital?

379
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,050
Three years ago,

380
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,670
the Evil Path Sect used concealment talismans

381
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,130
to infiltrate the Filth Valley in the North.

382
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,480
We have long since developed

383
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,910
a method to identify demons.

384
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,640
Now,

385
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,910
how dare you use the same old trick again?

386
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,500
It's ridiculous!

387

[Jintang Pier]

388
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,450
These people are quite something.

389
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,210
If they obstruct us,

390
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,670
just kill them all.

391
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,440
If you destroy the whaleboat,

392
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,170
are you planning to walk to the Nancang Demon Sea?

393
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,970
Hiding demonic aura

394
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,940
is easy

395
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,780
for me.

[Yin from the Lunar Sect]

403
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,350
The inspection this time is very strict.

404
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,350
But we can be relieved now.

405
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,490
They have found a demon.

406
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,820
Now there's no problem.

407

How is it?

408
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,310
As expected,

409
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,970
the scent of Yin Zhu has gotten on the whaleboat.

410
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,190
The demon is up to something big.

411
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,670
If any more demons

412
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,160
dare to use concealment talismans to sneak through,

413
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,090
they will be killed without mercy.

414
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,030
I didn't prepare for it.

415
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,670
I didn't expect

416
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,600
the inspection to be so strict now.

417
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,390
Here.

418
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,380
Give it back to me after we get off the whaleboat.

419
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,160
You really do care for me the most.

420
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,130
Put it on.

421
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,150
The whaleboat is like a small city.

422
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:54,990
The city

423
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,480
is divided into three areas.

424
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,510
The place we just stayed

425
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,510
is the guest area.

426
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,070
This is the trading area,

427
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,530
where all sorts of people gather,

428
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,600
a mix of good and bad,

429
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,110
so you can find some

430
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,640
rare spiritual treasures.

431
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,700
Why are you walking so fast?

432
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,870
There are so many good things.

433
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,850
We can browse

434
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,630
as we search.

435
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,570
This demon is hard to deal with.

436
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,390
There's not even a trace

437
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,090
of Yin Zhu's scent on the boat.

438
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,670
As long as he doesn’t take action,

439
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,630
he won’t be exposed.

440
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,430
Isn't it a waste of effort

441
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,760
to keep watch like this?

442
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,550
That's why

443
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,190
we can't just wait for him to act.

444
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,620
If he takes action first

445
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,990
and releases the Yin Zhu,

446
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,150
all the thousands of people on this boat

447
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,420
will be doomed.

448
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,570
What is this place?

449
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,310
The management office of the whaleboat.

450
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,270
The captain is a powerful figure

451
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,030
at the Yuanying Level in the cultivation realm.

452
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,150
He handles all the major and minor affairs

453
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,070
on the boat.

454
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,430
If we can team up with the captain for the search,

455
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,560
it will definitely be more effective.

456
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,820
Then let’s go find him.

to discuss with you.

Disciple of Master of Endurance?

464
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,860
You're the Bloody-handed Asura?

465
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,070
Yes.

466
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,590
This is my friend, Yin Ya.

467
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,310
I can be consider an external disciple

468
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,240
of the Sorrow Mountain Brahma Sea.

469
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,530
I've made an exception

470
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,750
and arranged a superior room for you.

471
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,390
If there are any issues with the food

472
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,520
or accommodations,

473
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,990
just speak to the waiter in the guest area.

474
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,950
Sir,

475
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,390
a demonic cultivator has sneaked onto the whaleboat.

476
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,190
Demonic cultivator?

477
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,590
He has Yin Zhu,

478
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,750
which means he’s not an ordinary demonic cultivator.

479
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,330
We’ve tracked him all the way here.

480
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,170
I’m certain

481
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,040
this demon is on the whaleboat.

482
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,880
However, he’s currently concealing his scent and holding his breath,

483
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,480
so we can’t locate him for the moment.

484
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,520
Nonsense!

485
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,030
I’ve been at the helm for decades

486
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,810
without making any mistakes.

487
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,990
If what you said is true

488
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,590
and such a powerful demon

489
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,050
has sneaked onto the ship,

490
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,210
wouldn’t that mean

491
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,090
that both I and the guards

492
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,720
on the whaleboat are blind?

493
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,600
What I said is true.

Please lend your assistance

495
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,280
and help us eliminate this demon.

496

Young lady,

497
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,190
you’re relying on the title of the Bloody-handed Asura

498
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,790
and your word with no evidence,

499

in a game of catching a thief.

501
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,630
I don’t have time for this.

502
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,390
Come on, you old man.

503
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,040
Not only are you blind, but you’re also deaf.

504
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,670
This matter

505
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,710
concerns the lives of everyone on the ship.

506
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,270
Why can’t you hear

507
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,230
a single word from us?

508
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,640
It's none of your business.

509

You attacked us?

512

Do you think I'm afraid of you?

Let's go.

517
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,030
He's so ungrateful.

518
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,750
He must either be stupid

519
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,480
or have serious mental issues.

520
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,880
He indeed has a problem.

521
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,480
He has

522
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,630
a flushed face,

523
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,630
bulging eyes,

524
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,310
and sores on his mouth and tongue,

525
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,710
and he sweats a lot and is sensitive to heat.

526
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,830
These are clear signs

527
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,230
of excessive liver heat.

528
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,280
No wonder I smelled

529
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,970
the stench of sweat from afar.

530
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,540
And his neck

531
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,470
is noticeably

532
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,760
thicker than normal.

533
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,950
It seems that he has a long-standing illness

534
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,110
for which mortal medicines

535
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,510
are no longer effective,

536
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,230
which is why he’s irritable

537
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,310
and has difficulty controlling his emotions.

538
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,470
Even if it’s a terminal illness,

539
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,790
it’s unlikely to be beyond your capabilities.

540
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,630
If we can

541
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,140
cure him,

542
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,430
it will make discussing demon-slaying

543
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,940
with him much easier.

544
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,550
Cure him?

545
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,630
Are you going to use poison?

546
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,830
I haven’t used poison in a long time.

547
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,670
Let’s first

548
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,260
check out the apothecary ahead.

549
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,110
Sure.

550
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,430
Let’s use something strong on him

551
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,110
and show him

552
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:27,950
our strength.

553
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,150
A new poetry collection by Young Dragon Lord is out,

554
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,810
containing exclusive Dragon Capital secrets.

555
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,060
It contains exclusive Dragon Capital secrets.

556
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,080
Take a look at the new book.

557
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,320
I wonder how Big Brother is doing.

558
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,550
He actually managed to publish

559
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,380
a poetry collection under the Dragon Lord's nose?

560
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,840
Could it be that his dad has changed his mind?

561
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,450
Dragon Capital is so boring.

562
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,890
Everyone is just playing tricks.

563
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,290
The tricks aren’t impressive,

564
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,050
but the flattery is loud.

565
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,910
This is not a secret of Dragon Capital.

566
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,620
This is a public execution.

567
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,510
That's him.

568
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,690
Great!

569
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,390
Great!

570
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,430
And there's more.

571
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,350
Young Lord! Young Lord!

572
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,320
It's so hot!

573
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,500
Hurry up!

574
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,200
Look at our Young Lord.

575
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,980
You've improved a lot.

576
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,330
Your fire is unstoppable.

577
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,270
Congratulations,

578
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,560
Young Lord.

579
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,900
You can't say that.

580
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,590
I was

581
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,550
originally a star in the literary world.

582
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,880
It was only for the sake of my friends

583
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,290
that I accidentally

584
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,660
reached the pinnacle of martial arts.

585
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,540
Alright.

586
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,870
That’s enough for today.

587
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,590
I’m now inspired

588
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,810
and eager to go back and write poetry.

589
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,590
Young Lord.

590
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,740
The Dragon Lord said

591
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,060
you must practice for the time

592
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,860
it takes for a full incense stick to burn every day.

593
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,720
How about

594
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,910
doing a martial arts squat for a while?

595
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,810
Well, I...

596
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,160
See?

597
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,200
It must be because the fire was too intense earlier

598
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,300
and made him sweat, right?

599
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,310
Let me wipe it off.

600
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,390
Don't catch a cold.

601
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,540
You were right.

602
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,630
Yes, I do

603
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,590
feel a bit unwell now.

604
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,440
I’ll head back first.

605
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,240
Young Lord.

606
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,510
You don't feel well?

607
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,980
I specifically prepared a secret medicine.

608
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,820
Finish your practice before you leave.

609
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,870
[Cold Medicine]

610
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,820
[Cold Medicine]

611
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,520
Why do you have everything?

612
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,100
[Cold Medicine]

613
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:14,510
Fine.

614
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,900
I don't have to go back.

615
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,300
How about

616
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,620
I recite a poem for you two here?

617
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,620
What do you think?

618
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,750
I haven’t fully absorbed

619
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,670
yesterday’s poem yet.

620
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,310
Could you please hold on a little longer?

621
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,770
You haven't absorbed yet?

622
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,450
Come on.

623
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,300
Being so dull and lax,

624
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,980
how can you make any progress?

625
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,130
Tell me,

626
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,920
how has the response been

627
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,590
to my new poetry collection?

628
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,020
It's already being talked about in the streets.

629
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,950
They just constantly complain...

630
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,570
They...

631
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,190
They are full of praise.

632
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,610
They are all complaining.

633
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,170
Nonsense!

634
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,850
What is there to complain?

635
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,810
They...

636
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,800
They complain that

637
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,290
the word count is not enough.

638
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,550
Look,

639
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,700
I knew it!

640
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,990
This just comes naturally, doesn’t it?

641
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,610
This is just the

642
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,670
perfect scene.

643
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,310
Thoughts gushing forth uncontrollably,

644
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,380
stuck doing squats in the square,

645
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,850
sneezes blasting away with the wind.

646
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,160
And wouldn’t you know it?
Someone’s standing right in my way.

647
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,630
See?

648
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,090
This is what we call professional.

649
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:31,910
Young Lord,

650
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,060
let's just get back to practice, shall we?

651
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,960
Me, practice?

652
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,670
What's the point of me practicing?

653
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,630
You don't know,

654
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,440
Nan Yan,

655
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,330
my sister,

656
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,350
has inherited the true teachings of

657
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,790
the Master of Endurance.

658
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,150
I don't need to protect her.

659
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,230
So tell me, what good is this practice for me?

660
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,230
Absolutely none!

661
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:45,870
But, Young Lord...

662
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,150
Well...

663
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:46,680
Alright.

664
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,000
Now I need to take time

665
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,260
to listen to their feedback,

666
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,000
right?

667
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,790
So when I go out

668
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,920
and meet them again,

669
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,270
I can take these new works

670
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,720
as a reunion gift.

671
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,760
Four copies each

672
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,310
for...

673
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,050
Not one less.

674
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:10,840
OKay.

675
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:11,909
Let's go.

676
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:12,820
Go and see

677
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,510
what the literary world

678
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,960
thinks of me

679
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,050
as a rising star.

680
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,070
Young Lord.

681
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:18,469
Young Lord!

682
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,190
Young Lord.

683
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,150
Practice! Just Practice!

684
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,630
What are you doing?

685
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,310
Practice! Practice!

686
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:21,870
Let me go!

687
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,550
Everything has changed over these three years,

688
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,880
yet he remains the same.

689
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,190
If the Dragon Lord sees

690
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,320
his peculiar poems,

691
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,320
he may not escape unscathed.

692
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,330
Both of you,

693
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,949
our Young Lord is both knowledgeable and talented.

694
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,469
Why not take two books back with you

695
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,469
for a closer look?

696
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,420
How about this?

697
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,670
I'll give you a special offer,

698

You're really good at flattering people.

701

Let's buy two then.

702
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,810
Why?

703
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,920

Father.

705
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,990
Since you asked me to practice martial arts,

706
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,360
I've been working hard

707
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,410
from dawn to dusk every day.

708
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,310
Now that I've mastered it,

709
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,640
Why won't you let me out?

710
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,180
What are you going out for?

711
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:15,840
I...

712
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,550
Is it for your so-called

713
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,150
Mighty Dragon Literary Society again?

714
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,550
I have other things to do.

715
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,670
You promised me that

716
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,270
you would let me write poems.

717
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,330
I did promise you.

718
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,430
But that was because at the gate of Filth Valley,

719
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,690
your little friend

720
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,120
passionately proposed

721
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,160
that I shall respect your hobby.

722
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,060
Okay.

723
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,000
I did so.

724
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,310
And I spent a considerable amount of money

725
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,950
to publish your poetry collection.

726
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,590
But what

727
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,520
you wrote is completely nonsense.

728
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,220
You see my poems?

729
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,630
How would I know if I didn't see it?

730
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,970
You are spouting nonsense,

731
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,870
completely disgracing

732
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,110
Dragon Capital's reputation.

How am I talking nonsense?

734

Art itself is...

735
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,790
It comes from life and is higher than life.

736
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,270
I'm just doing it on a real basis...

paper, and inkstone!

743
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:04,290
He's not allowed to write a single word anymore!

No.

No.

You foolish emperor!

747
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,310
A tyrant!

748
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,870
You have no martial arts ethics!

749
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,050
You can't do this!

Go to the Royal Treasury

752
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,240
and pick some things

that girls would like.

What girls would like.

755

Our Dragon Court

is all men.

757
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,910
And the treasury is full of ancient weapons.

758
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,750
There's nothing that girls would like.

759
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,210
Go buy if there are not any.

760
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,310
We are going to welcome

761
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,460
the lady of the house here very soon.

762
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,800
Are you getting married?

763
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,760
Nonsense!

764
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,120
Talking rubbish!

765
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,720
Young Lord is getting married.

766
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,330
Young Lord is in his prime,

767
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,580
is he marrying early?

768
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,990
This

769

unfilial son

770
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,660
is mostly due to

771
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,200
his immature nature

772
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,870
and being unmarried.

773
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,280
Let him marry early,

774
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,110
firstly, it can bring children and blessings

775
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,370
to our Dragon Capital.

776
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,780
And secondly,

777
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,800
with a wife and child by the hearth,

778
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,440
it could also temper

779
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,190
his impulsive nature.

780
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,240
His Majesty is wise.

781
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,590
Once the Young Lord enters the land of tenderness

782
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,450
he will no longer act recklessly.

783

Master Yun of the Yao Palace

784
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,290
has mentioned to me several times

785
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,900
hoping that Miss Yun Nian

786
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,440
could marry Zhan.

787
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,790
What do you think?

788
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,560
Miss Yun comes from a noble family.

789
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,390
it is said that she is gentle and virtuous,

790

knowledgeable and well-mannered.

791
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,800
If she could often stay by his side,

792
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,670
she would surely make Young Lord more stable.

793

Good.

794
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,190
Very good.

top-quality Wanku grass?

Miss,

807
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,240
the Wanku grass is highly poisonous.

808
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,840
If taken carelessly,

809
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,430
at the least it can cause diarrhea for three days,

810
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,160
and at worst,

811
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,110
it may be utterly devastating.

That intense, huh?

815
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,690
Since it's a poisonous plant,

816
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,240
it can also clear heat when used in medicine.
