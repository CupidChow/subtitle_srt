[Episode 7]

4
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,370
Of course I'm not afraid of him.

5
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,560
It's just I pity him because he doesn't have much time left.

6
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,090
So I'll let it slide for now.

7
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,940
Is that so?

8
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,840
I promise I won't bury you

9
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,470
in the ground before sunset.

10
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,840
Then I promise

11
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,510
you'll live till sunset.

12
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,980
Be careful.

13
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,580
Hurry up.

14
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,410
Get to work.

15
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,270
Okay.

16
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:39,860
Don't hurt him.

17
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,850
Don't come any closer.

18
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,850
Get to work.

19
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,570
Don't rush me.

20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,710
Don't you think about eating her food

21
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,360
if you don't finish the work.

22
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,310
But if you think about it, it's not bad.

23
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,990
It's actually a good thing that

24
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,610
you work your butt off while having to suppress your rage, right?

25
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,740
We're both living under Nan Yan's roof.

26
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,200
What's so noble about you?

27
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,480
Be careful!

28
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,770
Creeping figs are very precious to her.

29
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,500
You must handle them with care.

30
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,670
So troublesome.

31
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,940
I'll put up with you for now

32
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,600
for the silver mermaid pearl.

33
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,280
Slow down.

34
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,630
If you keep eating like this,

35
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,050
I'll go broke in no time.

36
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,690
Yan.

37
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,120
Why are you so nice to him?

38
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,180
Just eat. Mind your own business.

39
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,390
Where did he go?

40
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,400
Why is he still not here for dinner?

41
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,110
If you don't mind me saying,

42
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,800
Yan,

43
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,150
I don't think you know him well enough.

44
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,880
What if he has some ulterior motives towards you?

45
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,140
You can never really know what someone is thinking.

46
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,470
Even if I want to guard against him, there's nothing I can do.

47
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,180
The bastard who trapped you

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,860
in the barrier in Xiagu Street Market

49
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,090
was him, right?

50
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,400
Yan.

51
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,420
You are so kind to him,

52
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,670
and you even cured him of the disease,

53
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,270
but he treated you like that.

54
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,250
Why do you have so much to say?

55
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,090
Just eat.

56
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,250
I'll just say one more thing.

57
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,270
Yan.

58
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,850
You should never let your guard down.

59
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,160
How about

60
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,300
I sleep in your room

61
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,230
from tonight on?

62
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,030
This way, if he

63
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,790
suddenly loses his mind in the middle of the night

64
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,390
and does something bad to you,

65
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,310
I'll be able to protect you.

66
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,900
No need.

67
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,450
We're of different gender, so we should keep our distance.

68
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,540
I'm not a man,

69
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,340
but a male fox.

70
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,420
Go away.

71
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,130
I heard you talk about me mistreating you?

72
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,140
How dare I?

73
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Come on, enjoy your meal.

74
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,930
He has a point, though.

75
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,790
Sometimes, even I don't know

76
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,790
what I've done

77
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,500
when I went crazy.

78
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,440
How about I let him come live with me?

79
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,870
Who wants to live with you?

80
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,530
I want to protect Yan closely.

81
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:54,510
If we share a room,

82
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,710
you can protect her even better, right?

83
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,900
Why are you making all the excuses

84
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,030
and insisting on sleeping in her room?

85
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,130
Could it be that you're up to something evil,

86
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,520
and you want to make it convenient for yourself?

87
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,890
How is that possible?

88
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,330
I have nothing to hide.

89
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,310
I have absolutely no intentions towards Yan.

90
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,560
I'm just staying here

91
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,870
to

92
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,890
make a living.

93
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,930
So what are you scared of?

94
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,190
Why don't you dare to share a room with me?

95
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,880
Who said I'm scared?

96
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,380
Fine, let's do it.

97
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,380
You two can sleep wherever you want.

98
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
But let me make it clear beforehand.

99
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,950
Take it outside if you want to fight.

100
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,670
If you dare to mess up my house,

101
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,380
I'll pack you up and throw you both down the mountain

102
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,440
tomorrow morning.

103
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,580
Don't worry, Yan.

104
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,610
I won't start any trouble.

105
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,890
I will also do the honors

106
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,470
and take good care of him.

107
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,060
Who's that bastard?

108
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,720
The evil will be punished by their own kind.

109
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,590
Was it you?

110
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,190
You're pretending to sleep, aren't you?

111
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,550
It hurts.

112
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,360
It hurts!

113
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,470
I knew it was you.

114
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,030
Do you want to sleep in peace

115
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,400
or be hung outside?

116
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,670
I'll go to sleep.

117
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,630
If you didn't mess with me,

118
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,630
I wouldn't have made a fuss, would I?

119
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,060
There's enough tension between them.

120
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,590
Why did they stop fighting?

121
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,130
Are you done?

122
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,880
Do you want to sleep or not?

123
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,210
Stop pretending.

124
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,760
There's no one else in this room.

125
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,900
It must be you.

126
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,940
It's in the dead of night.

127
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,670
How do you know

128
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,230
it wasn't the ghost outside

129
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,230
causing trouble?

130
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,920
He didn't notice me

131
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,610
in this hidden corner, right?

132
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,430
Judging from his temperament,

133
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,240
he won't be able to bear it.

134
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,000
Give it a few more days of chaos.

135
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,340
I don't believe he can bear

136
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,070
to live in this room any longer.

137
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,600
No one is around.

138
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,960
Hey. What are you doing?

139
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,800
This time,

140
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,670
you provoked me first.

141
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,330
Step aside.

142
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,480
I'll tell Yan about

143
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,910
all the evil things you did tomorrow.

144
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,170
Let's see if you can...

145
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,200
Why is he coming this way?

146
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,000
Is he trying to get even with me?

147
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,050
Could it be he wants to sleep in my room?

148
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,590
What are you doing?

149
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,730
I'm sleeping here tonight.

150
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,690
You want to sleep here?

151
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,530
We're of different gender, so we should keep our distance.

152
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,210
I disagree.

153
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,260
Who said I want to sleep with you?

154
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,600
Where should I sleep then?

155
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,760
You want me to sleep there?

156
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,510
Why not?

157
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,520
It's natural for a doctor to take care of a patient.

158
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,100
Get down.

159
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,050
If I had known this would happen,

160
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,050
I should have ignored him back then.

161
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,950
It would still be better than

162
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,480
getting myself a monarch who refuses to leave.

163
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,360
It's too late to repent.

164
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,280
A devil's in my room, and I feel cold from within.

165
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,760
Could it be that

166
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,840
he insisted on sleeping here tonight

167
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,640
to get the silver mermaid pearl?

168
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,470
It's just a pearl.

169
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,950
Why would he spend so much time putting on an act with me?

170
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,980
I might as well throw that pearl in his face

171
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,620
tomorrow morning

172
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,880
and part ways with him.

173
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,570
So why are you still staying here by her side?

174
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,210
Are you also here for the silver mermaid pearl,

175
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,590
just like me?

176
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,030
Don't you think about

177
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,520
taking the silver mermaid pearl away.

178
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,580
So this is why

179
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,650
she fell out with me lately.

180
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,070
You can't sleep?

181
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,870
How do you know?

182
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,740
I had a dream.

183
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,080
I dreamed that you scolded me.

184
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,310
This is strange.

185
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,340
He even knows that I scolded him secretly.

186
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,450
Women in the mountains

187
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,790
are always sharp-tongued.

188
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,080
If I offended you in your dream,

189
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,790
please forgive me, My Lord.

190
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,430
Were you also this sharp-tongued

191
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
when you were treating your mother?

192
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,540
My mother?

193
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,810
My mother is not like you.

194
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,400
No matter how sharp-tongued I am,

195
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,050
my mother won't be angry.

196
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,950
Because she knows

197
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,520
I have her in my heart and I love her.

198
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,200
You know.

199
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,700
I don't have

200
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,020
many friends.

201
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,440
Only Xiangxiang keeps me company.

202
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,770
Although Xiangxiang can't talk,

203
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,730
it knows what I'm thinking.

204
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,470
If I were an ordinary person,

205
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,070
I would have become depressed long ago.

206
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,990
But

207
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,130
I don't feel lonely.

208
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,070
Others treat scorpions as poisonous insects,

209
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,290
but you treat your scorpion as a friend?

210
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,360
Do you also think

211
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,990
I'm a weirdo?

212
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,880
Socialization is nothing

213
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,920
compared to getting to know a friend coming from afar

214
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,850
and becoming soulmates over time.

215
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,240
A friend coming from afar,

216
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,670
and becoming soulmates over time?

217
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,890
Have you ever regretted

218
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,730
that you met me?

219
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,110
You know what?

220
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,760
You must have done

221
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,130
a lot of good deeds in your previous lives

222
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,630
that you got to meet me, a living Buddha,

223
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,490
when you were in trouble.

224
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,830
I treated your illness,

225
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,950
listen to your orders,

226
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,880
and provide you with nice food and drinks.

227
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,720
Even when someone came to pick a fight with you,

228
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,770
it was me who used my heirloom

229
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,630
to protect you.

230
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,090
You're blessed

231
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,140
that you met me.

232
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,560
It's just a scratch. It's okay.

233
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,900
I'll apply some ointment on it back home.

234
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,140
Actually,

235
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,470
you are

236
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,880
cold outside but warm inside.

237
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,810
You're not a completely good person,

238
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,810
but you're no villain.

239
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,690
You don't have

240
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,070
to pretend

241
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,760
that you don't care about me from now on.

242
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,430
Let's be honest with each other

243
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,970
and protect each other,

244
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,920
okay?

245
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,310
Talk decently.

246
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,560
My Lord.

247
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,360
My Lord.

248
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,370
My Lord.

249
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,050
Any request?

250
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,950
Please break the spell for me, okay?

251
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,690
Don't even think about it.

252
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,920
Why isn't he back yet?

253
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,050
Is he sleeping there?

254
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,810
So they are just

255
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,370
a couple having a quarrel,

256
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,510
and I'm the clown?

257
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:08,869
Wait and see.

258
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,780
There's no couple that I can't break up.

259
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,869
I will get you

260
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,890
out of this house.

261
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,550
He's really taking this place as home.

262
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,870
He's so relaxed.

263
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,130
Ji Yang.

264
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,330
Could this be

265
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,760
Candlelight Beetles?

266
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,660
Ji Yang, how are you feeling?

267
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,130
Just do your thing.

268
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,510
Whether I live or die,

269
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,030
I'll have no resentment.

270
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,910
The silver needle is too slow

271
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,540
to get the Candlelight Beetles out of his body.

272
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,630
How can he possibly take

273
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,030
the repeated injection?

274
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,750
Xiangxiang.

275
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,660
I'm counting on you.

276
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,750
Nan Yan.

277
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,280
Xiangxiang has taken care of

278
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,110
your Candlelight Beetles.

279
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,190
Have a good rest.

280
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,090
Yan.

281
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,940
Yan, what's wrong?

282
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,230
Did he mistreat you?

283
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,030
I'll get even with him for you.

284
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,430
If you have nothing to do,

285
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,710
go to Chief's.

286
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,990
I want to be alone for a while.

287
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,520
Did he really bully you?

288
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,270
It has nothing to do with him.

289
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,550
Last year,

290
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,350
when I brought you to Lunar Sect,

291
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,610
I promised that

292
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,100
after you give birth to the baby

293
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,400
and when Filth Valley opens this year,

294
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,720
I'll send you back.

295
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,100
I broke my promise.

296
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,460
I'm sorry, Xiangxiang.

297
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,460
What on earth did you do?

298
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,830
Yan didn't say a word

299
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,890
for a long time.

300
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
She even wouldn't talk to me.

301
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,920
I can't even get her to crack a smile.

302
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,360
Wood from an ancient phoenix tree.

303
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,110
Not only is it impervious to corrosion,

304
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,710
it also has a calming effect.

305
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,910
Spiritual power has no effect on it,

306
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:05,550
so

307
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,670
you have to carve it with brute force.

308
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,110
How did you get this?

309
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,840
It's none of your business.

310
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,880
You're so petty.

311
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,570
I can't even take a look.

312
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,390
What did you put as

313
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,820
the fillings for the bun, Yan?

314
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,710
How much did you make?

315
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,180
I'll finish eating all of them.

316
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,430
I made water chestnut and shrimp paste buns.

317
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,630
Eat it while it's hot.

318
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,390
What exactly

319
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:53,990
did you do

320
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,630
to make her

321
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,350
this mad?

322
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,040
Did she rob

323
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,910
the salt seller?

324
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,050
This is too salty.

325
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,660
Oh no.

326
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,040
I forgot that I had already added salt to the filling.

327
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,160
Stop eating.

328
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,220
Eat it.

329
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:03,890
Eat it.

330
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,330
Eat the bun.

331
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,550
You liar!

332
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,700
Why are you still here?

333
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,560
Why didn't the chief kick you out?

334
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,030
The chief wrote personally to ask me to stay.

335
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,290
Go find him yourself if you don't like it.

336
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,240
It's obvious.

337
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,810
You must have tricked him

338
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,210
with your sweet talking.

339
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,310
Doesn’t that count as my ability too?

340
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,980
How dare you?

341
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:07,780
Leave.

342
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,240
Get out of Lunar Sect now!

343
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:09,850
Leave!

Wait,

347
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,350
this fox spirit is full of hidden agendas

348
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,230
and never tells the truth.

349
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,090

00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,740
I'm still young.

516
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,980
Wan,

517
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,180
from now on,

518
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,330
I'll only be loyal

519
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,890
to you alone.

520
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,830
You're smart.

521
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,600
But Wan,

522
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,610
isn't it enough to have me

523
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,750
as your dual cultivation vessel?

524
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,630
Why did you

525
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,280
bring this girl back?

526
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,420
That young master and you

527
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,500
are just my freebies for getting her.

528
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,660
I just wanted to bring

529
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,870
that girl back

530
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,450
as bait.

531
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,520
For who?

532
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,870
Of course for the monarch of the Great Path.

533
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,010
If you try to kill me again,

534
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,310
I'll expose the fact that

535
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,650
you're hiding here.

536
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,940
You know who I am?

537
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,210
That's easy.

538
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,010
I'll just go and tell

539
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,010
Chief Meng later.

540
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,110
I actually didn’t realize

541
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,140
that that guy is Lord Shao Cang.

542
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,110
Little beast,

543
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,870
what are you thinking about?

544
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,650
Why are you set on

545
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,350
provoking Lord Shao Cang?

546
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,700
He exposed my identity

547
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,170
and ruined my livelihood

548
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,730
that I worked on for years.

549
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,900
I can't rest until

550
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,070
I've turned him into a puppet.

551
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:32,340
But...

552
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,250
I think that Lord Shao Cang is very resourceful.

553
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,190
He's not easy to deal with.

554
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,220
Wan, do you have a plan?

555
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,590
He was first kicked into Soul River

556
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,930
and then chased after.

557
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,550
I don't believe that

558
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,350
he's as powerful as he used to be.

559
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,390
Besides, I've already planted

560
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,780
traps in my cave.

561
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,710
Those who enter the formation will have to endure spiritual backlash.

562
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,100
Even if

563
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,510
he has the ability to conquer the world,

564
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,450
today will still

565
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,100
be his downfall.

566
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:03,860
Wan,

567
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,170
I have something else to tell you.

568
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,440
It's been some time.

569
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,350
Why are they so quiet?

570
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,050
Put me down!

571
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,470
You shrew!

572
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,210
Let me go! Let me down!

573
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,770
How dare you touch me?

574
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,530
You won't even address me politely.

575
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,850
How rude!

576
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,530
Let them go.

577
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,510
I can let them go,

578
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,470
as long as you

579
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,990
hand over your pearl.

580
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,800
Why do you want my pearl?

581
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,870
It's all because of you self-proclaimed

582
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,170
righteous cultivators that have forced

583
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,300
our Demon Clan into such dire straits.

584
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,350
As the dignified elder of the Evil Path,

585
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,750
I even have to hide my true identity

586
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,880
and disguise myself as a boat owner to lurk in the market.

587
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,150
But if

588
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,560
I have your pearl,

589
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,200
I can conceal my presence at any time,

590
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,520
and come and go freely

591
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,980
within the five states.

592
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,900
No, you can't give it to her.

593
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,310
Who knows how many lives

594
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,070
will she harm

595
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,480
once she has your pearl?

596
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,230
You'd better think carefully.

597
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,210
Is the life of these two young masters

598
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,140
more important,

599
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,160
or your pearl?
