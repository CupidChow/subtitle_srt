1
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,029
Switch up the movement.

2
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:36,412
Very adorable.

3
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,164
Swallow. Very good.

4
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,414
Tuck up the skirt.

5
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,542
Very adorable.

6
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,003
Great. That's it.

7
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,004
Adorable.

8
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:46,922
Yes.

9
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:47,964
Adorable.

10
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:49,758
Adorable.

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,760
Very good, very good.

12
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,803
Alright, let's check.

13
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,640
How is it?

14
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,226
I think... it's very adorable.

15
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,311
But maybe a little brighter would be better.

16
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,479
Sorry to bother you.

17
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,940
Then I'll adjust the lighting a bit brighter.

18
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,650
Let's adjust the lighting.

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,526
What do you think?

20
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:12,322
I think... the smile should be a bit more prominent.

21
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,365
Sorry to bother you.

22
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,004
Navy blue, beige, white, beige.

23
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,257
I really don't understand this combination.

24
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:34,261
Oh, meeting your boyfriend's family is a big deal.

25
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,097
Then just wear the clothes you like.

26
00:01:59,036 --> 00:01:59,078
Egoist.

27
00:01:59,077 --> 00:01:59,119
Egoist.

28
00:01:59,119 --> 00:01:59,161
Egoist.

29
00:01:59,161 --> 00:01:59,203
Egoist.

30
00:01:59,202 --> 00:01:59,244
Egoist.

31
00:01:59,244 --> 00:01:59,286
Egoist.

32
00:01:59,286 --> 00:01:59,328
Egoist.

33
00:01:59,328 --> 00:01:59,370
Egoist.

34
00:01:59,369 --> 00:01:59,411
Egoist.

35
00:01:59,411 --> 00:01:59,453
Egoist.

36
00:01:59,453 --> 00:01:59,495
Egoist.

37
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:04,374
Egoist.

38
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,961
Anyway, as long as it's not sweet, it's fine, right?

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,171
Right, exactly. Too sweet doesn't go well with a meal.

40
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,547
Haha, but sweet drinks are also delicious.

41
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,798
Hey, listen to me.

42
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,674
Go ahead.

43
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,343
I suddenly remembered something from the other day.

44
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:17,805
I went to get a marriage registration form.

45
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,849
That's Amazing.

46
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:21,975
What's going on?

47
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:27,481
You know, same-sex marriage is not recognized in Japan.

48
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:31,276
- But we still wanted to get married.
- Sorry, could you pour me a glass of water?

49
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:36,323
So, we took the marriage registration form,

50
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:36,782
filled it out together.

51
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:37,950
Like this.

52
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,492
Is it like that?

53
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,661
Isn't that Masaki Mizumori's move?

54
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,456
After we finished writing, we stuck it on the wall.

55
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,374
I really don't know what he was like before.

56
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,710
He used to be really muscular.

57
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,418
Is that so?

58
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,086
Incredibly strong, with abs and all.

59
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,130
His abs were really famous.

60
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,381
Exactly, and he even does love fortune-telling.

61
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,633
Like those Amida's blessings.

62
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,259
- So, he used to be a muscular guy.
- Impressive.

63
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:56,926
Well, forget it.

64
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,846
At our age, we shouldn't think too much about it.

65
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,056
- That's true.
- No matter how hard we try, it won't work.

66
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,351
Nan, are you exercising?

67
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,227
Of course.

68
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,063
Actually, I haven't put much effort into it.

69
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,481
You need someone to push you, right?

70
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,148
That's true.

71
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,067
So, where's the best place to work out?

72
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,360
You're rich, why not hire a personal trainer?

73
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,906
I actually thought of someone.

74
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,909
Well, how should I put it? He seems like a beginner.

75
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,619
Seems like he just started this profession recently.

76
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,078
A beginner?

77
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:23,537
Yes.

78
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,371
Is he gay?

79
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,122
Yes, he's gay.

80
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,081
How old is he?

81
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,375
Around 24.

82
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,084
Young, huh?

83
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:33,005
In this day and age, finding a personal trainer is like hiring an escort.

84
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,173
Finding a young boy who's in his prime?

85
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,716
I get it. It's like going to a nightclub.

86
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,385
Then tell me his contact information.

87
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,011
Sure.

88
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,721
But even someone like him has needs.

89
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,182
That's true. By the way, how did we end up talking about this?

90
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,433
We still need to tighten up our bodies.

91
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,560
yes

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,603
their business is expanding.

93
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,370
In order to escape the grudges of the past and their rural hometown.

94
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,622
I came to Tokyo when I was 18.

95
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,794
The clothes I wear are my "armor".

96
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,081
This guy is "Number One Pig."

97
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,838
By the way, yesterday I was playing a game.

98
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,465
I ended up losing in the final stage.

99
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,342
It's always easy to mess up in the end.

100
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,802
- I'm really frustrated.
- Yeah, I know that feeling.

101
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,307
Flies so far.

102
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,850
Flies really far.

103
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,684
That's great.

104
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,440
It's better to give snacks than this kind of thing.

105
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,860
Who wants the funeral gift from a dead gay bitch?

106
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:24,032
Back then, it was those "pigs" who looked down on me and my mother, but protected me.

107
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,201
It's a designer clothing.

108
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:37,921
I'm back.

109
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,119
I received another invitation for your middle school reunion.

110
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,832
I'm busy and can't go. Just throw it away.

111
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:20,755
Since you're so busy, you don't have to come all the way back every year on the anniversary of their death.

112
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,551
It's only once a year, just to greet my mom.

113
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,596
Your mom must be happy too, right?

114
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,727
Have you found a suitable partner?

115
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,686
What?

116
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,274
At your age, you should think about settling down.

117
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,654
Your mom probably wants to see your child too.

118
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,781
Let's talk about it when there's a suitable partner.

119
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,261
Is it Mr. Saito?

120
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:08,678
it's me.

121
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,306
- Sorry for being late.
- No problem

122
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,515
I am sorry.

123
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,853
I'm the personal trainer you scheduled, Ryuuta Yoshimura.

124
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:17,771
I'm Saito.

125
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,189
Pleased to meet you.

126
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,357
Last set of ten. Are you okay?

127
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:21,691
I'm fine.

128
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,984
Drenched like a wet chicken.

129
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:24,570
this way, please.

130
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,653
Thank you for your trouble.

131
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:39,001
Keep going for another three minutes. It feels great, right

132
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,004
This... Yeah, it's quite tiring.

133
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,591
How often do you work out these days?

134
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,469
Before, I used to work out twice a week.

135
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,096
Twice a week. And what about recently?

136
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,975
Recently, it's been once a month.

137
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,435
Once a month, huh...

138
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,690
It's such a waste that you have such a strong physique and don't exercise.

139
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,568
Right? I think so too.

140
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,201
Your body is so flexible.

141
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:13,785
Really?

142
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,619
Yes.

143
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,249
You look really handsome.

144
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,467
Seriously, even better than what they say.

145
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,552
Please don't be so polite.

146
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,014
But you really are handsome, aren't you?

147
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,474
You saying that makes me feel embarrassed.

148
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,645
Get up, 4.

149
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,604
Great.

150
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,484
Get up, 5.

151
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,901
Look up at a 45-degree angle to the side.

152
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,819
This side?

153
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,947
Good, 6.

154
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,533
One final push, support yourself.

155
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,327
Support myself?

156
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,495
Lift it up, lift it up.

157
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,831
lift it up.

158
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,125
good!

159
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,710
You did great.

160
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,629
You did great.

161
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,215
Upwards, 6, a bit higher.

162
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,844
Only two more to go, keep it up.

163
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,474
Engage the core.

164
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,395
Are you doing planks?
That shows how hardworking you are.

165
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,398
Okay, extend your right leg.

166
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,900
Hold your left foot.

167
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,030
Do you have time later?

168
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,031
Yes.

169
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:38,745
If it's convenient, I'd like to give you some dietary advice.

170
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:39,621
Sure.

171
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,539
If you don't mind, let's go to the nearby cafeteria.

172
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,499
Sure, no problem.

173
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,834
Really? That's great.

174
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,418
Let's go.

175
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,339
Next, grab your foot and step...

176
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:53,969
My recommended dish is grilled chicken skewers. If not available, go for sashimi.

177
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,303
Can I eat raw sashimi?

178
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:55,678
Yes, you can.

179
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,389
And don't forget to drink protein powder today.

180
00:09:59,015 --> 00:09:59,849
Got it.

181
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,602
During and after the workout,

182
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,606
and also at night and the next morning, make sure to drink it.

183
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,025
The brand I recommend is...

184
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,485
Slow down a bit, let me write it down first.

185
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,153
Sorry.

186
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,071
it's okay no problem

187
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,452
Nakamura, did you learn all this by yourself?

188
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,413
Yes, that's right.

189
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,541
Actually, I want to go to school and further my education.

190
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,835
So, I'm currently doing part-time jobs.

191
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,753
What kind of part-time job?

192
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,421
Late-night part-time job.

193
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,510
Does being an editor pay well?

194
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,887
Not really.

195
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,057
But well, I can't really consider myself part of the salaried class.

196
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,976
Impressive.

197
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,397
I dropped out of high school, so I couldn't choose my job.

198
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,109
But nowadays, education doesn't have much influence, right?

199
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,111
And my family is a single-income household.

200
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,864
My mom got sick when I was 14,

201
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,201
so I had to work.

202
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,621
So now, I'm doing other part-time jobs while working as a personal trainer.

203
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,958
But I want to gradually make personal training my main profession.

204
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,006
That's amazing.

205
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,215
Really?

206
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,049
It's amazing.

207
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,015
Let me pay.

208
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:23,558
I'll take care of it.

209
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,642
Or let me pay,

210
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,727
I'm a salaried worker.

211
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,688
Just for today, okay? Let me pay.

212
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,232
Well, thank you then.

213
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:33,193
Please split the bill.

214
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,570
The total is 1,250 yen.

215
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:35,820
Okay.

216
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:40,617
Oops, sorry.

217
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,870
It's okay, no problem.

218
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,622
Sorry.

219
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:51,962
Are you okay?

220
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,719
Are you really okay?

221
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,594
..I'm fine.

222
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,679
Let me pay, alright?

223
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:06,308
Please, can we not talk for a moment?

224
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:11,481
What's wrong?

225
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,650
Did I scratch it here?

226
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,359
Should I take a look?

227
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,151
Yes.

228
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:15,985
Then let me see.

229
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,990
It's just swollen, should be fine.

230
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:21,700
It's swollen...

231
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,576
it hurts!

232
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,661
It really hurts!

233
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,370
It should be okay.

234
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,541
Can you wait for a moment?

235
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,000
Okay.

236
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,512
Sorry.

237
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,306
What's wrong?

238
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,600
I want to buy a gift to take home for my mom.

239
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,352
But everything is so expensive.

240
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,688
Really? Very expensive?

241
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,397
Extremely expensive.

242
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,360
How are you doing?

243
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,194
I'm fine.

244
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,370
It's really swollen.

245
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:12,667
I think "Tragedy of WwW" is truly a landmark film in Japanese cinema history.

246
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,754
You see, Mita Yoshiko won many awards through this film.

247
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,465
Hiroko Yokoshimaru also transitioned into an actress because of it.

248
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,803
Every time I watch it, I remember Bourbonne's performance.

249
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,637
Indeed.

250
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,139
Hey, are you listening?

251
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,515
Hmm, hold on a moment.

252
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,641
We're talking about your favorite "Tragedy of WwW."

253
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,059
I know, the "Ordinary Woman," right?

254
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:30,810
Yes.

255
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,894
What are you doing?

256
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:32,520
What are you doing

257
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,187
Talking to a personal trainer.

258
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,772
Ah, the one from last time?

259
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,064
right.

260
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,899
What happened after that?

261
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,571
So, how is he? Is the kid handsome?

262
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,114
Well, he's quite handsome.

263
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:43,740
Here it comes.

264
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,284
But I think he's very innocent.

265
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,204
Incredibly pure, a really good little boy.

266
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,455
What do you know about innocence?

267
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,956
I mean, I don't really know.

268
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,415
What are you doing?

269
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,377
I have to send him everything I eat.

270
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,631
For example, "fried chicken combo, less rice."

271
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,507
What did you report today?

272
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,217
Just say I had this, this, and this?

273
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,931
Actually, it's better to eat something salty,
but grilled chicken skewers are passable too.

274
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,268
If I send him all of this, he'll be sad.

275
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,979
Why sad?

276
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,272
Isn't your task to send him everything you eat?

277
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,440
He's a good kid.

278
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,317
That doesn't have anything to do with being a good kid...

279
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:20,944
You're lying.

280
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,486
There are two types of lies, you know.

281
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,489
One is a "malicious lie," and the other is a "kind lie."

282
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:25,823
Mine is the latter.

283
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,576
Don't try to fool people with seemingly reasonable words.

284
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,494
Just don't eat so much.

285
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,454
Oh well, I couldn't help it.

286
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:37,835
But in the end, do you have any intention of restraining yourself or...

287
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,086
I am restraining myself, but I can't resist eating.

288
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,380
You're not restraining yourself at all!

289
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,425
That wolfish way of eating shows no restraint.

290
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,634
It disappears with a "gulp" into your mouth.

291
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,761
- gone in a second
- It was just right here.

292
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,305
Can't help it, the pizza in front of me disappears in the blink of an eye.

293
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,141
I even saw the trajectory.

294
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:52,850
There's no trajectory.

295
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,185
It all ends up in your big mouth.

296
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,186
So, I'm the victim here.

297
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,229
What's that? Pretending to be a victim now?

298
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,440
I am the victim.

299
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,400
Here he goes again.

300
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:01,943
he started again

301
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,695
Little Wu's specialty.

302
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,697
Hey, why don't you join in, Hao Fu?

303
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,157
No way, I absolutely won't.

304
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,201
Is this a dance from Okinawa?

305
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:12,579
Don't expose my background.

306
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,129
Annoying, why am I the only one dancing?

307
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,340
8, two more times.

308
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,676
Raise them up, raise them up, raise them up.

309
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,929
9, the last one.

310
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,181
One more time.

311
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:32,640
Can't go on.

312
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,642
Raise them up, keep going.

313
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:35,852
Keep going.

314
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,481
Raise them up, straighten your arms, okay?

315
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:43,276
You did really well, perfect.

316
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,068
Working hard.

317
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,825
Keep it up, great, great, great.

318
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:51,576
Just a little more.

319
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,285
18

320
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,121
Two more times.

321
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,414
Keep going.

322
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,499
19

323
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,376
Last one.

324
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,419
This is the last one.

325
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,631
Hold on for the last one, great, 20.

326
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,301
Feeling it now.

327
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,178
Feeling it.

328
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,181
The beginning is always the hardest.

329
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,765
Sorry, Nakamura, wait for me for a moment.

330
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:15,599
Sure.

331
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,312
Hello.

332
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:25,527
Take care.

333
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:27,987
What's wrong?

334
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,780
Here, this is for your mother.

335
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,740
for your mother.

336
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:32,659
This won't do...

337
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,868
And this is for you.

338
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,286
- It's my turn.
- It's okay, I'm sorry.

339
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,287
You don't have the right to refuse.

340
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,038
But I really...

341
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,581
Alright, let's go.

342
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,544
Well...

343
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,006
Here they come.

344
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:48,591
coming

345
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,234
thank you for the gift.

346
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,026
You're welcome.

347
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,649
Wait, what do you mean?

348
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,404
Is it a return gift for the sushi?

349
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:53,781
No, it's not.

350
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,160
Then why?

351
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,872
Because you're charming.

352
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,091
Please come in.

353
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,384
Excuse the intrusion.

354
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,054
Ah, wait a moment.

355
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,350
Here, slippers.

356
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,392
Sorry to trouble you.

357
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,604
Can we enter? It might be a bit messy.

358
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,363
Mr. Linqiang's house is really big.

359
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,197
It's quite empty too.

360
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,450
The view is amazing as well.

361
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,371
Isn't it? What would you like to drink?

362
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,188
It's hot.

363
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,063
It's really hot.

364
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,653
Really?

365
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,223
Wait a moment.

366
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,482
Oh no, not good.

367
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,660
Is everything okay?

368
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,888
Wait a moment.

369
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,040
Feels so comfortable.

370
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:57,942
Alright, it's done.

371
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,694
Thank you. Shall I make tea for you?

372
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,903
No, I'll do it myself.

373
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:01,445
Are you sure?

374
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,658
Use this towel.

375
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:06,242
Okay.

376
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,081
Here you go.

377
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,000
Thank you.

378
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,180
Thank you.

379
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,979
Mmm, all done.

380
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,356
Wait a moment.

381
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:38,357
Why don't you wear this?

382
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:38,899
Okay.

383
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,518
Who's this?

384
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,146
It's my mother. She passed away when I was in middle school.

385
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,731
I see.

386
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:06,154
So, I envy you. You can still do many things for your mother.

387
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,160
Ah, would you like some sugar and milk?

388
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,077
Just a little bit of sugar, please.

389
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:13,744
Okay.

390
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:23,254
Enjoy your meal.

391
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,796
Thank you.

392
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,341
Now, I'll pour the milk.

393
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:34,974
Are you conducting a science experiment?

394
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:38,936
- cheers.
- cheers.

395
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,317
It's delicious.

396
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,736
Indeed, it's really tasty.

397
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,201
Nakamura, you forgot something important.

398
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,328
Ah, I forgot. Thank you.

399
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:56,995
It's no problem.

400
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:58,873
Just call me Ryota.

401
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,002
Don't call me Yukimura, call me Ryota.

402
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,630
Ah, then you can call me Kosuke.

403
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,174
Hao-fu... No, I'll still call you Mr. Hao-fu.

404
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,384
That's fine too.

405
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,262
So, see you in a week.
Try to use the stairs more.

406
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,765
- Understood.
- Mr Kosuke.

407
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,143
Okay, you can go now.

408
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:20,644
Sorry for the interruption.

409
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,939
Goodbye, be careful on your way.

410
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:58,576
There is a dark night in my heart.

411
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:05,499
This bottomless dark night.

412
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:11,880
From my childhood, it has always gazed upon my heart.

413
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:35,362
♪ The moon swiftly darts, deeply piercing ♪ ♪ My heart, forever bound by destiny ♪

414
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:44,996
♪ Translated as the calculation of plum blossoms ♪

415
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:54,297
A commitment to protect the cherished love of mine

416
00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:04,224
Entering the snowy world once again

417
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:09,063
A hesitant person, entering the virtual world.

418
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:13,900
A public relation, now devoted to duty L The power and belonging of a rented room, a reverse toss.

419
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:23,243
A total exchange, the intense passion of six people An inner team, the necessary training for success,

420
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:32,419
Avoiding the light of the clothes in the boat's journey

421
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,088
Many A's, with hail present,

422
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:42,721
Stationing at both ends of the six-four station
External-ARNAX, and also

423
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:56,818
Is that okay?

424
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,111
Yes.

425
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,031
Is it okay to do it standing?

426
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:02,783
Yes, sure

427
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,093
this is for your mother.

428
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,220
How can I accept this?

429
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,178
It's a picture for your mother.

430
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,014
No, Mr. Hōfu, I really can't.
It's okay, it's okay.

431
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,393
Ryōta, come and take it back.

432
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,019
Thank you for always taking care of me.

433
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,313
Say hello for me.

434
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:15,814
Goodbye.

435
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,639
Please take a look. First, there's this.

436
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,848
And it's called "Rōō Wangū".

437
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,810
Made from Fromage Blanc, which is a type of white cream cheese,

438
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,644
paired with fresh cream.

439
00:30:55,854 --> 00:31:01,151
The thin, snow-like pure white color brings to mind a melting texture that disappears upon entering the mouth.

440
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,239
But once you taste it, a variety of flavors instantly spread throughout your mouth.

441
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:11,286
The rich flavor perfectly blends with the fresh fruity aroma and acidity of raspberries.

442
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,121
Just the right combination of two into one

443
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:14,915
Do you hear it?

444
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:20,212
This cake. Raise it up. Can I? Let me feed you. As you eat it, Transform. Transform your mood.

445
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,131
What does this remind you of? Little Kyō.

446
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,423
I don't know.

447
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,341
It's like falling in love, isn't it?

448
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,595
Hey, hey, can you be a little more discreet?

449
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,223
ignore him.

450
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:34,476
But on another note, when we were doing it...

451
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:35,769
Doing it? Having sex?

452
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,020
How was it?

453
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,773
How should I put it? Sometimes, I feel like he's too polite.

454
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,608
Being polite isn't a bad thing.

455
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:47,906
Well, it's good, but I want him to be more assertive.

456
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:52,870
Forget it, sorry. Let's eat.

457
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,079
Oh, come on.

458
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:58,500
First, let's taste it. Here.

459
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,471
Mmm, it's so good.

460
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,598
It's climbing.
Climbing Mount Everest.

461
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,600
You're climbing.
Finally reached the summit.

462
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,315
9, one last time.

463
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,483
Keep going, keep going.

464
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,320
Extend your arm straight. OK.

465
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,537
- Great job.
- Is it great?

466
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:36,663
You're working hard.

467
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:38,790
16.

468
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,084
17.

469
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,127
Keep going.

470
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,797
18, two more to go.

471
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,467
19, one last time.

472
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,886
20 OK.

473
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,640
finally done.

474
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,599
The continent and

475
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,068
Don't be like this, Mr. Kosuke.

476
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,195
There's someone here.

477
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,114
Where?

478
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:10,864
There really is.

479
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,037
It's really not possible.

480
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,038
It's not possible.

481
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,671
No one's like you.

482
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:31,719
It's tickling.

483
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,529
It tickles so much.

484
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,742
It's fine.

485
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,453
Don't be like this, really.

486
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,058
Ryōta.

487
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,103
Hold on to Yang Zhuang.

488
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:27,941
Don't be polite. You should be used to it by now.

489
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:30,360
i want to end this relationship.

490
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,999
Are you saying you don't want to see me anymore?

491
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,001
Yeah, let's not meet again.

492
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,384
Is that so?

493
00:34:57,137 --> 00:35:03,644
But if you didn't want to sleep with me,
you could have been clear about it.

494
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:03,852
But what about the gym...

495
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,312
I like you.

496
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,190
Then why?

497
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,236
Explain it clearly. Make me understand.

498
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,240
If you don't like me always giving things to your mother...

499
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,785
No, it's not like that.

500
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:23,330
Actually...

501
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,084
Actually I've been selling...

502
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,836
Ever since I dropped out of high school until now.

503
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,382
I've been doing just fine.

504
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,259
but..

505
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,930
Ever since I met you, it's been painful.

506
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,433
And I can't choose to give up this job.

507
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,270
because i have nothing.

508
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,774
If I lose this job, I won't be able to support my mother.

509
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,195
So, I'm sorry.

510
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,739
Really sorry.

511
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,420
Good evening.

512
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,796
good evening. please come in.

513
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,132
Sorry to disturb you.

514
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,886
You're really tall.

515
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,514
I'm 184 cm.

516
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,182
Please have a seat.

517
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,100
Thank you.

518
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,728
Let me take off my coat first.

519
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,901
this room is really nice.

520
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,277
You're really fair-skinned.

521
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,614
People always say that.
I feel a bit embarrassed.

522
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,741
So fair and radiant.

523
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,368
This side is even fairer.

524
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:52,039
Indeed, it's so smooth.

525
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,502
Shall we shower together?

526
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,795
Sure.

527
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,329
Are you sorry? Don't be afraid.

528
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,150
Are you going to climax? Can we do it now?

529
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,901
Yes.

530
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,821
Lakeside.

531
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:43,900
How have you been lately?

532
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,361
Of course, how about you?

533
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,279
I'm doing fine too.

534
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,349
Ah, I have to go now.

535
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,475
Go ahead.

536
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,437
I'm going.

537
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,501
Hello, nice to meet you...

538
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:07,376
I'm sorry.

539
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,752
Why is it you?

540
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:09,337
Come in quickly.

541
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,382
how could it be you?

542
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:14,008
I'm sorry but...

543
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:14,634
Why?

544
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,511
Because you never answer my calls.

545
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,305
Just give me 5 minutes. Let's talk.

546
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,725
I......

547
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,104
I like you.

548
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:34,946
I really like you, I like how hard you work for your mother.

549
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,324
So, let me do something for you.

550
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,493
I don't want to give you trouble.

551
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:41,828
Whether it's considered troublesome or not, i
t's up to me to decide.

552
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,455
If I hadn't met you, it would have been better.

553
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:46,833
If I hadn't met you,
I wouldn't be in so much pain.

554
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,794
I was doing just fine in this job.

555
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,770
let me buy you.

556
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,612
Let me be your exclusive client.

557
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,656
Every month, 100,000 yen.

558
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,368
Even though I, as a poor client,
can only afford this much money.

559
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:29,250
But you can do other part-time jobs to make up for the rest.

560
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:39,510
If you don't want to or think it's not worth it,

561
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,929
Then I'll give up, okay?

562
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,224
Disappear from your sight from now on.

563
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:50,479
How about that? You decide.

564
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,573
Ryota.

565
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,203
let's work hard together.

566
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:10,917
Ryota.

567
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:40,983
I'll take this.

568
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:05,174
I have to go now.

569
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:08,052
Hey, won't you stay the night?

570
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:12,223
Um... starting from today,
I'll be working the night shift.

571
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,141
today?

572
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:17,478
What about the daytime job?

573
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:22,608
During the day, I also work, but one job alone isn't enough.

574
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:28,656
I see... Hold on tight.

575
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,909
Why apologize?

576
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:36,455
After all, I was the one who rushed into things first.

577
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:44,004
Mr. Kosuke, I'm glad I can tell Mom the truth.

578
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:55,600
Ryota.

579
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:56,058
- Hmm?
- Take it with you.

580
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,727
It'll be cold in the morning for sure.

581
00:48:58,811 --> 00:48:59,937
Forget it. It'll get dirty.

582
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,896
No, I can't accept something so valuable.

583
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,649
No, I can't accept something so valuable.

584
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,526
No, I don't wear it anymore. Don't be polite.

585
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,569
It's useful, it's useful.

586
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,446
Clothes are happy when someone wears them.

587
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,198
Alright, take it then.

588
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:12,908
Thank you.

589
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:13,826
It's made in Italy, by the way.

590
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:17,538
Well, I'm leaving.

591
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:18,956
Bye, Long.

592
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:20,249
Keep going.

593
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,376
Thanks.

594
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,031
So, Kosuke-san, is there anything you dislike?

595
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:53,950
In what aspect?

596
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:57,744
My mom starts bustling early in the morning and makes a lot of dishes.

597
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,038
Are you asking about food?

598
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:02,708
Are you okay?

599
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,252
Just be like your usual self.

600
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:08,506
You know, I've never met my boyfriend's family before.

601
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,341
But there's no way to tell her we're lovers.

602
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:12,510
That's true...

603
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,305
Why does it feel like you're dressed differently from usual?

604
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:19,392
Just keep quiet.

605
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:24,522
This is the place.

606
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:29,986
I'm back.

607
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,862
Welcome back.

608
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:35,408
Hello, nice to meet you.

609
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,617
Welcome, welcome.

610
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,160
I'm Sato Kosuke.

611
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,580
Sorry, our house is very small.

612
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,708
No, no, it's no bother.

613
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,004
Sorry, please come in.

614
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,757
I apologize for visiting your home so suddenly.

615
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:52,716
By the way, Ryota, can you do me a favor?

616
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,301
We're out of Worcestershire sauce.

617
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:54,760
Worcestershire sauce?

618
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,387
- Can you go buy some?
- Sure, I'll go.

619
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,931
Here's the money for you.

620
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,683
Just buy a small bottle.

621
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,144
The usual kind? Okay, got it.

622
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,020
Hmm, if they don't have it,
just buy something else.

623
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,854
It's okay, I want Worcestershire sauce.

624
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,731
I'll be right back.

625
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,483
Sorry, please have a seat.

626
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:13,028
I brought you a little gift, nothing too valuable.

627
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,613
- There are cherries and...
- Why are you giving us gifts again?

628
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,740
Oh, cherries!

629
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:20,244
- That's great, we should put them in the fridge quickly.
- Yes, let's do that.

630
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,663
Here's some kudzu noodles as well.

631
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,498
If you're not going to eat them right away,
you can put them in the fridge too.

632
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,459
I really like kudzu noodles.

633
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,711
Really? That's great then.

634
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,255
I haven't had them in a long time.

635
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,008
Ah, please have a seat.

636
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,676
Alright, I'll just follow your lead.

637
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,763
- You've really gone through a lot...
- I left the bag over here...

638
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,222
Please put it down.

639
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:44,143
Last time, you gave us expensive sushi.

640
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,561
And it suited your taste too, right?

641
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:50,524
Well, sushi and such are rare treats for us.

642
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,651
Please have a seat.

643
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:53,986
Okay, sorry.

644
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,947
Ryota should be back soon, so please enjoy.

645
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,327
- You can take off your coat, right?
- Then I'll take it off first.

646
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:10,545
Ah, we can only offer you simple and plain food.

647
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,004
Simple is the best.

648
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:18,051
Is that so? Mr. Saito, you really know how to talk.

649
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:24,058
By the way, where are you from?

650
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,310
I am from Chiba.

651
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,479
Chiba, I see.

652
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:31,023
Hmm, it's a really rural place near Kaizo.

653
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,112
Is that so? Are your parents still living there?

654
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:40,199
My mother passed away,

655
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,243
my father is the only one living there now.

656
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,911
Oh, your mother passed away.
When did that happen?

657
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,122
When I was 14 years old.

658
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:51,335
That must have been tough.

659
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,588
It must have been a tough time.

660
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,549
Well, it wasn't that difficult...

661
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,677
- I'm starting.
- Oh, I see...

662
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,861
Things you didn't like to eat as a child,

663
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,529
it's possible to start liking them when you grow up, right?

664
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,614
That's true.

665
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,866
Can I eat the mushrooms?

666
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,202
I've actually grown to love mushrooms now,
so I can eat them.

667
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,161
Why is that?

668
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,746
what don't you like to eat?

669
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,249
Actually, I don't think there's anything I particularly love or dislike.

670
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,458
I see.

671
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:32,668
Pass me that, please...

672
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:33,794
Is it difficult to debone a fish head?

673
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:41,301
Well, with things like that... I can understand if you're cooking at home.

674
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,552
Do you cook for yourself?

675
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,474
I don't do it now, but when I lived alone, I did cook.

676
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:49,143
Sometimes, when someone comes over, I cook.

677
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,895
What about your wife? Are you married?

678
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,062
I'm not married yet.

679
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,231
Oh, so you're not married yet.

680
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,607
Are you living together with your girlfriend, then?

681
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,317
no...i don't have a girlfriend either.

682
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:02,156
No girlfriend? You're kidding.

683
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,115
No, really, I don't.

684
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:03,824
I'm not that popular either.

685
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:08,245
With your qualifications,
you must have girls swarming around you.

686
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,665
That's not the case. I'm not appealing to women.

687
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,708
So what type do you like?

688
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,627
Mom, Mom, look!

689
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:15,878
What's the matter?

690
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,546
This is what Mr Kosuke gave me before.

691
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:18,589
He gave it to you?

692
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,007
Okay, you don't have to show it to Mom.

693
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,550
Oh, you accepted it?

694
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:21,967
Yes.

695
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,511
Thank you so much.

696
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,430
Don't be so polite, just wear it.

697
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,975
I've never bought anything for this child.

698
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,728
- thank you so much.
- you're welcome.

699
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:33,646
How is it?

700
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,983
- It fits well.
- Really? It fits well?

701
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,152
It's like it was tailor-made.

702
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,194
It looks good, right?

703
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,988
"Clothes make the man."

704
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:44,573
No, no.

705
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,535
It looks nice, really nice.

706
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,162
I just think it fits him perfectly.

707
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:53,540
Really, the sleeve length and everything,
they're just right.

708
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,919
Will it be warm enough for winter this year?

709
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,298
What are you taking a picture of?

710
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,216
Okay, just be natural.

711
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,010
- sorry.
- Please take the picture.

712
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,637
- Go ahead, take it.
- You should join too.

713
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,139
I'll pass......

714
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:09,473
Opportunities like this are rare.

715
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:12,017
Let's take it together, it's no big deal.

716
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:13,561
You're making me shy.

717
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,647
Alright, let's consider it a commemoration?

718
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:20,067
Opportunities like this are rare, so I'll take the picture.

719
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,861
It's a professional habit,
I always like to take more shots.

720
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:24,780
Okay, that's enough.

721
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,198
You two should get closer.

722
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:27,199
very good.

723
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:31,536
Nakamura, put your hand on her shoulder.

724
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:36,000
Taking pictures can be embarrassing.

725
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,918
Very good, very good.

726
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,588
- Mr. Saito, it's your turn. Let me take this one.
- I'll pass......

727
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,549
- Let's take a picture together, the three of us.
- I don't like being photographed.

728
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:45,760
Is it not possible?

729
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,136
We rarely get together like this.

730
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,219
Do you really want to take my picture? Okay then.

731
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,974
Let's take a picture to commemorate Mr. Saito's visit to my house.

732
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:52,933
Okay, come on.

733
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,896
Alright, one picture together.

734
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,484
Thank you so much today.

735
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,277
- Coming to our small and shabby house.
- Let me see.

736
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,362
I will send it to you later.

737
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:15,956
if you do not mind.

738
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,667
Can I take these dishes home?

739
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:20,210
Thank you.

740
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,294
"DTH LO."
- Are you willing?

741
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:21,921
S-selling six-shot wind.
Of course, I'm willing.

742
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,504
-  What's wrong?
- That's great.

743
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:23,547
Can you come over here?

744
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,262
Hey, no.

745
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,388
Are you crazy?

746
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,190
Thank you for your hospitality.

747
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,733
Come by often.

748
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,154
I'm really satisfied.

749
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:48,864
Really? That's good.

750
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,241
You ate a lot today, right?

751
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:54,035
Yeah, is that okay?

752
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,038
Eat less tomorrow, it'll be fine.

753
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,081
That's true.

754
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:02,169
By the way, do I need to report to you today?

755
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,671
No, not today.

756
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,179
Auntie, you don't have to be polite.
It's fine to leave it here.

757
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,681
That won't do.

758
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,431
Please don't be polite.
Just leaving it here is enough.

759
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,724
It's alright, really.

760
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:17,267
I'm used to walking this way.

761
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,896
- Thank you for going through so much trouble today.
- Then, I'll take my leave. Thank you for your hospitality.

762
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:21,438
Let me walk you to the subway station.

763
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,315
No need, accompany Auntie instead.

764
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:24,691
Let's go together and send you off.

765
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,610
No, I'll go by myself.

766
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:27,485
Are you sure?

767
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:28,988
Then, I'll take my leave.

768
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,197
thank you so much today.

769
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,656
I should be the one thanking you.

770
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,159
Thank you for sending me so many things.

771
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:34,869
Well then, I'll be going now.

772
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:35,243
Guo Zhi.

773
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:35,828
Be careful on the way.

774
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,495
Okay, then I'm leaving.

775
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,003
Take care.

776
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,838
Thank you.

777
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,554
Does he know the way?

778
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:54,554
He knows.

779
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:57,266
He said it's fine.

780
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,018
Be careful on the way.

781
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:57,451
Here, wash these too.

782
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:58,410
Okay.

783
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,389
sorry for waking you up.

784
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:04,142
It's so comfortable...

785
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:07,812
It's alright, you go back to sleep.

786
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:09,189
San.

787
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:28,291
I'm leaving.

788
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,376
San.

789
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,085
This is for you.

790
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:33,797
Thank you for taking care of me all this time.

791
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:34,381
It's nothing.

792
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,299
I will definitely repay this money.

793
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,217
Just keep it.

794
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,176
Thank you.

795
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:50,147
Goodbye, take care on the way.

796
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:52,482
- See you.
- Take care.

797
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:16,507
Hello, may I help you...

798
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,116
how's it going?

799
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,744
I need to undergo surgery...

800
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:49,331
...I see.

801
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:32,665
Mom will definitely get better.

802
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,626
I want to see Xiaohao grow up.

803
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,044
See you get married...

804
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:43,510
I will become a doctor and cure Mom's illness.

805
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,055
Thank you.

806
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:02,070
Ryota.

807
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:07,117
How is your mother?

808
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,077
She's fine now.

809
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:09,452
Really?

810
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:10,453
Yes.

811
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,205
And what about you?

812
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:13,832
I'm fine.

813
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:14,916
Really?

814
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:15,291
Yes.

815
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,294
Has the date of discharge been set?

816
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:20,339
Yeah, next week.

817
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,676
But I might have to go to the hospital more often in the future.

818
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,720
I see.

819
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:31,391
Take this.

820
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:34,353
No need.

821
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,144
No need.

822
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:37,522
I'm a salaried worker, after all.

823
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:40,567
Thank you very much.

824
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:49,534
Do you have time later?

825
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:50,576
San.

826
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:51,202
Yeah?

827
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:52,996
Can you accompany me for a while?

828
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:54,748
okay, I got it.

829
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:59,127
If it has already traveled 60,000 kilometers,
it's too expensive to repair.

830
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,339
The door won't open...

831
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:07,844
Ryota, can you come over for a moment?

832
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:14,226
What's up?

833
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,560
Do you want to check out this car?

834
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:16,770
- This car?
- Sun.

835
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:17,855
Sure.

836
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,647
Ah, sit here.

837
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:22,484
do you have a driver's license.

838
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:23,734
Yes.

839
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:28,865
Actually, I thought getting a driver's license might give me more job opportunities,

840
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,992
but it didn't really help.

841
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:34,829
It's spacious, right?

842
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:36,873
Yeah.

843
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:38,207
Is the interior nice?

844
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,168
It's a compact car, right?

845
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,378
Compact cars these days are impressive.

846
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,131
It even has an electronic toll collection system (ETC).

847
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,178
I want to buy a car.

848
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:51,680
buy it in your name.

849
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,101
Your mom has trouble with her legs, right?

850
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:01,106
I feel bad making her go to the hospital so far.

851
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:03,400
It's really not necessary...

852
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,276
so be it

853
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,736
Then how about you contribute some money?

854
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,614
Just pay a little bit each month.

855
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:10,990
What do you think?

856
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:20,358
Let's both make the maximum effort for the sake of your mom.

857
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:28,508
Thank you... San.

858
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:41,730
You scared me.

859
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:49,070
Hey, don't drink like that.

860
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:49,862
Are you OK?

861
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:57,120
This is good wine, you shouldn't drink it like that.

862
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:12,594
When I was a kid...

863
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:19,100
Since my mom got sick, our family had our only trip together.

864
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,644
We went to the seaside.

865
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:25,607
Looking back now, that hotel was really run-down...

866
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,650
But as a child, I was really happy.

867
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:35,908
I was so excited that I kept talking to Mom the whole time we were in bed.

868
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:40,122
The next day, probably in the morning,

869
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:43,416
we went to a beautiful cape.

870
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,921
I don't know why, but I just kept staring at the sea.

871
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:54,344
The sea breeze was really strong.

872
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:03,019
I was thinking, can this wind blow away Mom's illness?

873
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:07,691
Hey, what's the matter?

874
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,026
Stop it. Why are you hitting me?

875
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:11,653
Mr Kosuke "Membership Card I"
At 10 o'clock.

876
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,071
Do you believe in heaven?

877
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:14,322
Why are you suddenly asking about that?

878
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:14,948
Heaven?

879
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:19,327
Heaven? I don't believe in that kind of thing at all.

880
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:19,869
Is that so?

881
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:22,622
I only believe in things I can see.

882
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,541
But if there is a heaven,

883
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,168
maybe one day we'll be able to see your mom again, right?

884
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:33,507
Well, thinking about it won't give us an answer to this kind of thing.

885
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,803
Kosuke-san, you're really a super realist.

886
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,846
Thanks for the compliment.

887
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:40,306
I'm not complimenting you.

888
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:40,932
I am complimenting you.

889
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:41,599
not running for you

890
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:42,725
Enough, stop it.

891
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:43,184
Keep taking a few more.

892
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,478
Enough, what are you doing?

893
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:45,937
Let me take more.

894
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,480
Take more? Are you taking a porn film?

895
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,147
Don't be like that.

896
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:50,191
Don't be like that.
You stop taking pictures.

897
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:51,776
Stop it, it's itchy.

898
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:52,943
Please stop quickly.

899
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:57,949
You want me to blow here?

900
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,330
- Does it feel comfortable?
- Yes, it's comfortable.

901
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:08,877
It feels great to have someone help blow dry your hair, right?

902
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,295
I really like it.

903
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:13,256
Do you like it?

904
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,102
Good morning.

905
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,272
Good morning. It's rare for you to wake up early.

906
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,566
I'll make some coffee too.

907
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:15,693
Do you know how to make it?

908
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:16,736
Yes, I know.

909
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,198
Should we pick up the car on Sunday?

910
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:20,906
Yes.

911
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,284
Then let's drive to the seaside.

912
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:24,911
- The seaside?
- Yes.

913
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:26,871
Will you drive?

914
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:29,165
- Scary.
- For sure.

915
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,793
I feel a bit nervous.

916
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:32,877
No problem.

917
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,087
Okay, let's go.

918
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,004
- Drink.
- Drink.

919
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:45,973
Drinking coffee at your place should be nice, right?

920
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:50,311
Here? Can't we drink it on the couch?

921
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:54,274
Drinking on the couch is also fine,
but I just want to sit on yours.

922
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:55,358
- You want to sit on mine?
- Yes.

923
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:56,359
Then come and sit.

924
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:57,818
Not that.

925
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:00,488
What's the difference?

926
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:05,785
Take this gift.

927
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:07,412
Thank you.

928
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:08,955
Goodbye.

929
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:10,539
Good luck.

930
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,796
Mr. Kosuke, do you like me?

931
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:18,965
I hate you.

932
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,843
I'm lying. I actually like you the most.

933
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:24,888
I knew it.

934
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:28,975
Why do you seem strange?
What's wrong?

935
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:31,519
I am leaving.

936
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:32,478
Okay.

937
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:34,564
Good luck.

938
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:35,398
Thank you.

939
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,120
Come on, Nakamura.

940
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:51,373
Okay.

941
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:54,333
Move over there, right?

942
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:54,875
Yes, over there.

943
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:02,133
Let's just put it here.

944
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:04,510
Okay, can it stand up?

945
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,559
Okay, cute. Very good.

946
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:13,478
More. More smiles.

947
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,480
Yes, very cute.

948
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:19,317
Yes, okay.

949
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,318
Ah, very good, very good.

950
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,490
Let's put it next to it.

951
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:27,700
OK.

952
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:30,453
I'm going to put it down, okay?

953
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:36,834
Looks cool, quite good.

954
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:45,634
That's enough.
We've taken enough.

955
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:46,928
Okay, let's stop here.

956
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:49,305
Thank you. You've been a great help.

957
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,348
No, no, I'm very happy.

958
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:51,057
Remember to send it to me.

959
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:51,683
of course.

960
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:55,353
That's great. It's really good.

961
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,980
I'm so happy, really happy.

962
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:39,147
Ah, it's already past nine.

963
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:44,319
Ryota it's time to wake up.

964
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,739
Should we go to Mr. Kosuke's house?

965
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:36,662
Ryota? Where are you now?

966
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:37,663
The car has already been delivered.

967
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,335
Ah, sorry. Is it... Sorry, is it Auntie?

968
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:48,716
I'm Saito. Is Nakamura still sleeping?

969
01:13:57,975 --> 01:13:58,767
What?

970
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:06,942
Wait, wait... What?

971
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:20,540
Mr. Kosuke... that...

972
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:28,214
Ryota... he passed away...

973
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:32,635
he didn't wake up this morning...

974
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,220
When I went to wake him up...

975
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:37,724
There was no breath in him under the covers...

976
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,562
He... he's gone...

977
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:47,567
He... he's gone...

978
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:23,269
Sorry, Wang Si. Are you okay?

979
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:07,188
I'm fine.

980
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,064
I'm sorry.

981
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:14,320
Are you okay?

982
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:15,362
I'm fine. Sorry...

983
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:17,155
It's okay.

984
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:20,617
Sorry...

985
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,126
You okay?

986
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,723
How are you?

987
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:47,812
Take a little rest here.

988
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:49,147
Sorry...

989
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:01,659
Do you want something to drink?

990
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,203
...No need.

991
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:56,672
Today has really troubled you.

992
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,090
Thank you very much.

993
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:09,643
You take care too.

994
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:11,729
Thank you for coming here today.

995
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,983
I'm sorry.

996
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:19,569
Why are you apologizing?

997
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,909
If Ryota heard you apologizing, he would be very sad

998
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:45,680
On the day you came, I asked Ryota.

999
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:53,604
I asked him, "Is he the 'important person' to you?"

1000
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,069
Ryota couldn't answer.

1001
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:03,698
so i told him

1002
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:12,423
It doesn't matter whether you like men or women.

1003
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:20,297
As long as you can find the person you truly love,
isn't that the best thing?

1004
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:30,933
Ryota was just like you back then.

1005
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:36,521
He said countless times, "I'm sorry."

1006
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,990
But Ryota also said,

1007
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:52,621
"I was saved by Mr. Kosuke

1008
01:19:55,332 --> 01:20:00,671
"So, this world is not just hell..."

1009
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:10,306
I'm really thankful to you.

1010
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,071
Why did you suddenly come back?

1011
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:09,490
Did something happen?

1012
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:11,533
sorry, i came back to find something.

1013
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:15,746
You could have told me,
and I would have helped you find it.

1014
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:19,875
But that thing is something only I know where it is

1015
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:23,546
Is that so? Have you found it?

1016
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:27,341
No, I'll go back to my house in Tokyo and look for it again.

1017
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:28,717
I see.

1018
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:34,432
So, are you staying overnight tonight?

1019
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:38,894
Yeah, I'll stay for the night.

1020
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:42,022
Then I'll go cook dinner.

1021
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:45,651
Really? Thank you.

1022
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,170
Yeah, fish is delicious

1023
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,844
- I was going to say..
- Yeah?

1024
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:15,348
During the time when Mom was sick, was it difficult for you?

1025
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:20,394
It wasn't that difficult, really.

1026
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:23,647
There was just one time

1027
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:30,654
when your mom shouted at me,

1028
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:34,658
telling me to leave her.

1029
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:40,998
She said, 'I don't want to trouble you anymore.

1030
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:44,376
And then?

1031
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:52,050
And then I said, 'If you hate me, let's get a divorce...'

1032
01:22:54,052 --> 01:23:00,267
But if it's not like that, then don't say those things anymore.

1033
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:04,729
Since we know each other, this is our fate.

1034
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:09,026
If it's fate, then let's continue on together.

1035
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:18,410
I'm not good at expressing myself, I didn't know what to say to her.

1036
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:25,417
But at that time, both your mom and I cried like babies.

1037
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:45,854
This is the first time I've heard about this.

1038
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,292
I'm here.

1039
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:12,422
Sorry for the sudden visit."

1040
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:16,009
Sorry for the sudden visit.

1041
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,138
Come in, come in, it's raining outside.

1042
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:22,557
I happened to be nearby and wanted to pay my respects.

1043
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:24,101
Thank you for going out of your way.

1044
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,376
Excuse Me.

1045
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:51,253
Thank you.

1046
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:57,425
really trouble you

1047
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:59,011
It's a bit dark, isn't it?

1048
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:02,223
I turned off the lights, sorry about that.

1049
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:04,307
Turn on the lights over here.

1050
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,938
It's a bit brighter now, right?

1051
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:12,316
thank you for your hospitality.

1052
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:19,030
It's really gloomy in here.

1053
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:20,991
Are you doing well lately?

1054
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:22,075
thanks to you, I'm doing fine.

1055
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:23,451
Are you busy with work?

1056
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:25,120
Yeah, it's been busy recently.

1057
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,664
- Oh, I see
- How about you, Auntie

1058
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:31,585
Just getting by, making do.

1059
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:32,920
Like that..

1060
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:34,796
Yeah, exactly.

1061
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:41,636
Oh, Auntie, please accept this little token of appreciation.

1062
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:45,474
Huh? What is this?

1063
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:52,731
What's this money for?

1064
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:55,275
Consider it as a part of your living expenses.

1065
01:25:57,069 --> 01:26:02,116
I can't accept this. It's too much money...

1066
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:04,242
Well..

1067
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:11,708
Well... actually..

1068
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:23,178
I've been supporting Ryota every month.

1069
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:26,807
He has been working hard for you.

1070
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:30,102
Did Ryota suggest this?

1071
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:31,270
Oh no, it's not like that.

1072
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:35,941
It was my decision to support him.

1073
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:39,820
It's more like a form of sponsorship.

1074
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:40,904
Every month?"

1075
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:46,951
Yes, Ryota has been working really hard for you.

1076
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:50,455
"I also wanted to do something for both of you.

1077
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:53,291
So, I provided him with support.

1078
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:58,338
There's really no other meaning to it.

1079
01:26:58,714 --> 01:27:00,633
I just wanted to work hard together with him.

1080
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:03,927
Oh.

1081
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,681
F and people.
How should I put it?

1082
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:11,559
Ryota has passed away now.

1083
01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:17,316
I want to do something for you on his behalf.

1084
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:22,362
But... even if you say so...

1085
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:25,574
I appreciate your kindness,

1086
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:29,327
but I can't accept this money.

1087
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,211
But I want to...

1088
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:44,551
I hope your future life can be a bit more stable.

1089
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:50,933
so......

1090
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,853
Even though I can't fully replace Ryota...

1091
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:56,020
but seriously,

1092
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,274
even if I can show filial piety in this way...

1093
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:03,361
I hope you can accept my impolite request.

1094
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:13,956
Thank you so much.

1095
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,041
Thank you.

1096
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:31,557
I've really been selfish.

1097
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:35,811
I'm sorry...

1098
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:41,692
But I really can't forget everything.

1099
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:45,778
Ryota used to work so hard.

1100
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:54,120
And I sponsored Ryota every month.
What can I do for you?

1101
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:57,249
I really can't accept that everything has turned into nothingness

1102
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:01,086
Please... I'm sorry...

1103
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:06,466
Please, I beg you.

1104
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:23,483
I'm sorry.

1105
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:30,783
I don't feel good hearing your apologies either.

1106
01:29:33,076 --> 01:29:35,036
All right.

1107
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,916
Then let's stop apologizing to each other.

1108
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:43,504
That's true.

1109
01:29:45,255 --> 01:29:47,090
Well, thank you.

1110
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:48,842
I also want to thank you.

1111
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:45,566
Okay, we're done.

1112
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:49,652
Okay, we're done. Another drink. Another drink...

1113
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:50,404
That's enough, Xiaowu.

1114
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:55,199
Why not dilute all your troubles with alcohol?

1115
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,368
Is it not good this way?

1116
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:57,618
Keep working, hurry up.

1117
01:30:57,619 --> 01:30:59,162
But you seem to be in good spirits, right?

1118
01:30:59,162 --> 01:30:59,996
Isn't that so?

1119
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:02,832
Let me tell you, I helped his mother with a small favor.

1120
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,459
What kind of favor?

1121
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:05,961
It's about the money....

1122
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:07,420
You gave her money?

1123
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:09,088
Also bought some things...

1124
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,758
Are you offering sacrifices or something?

1125
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:13,718
But I didn't give much.

1126
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:14,594
How much did you give?

1127
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:18,723
I give as much as I love... just enough for living expenses.

1128
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:24,104
But you're not that well-off either... How about yourself?

1129
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,522
It's okay. It's not what you think at all.

1130
01:31:27,357 --> 01:31:29,192
What do you mean?

1131
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:31,486
Lao An, what do you think?

1132
01:31:31,778 --> 01:31:33,071
Let Xiaoxiao handle it...

1133
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:37,784
It's complicated if we involve Lao An.
Don't worry about it.

1134
01:31:37,784 --> 01:31:38,743
By the way, Kota, how are you?

1135
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:40,078
What about the marriage application form?

1136
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,371
Don't ask about that.

1137
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,164
Don't ask. Bringing that up just hurts.

1138
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:44,374
Really? So soon?

1139
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:45,458
Forget it. Let's have a drink.

1140
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:47,293
Although it was just for fun, it still hurts.

1141
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:48,711
What? Weren't things going well between you before?

1142
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:49,504
We got divorced...

1143
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:03,184
Isn't that better?

1144
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:04,435
Is it?

1145
01:32:05,562 --> 01:32:08,648
It withered like this.

1146
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:12,194
Where should I put this?
I'll put it on the balcony for now?

1147
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:12,527
Okay.

1148
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:13,653
put it here.

1149
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:24,664
What about this side?
Should I clean it up a bit?

1150
01:32:25,915 --> 01:32:30,336
Okay, sure. Thank you for your trouble.

1151
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:32,297
It's rare to have such good weather today.

1152
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:06,206
Is that so?

1153
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:07,290
I have to clean up near my house too...

1154
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,375
Yeah, after all, you lost your mother early.

1155
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:12,753
Yes, but my father is quite diligent.

1156
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,425
Can he cook?

1157
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:17,091
Yes.

1158
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:18,385
Does he also do house cleaning?

1159
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:20,303
Yes, we take turns doing household chores.

1160
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:24,682
I really married the wrong person.

1161
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:33,441
Ryota's dad doesn't care about anything at home.

1162
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:36,027
When Ryota was still in elementary school,

1163
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:39,948
he started bringing women home.

1164
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:42,074
That's really outrageous.

1165
01:33:42,075 --> 01:33:43,285
How can there be such a person?

1166
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:44,285
Unbelievable, right?

1167
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:46,829
I was the one who discovered it.

1168
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:50,250
But I really felt that I couldn't go on anymore because of that incident.

1169
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:55,421
I asked him, "What if Ryota sees it?"

1170
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:59,467
And he said, "Maybe their school is organizing a summer camp?"

1171
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:01,219
"I know about it."

1172
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:04,013
"I know about it"... What's that attitude?

1173
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:07,267
Yes, he had no fear at all.

1174
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:11,938
Later, he eloped with that woman.

1175
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:16,317
But he called my house later.

1176
01:34:17,527 --> 01:34:18,528
What did he say to you?

1177
01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:22,657
Actually, I don't even want to hear his voice.

1178
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:26,703
But he still had that arrogant tone.

1179
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:29,247
Wait, can I guess?

1180
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:29,706
Go ahead, guess.

1181
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:30,707
Was he asking for money?

1182
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:31,207
You got it.

1183
01:34:31,207 --> 01:34:31,791
That's exactly it.

1184
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:35,336
But at that time, I had some health problems.

1185
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:43,303
Longtai was worried about me,
so he dropped out of high school to work and support the family.

1186
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:48,725
I can't do something that betrays Ryota.

1187
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:52,729
So I told him that no matter what he said, he wouldn't work.

1188
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:53,521
That's really how it should be.

1189
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,565
He confidently said, "Ryuta is making money, right?

1190
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:57,317
"So, you must have money at home, right?"

1191
01:34:57,984 --> 01:35:02,030
I've never been so angry before." hangs up the phone

1192
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,031
After that, he never called again.

1193
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:06,326
Thank you so much for helping me through all of this.

1194
01:35:06,326 --> 01:35:08,036
No trouble at all.

1195
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:10,372
Thank you very much.

1196
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:11,956
You're welcome.

1197
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:16,794
This should be about it then.

1198
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:17,753
Yes.

1199
01:35:19,505 --> 01:35:20,965
It's already late.

1200
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:25,553
Well, I should probably leave soon.

1201
01:35:28,097 --> 01:35:33,561
Would you... like to stay overnight?

1202
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:39,150
How can I impose like that?

1203
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,570
Tomorrow, you have a day off, right?

1204
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:45,072
Yes, I don't have work tomorrow.

1205
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:49,119
Then, sleep in Ryu's room.

1206
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:59,337
Oh, I'll prepare hot water for you to take a bath.

1207
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,260
Can I really?

1208
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:07,804
I'll prepare it for you right away.

1209
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:09,764
Wait a moment.

1210
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:11,266
I'm sorry for the trouble.

1211
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:27,031
I left pajamas and towels outside.

1212
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:28,866
Ah, thank you for the hall.

1213
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:42,839
Thank you, Auntie.

1214
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:48,385
Oh dear, Ryu's clothes are a bit small.

1215
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:50,096
It's alright.

1216
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:51,431
No, really.

1217
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:53,558
Where? It's because I'm too strong.

1218
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:58,605
But you should be grateful to your parents for having such a strong body.

1219
01:36:58,604 --> 01:37:00,564
Thanks to your parents.

1220
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:05,194
Actually, it's a bit too strong.

1221
01:37:06,321 --> 01:37:11,368
didn't intend for Ryu to have such a strong physique.

1222
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:15,621
He was weak when he was young,

1223
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:23,004
but he worked really hard,

1224
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:25,798
grew up to be so tall.

1225
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:31,971
I guess that's why he wanted to do that..

1226
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:36,642
What's it called? Training?

1227
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:47,194
It's the kind of job that helps people who work hard.

1228
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:51,324
I think that's how he sees it..

1229
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:07,965
Yes.

1230
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:32,114
Stand up.

1231
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:49,090
Feels so comfortable.

1232
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:51,134
Hey, my body can't take it anymore.

1233
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:51,593
Nonsense,

1234
01:38:52,385 --> 01:38:52,969
you're getting older.

1235
01:38:52,969 --> 01:38:54,679
no no no

1236
01:38:57,348 --> 01:39:01,143
I think it's time to sort things out in Ryu's room.

1237
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:03,562
Take whatever you want.

1238
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:06,316
Then I'll go take a look later.

1239
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:09,902
Yes, over there.

1240
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:11,863
Feels so comfortable.

1241
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:14,573
You're feeling much better now.

1242
01:39:14,574 --> 01:39:15,492
Is it ok?

1243
01:39:15,491 --> 01:39:17,576
Yes, thank you.

1244
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:19,161
Would you like something to drink?

1245
01:39:19,162 --> 01:39:20,497
Thank you.

1246
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:31,758
Can you help me dye my hair?

1247
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:34,385
sure.

1248
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:35,136
Like this?

1249
01:39:35,303 --> 01:39:35,845
Yeah.

1250
01:39:36,429 --> 01:39:37,597
That's great.

1251
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:40,308
I'm good at this kind of thing..

1252
01:39:43,102 --> 01:39:46,689
because I also have a lot of white hair.

1253
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:48,274
You're still young...

1254
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:51,652
No, no, when you look over here.

1255
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:53,821
Ah, really, there are some.

1256
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:55,323
Right, oh.

1257
01:39:59,619 --> 01:40:01,454
Sorry for bothering you, thank you for your hospitality.

1258
01:40:01,871 --> 01:40:03,331
Thank you too.

1259
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:05,583
Then I'll leave.

1260
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:06,167
Alright.

1261
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:09,962
Here, for this month.

1262
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:15,926
Thank you so much.

1263
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:25,645
If you don't mind,

1264
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:27,897
how about living together?

1265
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:32,693
Living in my house, just the two of us.

1266
01:40:42,078 --> 01:40:43,204
Isn't that... too much?

1267
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:45,581
No, no, it's completely fine.
There's no problem at all.

1268
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:50,128
No, it's really too much.

1269
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:54,549
Why would you say that? Isn't it better to live together?

1270
01:40:54,549 --> 01:40:58,219
In case something happens, it's good to have someone living together for support.

1271
01:40:58,427 --> 01:40:59,762
I'm sorry.

1272
01:41:10,815 --> 01:41:13,484
Thank you for your kindness,

1273
01:41:15,945 --> 01:41:20,450
but this time, please listen to me. Please.

1274
01:41:20,449 --> 01:41:22,284
That is...

1275
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:27,665
It's completely fine. If you don't want to,

1276
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:36,632
Please have a friend's heart.

1277
01:41:36,841 --> 01:41:44,098
From Daikura Kyufu.

1278
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:09,164
Welcome.

1279
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:35,191
Hello, please wait a moment.

1280
01:42:43,366 --> 01:42:44,826
Hello, I'm Saito.

1281
01:43:04,804 --> 01:43:05,638
May I ask...

1282
01:43:06,263 --> 01:43:06,722
Hello.

1283
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:09,725
Do you have business with Mrs. Nakamura?

1284
01:43:09,725 --> 01:43:10,726
Yes.

1285
01:43:11,811 --> 01:43:17,567
Mrs. Nakamura was hospitalized a week ago.

1286
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:19,944
I see.

1287
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:20,861
Yes.

1288
01:43:36,377 --> 01:43:37,837
Hello.

1289
01:43:37,837 --> 01:43:40,173
May I ask which ward Taeko Nakamura in?

1290
01:43:40,339 --> 01:43:41,423
Ah, you're her family?

1291
01:43:41,424 --> 01:43:44,010
I am her caregiver.

1292
01:43:44,009 --> 01:43:46,011
Alright, please wait a moment.

1293
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:52,685
She is staying in room 916 over there.

1294
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,061
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

1295
01:44:10,119 --> 01:44:13,914
You brought a lot of things. Are you her son?

1296
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:15,624
No, I'm not.

1297
01:44:26,427 --> 01:44:27,970
is it your son

1298
01:44:30,055 --> 01:44:33,433
no

1299
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:36,353
I-I'm the person who has been taking care of her son.

1300
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:43,986
How did you know I was here?

1301
01:44:44,069 --> 01:44:45,654
your neighbor told me.

1302
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:53,329
I'm sorry for not telling you.

1303
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:58,126
I felt that if I told you, you would worry.

1304
01:44:58,292 --> 01:45:00,294
I worried even more because you didn't tell me.

1305
01:45:02,546 --> 01:45:03,797
I'm sorry.

1306
01:45:05,758 --> 01:45:06,717
Why are you in the hospital?

1307
01:45:15,559 --> 01:45:17,770
Let's go downstairs for a walk.

1308
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:28,614
Today,

1309
01:45:30,825 --> 01:45:33,995
I really ran around to many places.

1310
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:35,246
Is that so...

1311
01:45:35,246 --> 01:45:36,873
And you're carrying such heavy things.

1312
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:41,210
I'm sorry.

1313
01:45:49,468 --> 01:45:52,638
How about resting here for a while?

1314
01:45:52,763 --> 01:45:54,139
Do you want to sit here?

1315
01:45:56,308 --> 01:45:57,851
Then let me help you get out.

1316
01:45:58,686 --> 01:45:59,270
Okay.

1317
01:46:00,437 --> 01:46:01,605
dad.

1318
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:04,900
Come.

1319
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:07,236
One, two, come.

1320
01:46:07,236 --> 01:46:08,320
Thank you.

1321
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:14,327
- Are you feeling sick?
- It's not a problem, just a little sickness.

1322
01:46:14,535 --> 01:46:16,037
I'll leave the wheelchair here for now.

1323
01:46:23,419 --> 01:46:24,545
So cute......

1324
01:46:27,089 --> 01:46:28,549
What's wrong?

1325
01:46:32,595 --> 01:46:34,764
The doctor said it's already stage four.

1326
01:46:39,018 --> 01:46:40,520
pancreatic cancer.

1327
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:48,861
I really don't want to have cancer.

1328
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:57,119
The doctor said the back pain is also because of it.

1329
01:46:59,163 --> 01:47:01,707
I probably don't have much time left.

1330
01:47:07,588 --> 01:47:08,672
I'm sorry.

1331
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:11,008
What?

1332
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:14,428
It's my fault.

1333
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:16,054
No, it's not.

1334
01:47:16,805 --> 01:47:17,514
I'm sorry.

1335
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:18,891
No, it's not.

1336
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:23,104
It's me... I pushed Ryota too hard.

1337
01:47:24,188 --> 01:47:24,939
it's not your fault.

1338
01:47:24,939 --> 01:47:28,651
It's all my fault for making Ryota do so much work

1339
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:30,778
and leaving you alone.

1340
01:47:30,778 --> 01:47:32,905
Turns out no one noticed your condition

1341
01:47:33,155 --> 01:47:34,948
what are you talking about

1342
01:47:35,824 --> 01:47:36,992
No, it's not like that.

1343
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:39,411
Stop apologizing.

1344
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:42,164
No, it's not like that.

1345
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:44,583
Stop apologizing.

1346
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:46,502
You didn't do anything wrong.

1347
01:47:47,419 --> 01:47:51,465
You don't need to apologize.

1348
01:47:58,180 --> 01:48:00,641
I really appreciate you.

1349
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:04,645
If I'm not mistaken,

1350
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:07,315
You should...

1351
01:48:10,109 --> 01:48:12,486
Love Ryuta

1352
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:18,200
And love me too, right?

1353
01:48:21,578 --> 01:48:22,871
I think that's how it is.

1354
01:48:25,124 --> 01:48:26,876
I......

1355
01:48:30,629 --> 01:48:32,798
I really don't understand what love is.

1356
01:48:36,385 --> 01:48:39,263
It's okay if you don't understand.

1357
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:47,688
As long as we feel that you love us, isn't that enough?

1358
01:48:51,525 --> 01:48:53,152
It's alright, it's alright.

1359
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:15,126
Hello.

1360
01:51:15,127 --> 01:51:16,545
You came

1361
01:51:17,838 --> 01:51:19,423
How was your day today?

1362
01:51:21,133 --> 01:51:23,135
This one is so beautiful.

1363
01:51:23,552 --> 01:51:26,263
Is it? Then I'll put it in a vase.

1364
01:51:26,346 --> 01:51:27,848
Is he your son?

1365
01:51:28,724 --> 01:51:29,058
No, he's not.

1366
01:51:29,057 --> 01:51:31,101
Yeah.

1367
01:51:34,730 --> 01:51:37,524
He's my son whom I'm proud of.

1368
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:04,528
So beautiful.

1369
01:53:09,825 --> 01:53:12,328
If something happens someday,

1370
01:53:12,869 --> 01:53:17,457
Mr. Kosuke's mother

1371
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:25,715
Will definitely help take care of Ryuta, right?

1372
01:53:37,769 --> 01:53:39,437
I'm sure that's the case.

1373
01:55:51,611 --> 01:55:52,779
I wanted to say...

1374
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:56,574
What's wrong?

1375
01:56:02,956 --> 01:56:05,041
Could you...

1376
01:56:09,129 --> 01:56:12,174
Let's stay a little longer.

1377
01:56:14,926 --> 01:56:15,718
Okay.

1378
01:56:45,373 --> 01:56:45,415
