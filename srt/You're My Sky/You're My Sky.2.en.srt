My destiny is with your Fa.

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,580
Just shoot.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,540
Practice and be better at basketball.
Then, follow me.

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,290
Practice a lot and seem to be
more determined than others.

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,940
When Coach Tuan sees us,
he'll think that we are freaking good.

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,910
The camp will be over in a few days.

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,370
What will we be after this?

18
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,330
Well, National Junior Basketball players.

19
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,370
Follow me.

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,500
Why didn't you dance?

21
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,220

Okay, today is Team Up day!

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,360
Don't overthink.

35

Mmm.

At least, tell me why.

Bro!

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,750
Because our team sucks.

52
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,870
Then improve the team performance.

53
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,950

Recruit some new players?

56
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,640
I can help you
with the practice or the game.

57
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,670
Do you think you're that good?

58
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,830
Do you think the team will be better
with only one player more?

59
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,160
Don't try too hard.

60
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,500
It's a waste of time.

61
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,750
You're the one who told me
not to give up easily.

62
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,990
But why do you do that?

63
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,330
I might forget to give you
one more lesson.

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,580
You can't have it all.

65
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,720
Whatever.

66
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,990
I probably don't know you well enough.

67
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,030
Yo, freshman.

68
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,040
Wanna shoot some hoops?
We're two men short.

69
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,690
What's up with that boy?

70
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,910
Senior Fa.

71
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,910
Wanna play basketball with us?

72
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,320
Wait.

73
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,200
It counts as cheating
with him in your team.

74
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,980
Please.

75
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,540
We'd love to play with you,
before you quit.

76
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,660
Can I play with you guys?

77
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,510
So, I can fill the spot.

78
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,200
Here it is, we have enough people.

79
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:18,910
And...

80
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,590
that senior's going to play?

81
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,330
He seems afraid that
people will know that he actually sucks.

82
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,220
I saw your name on the school forum.

83
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,170
Is it true that you're the fastest, Vee?

84
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,640
Just call him
the treasure of the running team.

85
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,380
He broke the record
on the very first day of his freshman year.

86
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,420
He's so fast that other universities
have to pray that he won't run.

87
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,720
It's a shame that
he'll run only one competition.

88
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,900
Indeed.

89
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,700
He's so good that
he'll win whatever competition he enters.

90
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
So suspicious.

91
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,010
What do you want, Pete?

92
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,590
Pond broke his leg.

93
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,540
What?

94
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,600
When?

95
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,320
This morning. The wound is still fresh.

96
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,710
And what about your relay team?

97
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,040
You have only three people.

98
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,400
That's why we need someone
to replace Pond.

99
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,330
We've been practicing for almost a year.

100
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,010
If we draft someone,
he has to have a good fundamental.

101
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,020
Vee, bro.

102
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,260
Help your seniors, please.

103
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,380
We'll be sunk with someone else.

104
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,780
Oh.

105
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,720
But I've never run a relay.

106
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,480
No one else has done that.

107
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,540
The coach said if we want to make it
in time for the Confederation match,

108
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,540
it has to be you.

109
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,890
Listen.

110
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,440
If you join the team, you'll be
the last runner, after Dome.

111
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,860
You're close, right?
Since he's your big sister's boyfriend.

112
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,690
Come on.

113
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,660
The worst that could happen is losing.

114

(Promoting Healthy Communities
by Professor Wiroj Sermsook)

115
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,010
Pick one card per person, okay?

116
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,420
Are you done?

117
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,000
Before we start,

118
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,990
I want to let you know that this year,
we'll change the study technique.

119
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,190
I want you to work in pairs,

120
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,800
with the same partner
for the whole semester.

121
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,370
But professor...

122
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,740
- I don't want to.
- The old one was already good.

123
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,000
Please don't.

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,790
Because in the past, you've worked solo.

125
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,140
But you mostly complained
when you were in the communities.

126
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,080
Especially, girls.

127
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,530
It's risky when you're out there alone.

128
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,040
Likely to have a fight
with some villagers.

129
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,320
I mean, girls in our faculty, right?

130
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,320
So, I think this year,

131
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,000
it'll be more appropriate
if you work in pairs.

132
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,990
If you already have your card,
find your partner.

133
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,960
Match a word card
with a picture of an organ card.

134
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,760
- Who's got my eye?
- An ear.

135
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,300
- Where's an eye?
- Who's an ear?

136
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,100
- Ear?
- Here, here!

137
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,540
- You can sit here.
- What you've got?

138
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,780
- A leg or a hand?
- Leg.

139
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,840
When you've found your match,

140
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,120
that's your partner
who will work with you for the semester.

141
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,740
Please get to know each other.

142
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,880
Professor Wiroj,

143
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,450
I can't find my partner.

144
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,540
Well, which card do you have?

145
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,790
(Heart)
I've got a heart.

146
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,140
(Heart)

147
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,700
There's a heart here.

148
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,660
But it doesn't seem
to belong to anyone.

149
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,270
Eh?

150
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,000
But I've prepared cards for
the same amount of this class's students.

151
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,730
Maybe,

152
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,910
somebody's skipped class since day one.

153
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,330
So can I work solo?

154
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,180
I am sorry.

155
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,940
I couldn't find the room.

156
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,990
I didn't remember which building.

157
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,160
Here he is.

158
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,040
The owner of your heart.

159
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
Ooh.

160
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,040
Is it Aai?

161
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,230
Alright, champ?

162
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,420
Why is he so good?

163
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,260
I know.

164
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,340
No wonder he gave up
on the faculty's basketball team.

165
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,260
Watch the game.

166
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,040
If you can't even rely on yourself,

167
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,980
don't think to carry the team.

168
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,080
When this game finishes,

169
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,580
I hope you'll come back to reality.

170
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,830
Did he just steal the ball from Fa?

171
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,640
Hey, what's the score?

172
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,700
4-1.

173
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,090
6-6, final game.

174
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,150
Wow.

175
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,870
- Awesome.
- We won!

176
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,680
Fa's team won! Woo!

177
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,520
Your boyfriend is the most intimidating.

178
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,080
He says a few words per day.

179
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,620
How can you say he is
kind, attentive and caring?

180
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,540
Wait.

181
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,880
Dome is not fluent in Thai.

182
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,710
If you want him to talk more,
talk to him in English.

183
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,440
So it is better then.

184
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,880
I'd rather be in silence
than speak English.

185
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,750
He'll understand whatever you say.

186
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,800
I just want my brother
and my boyfriend to get along.

187
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,330
Since you're both in the relay team.

188
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,620
Pan, I gotta go.

189
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,750
Pete just called me.

190
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,520
Okay.

191
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,830
See you at home.

192
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,950
Let's stretch.

193
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:48,040
Normally, Coach tells the relay running team
to always practice together.

194
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,160
It's an obligation.

195
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,910
We need to be in sync
when running a relay.

196
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,420
Our coach always says,
"Relationship is the most important."

197
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,160
Back massage?

198
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,950
Sure. Thanks.

199
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,450
Is it okay like this?

200
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,660
Can you do it harder?

201
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,220
This hard?

202
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,400
I'll remember that.

203
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,540
Don't worry when receiving the baton.

204
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,760
Just put your hand
in the right position.

205
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,430
And Dome will do the rest.

206
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,260
Ugh!

207
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,540
Ugh!

208
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,110
Ugh!

209
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:27,860
Ugh!

210
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,700
Ugh!

211
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,700
Ugh!

212
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,790
Hey, fresh towels.

213
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,700
Thank you.

214
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,000
- Thank you.
- Here.

215
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,130
Fresh towel.

216
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:49,800
You're okay?

217
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,720
Thank you.

218
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,410
- Tired?
- Thank you.

219
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,200
Okay.

220
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,540
Well?

221
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,620
Are you okay with relay?

222
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,620
I think I need more practice.

223
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,580
Good thing that you're the last runner.

224
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,170
Practice only receiving not passing.

225
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,840
You just need more practice
with Dome and you'll be fine.

226
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,450
Wanna practice more?

227
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,160
Passing a baton.

228
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,400
Why not?

229
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,870
Why are you doing that?

230
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,310
You don't know.

231
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,750
UV rays are everywhere.
So are P.M. 2.5.

232
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,620
You need that.

233
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,410
I know.

234
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,550
I asked why in the classroom.

235
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,310
Oh, I forgot to apply it this morning
and I have soccer practice.

236
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,420
We're done for today.

237
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,080
Next time, we're going to work in pairs.

238
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,830
Can I have your contact?

239
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,950
We'll become partners.

240
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,980
So, we can chat.

241
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,580
No.

242
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,910
We haven't got an assignment.

243
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,200
We don't need to talk.

244
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,620
You missed a spot.

245
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,720
Where?

246
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,000
Your forehead.

247
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,160
Where is it?

248
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,890
Never mind.

249
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,470
Can I have your contact?

250
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,770
It's annoying, right?

251
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,490
If you want it gone,
give me your contact.

252
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,970
And I'll find that spot.

253
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,630
At least a hint?

254
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,450
Or the first three letters.

255
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,620
Let me tell you something.

256
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,080
Just so we're clear.

257
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,730
I need my GPA for a scholarship.

258
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,750
If you don't take the class seriously,
and weigh me down,

259
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,160
do me a favor.

260
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,540
Drop this class!

261
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,000
Professor Wiroj,

262
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,470
I've heard that the master's degree
scholarship in Japan is now open.

263
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,080
Right.

264
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,480
I totally forgot.

265
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,580
You can send your application
and send your transcript afterward.

266
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,040
Yes, sir.

267
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,420
I've prepared all the documents.

268
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,110
Good.

269
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,800
I'll give them to you quickly.

270
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,370
What's wrong, Aai?

271
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,440
Professor...

272
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,040
Can I change my partner?

273
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,000
You haven't even worked together,
yet you ask me that.

274
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,790
Are you worried
that an athlete will be your burden?

275
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,540
This class is not so hard.

276
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,370
You can do it.

277
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,520
Give it a chance.

278
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
If you don't try,

279
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,080
how can you tell
if it'll be good or bad?

280
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,910
Senior Aai.

281
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,910
(Hello!)

282
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,580
Where did you get my contact?

283
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,500
Your contact ID is the same
as your Instagram ID.

284
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,700
I've tried to add it and it worked.

285
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,660
Is this destiny or what?

286
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,750
Most of the menu.

287
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,060
- Really? Is it editable?
- Yeah...

288
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,660
Hi, bros.

289
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,900
Where can I put away this ball?

290
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,620
Under the stairs.

291
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:03,620
Thank you.

292
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,830
Ing, can I ride you home?

293
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,530
Don't bother.

294
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,150
My dad will pick me up later.

295
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,110
Call me when you get home.

296
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,730
I miss you already.

297
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,120
Still nothing?

298
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,080
It's almost three years.

299
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:32,920
Enough.

300
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,550
You do that whenever I see you.

301
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,160
Anyway,

302
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,840
I'm counting on you
about our freshmen sports day.

303
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,760
Bye.

304
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,300
I'm gonna put this ball away.

305
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,770
Is it here?

306
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,540
Just go already.

307
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,220
Call me when you get home.

308
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,760
I miss you already.

309
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,440
Still nothing?

310
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,600
It's almost three years.

311
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,260
Don't daydream when you walk.

312
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,200
Or walk next to me,
so you won't get hit.

313
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,620
Bro.

314
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,160
Can we talk?

315
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,250
You're better.

316
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,540
It's still fun playing with you.

317
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,000
Why, bro?

318
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,130
Isn't it about the fact that you
didn't get in Junior Team second selection?

319
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,160
You knew?

320
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,000
Mm-hmm.

321
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,080
I already knew.

322
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,960
Kids at the camp were talking about it.

323
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,250
It's really that?

324
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,410
I just think that I'll graduate soon.

325
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,440
I've been playing basketball
for many years.

326
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,120
I'm not in the National Team
nor some club.

327
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,700
Shouldn't I do something else?

328
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,490
For all these three years,

329
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,100
our basketball team is getting worse.

330
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,650
The best players, they all graduated.

331
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,950
The rest are burned out.

332
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,340
The coach has just resigned.

333
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,580
He had enough of a low salary.

334
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,590
A sport
that you don't need to be the best.

335
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,720
It does not exist.

336
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,580
If you want to go far, you have to
be able to carry the whole team.

337
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,280
Or you just quit.

338
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,160
There's no hope in Chaiyakorn.

339
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,580
I'm here.

340
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,200
It'll be okay, since we're both here.

341
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,790
We're a basketball duo.

342
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,540
I don't think that way anymore.

343
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,410
Sorry.

344
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,120
Why do you have to say "Ugh"
when passing the baton?

345
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,330
Actually, you can say anything.

346
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,830
We just don't feel like
finding other new words.

347
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,520
Let's change it.

348
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,240
I want to be a standout.

349
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,200
And "Ugh" is irritating.

350
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,820
Anything you like.

351
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,160
Your favorite color.

352
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,500
Favorite food.

353
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,750
How about Pan? You like her.

354
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,330
Crepe with egg.

355
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,120
For real?

356
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,850
Mmm.

357
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,250
Hello, Pan.

358
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,830
Yes.

359
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,370
We're just done.

360
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,990
Mmm-hmm.

361
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,040
Uh-huh.

362
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,500
Sure.

363
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,250
Mmm-hmm.

364
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,870
Okay.

365
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,950
You either don't talk much
with my sister.

366
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,990
If Pan talks, I talk,

367
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,910
who will listen?

368
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,410
When you first met,
how did you approach her?

369
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,410
Well,

370
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,370
I texted her.

371
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,290
And I asked my friends about what to say.

372
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,660
Seriously?

373
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,240
Isn't that too easy?

374
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,140
Don't you have
your special move for girls?

375
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,020
For example...

376
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,830
Yeah.

377
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,910
When I have a feeling for someone,
I'll use the eye contact technique.

378
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,370
I'll stare 'til they notice.

379
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,660
Force them to make eye contact.

380
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,410
And after that,

381
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,990
a piece of cake.

382
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,200
100% guaranteed.

383
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,200
Nonsense.

384
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,290
It's for real, I'll show you.

385
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,500
Let's go home.

386
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,670
Ow!

387
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,990
What's wrong?

388
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,160
I always feel pain in my inner thigh
after too much running.

389
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,120
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have made you stay.

390
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,000
Hey, it's okay.

391
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,950
I'll be fine after applying
a cooling gel pad.

392
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,650
Let's go home.

393
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,000
You stare like this?

394
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,440
That's creepy.

395
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,180
Teach me then.

396
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,260
Okay, I'll teach you.

397
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,370
There's something.

398
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,290
A sport
that you don't need to be the best.

399
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,520
A sport
that you don't need to be the best.

400
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,990
It does not exist.

401
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,200
You loser!

402
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,700
Hey, there's big news!

403
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,080
Coach Tuan's scandal
has been exposed to the public.

404
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,700
Listen to this.

405
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,340
Tuan,

406
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,200
why do you take Tupfa and Tohranin
out of the National Junior team list?

407
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,460
See?

408
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,370
They both have very good combined stats.

409
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,520
Do what I told you to do.

410
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,010
Don't ask too many questions.

411
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,050
All 20 players are filled, you see?

412
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,950
What do you want me to do?

413
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,040
But the last two on the list...

414
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:50,990
See?

415
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,200
They have much lower stats
than Fa and Torn.

416
00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:00,460
I think we better take them out
and keep Fa and Torn on the team.

417
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,330
Um,

418
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,380
for me, Tupfa,

419
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,160
I can give him one more chance.

420
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,560
But Tohranin is not fit for the team.

421
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,530
"Not fit"? What do you mean?

422
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:23,160
Is it because of his performance or
your special deal with some schools?

423
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,160
Torn might not be perfect.

424
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,120
But at least, he plays a lot better
than those two.

425
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,780
How many kids,

426
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,840
who's got picked
not because of their skill,

427
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,330
but because of your special deal?

428
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,630
And how long will you keep doing this?

429
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:46,740
No matter how good those 20 kids are,

430
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,180
they could be kicked out
whenever you got a deal?

431
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,570
Coach Big!

432
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,940
Don't you ever judge me with
your childish naive point of view again!

433
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,170
If you still say something like that,

434
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,840
you'll lose your future
in basketball career path.

435
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,610
Can I ask you one thing then?

436
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:23,750
Can you write Tupfa a recommendation
letter for Chaiyakorn University?

437
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,580
Just this one.

438
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,500
And I won't ask you for anything.

439
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:35,870
I'm here.

440
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,070
How are you, dude?

441
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,830
I've got a lot of texts.

442
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,960
So what did you reply?

443
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,160
I didn't.

444
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,210
It's nothing for me.

445
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,750
Hey, Fa.

446
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,480
Is it true about Coach Tuan?

447
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,640
We're waiting
to hear it from you, inside.

448
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,100
Oh.

449
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,410
Forget about it.

450
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,250
Bye.

451
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,900
Check on him.

452
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,270
I must be the last person
he wants to talk to.

453
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,650
The situation has changed.

454
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,220
I think now you're the one
who gets him the most.

455
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,220
In my first game, I failed so hard.

456
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,420
So, my dad took me to a place
like this one,

457
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,470
told me to close my eyes,
take a deep breath.

458
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,470
I really felt better.

459
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,910
Go!

460
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,190
I'll take note for you.

461
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,190
You've listened to it, right?

462
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:39,120
If I was not on the list because of
my performance, I wouldn't mind.

463
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,340
But it was because of
that freaking special deal.

464
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,600
And you,

465
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,980
you got it too.

466
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,480
What did I get?

467
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,470
I've been talking to kids from the camp.

468
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,310
They all said,

469
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,380
if it happened to me...

470
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,580
it happened to you too.

471
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,000
Do you know

472
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,340
that you had impressive stats?

473
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,730
It was even the best of the team.

474
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,370
Everybody was surprised.

475
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,120
So, I'm here to tell you

476
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,580
that I felt sorry.

477
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:08,700
Want some revenge?

478
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,370
Sports Science Confederation match.

479
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,040
Our team will be against his team.

480
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,290
We will know for sure

481
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,800
if you really suck

482
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,480
or you've been cheated on.

483
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,500
Let's take back
our stolen victory from him.

484
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,740
Even I want to do that, but I can't.

485
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,390
Our basketball team
has no skillful player.

486
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:11,530
Practice and be better at basketball,
then, follow me.

487
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,740
We will play together again.

488
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,220
Okay, my duo?

489
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,890
I'm right here.

490
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:29,620
When you miss a shot,
I'll go get the ball.

491
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:34,420
When I miss a shot,
you'll go get the ball.

492
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,410
And when the others miss a shot,

493
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,700
we'll help them.

494
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,500
Isn't it how basketball works?

495
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,490
A sport
that you don't need to be the best.

496
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,980
When you miss a shot,
your friends will be there.

497
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,800
This...

498
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,020
is basketball.

499
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,580
Follow me.

500
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,980
I'll follow you to the National Team.

501
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,330
Okay.

502
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,200
I'll think about it.

503
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,200
He likes a girl.

504
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,240
He's been approaching her
for a long time.

505
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:15,920
If you can't be number one,

506
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,370
you should reserve for number two.

507
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,530
How come we've never talked?

508
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,500
You've got a lot of attention, Vee.

509
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,860
What do you think after we've talked?

510
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:24,920
You're just like Pan.

511
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,800
Nope, I'm spicier.

512
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,740
It's your name.

513
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,720
It is my name.

514
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:33,400
But if we include what in parenthesis,

515
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,060
it means you.
