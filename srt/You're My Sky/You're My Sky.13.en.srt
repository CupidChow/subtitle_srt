00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:23,180
Hello, we are the cast of
"You Are My Sky".

2
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,820
Hi, I'm Tae, Chayapat Kongsub,
acting Tupfa.

3
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,580
Hi, I'm Suar, Krisanaphong Sripattiyanon,
acting Toranin.

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,260
Hi, I'm Kris, acting Dome.

5
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,840
Hi, I'm Porsche, Tanathorn Charoenratanaporn,
acting Vee.

6
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,580
Hi, I'm First, Thammarat Janngam,

7
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,220
Hi, I'm Perce, Patarakorn,

8
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,660
Hi, I'm Boom, Thanut Jiraratchakit,
acting Saen.

9
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,620
Hi, I'm Jump, Kananat Yansukon,
acting Aai.

10
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,020
(Let's talk about your feeling
about your first scene)

11
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,650
My feeling
when playing the first scene, well,

12
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,460
our first scene was
the "Meatball" scene, right?

13
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,860
- In Chachoengsao.
- Yeah, Chachoengsao.

14
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,580
When I first acted along with Jump,
we weren't getting any sleep.

15
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,500
(What?)

16
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,060
- We weren't sleepy.
- We weren't sleepy.

17
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,860
It was 3:00 AM. We were so woozy.

18
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,580
Yeah, we were kinda lost
because it was like our first gig.

19
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,220
We didn't know exactly
what to do in the scene.

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,380
For me, it was hard stuff.

21
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,780
- It was our first scene together. It...
- Right.

22
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,940
was an emotional scene
where he massaged my leg.

23
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,700
- And we weren't that close.
- Right.

24
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,580
So it was kind of a little bit hard.
But the crew helped us get it done.

25
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,470
- And you two are close now.
- No, I don't even know him.

26
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,700
Who is he?

27
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,820
My first scene was basketball practice.

28
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,660
It was a very tiring scene
because we were filming all day.

29
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,500
And I happened to get my vaccine
that day so I almost blacked out.

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,780
- You were! You were sleepy.
- Not "almost".

31
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,420
Mine is the relay scene
with Vee and Dome.

32
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,580
- That one?
- Yes.

33
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,730
We began at 7:00 AM
and finished at 8:00 or 9:00 PM.

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,060
Mine is that scene...

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,110
the kissing scene which was...

36
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,060
Rock-hard.

37
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,060
It was like a "Yes or No" thing.

38
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,460
It was like a feeling test for both of them.
And when they kissed, it was a yes.

39
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,090
(Which scene do you like the most?)

40
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,380
The scene I like the most
is in Episode 11,

41
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,640
where Torn acquired the golden form.

42
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,940
Of course!
My nose was bleeding that bad.

43
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,860
It was the scene where I thought
it was a challenge for me.

44
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,740
Because I had to be emotional
and bump a big guy, bigger than Kris.

45
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,820
I bumped him but I was the one who fell.

46
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,660
The scene where Tupfa and Torn walked on
the beach after the party with the team,

47
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,980
- and we were like "Let's take a walk".
- Yeah.

48
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,540
The vibe was perfect.
It was like a moment of opening up.

49
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,900
We finally felt relieved and lightened.
And the feeling was just right.

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,020
Yes.

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,300
The scene I like the most is probably...

52
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,060
where Dome and Vee kissed
and saw that Pan was behind them.

53
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,060
Why do you like it?

54
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,580
It was the scene where you felt...

55
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,140
What is happening?

56
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,700
Yes, what is happening?

57
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,980
- The scene I like the most is...
- I love shrimp.

58
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,860
Cool, I love shrimp.

59
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,580
It's where Suar and Tae
kissed on the bed.

60
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,260
And the teammates were giggling.

61
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,100
I think the scene is lovely and you can see
the warmth between the teammates.

62
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,620
The scene that I like is the freshman
orientation and graduation ceremony

63
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,140
- where we were wearing a gown.
- Oh.

64
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,340
I like the orientation scene
because I think it was so real.

65
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,060
- You could get the vibe, right?
- Yeah, you can feel it.

66
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,380
I like the "Ask You Out" scene.

67
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,020
The scene where he asked me to be
his boyfriend with the fireworks.

68
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,980
It was so beautiful
and the feeling was right.

69
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,980
Fine, I'll be your boyfriend.

70
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:13,300
♪I don't care whether
you let me love you or not♪

71
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,050
♪You are my good story...♪

72
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,380
(Which scene was the hardest?)

73
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,180
The hardest scene was
the basketball game.

74
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,060
Because there were a lot of sequences.

75
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,900
The cast members had different jobs
to do like... shooting the ball,

76
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,860
getting a nice pass... It was tough.

77
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,070
The hardest was
when I talked to Tae under the stairs.

78
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,970
Torn had been getting
very bad feelings from Fa.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,780
He broke his promise.

80
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,860
There was one line, "If someday I have
no one left, it's because everyone left me,

81
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,380
not that I left everyone."

82
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,960
Coach Tuan's way will
make you have no one left.

83
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,940
I'll leave no one,
if someday I have no one left,

84
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,540
that is because everyone left me.

85
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,470
The hardest for me is probably in Episode 6.
The kissing scene in Grandma's house.

86
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,900
Because it was an emotional scene.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,980
He was letting me do what I wanted.

88
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,380
I wanted a kiss but kinda asked
for his permission anyway.

89
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,700
I want a kiss, but it's OK. Never mind.

90
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,880
Why not?

91
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,340
It's a scene where I was using my phone
on the stairs, which was a post-wrap scene.

92
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,980
It wasn't hard for acting,

93
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,910
but it was hard
because everyone was pressuring me.

94
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,620
- Everyone was ready to scream.
- The final scene.

95
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,300
The hardest to film
was the running scene.

96
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,460
The running scene as well. It was hot.

97
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,300
You had to run fast enough to look real,

98
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,280
but not too fast to be out of the frame.

99
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,740
It was a hyperventilation scene.

100
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,820
The first time I acted, I blacked out,

101
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,780
and my body was numb for real.

102
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,860
The acting coach was helping me.
I almost got it at the first take.

103
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,440
But they asked me for another take.

104
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,760
(But can I have another one...)

105
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,790
- Hey.
- Hey!

106
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,220
Vee! It's okay, Vee.

107
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,430
(Paranormal experiences
while filming this series)

108
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,500
Please share your paranormal experience.

109
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,200
Well, there was a hotel...

110
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,660
- Really?!
- Not yet!

111
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,780
Don't pout, please.

112
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,030
That day, we had finished the 9th scene
and I wanted a rubber band for my hair.

113
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,220
So I walked there,
trying to ask someone from the crew.

114
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,980
First, Kris and Porsche were
acting in the drunken scene.

115
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,960
They told me that Saen was in the frame.

116
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,820
Even though I was walking
so close to the plant wall,

117
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,860
I was sure I wasn't in the frame
but they said I was.

118
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,740
And when I passed, there was an old
abandoned house with an undone looking.

119
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,740
I was walking by. It was so dark,
and I got chills down my spine,

120
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,260
but I thought it was nothing.
I turned around and looked at the window.

121
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,100
I saw a reflection that
looked like someone behind me.

122
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,500
I was shocked. I heard that
don't say it out loud or run.

123
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,510
But that night, I didn't care.

124
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,500
I ran to Som who worked
in the costume department.

125
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,700
I found her and asked for a rubber band.

126
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,020
Then I asked her to walk me back.

127
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,860
When she walked me back,

128
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,580
and I felt better,
I called a master of mine.

129
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,100
He was in a minor accident.

130
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,220
And he is the master about
supernatural stuff like a talisman.

131
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,340
I called him asking
"How are you doing? Are you hurt?"

132
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,020
I was asking him but then
he asked me "Who are you with?"

133
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,900
"Listen carefully, there will be
a lady coming toward you."

134
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,620
I was like, "Eh?" I didn't tell him.

135
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,020
Then he said, "But don't be afraid,
the hermit's spirit is protecting you."

136
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,260
Later, I couldn't sleep that night.

137
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,420
So I told Jump about this
when I went for my portable charger.

138
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,580
So Jump couldn't sleep either.

139
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,980
When you asked Som to walk you back,

140
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,360
did you let her walk back by herself?

141
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,260
Yes, I did.

142
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,210
She didn't know.

143
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,580
I've read about that house, there was
a gunshot incident and a woman had died.

144
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,700
Fan told me that she felt
it since the first night.

145
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,660
Fan told me
"I saw the hermit's spirit next to you."

146
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,180
She told me that.

147
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,420
Even I didn't tell her that I was in
a ceremony of a hermit of art or anything.

148
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,020
So I was like, "Oh my, it's real!"

149
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,740
- It was when we were filming at...
- B-Pro?

150
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:25,220
Yes, B-Pro Bang Na. I was
driving from my home around 6:00 AM.

151
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,020
Then a car from behind
was driving very fast.

152
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,180
It got into my lane and bumped into...

153
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,500
It flipped and bumped into
a lamp post on the expressway.

154
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,220
- Flipped?
- Yes. You have to see the video clip.

155
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,660
And it was nearly the lotto day, so
everyone asked me my license plate number.

156
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,260
And the lottery result
was exact my plate number.

157
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,660
- Som won the lottery.
- The same Som who walked Boom?

158
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,860
You again?

159
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,540
(How is the public reaction?)

160
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:01,220
The public reaction is pretty nice for us
who are new actors and a new company.

161
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,740
Especially among international fans
who are a lot.

162
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,860
(Which countries are the fans from?)

163
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,980
- Well, Brazil, the Philippines.
- The Philippines.

164
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,700
- Vietnam, Indonesia.
- Spain.

165
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,620
- Italy.
- China.

166
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,620
Oh yeah, Laos, Myanmar, practically all.

167
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,580
There are some compliments,
good lighting, beautiful shots,

168
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,620
great crew,
perfect lighting, good script...

169
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,020
- What about the cast?
- They're terrible.

170
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,100
- It was a joke, there're compliments.
- There're two good actors, though.

171
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,260
Torn and Fa, the younger ones.

172
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,660
No, three good actors. Coach Tuan.

173
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,900
(Working with the crew and the cast)

174
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,850
I'd like to thank the crew.

175
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,540
- Everyone who has been working so hard.
- Yes.

176
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,420
- All were dedicated and did their best.
- Right.

177
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,430
So the shots, the light, and the sound
are all great as you have seen.

178
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,820
I'd also like to thank everyone here,
who made everything fun.

179
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,620
I'd also like to
thank all the camera crew.

180
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,120
Because we are newbies,
so we couldn't deliver the perfect shots.

181
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,540
But they were so patient with us,

182
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,220
and did a very good job
as all the fans can see.

183
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,660
- The grandma was a great actress.
- Right.

184
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,140
- You could feel her warmth.
- Yes, you could.

185
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,620
And she really reminded you
of your own grandma.

186
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,700
- Coach Big is very handsome.
- The most handsome.

187
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,980
- The actor playing Coach Tuan is sweet.
- Sweet and kind.

188
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,460
But in the series, "Toranin!"

189
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,500
"You sucked."

190
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,590
Toranin, you sucked.

191
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,940
You really did.

192
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,020
And all the extra artists, they're good.

193
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,420
The producer did a good job in casting.

194
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,900
- They were in good character.
- Yes.

195
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,580
Good character, and they didn't
come in just to be in the scene.

196
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,940
- They were there to be fulfilled.
- That's right.

197
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,820
(What to tell all of your fans)

198
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:57,260
Okay, I would like to thank all of our fans
who keep supporting us eight.

199
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:02,640
All of the comments that you've sent us,
we all have seen them.

200
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,860
We've read everything
that you've tagged.

201
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,740
We are proud of being
just a kid who never had this.

202
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,420
I'd like to thank everybody
who adores and cares for us.

203
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,770
We can feel your love and support.

204
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,660
It is the motive power for us.
It really is. Thank you.

205
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,740
I'd like to thank all of our fans in Thailand
and from abroad who are supporting us.

206
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,780
And thank you all
who have been watching us.

207
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,030
We'd all like to thank you,
everybody who's been supporting us

208
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,060
from day 1,
from episode 1 all the way to episode 12.

209
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,220
We appreciate all of your support,

210
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,580
and we love all of you. Thank you.

211
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,020
And I'd like to thank all the
Thai fans and international fans.

212
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,910
Thank you
for always supporting us eight.

213
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:50,010
We are really glad that
you are here to complete us.

214
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,460
Okay, and please support us
World Y Entertainment.

215
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,100
And for those who might
have never watched the series,

216
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,660
you can watch all the 12 episodes
on WeTV.

217
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,660
Thank you.

218
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,380
But now we eight are here.

219
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,320
So we can't just leave yet.

220
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,180
We are going to play some games.

221
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,580
We are separated into four teams.

222
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,940
Two people on each team,
who are sitting next to each other.

223
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,220
Please keep waiting to see
what will happen next.

224
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,300
Let's go!

225
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,780

226
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,300
(Cheetah Tiger)

227
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,580
(Boom Is Means Jump)

228
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,540
(The Sinners)

229
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,620
And this is the team who will play first,
the team Single Boys.

230
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,340
Okay, you'll choose your option first.

231
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,500
Which one do you choose, A, B, C, or D?

232
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,540
- A.
- A.

233
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,540
- A.
- The first option.

234
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,220
You have 100 seconds for this round.

235
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,540
Are you ready? One, two, three, go!

236
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,260
(Physical)

237
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,340
Bodybuilding.

238
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,900
So close.

239
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,060
Physical therapy.

240
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,780
Okay, correct.

241
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,700
Basketball.

242
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,020
Correct!

243
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,540
(Saen)

244
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,100
Who?

245
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,140
- You got it!
- Saen?

246
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,500
What is that?

247
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,900
A lice itch.

248
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,780
Head petting.

249
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,540
Three, two, one.

250
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,380
- Coach Big! Coach Big!
- Time's up.

251
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,380
Yes, it is.

252
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,100
The time was up.

253
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,940
The team Single Boys got
four words, four points.

254
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,940
And the next team is The Sinners.

255
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,940
Can he read Thai?

256
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,180
He can read but
does not guarantee his understanding.

257
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,380
B, C, or D, which one do you choose?

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,220
Meal?

263
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,460
There's the word "meal".

264
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,420
Meal box.

265
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,620

- Basketball player. Tupboke.

275
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,100
(Relay Race)

276
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,700
Baton passing. Baton.

277
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,500
Relay race.

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,260
That was easy.

281
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,020
- The last one.
- Time's up.

282
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,060
You got six words, six points.

283
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,540
The next team is Boom Is Means Jump.

284
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,980
I choose B.

285
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,980
Ready? Three, two, one, go!

287
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,220
What is it? Waves.

288
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,540

Suar, I mean, Torn.

293
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,100
How can you say Suar?

294
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,720
Back?

295
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,180
Foul!

(Rebound)

298
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,220
- Layup. Shoot a basketball.
- Pass

299
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,820
Pass.

Pass, pass.

308
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,780
Why always pass?

309
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,380
Arm pain. Leg pain. Sore.
Running. Stretching.

310
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,700
- Cooldown.
- Yes.

311
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,580
Time's up.

312
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,460
The team Boom Is Means Jump
got four points.

313
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,580
- And now this game has ended...

the team Cheetah Tiger.

315
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,460
- I'm ready.
- Ready?

316
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,340
One, two, three, go!

317
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,740
(Win)

318
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,980
Happy. Win.

319
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,630
(Teamwork)

320
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,660
Hey!

321
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,060
Boom? Cheering?

322
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,700
Pass!

323
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,900
(Smart Watch)
Watch. Timing watch.

324
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,740
Running Apps? Mobile phone.

325
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,820
Pass!

326
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,340
Tupfa.

327
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,100
(Sports Union)

328
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,300
Pass!

329
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,380
(Soccer)

330
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,900
Kick a ball? A ball? Soccer?

331
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,940
Stretching. Warm your body. Warm up.

332
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,260
(Seafood)
Tupfa, Tupfa's eating. Tupfa's death.

333
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,820
Tupfa's getting fat.

334
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,780
Pass!

335
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,930
(Kiss)

336
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,860
Kiss.

337
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,780
Dome, I mean, Pete. Pete! Pete!

338
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,580
Easy.

339
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,900
Our team got six words, six points.

340
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,220
So easy, the last couple.

341
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,460
And the first game has ended,
the charades game.

342
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,260
- Yes.
- Well,

343
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,260
The Sinners and our Cheetah Tiger
both got six points.

344
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,700
Boom Is Means Jump and Single Boys,

345
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,220
- they both got four points.
- Ten points.

346
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,300
Four points.

347
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,500
But don't worry, we have many games.

348
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,660
We'll get more points, let's see!

349
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,900
Okay, the second game is
the Circle of Peanuts!

350
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,260
The rule of this game is so simple,
we give you a spoon,

351
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,980
and you have to run from one podium to
scoop peanuts while dribbling a basketball.

352
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,260
And the next person
has to dribble a soccer ball.

353
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,180
And then run.

354
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,620
And repeat that circle.
Each couple will have their turn.

355
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,540
We count the point from peanuts,
one peanut means one point.

356
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,620
The team who played last in the last game
will play first, which is...

357
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,580
Cheetah Tiger.

358
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,020
You have 100 seconds. Ready? Go!

359
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,220
Go!

360
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,740
Don't have any, I guess.

361
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,660
Go!

362
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,700
Faster, Tae, faster.

363
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,540
Six, five...

364
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,380
Two, one, time's up.

365
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,500
Chill, man.

366
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,340
Right, Tae? This game is chill, right?

367
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,420
Chill.

368
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,220
The team Cheetah Tiger has done playing.
We'll change the rule.

369
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,300
We change from one peanut,
one point, to ten grams, one point.

370
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,140
182 grams.

371
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,860
18 points.

372
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,860
Six points plus 18 points
equals 24 points.

373
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,940
Let's see the next team and that is...

374
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,700
Boom Is Means Jump.

375
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,260
Boom Is Means Jump's running now,
easy, man.

376
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,740
- They got four points. Are you ready?
- Yes.

377
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,860
Ready? Go!

378
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,540
Go! Go! Go! Go!

379
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,980
Oh, hey! Hey! Hey!

380
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,660
Any peanuts left?

381
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,060
- Let's go!
- The soccer player is here!

382
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,060
Hey! Where's the ball?

383
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,220
Jump!

384
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,260
Wow, cool. Looks delicious.

385
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,220
- His hand is shaking.
- Jump!

386
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,020
Hey! Hey! Hey! No peanut left.

387
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,820
Go! Go! Go! Go!

388
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,540
Nine, eight, seven...

389
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,660
No peanut!

390
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,060
Two, one, time's up.

391
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,560
Boom is cheating.

392
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,060
(Boom is cheating)

393
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,140
Okay, let's see how grand
the team Boom Is Means Jump is.

394
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,500
I was gonna throw that away.

395
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,860
13 points.

396
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,780
Four points plus 13 points
equals 17 points.

397
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,380
The next team is The Sinners.

398
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,780
Ready? Go!

399
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,780
Kris, don't forget to scoop the peanuts.

400
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,540
- Go! Go! Go!
- Why so many?

401
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:14,900
Here.

402
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,620
Let's go!

403
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,400
Hey! Hey!

404
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,300
Go! Go! Go! Go!

405
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,940
Kris got so many.

406
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,780
Wait, the ball, the ball.

407
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,500
(Where's the ball?)

408
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,060
Six, five...

409
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,220
Two, one...

410
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,500
Enough! Time's up.

411
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,620
Okay, The Sinners. Wow, they got plenty.

412
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,900
212, so 21 points.

413
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,460
Six points plus 21 points
equals 27 points.

414
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,900
And the last team, Single Boys.

415
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,700
- Ready.
- Ready? Go!

416
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,420
Go!

417
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,260
(Is that a joke?)

418
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,060
- No!
- No! Replay!

419
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,060
- Please.
- Go!

420
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,500
Let's go! Let's go!

421
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,180
He's a soccer player.

422
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,860
He scooped a big spoon
but they all fell.

423
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,460
- Easy.
- 30 seconds.

424
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,340
Go!

425
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,260
- Let's go!
- Here he comes!

426
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,540
Nine, eight, seven...

427
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,580
- Five, four...
- You can't make it, I guess.

428
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,580
Two, one.

429
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,220
Hey! Hey! Hey!

430
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:35,940
Let's see.

431
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,980
Wowww!

432
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,980
- That's enough.
- 17 points.

433
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,500
Plus 4 points equals 21 points.

434
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Now, the last team is...

435
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,180
Boom Is Means Jump.

436
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,820
The game Circle of Peanuts is over.

437
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,620
Thank you, Koh-Kae, for this game.

438
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,780
Thank you.

439
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,580
Eat properly, now.

440
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,060
(Creamy in every nut,
yummy in every bite)

441
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,980
Good!

442
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,140
The last team is Boom Is Means Jump.

443
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,300
And the first team on the leaderboard
is The Sinners.

444
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,220
What is the last game and will
Boom Is Means Jump get more points?

445
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,060
- Let's see.
- I don't want any.

446
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,700
- Let's see.
- Go!

447
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,860
And the last game is
Who Can Guess Your Number?

448
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,060
The rule of this game is,
we have to write down a number.

449
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,820
A couple writes a number,
any number between 1 to 1,000.

450
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,860
And we will see
what those numbers are for.

451
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,020
Please, discuss this with the team.

452
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,300
Yes, it is.

453
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,220
One, two, three, review.

454
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,620
(Cheetah Tiger 143, Boom Is Means Jump 357
The Sinners 550, Single Boys 961)

455
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,420
(Number you wrote = Milliliter)

456
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,940
Okay, for this game the rule is,

457
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,580
we'll drink Coke and leave it as close
as possible to our chosen number.

458
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,220
We get two bottles of Coke,
and you each will drink one bottle.

459
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,140
And then, combine and weigh the rest,

460
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,860
and leave it as close as possible
to our chosen number.

461
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,740
Okay, ready? Each couple can begin.

462
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,620
(Good stuff)

463
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,220
ILY sign? I love You.

464
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,260
- Can I help you?
- Almost done.

465
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,700
(Ahhh!)

466
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,900
So refreshing, bro.

467
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,100
Woah!

468
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,340
Too much, maybe?

469
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,580
- Ah!
- Too much.

470
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,620
Let's cheer for this.

471
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,520
(So bubbly)

472
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,910
I want some points but I also want
more Coke. What should I do?

473
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,740
- Buy it yourself.
- Buy some, right?

474
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,180
- Let's win first.
- Okay.

475
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,700
Okay, now we all have...

476
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,020
drunk Coke in the portion
that we thought we should.

477
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,620
Let's begin with The Sinners.

478
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,980
- What number have you chosen?
- 550.

479
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,780
The number on the scale must be
as close to 550 as possible.

480
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,090
Let's see.

481
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,860
- Oh, why are they so perfect?
- Cool.

482
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,940
(Why are they so perfect?)

483
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,180
Okay, tick, tick, tick...
And the number is 462.

484
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,140
The Sinners got -88.

485
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,620
You wait on the leaderboard.

486
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,420
Okay. Next is my team, Cheetah Tiger.
Suar, you go first.

487
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,740
Well, here I come.

488
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,430
- It's 143.
- Must be close.

489
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,420
Woah! It's close.

490
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,500
126 for Cheetah Tiger.

491
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,220
We are at -17.

492
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,020
At least we're not the last team,
we win over them.

493
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,580
Single Boys!

494
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,060
Our team used the E = mc2 equation
to calculate, so we...

495
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,940
Come again?

496
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,340
705.

497
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,620
705 plus 210...

498
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,140
equals 915.

499
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,220
They got -46.

500
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,340
And win over these two.

501
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,980
The last team, Boom Is Means Jump.
Which number you've chosen?

502
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,710
- 357.
- Woah, so close.

503
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,140
First place, maybe?

504
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,860
Hey, they're gonna win?

505
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,380
- 318.
- So -39.

506
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,880
Only -39.

507
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,580
And we've finished all three games.
Is it fun, guys?

508
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,020
- Yes, it is.
- So fun!

509
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,460
Okay, let's see the total score and
see who will bring this trophy home.

510
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,900
The team that got the least points is...

511
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,460

00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,740
(Fourth Place
The Sinners)

513
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,740
- Last place.
- We were tired of what?

514
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,780
The team that comes in third place is...

515
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,220
The yellow team, Single Boys.

516
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,220
(Third Place

517
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:41,060

our 'You're My Sky' Trophy is...

518
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,700
