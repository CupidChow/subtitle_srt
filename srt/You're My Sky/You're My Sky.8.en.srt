on the same day as Fa's tryouts.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,280
I got that scholarship in Japan.

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,040
But I didn't know what to tell you.

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,580
I was afraid that you
would feel bad if you knew.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,580
But the fact that I know it
from someone else still makes me feel bad.

16
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,290
I...

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:55,990
have decided.

18
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,620

(This is your chance to be part of our team.
Let's make history with Coach Tuan)

50
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,700
I think...

51
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,160
there are two types of people
in the world.

52
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,290
The first one,

53
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,000
is people who will be
better with the help of others.

54
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,700
They need someone to protect them,

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,620
someone to take care of them,

56
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,500
and grow with them.

57
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,700
The second one,

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,410
is people who improve themselves.

59
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,080
They push themselves to the top
so they can be a support for others.

60
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,370
For me,

61
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,370
it's so obvious
what type of person I am.

62
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,620
And I've been training my team
to be like me.

63
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,600
And that's my first step
to being successful.

64
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,290
Tupfa.

65
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,290
You are an elite.

66
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,490
But I have a question
that I always want to ask you.

67
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,950
Are you the same type of elite as me?

68
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,120
Welcome you all,

69
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,420
to the final
of the Sports Science Union Games!

70
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,910
Can Saint-Baylon,
the former champion, keep their title?

71
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,120
Or will Chayakorn,
the dark horse, steal theirs?

72
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,790
We will win not because of one player.

73
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,490
But because of our cooperation.

74
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,200
Teamwork.

75
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,830
Remember, okay?

76
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,120
Are you ready?

77
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,620
Yes!

78
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,750
- Here.
- Hands.

79
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,330
Here. Come on.

80
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,410
We're gonna win!

81
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,540
On three.

82
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,290
One,

83
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:37,750
two,

84
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,450
three.

85
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,910
Chayakorn!

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,500
- Wooh!
- Let's go! Go!

87
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,660
I'd love to be on Coach Tuan's team
but I need to be better.

88
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,400
How much better do you need to be?

89
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,450
I need to be top 12 in the country.

90
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,000
Top in the country?

91
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,000
And this year it will be held
by Saint-Baylon University,

92
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,680
where the national top coach,

93
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,180
Coach Tuan is.

94
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,160
Win over Coach Tuan's team.

95
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,030
And get the gold medal.

96
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,790
As we promised.

97
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,590
That jump was unbelievably high.

98
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,200
Chayakorn got the ball.

99
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,000
Chayakorn is in good form.
Can Saint-Baylon keep up?

100
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,460
What do you say, Saint-Baylon?

101
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,450
- Wooh!
- Wooh!

102
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,020
And Saint-Baylon gets their game back.

103
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,900
Now it's a tie.

104
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,080
Gonna be a good game for sure.

105
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,490
Relax, just play as we practice.

106
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:49,930
Go!

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,700
Chayakorn doesn't wait to strike.

108
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,500
Make a pass.

109
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,060
A trick pass! Again and again!

110
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,750
Oh! Another trick pass!

111
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,780
Here we go! Is he gonna make a shot?

112
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,250
Chayakorn makes another score.

113
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,400
And now, Saint-Baylon calls a time-out.

114
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,370
Wooh! Awesome! Come here!

115
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,240
Wow! You guys are doing great! Good job!

116
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,480
Just do as we plan, as we train.

117
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,050
Torn, if we're doing this,
we're gonna win for sure.

118
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,420
Absolutely! How could we lose the game?

119
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,620
We've been training hard, we can do it!

120
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,370
- Oh, are you guys feeling okay?
- We can do it!

121
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,040
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

122
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,750
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

123
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,080
- Can you do it?
- Yes!

124
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,160
Hands!

125
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,120
Let me say it this time.

126
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,410
On three.

127
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,880
One, two, three, Chayakorn!

128
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,620
Wow! The dark horse Chayakorn
is in very good form.

129
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,080
The three-time champion
Saint-Baylon might be defeated.

130
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,120
Hey, wanna watch?

131
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,820
The final match between
Chayakorn and Saint-Baylon.

132
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,620
Coach Tuan's got it hard.

133
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,660
Don't worry, I see their strategy.

134
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,630
Out, out, out.

135
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,660
You three are in.

136
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,830
I'm sorry, Saen.

137
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,810
Do you want to try it?

138
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,940
Do you want to try
a long-distance relationship?

139
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,800
I don't want you to wait for me.

140
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,540
But I'm willing to.

141
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,300
Well, if I'll never come back,

142
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,480
will you still wait for me?

143
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,490
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,960
I have been thinking.

145
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,730
I'll study and then find a job there.

146
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,750
I want to live there.

147
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,610
If we date knowing we'll break up,

148
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,580
would it be better
to not date in the first place?

149
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,450
What makes you think that?

150
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,450
Does the time we have
spent together mean anything?

151
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,290
Actually,

152
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,330
it is easy to answer.

153
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,010
Do you love me enough
to try a long-distance relationship?

154
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,740
That's it.

155
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,370
And we're back to the second quarter.

156
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,980
Saint-Baylon is now in a risky position.

157
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,020
Because Chayakorn now
has leading points.

158
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,540
I don't know how Coach Tuan will help
the former champ Saint-Baylon turn the tide.

159
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,120
Chayakorn's moving forward.

160
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,160
Ah, as good as before.

161
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,240
Here we go, here we go.

162
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,870
Fluke, on your right!

163
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,830
Oh! The ball got stolen.

164
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,900
Now, the table
has turned to Saint-Baylon.

165
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,040
This score belongs to Saint-Baylon.

166
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,710
This is bad.

167
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,250
Huh? What are you saying, Coach?

168
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,500
See?

169
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,280
Coach Tuan uses tall players.

170
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,790
No matter how perfectly we shoot,

171
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,580
in front of tall players,
it's like we shoot to a wall.

172
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,910
They force us to make a side step pass.

173
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,040
And they can steal the ball easily.

174
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,370
Uh, can I get a time-out?

175
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,290
Chayakorn calls a time-out.

176
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,330
Uh, listen, everyone,

177
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,680
just calm down.

178
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,410
Now we can't get open shots
but I have a plan for that.

179
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,870
Well...

180
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,220
Nah, it's too risky.

181
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,700
Let's say...

182
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,490
Let's do this, uh...

183
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,020
Coach.

184
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,660
What is your risky plan?

185
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,490
Torn, I think...

186
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,740
it's too risky, we don't use that.

187
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,620
Listen to me, we are going to, uh...

188
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,890
Coach.

189
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,000
Have faith in us.

190
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,660
Okay.

191
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,660
Now, the game has changed

192
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,080
after Coach Tuan changed
the strategy by using tall players.

193
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,500
Coach Tuan's team made a comeback.

194
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,580
Listen.

195
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,790
They are tall
but it's also a disadvantage.

196
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,890
We'll use the fast break strategy.

197
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,410
It's alright when they steal the ball.

198
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,780
Let them have it.

199
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,500
We just need to block the shot.

200
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,150
But the downside is
if we keep using this plan,

201
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,830
it will drain out your energy.

202
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,160
Can you take that?

203
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,700
Chayakorn's doing well
by using the fast break strategy.

204
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,620
But they use all their energy
for running.

205
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,290
How long will they keep fighting?

206
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,830
Kids, please go inside after
I check your name on the list.

207
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,870
Pongpat.

208
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,500
Kohn.

209
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,080
Pahtohn.

210
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,490
Thanawit.

211
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,660
Puhbodin.

212
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,870
Tupfa.

213
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,540
Tupfa.

214
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,490
You're here for the tryouts?

215
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,180
Yes.

216
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,160
Please go inside.

217
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,200
The game is now favoring
to Saint-Baylon.

218
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,660
Oh! Chayakorn stole the ball.

219
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,700
Torn.

220
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,870
But be careful.

221
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,290
They'll change their plan immediately
once they see the fast break.

222
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,940
In that case, we will use the duo plan.

223
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,490
Champ, the plan has changed.

224
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,230
Mm-hmm, smart boy.

225
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,160
Chayakorn's changed their strategy.

226
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,260
- Hey! What is that?
- What the heck?

227
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,100
Saint-Baylon's No.6 made a foul.

228
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,060
Now, the game got more intense.

229
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,200
Coach Tuan's still got
his national top coach reputation.

230
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,500
Can you still play?

231
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,120
Yes.

232
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,040
But Coach,

233
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,940
SBU is aggressive.

234
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,290
Yeah, I saw that.

235
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,450
Coach Tuan intentionally hurt us.

236
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,700
So let them all get fouls.

237
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,340
But they have plenty
of substitute players.

238
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,370
We only have Ice.

239
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,280
They intend to make us tired.

240
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,370
Coach.

241
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,700
I have a plan.

242
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,660
We're gonna use the same strategy.

243
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,830
If they want to foul,

244
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,790
we let them,
and score from penalty shots.

245
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,040
We can't, Torn.

246
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,660
You could get injured.

247
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,770
Coach.

248
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,580
If there's a better plan,

249
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,680
we're willing to do that.

250
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,340
But while you're trying to
come up with a better strategy,

251
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,840
let us use this plan.

252
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,900
It doesn't hurt that much, Coach.

253
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,160
We'll just sleep for a week
to make the pain go away.

254
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,620
But our victory,

255
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,750
it won't go away, Coach.

256
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,870
Can you do that?

257
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,000
Yes!

258
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,660
Hey, a foul!

259
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,240
Chayakorn scored one point
from the penalty shot.

260
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,460
- Foul!
- What?

261
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,290
Chayakorn scored one point.

262
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,950
Time-out, please.

263
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,580
Coach.

264
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Torn.

265
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,250
I'm sorry.

266
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,790
Coach.

267
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,750
Don't worry.

268
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,110
You're here helping us.

269
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,870
We are a small team,

270
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,290
yet you can make us go this far, Coach.

271
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,180
We can't thank you enough for that.

272
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,490
Don't blame yourself.

273
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,040
Ow!

274
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,200
Are you alright, Torn?

275
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,270
- Dunno, my leg feels stiff.
- What's wrong?

276
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:07,910
Sit.

277
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,490
But I'm okay.

278
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,820
I'm alright.

279
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,750
Tupfa.

280
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,500
Go inside, please.

281
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,860
Go, bro!

282
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,020
Just go. I want to see you win.

283
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,920
Go, bro, and get the gold medal.

284
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,270
What about you, Torn? You said we
were going to get a gold medal together.

285
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,740
I'll follow you anyway.

286
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,580
Practice and be better at
basketball, and then, follow me.

287
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,120
Okay, my duo?

288
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,450
Not only Chayakorn,

289
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,620
I'll follow you to the National Team.

290
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,870
I'm here now.

291
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:24,200
Let's take back
our stolen victory from him.

292
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,290
You're going for the tryouts?

293
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,330
It'll be okay since we're both here.

294
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,910
We're the basketball duo.

295
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,390
Oh, where are you going?

296
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,340
Let's go.

297
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,720
Let's play.

298
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,250
Is it the last quarter? Hurry up.

299
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,790
Are you done with your tryouts?

300
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,830
Hey!

301
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,900
Are you done?

302
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,250
Can I tell you later?

303
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,030
Lane four: Saint-Baylon University.

304
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,700
Lane six: Chayakorn University.

305
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,410
Lane eight: Prajim University.

306
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,330
One.

307
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,120
Two.

308
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,450
Three.

309
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,460
Stare for more than eight seconds.

310
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,540
- Four.
- You're a male version of Pan.

311
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,940
- Five.
- Just want my bro and my boy to get along.

312
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,900
- Six.
- You're already with my sister.

313
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,330
- Seven.
- Even when I'm with Pan,

314
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,300
- all I can think about is Vee.
- I might break up with Pan.

315
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,420
I want to see you all the time.

316
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,040
The only thing you have to
think about today is Dome.

317
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,480
Vee!

318
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,870
Vee!

319
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,490
Vee, are you okay?

320
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,250
What's wrong?

321
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,660
No, slow your breathing, Vee.

322
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,290
Slowly. It's okay. It's okay.

323
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,620
It's okay.

324
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,260
Tell me if someone speaks ill to you,
I'll go get them.

325
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,100
It's not your fault.

326
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,980
You didn't mean to.
Everyone makes mistakes.

327
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,290
It's okay.

328
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,370
Are you okay? Alright?

329
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,540
Are you alright?

330
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,790
Oh my god, Vee! Vee! Vee!

331
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,000
Vee!

332
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,910
Is there anybody out there?

333
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,180
Vee is hyperventilating! Please help!

334
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,200
Fam, get me a bag.

335
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,000
- Relax, Vee.
- Vee, calm down.

336
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,330
Breathe slowly, slowly.

337
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,040
- Thanks.
- Slow your breathing.

338
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,580
Vee, slow your breathing.

339
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,830
Slowly.

340
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,180
Vee.

341
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,540
Slow your breathing.

342
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,560
Slowly, slowly.

343
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,080
Slowly. Breathe slowly, Vee.

344
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,130
Relax.

345
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,580
Okay, just relax.

346
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,290
Vee.

347
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,580
That's good.

348
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,580
Just relax and breathe slowly.

349
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,540
- Relax, Vee.
- Slowly.

350
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,490
- Better?
- Vee, breathe slowly.

351
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,790
Easy, easy.

352
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,660
- What?
- Hey!

353
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,020
Vee!

354
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,620
It's okay, Vee.

355
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,180
Slow your breathing, Vee.

356
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,500
Vee.

357
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
Hey!

358
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,790
Vee.

359
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,700
- Just relax.
- Vee.

360
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,750
- Relax, Vee.
- Dome.

361
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,580
- Get out of here.
- Vee.

362
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,110
Relax, it's okay, it's okay.

363
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,240
- It's okay.
- Dome!

364
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,500
Didn't you hear me tell you
to get out of here?

365
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,500
Can you see him stressed?

366
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,260
- Breathe slowly.
- Just get out.

367
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,660
It's okay, Vee.

368
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,220
I'll tell you when he's getting better.

369
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,580
How is Vee?

370
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,750
He's stressed.

371
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,870
More people, more stress.

372
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,540
I'd better get out of there.

373
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,040
And you?

374
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,910
What's wrong?

375
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,520
Pan.

376
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,620
You and Dome...

377
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:56,660
If you knew that
you two were going to break up,

378
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,290
would you still date him?

379
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,240
Is that the nature of life?

380
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,200
You're afraid that you'll
end up parting from everyone.

381
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,960
So you don't get close to them?

382
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,100
Will you let that fear
keep you from your happiness?

383
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,330
I'm afraid that

384
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,000
we'll break up when I'm there.
I could get worse.

385
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,830
It's going to hurt, alright?

386
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,700
Let me ask you a question.

387
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,860
Right about now.

388
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:45,980
If you're not with him,
you're really gonna be happier?

389
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,620
You said you're afraid of being hurt.

390
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,500
But now, everyone is hurt.

391
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,820
Saen.

392
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,480
Gosh! Aren't you afraid?

393
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,000
One thing that I'm afraid of...

394
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,180
is you don't love me.

395
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,700
Seems like what I'm afraid of
is happening right now.

396
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,180
No, it's not like that.

397
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,880
- I just...
- It is.

398
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,580
It's just you love me or you don't.

399
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,260
Don't say you do but
you're afraid of getting hurt.

400
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,080
You know I feel bad hearing that?

401
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,450
So what do you say?

402
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,200
Saen.

403
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,640
Fine!

404
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,370
Let's try.

405
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,450
What do you want to try?

406
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,410
Well, that...

407
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,910
long-distance relationship.

408
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,120
Okay.

409
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,280
That's it.

410
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,910
May I congratulate the two athletes
who are in front of Gate Five?

411
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,290
May your love grow stronger
each and every passing year.

412
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,740
For better or worse...

413
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,540
Hold on.

414
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,620
Wait a minute.

415
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,450
Please.

416
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,790
Here.

417
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,030
My keychain.

418
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,290
I marked my territory.

419
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,500
Don't let anybody in.

420
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,490
Please put it on your bag.

421
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,810
I need to go. Coach calls me.

422
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,250
Thank you.

423
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,750
I'm very happy.

424
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,500
Wooh!

425
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,500
Now, it will be the training session
for Chayakorn University.

426
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,500
Please be on the field.

427
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,490
So you don't want to be on my team?

428
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,410
Coach.

429
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,580
I have to apologize.

430
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,940
I'm not elite as you saw me.

431
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,450
I'm not the same type as you.

432
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,700
And you've asked me
if I'm strong enough to fight my battle alone.

433
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,080
I can tell you...

434
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,840
I'm not.

435
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm too weak to fight alone.

436
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,750
I'm better thanks to the others.

437
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,410
I'm better thanks to my team.

438
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,500
I'm sorry, Coach.

439
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:30,950
This is my choice.

440
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,700
It's good that you understand that.

441
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,200
I needed you to choose

442
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,330
what path you'd take.

443
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,250
No matter what path,

444
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,410
you'd choose the best path
that is perfect for you.

445
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,870
I have no doubt that Coach Big
will make you two stronger.

446
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,500
It's just that I can't do that
with you two.

447
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,160
Let's fight in the game with our honor.

448
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,200
I'll show you.

449
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,410
Torn and I will win over your team.

450
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,610
Where have you been?
We're waiting for you.

451
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,900
- Go.
- Yes.

452
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,120
I'm here, Coach.

453
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,500
Switch a player.

454
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,800
- Go, go, go.
- Wooh!

455
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,700
Chayakorn has switched a player.

456
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,580
And Chyakorn has just scored.

457
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,500
Now the game
has turned in Chayakorn's favor.

458
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,580
They keep scoring but
it's nearly the end of the game.

459
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,620
Will they make it in time?

460
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,630
Another score for Chayakorn.
They're getting stronger.

461
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,750
Go for it!

462
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,000
Now only 10 seconds left.

463
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,250
Shoot!

464
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,540
Will he make a three-point shot?

465
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,750
If he scores this shot, they'll win.

466
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,620
Now, he shoots.

467
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,950
Oh!

468
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,540
Ouch!

469
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,450
He didn't make it.

470
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,830
Oh, the ref just called a foul.

471
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,700
Chayakorn got penalty shots
but only five seconds left.

472
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:50,000
Chayakorn has no choice
but to make those two shots,

473
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,490
and end in a tie.

474
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,540
- That's it!
- Yay!

475
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,850
One point now.

476
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:01,460
But I'm not sure they have enough
energy left for overtime.

477
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,410
They look exhausted.

478
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,160
Shoot.

479
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,120
When you always lean on the other,

480
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,460
don't think to carry the team.

481
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,660
Every penalty shot has its value.

482
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,060
Just one point can change
the outcome of the game.

483
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,370
Unless...

484
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,410
Unless what, Coach?

485
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,660
Unless we get a rebound
from that penalty shot.

486
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,360
We'll get two points instead of one.

487
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,200
So miss a shot by purpose?

488
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,200
Yes.

489
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,020
Aim for the rim of the hoop.

490
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,340
If you're being too focused,
they can see your trick.

491
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:17,040
This trick needs two players
who know each other well.

492
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,580
You need to read each other's
minds when to make a rebound.

493
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:26,000
The question is you two
have that level of trust.

494
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,270
I'm too weak to fight alone.

495
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,580
I'm better thanks to my team.

496
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,660
When you miss a shot,
I'll go get the ball.

497
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,830
When I miss a shot,
you'll go get the ball.

498
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,750
And when the other misses a shot,

499
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,830
we'll help them.

500
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,370
And that's two points, guys!

501
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,180
Chayakorn won!

502
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,050
I can't believe
that Chayakorn's made it!

503
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:04,450
Nobody expected to see
a rebound from a penalty shot.

504
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,490
- Wooh!
- Chayakorn stole the victory.

505
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,520
They're jumping for joy.

506
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,580
Everybody is happy
and I'm happy for them.

507
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,290
And this year's championship
belongs to the dark horse.

508
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:31,160
Chayakorn!

509
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,180
It's our turn now. Quick, quick, quick.

510
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,200
Ouch!

511
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,370
Bro.

512
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,410
Something's wrong with my leg.

513
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,330
I can't move my leg.

514
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:30,950
What do you say?

515
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,360
Who shares a room with whom?

516
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,910
Can we share a room
with another class year?

517
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:37,900
Thanks for being open-minded.

518
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,250
A long-distance relationship
might not be easy.

519
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,950
But I'll always be on standby.

520
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,040
Do you think I chose
Chayakorn just to play basketball?

521
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,830
Right person,

522
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:48,920
wrong time.

523
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,260
So it considers wrong, doesn't it?

524
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,180
Can we not give a dang about time?

525
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,080
It's not even halfway,

526
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,790
keep going with me.

527
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,750
I won't give up easily.
