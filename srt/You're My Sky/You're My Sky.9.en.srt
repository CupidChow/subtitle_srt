- It's okay.

my answer is "no".

19

I'm too weak to fight alone.

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,220
I can be good because of other people.

Hey. Have you got the key yet?

Nothing.

What are you thinking?

72
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,420
I'm thinking about Coach Big.
He talked exactly like you.

73
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,540
He insisted that I should just rest.

He's right.

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,270
You've just had surgery, Torn.
How can you get back to practice so early?

Please. It's only nine months.

Where are you going?

115
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,150
I can go anywhere without you, bro.

116
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,240
And don’t follow me.

119
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,380
I didn't come to talk about us.

120
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,660
Over is over. Don't worry.

121
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,150
Are you still angry at Vee
for dropping the baton?

122
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,460
I'm never angry at him.

123
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,510
So, why don't you talk to each other?

124
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,760
I saw you two at the lobby.

125
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,660
Honestly,

126
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,640
what's the problem?

127
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,660
Isn't it so bad that you can't tell me?

128
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,910
Vee becomes very quiet now.
I already asked him, but he refused to talk,

129
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,260
so I have to ask you instead.

130
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,740
And you still won't tell me?

131
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,460
What am I supposed to do?

132
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,730
I'll see what I can do.

133
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,260
Please help me.

134
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,020
After this, I won't ask you for anything else.

135
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,420
This way, you won't have to be involved
with your ex and feel awkward anymore.

136
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,050
Are you thinking about my friend, bro?

137
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,770
Yeah.

138
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,590
Are you thinking about my friend, too?

139
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,700
I am, bro.

140
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,130
I don't know what's wrong with Saen.

141
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,700
Today, he spoke with me only one sentence.

142
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,940
Well,

143
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,870
if you see him, you can try asking him.

144
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,420
What about yours?

145
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,550
Do you know about the club that called the
whole basketball team to audition, right?

146
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,040
I do.

147
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,470
Right!

148
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,990
Fa doesn't believe me that I'm really okay,

149
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,790
if the whole team will go to the audition.

150
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,420
I don't believe as well.

151
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,230
Do I have to not believe myself, too?

152
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,350
Well,

153
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,480
Saen, he desperately
insisted me on going to Japan.

154
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,700
He said he was okay. He can
survive a long distance relationship.

155
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,740
Do you think if I really go to Japan,

156
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,740
will he be lonely?

157
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,900
Because, now, he keeps saying he will be okay.

158
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,580
I might decide not to go to Japan.

159
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,150
Because I really don't know
if he's really okay.

160
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,420
Tell him what is in your mind,

161
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,020
so you guys can solve the problem together.

162
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,740
Does your "Okay" mean "Really okay"?

163
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,460
Not "Okay, give me a moment, I'll get better."

164
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,680
Fa won't feel easy at all.

165
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,670
Your goodwill makes others unable to go.

166
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,030
Can you go with me for a moment, bro?

167
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,980
Where are you taking me to?

168
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,980
Come on. I'll tell you later.

169
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,580
Where are you going?

170
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,590
Just a moment.

171
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,740
What are you doing, Saen?

172
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,080
Just give me your time for
only one stick of sparkler.

173
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,630
What?

174
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,550
Please watch the fireworks with me.

175
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,720
These many months,

176
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,800
I'm glad that I could get to know you better.

177
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,100
Thank you so much for opening your mind to me.

178
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,110
Long distance relationship might
not be easy. But I'm on standby.

179
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,200
You can call me, whenever.

180
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,940
I may not be good at giving advice,
but I can be a good listener for you.

181
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,500
Whether you wake up early,
or before you go to bed,

182
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,770
when you're tired,
or argue with classmates,

183
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,190
or you just want to complain
"Why is Japanese so hard?".

184
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,040
You can call me.
I will listen to everything you will say.

185
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:00,980
The sparkler is almost gone.

186
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,010
What I'm going to say is…

187
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,220
This sucks.

188
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,990
I need a little more time.

Don't leave me to anyone else.

Are you shy?

209
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,340
Pete. Walk carefully, you're heavy.

210
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,580
Dome, my best friend.

211
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,920
I'm sad.

212
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,800
We shouldn't have lost.

213
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,200
I really have no idea how
could we miss it. It was almost there.

214
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,440
We've been patiently practicing all year.

215
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,360
You know how tired we were.

216
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,360
Why did the baton have to fall?

217
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,850
Nobody wants to miss it.

218
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,820
It's because you and Vee quarreled.

219
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,820
Who said that team relationships
are the most important?

220
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,180
I was all my fault.

221
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:31,500
At first, I thought that if I could
get close to him quickly,

222
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,500
it would be good.

223
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,220
Dang it!

224
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,780
Honestly,

225
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,910
I thought if I could get to know him sooner,

226
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,600
I would be very happy.

227
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,650
Or if we have never known each other at all,

228
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,110
I wouldn't have to regret every day

229
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,100
that in this world

230
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,780
there is one person that I freaking like,

231
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,780
but can't have.

232
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,300
- Here they come.
- Yes!

233
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,270
- Take it.
- Great.

234
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,140
- Wooh!
- Give me one.

235
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,300
You're so mean.

236
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,980
Aww, Torn. I'm sorry.

237
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,460
- Aww. Torn.
- Aww.

238
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,310
- Aww. Torn.
- Don't be angry.

239
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,740
Want one?

240
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,740
Not finished yet.

241
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,680
So,

242
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,330
who will go to the audition?

243
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,980
Well, almost the whole team except Fluke.

244
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,770
Umm…

245
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,080
Well, I don't want to play professionally.

246
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:34,940
I applied for it in the first place
because I missed basketball.

247
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,130
Honestly,

248
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,130
I am who I am.

249
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,580
Because it would make other basketball
players at school quite uncomfortable,

250
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,640
so I faded out.

251
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,990
But when Coach Big announced
to recruit players to join his team

252
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,140
and no gender limit.

253
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,530
I was so freaking happy.

254
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,470
So, I tried to apply.

255
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,610
Woah! Is this just a try?
You've got a gold medal.

256
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,700
Torn. May I go for audition, too?

257
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,700
I haven't graduated for seven years.

258
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,490
This is the most promising thing in my life.

259
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,750
Hey, everyone. To be honest,

260
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,260
if anyone wants to go for audition,
you can go. I'm really okay,

261
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,680
and you don't even have to
ask for my permission.

262
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,420
I'm more than happy that we've come this far.

263
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,660
Right?

264
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,950
So stop talking behind my back.

265
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,180
And that secret chat group,

266
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,700
please close it, too.

267
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,050
Okay. It's me.

268
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,050
Boo!

269
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,280
Bro, you’re so busted!

270
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,760
Come on!

271
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,340
Let's forget about it.

272
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,370
We'd better drink, come on.

273
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,380
- Come on!
- Come on!

274
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,800
- Cheers!
- Snack please?

275
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,380
Cheers!

276
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,380
Come on. Come on.

277
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,780
Let's take a walk.

278
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,660
In fact, our promise has already come true.

279
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,660
We've stood and received
gold medals next to each other.

280
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,480
Only just we haven't stood
on the podium and taken a picture.

281
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,190
Yeah.

282
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,500
It was so freaking chaotic on that day.

283
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,680
Everyone would like to go to the hospital.

284
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,780
Let's take a picture with the gold medal
when we go back, shall we?

285
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,580
Umm.

286
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,340
I'm not sad.

287
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,590
I'm afraid.

288
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,460
When the tendon was damaged,
it made me think a lot, bro.

289
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:51,780
A life of an athlete. Anyone knows that
their age limit is only at 35 years old.

290
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,700
Ten months that they lost,

291
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,100
it made a big change
in a basketball player's life.

292
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:08,020
Moreover, knowing that
the other teammates are going to audition,

293
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,380
I'm afraid the opportunity like this
won't come to me again.

294
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,450
When I said that the opportunity for
athletes doesn't come easily.

295
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,900
I really meant that.

296
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,850
Please go for audition.

297
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,460
It reminds me of when we were at
the national youth team camp.

298
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,530
When we talked about
what will we be when we grow up.

299
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,560
We will be in the national team...

300
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,480
Then be coaches.

301
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,680
Then open a school.

302
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,460
- If we have enough money.
- If we have enough money.

303
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,900
We're not even halfway there yet.

304
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,350
Let's go together first.

305
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,070
Yeah.

306
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,980
I won't give up that easily.

If we could go back to when
the first semester started,

318
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,960
then someone said that we're going to
sleep together in this bed like this.

319
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,720
It might give us goosebumps.

320
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,820
Didn't it?

321
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,210
Since when?

322
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,360
High school?

323
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,390
Is that true?

324
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,860
When?

325
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,980
Do you think that I came to Chayakorn
because I just wanted to play basketball?

326
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,470
Yes.

327
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,500
Sorry to keep you waiting.

328
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,340
Here,

329
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,700
your reward.

330
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,250
My condo key card.

331
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,550
Actually, I've been
thinking about it for a while.

332
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,780
Since your surgery,

333
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,920
I thought if someone was here
with me, it would be great.

334
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,520
You can come by,

335
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,080
or you can bring your
clothes and leave them here.

336
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,620
You've helped me for many times.

337
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,420
Please let me take care of you.

338
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,730
Okay?

339
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,600
Why?

340
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:22,990
Nothing.

341
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,420
Just...

342
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,020
It's just like a dream.

343
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,360
No. Not the same.

344
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,880
But after this,

345
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,070
probably yes.

wrong time.

It must be considered to be wrong, right?

360
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,820
But if that person is so right.

361
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,260
Just don't care about the time.

367
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,100
What's up? Are you excited?

368
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,100
Yeah.

369
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,900
I couldn't sleep last night.

370
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,060
You can do it.

371
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,440
Just think, you go there to play.

372
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,000
And check your name in the club.

373
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,310
Okay.

374
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,500
And how are you?
Have you finished packing yet?

375
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,500
Almost done.

376
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,660
See you at your condo this evening.

377
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,060
Okay.

378
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,670
Bro.

379
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,310
Huh?

380
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:02,680
I love you.

381
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,140
I love you, too.

382
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,990
I'll continue packing stuffs.

383
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,270
Bye.

384
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:22,840
You can do this!

385
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,180
Alright!

386
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,810
Huh? Fa!

387
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,300
Wow!

388
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,920
- I haven't seen you for ages!
- Yeah.

389
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,120
- Did you come to audition as well?
- Yeah.

390
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,120
No one has come yet.

391
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,120
Yep.

392
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,380
How are you, bro?

393
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,480
Oh, I freaking miss you.

394
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,940
Fa. Today you will play with Chain.

395
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,100
I miss you, too.

396
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,920
Hey! What are you doing?

397
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,060
Alright, let's go in there.

398
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,860
- Let's go.
- Okay.

399
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:04,540
Does the club train you too hard?

400
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:08,860
The coach will announce the selected
12 players soon. Especially if I am a new kid,

401
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,100
I must be the first one to come practice
and the last one to go back home.

402
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,620
If you aren't comfortable
that I and Fa train together.

403
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,820
Don't you want to see Fa getting better?

404
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,820
Nobody will forget that I and my sister
share the same boyfriend.

405
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,180
I'll wait until you tell me to stop.

406
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,260
I'm not going to Japan anymore.

407
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,780
It's possible, bro,

408
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,940
that long distance relationship.

409
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,900
You can do it, but I don't know
whether I can do it or not.
