(Viewer discretion is required.)

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,700
You want me to go left or right?

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,200
Whichever way you want,
but the point is not letting me know.

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,700
Playing with you...

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,660
is the best.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,660
Fa...

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,580
What would you do if you
verbally hurt someone by accident?

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,580
Can I sign sitting next to you?

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,580
Saen.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,410
Are you serious?

19
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,370
Why do you think I'm just joking around?

20
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,620
I'm dead serious when I say I like you.

(Yeak David Park)

32
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,450
Do you run here too?

33
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,990
Did you already do your run?

34
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,000
Just for a bit.

35
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,750
Can you wait for me?
So we can run together.

36
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,830
Do you want my help?

37
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,810
Wanna go?

38
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,990
Here.

39
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,620
Thanks.

40
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,410
Why do you often get leg cramps?

41
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,760
Did you do enough stretches?

42
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,620
I did my stretch routine.

43
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,540
Want me to check it?

44
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,950
Are you sure you had straightened it?

45
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,580
So tense.

46
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,660
Dome.

47
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:09,990
Oh, hi.

48
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,540
Why are you here?

49
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,330
He got cramps at the park while running.

50
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,290
And I happened to be there,
so I brought him here to check.

51
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,290
- Cramps again?
- Uh-huh.

52
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,840
And will you be able to enter the match?

53
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,940
I will. Easy.

54
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,250
What are you reading?

55
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,210
How many tests do you have?

56
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,840
Have you eaten?

57
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,090
Torn.

58
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,060
(Give this to the freshman Torn.)

59
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,500
Saen is so cool, isn't he?

60
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,830
He plays in a famous soccer club.
He's good-looking and born rich.

61
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,450
Anyone would be lucky to have him.

62
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,620
Don't you think?

63
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,660
Don't say that.

64
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,410
I'm stressing out.

65
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,620
What is it about?

66
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,450
During the Cheer-Book Signing Veek,

67
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,290
he said that he was serious
when making a move on me.

68
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,620
And how are you feeling?

69
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,500
Do you like him?

70
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,830
You're taking too long.

71
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,790
I think you do.

72
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,870
Hold on.

73
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,940
I'm processing it.

74
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,540
How do you behave when you like someone?

75
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,700
You'll miss that person, wanna be with
him, hug him and pet his head.

76
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,660
You won't be yourself.

77
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,450
You'll want the best for him.

78
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,380
The easiest explanation is

79
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,520
you want to keep the thing that
happened between you and him.

80
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,000
Are you sure?

81
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,490
Is that just an okay feeling?

82
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,880
And you do some with Torn.

83
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,870
Does that mean you like Torn?

84
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,080
When did I do that with him?

85
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,520
You've been with him on
the basketball court from dusk to dawn.

86
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,200
Doesn't that count as "wanna be with"?

87
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,660
Are you insane?

88
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,270
I've been practicing.

89
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,400
And that drinking yogurt.

90
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,400
Have you ever thought to buy me one?

91
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,950
I just happened to buy an extra.

92
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,750
I'd give it to you if you asked.

93
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,500
And your last example,

94
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,250
let's say you will never
see him again from tomorrow,

95
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,830
how would you feel?

96
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,750
See?

97
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,500
You're also taking too long.

98
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,540
Nonsense.

99
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,000
Your theory is wrong.

100
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,160
Aai.

101
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,540
Pass me the drink, please.

102
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,980
Don't be ridiculous. It's mine.

103
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,250
It's refreshing, isn't it, Saen?

104
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,500
Even I who just looked at it
feel refreshed.

105
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,000
Aai.

106
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,330
I have a favor to ask.

107
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,080
Can you tutor me
in Professor Wiroj's class?

108
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,330
I've studied all night
but didn't get it.

109
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,040
You're top of the class.

110
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,580
I'll understand better if you help me.

111
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,330
Please.

112
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,450
Why do I have to help you?

113
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,910
Because of my cuteness.

114
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,200
No.

115
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,290
Saen, if you need a study group,
Dao and Deon are studying this subject.

116
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Do you know Dao and Deon?

117
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,080
The twins
who are freshmen king and queen.

118
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,220
I'll send you their contact
if you'd like.

119
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,450
Because you're busy studying, right, Aai?

120
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,660
Uh...

121
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
right.

122
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,910
I gotta go.

123
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,250
I have an exhibition game this evening.

124
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,120
Okay.

125
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,750
You gotta go too.

126
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,790
Oh!

127
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,440
What's wrong?

128
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,790
Hmm.

129
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,160
How is it?

130
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,830
It wakes you up?

131
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,080
Yeah.

132
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,080
Wide awake.

133
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,410
Yeah, I always eat that while studying.

134
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,410
It keeps me up.

135
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,040
Hmm.

136
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,480
There's an exhibition game today.
Don't be late.

137
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,330
(Coach Big's kids)

138
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,580
Who don't have any more exams,
you can join me in our club.

139
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,040
And who still do, good luck.

140
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,500
What?

141
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,750
Where are you going?

142
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,250
I can't concentrate
when studying with others.

143
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,250
I'll be studying alone.

144
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,080
I'm off.

145
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,120
- See you.
- See you.

146
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,160
(Be always blooming)

147
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,700
Don't you have an exam?

148
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,250
Not soon.

149
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,330
I can't concentrate there.

150
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,370
It's quieter here.

151
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,660
You can do that up here.

152
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,580
Which class?

153
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,290
Anatomy.

154
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,380
Are you free to teach me?

155
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,250
Of course.

156
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,040
Good thing that you mentioned that.

157
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,330
My notes on Anatomy.

158
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,990
I've usually copied that for others.

159
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,120
But I think I won't do that
this year. You can have it.

160
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,950
How do you behave when you like someone?

161
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,200
You'll want the best for them.

162
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,700
What's wrong?

163
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,250
Has someone called dibs on it?

164
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,400
No, take it.

165
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,860
Anyone could have it, I don't care.

166
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,990
I'm not done working.

167
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,460
Gotta go.

168
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,580
I'm here to refill my bottle.

169
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,500
And you?

170
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,930
How is your group study?

171
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,420
Not in the slightest progress.

172
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,040
They've been glued to their phone.

173
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,610
I should have studied alone.

174
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,660
Oh.

175
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,450
The notes of which I missed one chapter.

176
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,330
Can I photocopy yours?

177
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,030
The others' are hard to understand.

178
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,450
Sure.

179
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,030
I left them outside.
You can come and get them.

180
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,000
Well...

181
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,830
I'll tell Dao and Deon that
you'll be tutoring me.

182
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,080
So I can ditch them.

183
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,080
- Can you wait here?
- Okay.

184
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,240
You gotta help me.

185
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,880
You sure have elastic skin.

186
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,940
I understand it contains collagen.

187
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,580
Why do you have Japanese in your notes?

188
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,180
Oh, I applied for a master's
scholarship in Japan.

189
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,160
I wrote down some info
about the city I wish to go to.

190
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,820
But I don't know if I'll get it.

191
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,980
There're a lot of applicants.

192
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,330
Come on.

193
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,700
You're soon-to-be
top of the class dean's list.

194
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,610
Nobody gets that scholarship but you.

195
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,370
I hope so.

196
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,860
I've been working hard
for that scholarship.

197
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,510
What do you want to do
when you're in Japan?

198
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,160
I want to go to the Hanabi festival.

199
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,120
I'd love to see fireworks there.

200
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,400
You're romantic.

201
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,000
I'd love to go with you
and see fireworks with you.

202
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,730
May I?

203
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,500
Break is over.

204
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,370
Back to studying.

205
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,920
(Aai's property)

206
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,670
(Aai's property)

207
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:27,640
(Aai's property)

208
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,200
(Be always blooming)

209
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,780
What's wrong with you?

210
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,200
You lost your focus.

211
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,290
Especially, Fa and Torn.

212
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,870
You've failed at teamwork.

213
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,830
Sorry, sir.

214
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,410
Coach...

215
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,330
Hi, Big.

216
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,000
Sorry that I came unannounced.

217
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,700
It's urgent.

218
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,410
And...

219
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,450
this is Mr. Pahwat

220
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,290
and scouts from the Flying Dragon club.

221
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,000
They are a new basketball club.

222
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,900
Have you heard of them?

223
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,250
Yes.

224
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,410
I've heard that they are a big spender
and recruit only young blood.

225
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,290
Having big money but lack of talents,

226
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,700
what can you complete with others?

227
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,990
I noticed that some from
Chaiyakorn Team are good enough.

228
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,990
So I'd like to see their skill.

229
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:04,800
Do you mind if we stay and
watch your exhibition game, Coach Big?

230
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,620
Not at all. Please sit.

231
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,620
Alright, everyone.

232
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,200
Listen to me.

233
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,580
We need to be more in harmony.

234
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,290
Focus.

235
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,450
Okay?

236
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,460
- Yes.
- Okay.

237
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,510
Shout for the ball once you
escape a trap defense. Okay?

238
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,370
Yes, coach.

239
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,450
Win this game.

240
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,990
Let's go! Go!

241
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,540
Bro,

242
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,370
I understand that
you and Torn fit together.

243
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,620
But the club's scouts will be watching.

244
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,700
Could you pass the ball to others?

245
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,080
We've worked hard too.

246
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,410
We also need to be in the spotlight.

247
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,450
Here!

248
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,870
Fa!

249
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,620
Could you pass the ball to others?

250
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,320
We also need to be in the spotlight.

251
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,390
- Bro!
- Fa!

252
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,860
Straight to the game, huh?

253
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,620
Oh, it's you.

254
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,740
Yeah, it's so fast.

255
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,440
I enjoy playing games with this.

256
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,100
It got me hooked.

257
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,840
So, did the exams go alright?

258
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,160
Well,

259
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,160
I did better than I expected.

260
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,220
Luckily, I had a cute tutor,
so I could focus on my study.

261
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,140
Happy to help.

262
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,790
Oh, yeah, about the community
member interviews this weekend.

263
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,700
Let me look for a community.

264
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,100
Okay, let's assign roles,
I'll write a questionnaire.

265
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,770
Professor Wiroj is calling me.

266
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,660
Answer the phone. In case there's
something wrong with the exam.

267
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,990
Hi, sir.

268
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,950
Aai...

269
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,660
They've announced
the scholarship winner.

270
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,750
You've fulfilled your dream.

271
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,580
Bro,

272
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,370
we need to stop.

273
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,490
Let us be as before.

274
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,080
You're already with my sister.

275
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,790
Will you break up with her?

276
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,620
If you won't,

277
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,330
we need to be as before.

278
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,330
Deal?

279
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:11,760
Mhm.

280
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,700
Deal.

281
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,540
How are you?

282
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,120
Tired?

283
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,680
Champ.

284
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,060
Huh?

285
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,290
- Did you ride here today?
- I did.

286
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,700
Can you drop me off at the building?

287
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,620
Oh? You usually go with...

288
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,830
Feel like riding a bike today.

289
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
Oh, okay. I can drop you off.

290
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,180
Now?

291
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,620
- Yeah.
- Okay.

292
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,980
- See you.
- See you.

293
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:57,870
Hey.

294
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,830
I'm sorry.

295
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,040
I shouldn't have asked you that.

296
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,870
Hey,

297
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,910
it wasn't your fault, Fluke.

298
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,040
I just realized that I had been
passing the ball to no one.

299
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,200
Don't worry.

300
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,090
And...

301
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,250
about Torn,

302
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,080
are you gonna win him back?

303
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,480
I think I am.

304
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,240
Why the smile?

305
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,910
So embarrassed.

306
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,500
Let's be honest.

307
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,750
Well...

308
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,330
you and Torn,

309
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,370
is there something special
between you two?

310
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,700
What?

311
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,990
No! There's nothing special.

312
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,800
Seriously?

313
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,330
Seriously.

314
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,000
To tell you the truth,

315
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,110
you and Torn look so adorable
when you're together.

316
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,830
Think about it.

317
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,600
Do you realize
that you care about him a lot?

318
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:35,040
You're not going to win him back
if you don't, am I right?

319
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,330
I can't find a cooling compress ball.

320
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,080
Use this instead.

321
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,370
And drink it.

322
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,040
You've studied hard.
I don't want you to get sick.

323
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,200
Close your eyes.

324
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,410
It's hard to memorize things if you
keep looking at the book.

325
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,200
Draw a picture,

326
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,910
or look at the real thing.

327
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,520
The frontalis muscle

328
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,000
is a muscle that's used
for lifting your eyebrows.

329
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,870
The corrugator muscle,

330
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,620
for frowning.

331
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,410
The zygomaticus major muscle,

332
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,790
for smiling.

333
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,620
Here.

334
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,750
I've drawn some for you.

335
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,870
You can use that.

336
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,950
If you're gonna be mean,

337
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,620
be the meanest.

338
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,510
So, what's going on?

339
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,520
I saw that the coach asked to see you.

340
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,040
Scouts from the club

341
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,240
told me to try out for the team.

342
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,660
Really?

343
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,950
Mhm.

344
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm going after
the confederation's championship.

345
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,500
I'm happy for you.

346
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,000
You made it.

347
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,410
Not yet.

348
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,290
I need some training before the tryout.

349
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,160
About that, are you free this Saturday?

350
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,500
Help me train.

351
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,660
I have to visit my uncle this Saturday.

352
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,760
But I can blow that off.

353
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,410
I'll help you with the training.

354
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,230
Don't, or your uncle will be waiting.

355
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,330
I have an idea.

356
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,800
We can use that court near your house.

357
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,750
Yeah.

358
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,980
So meet me on the court this Saturday.

359
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,200
You do some with Torn.

360
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,330
Does that mean you like Torn?

361
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:37,550
And what was wrong with you today?
You were acting weird.

362
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,080
Sorry.

363
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,750
I had something to think about.

364
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,500
Can you tell me what it was?

365
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,330
You wouldn't want to know.

366
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,790
See?

367
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,830
It makes me even more curious.

368
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:56,450
What was it?

369
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,160
Tell me.

370
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,580
Please tell me.

371
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,790
Please.

372
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,620
Please.

373
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:07,180
What was it? Tell me, please.

374
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,870
I'd love to know.

375
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,750
Please.

376
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,250
Okay.

377
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,950
You'll wanna hug him
and pet his head.

378
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,410
You won't be yourself.

379
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,410
You'll want the best for him.

380
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,370
The easiest explanation is

381
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:42,250
you want to keep the thing that
happened between you and him.

382
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,040
Playing with you...

383
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,950
is the best.

384
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,860
Better if you don't know.

385
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:32,620
If you're going to be this worried,
you should haven't brought her.

386
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:34,660
Where do you take me?

387
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,040
It's a homestay,

388
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,280
the home which is a house.

389
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,250
My grandma's house.

390
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,290
Even when I'm with Pan,

391
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,990
all I can think about is Vee.

392
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,370
Where is Saen going to sleep?

393
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,410
In your room.

394
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,450
Do you still want to be with me?

395
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,120
How do you really feel about me?

396
