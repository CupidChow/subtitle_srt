(The series was adapted from 'You're My Sky')

20
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,660
Did you say it was gonna be nothing?

21
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,120
And what is this?

22
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,830
Do you wanna know? I'll ask them.

23
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,040
Easy, you fool.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,500
This is called "Warm Up".

25
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,700
It's kinda like freshmen orientation.

26
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,660
By the way, I'm Vee,

27
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,830
Track and field.

28
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,700
I'm Torn, a basketball player.

29
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,370
This is Saen, a soccer player.

30
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,200
We were in the same high school.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,370
And the Warm Up you're talking about.

32
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,160
What do we have to do?

33
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,500
Have you ever
participated in an orientation?

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,120
Yeah.

35
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,540
So, it's just like that.

36
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,700
Except our faculty is so energetic.

37

These seniors,

are the people who will be
at your side for a whole year.

First senior,

114
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,790
Pete, responsible for your well-being.

115
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,620
And the next senior,

116
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,040
Dome,

117
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,000
responsible for sports activities.

118
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,370

Aai, responsible for academic activities.

00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,500
And we save the best for the last.

122
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,330
The boss of our Student Association.

123
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,370
He sits on the president's chair.

124
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,870
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

125
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,790

- is...

127
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,950
Tupfa.

128
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,580
Well, well, well.

129
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,990
Let them introduce themselves.

130
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,160
Please come right here.

131
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,700
Come here please.

132
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,950
Come here.

133
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,600
(Ten years ago)

134
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,160
Yeah, I did lock the door.

135
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,830
Torn has never gone outside.

136
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,160
He always loses.

137
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,080
That's why none of the kids invite him.

138
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,500
I know, I gotta go.

139
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,990
Hey, kid.

140
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,700
Why you're being locked in?

141
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,370
My uncle went to work,
and he's afraid I might get hit by a car.

142
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,580
A kid next door just got hit by a car.

143
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,910
And how do you go play outside with friends?

144
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,990
Normally...

145
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,420
No one invites me.

146
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,990
Do you wanna get out?

147
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,350
Is that a thing? Feel like I'm in a movie.

148
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,510
Maybe next time.

149
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,540
It's okay, bro.

150
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,000
Even I can go outside,
I can't play anything with you.

151
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,950
Because I have no skill.

152
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,990
There's something.

153
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,620
A thing that you don't need to be good at
but can enjoy.

154
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,520
Torn.

155
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,330
Wow.

156
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,200
Fa, you must be good at...

157
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,140
What is it called again?

158
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,260
Basketball.

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,120
Basketball.

160
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,910
I don't want to brag.

161
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,660
But the teacher said that with my skill,
I can play in the high school league.

162
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,540
I'll prove that to you.

163
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,250
This is called lay-up.

164
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,750
But there's another thing.

165
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,540
The rebound.

166
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,830
That move is hard to do.

167
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,250
Do you know it, Torn?

168
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,750
Rebound is...

169
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,540
When a player misses a shot,

170
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,990
his teammate will get the ball
and make that shot count.

171
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,920
It needs two people to demonstrate.

172
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,250
Nice, you're so skillful.

173
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,520
I don't even know what I like.

174
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,990
It's alright.

175
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,440
Don't need to be rush to find out.

176
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
(It's challenging.)

177
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,000
(Because there's a lot of newcomers.)

178
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,290
(We need to restart everything.)

179
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,330
That's Coach Tuan.

180
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,370
(I'm trying to improve their
physical fitness in every aspect.)

181
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,620
(But when the time goes by,)

182
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,450
(I can see that this team
needs to focus on speed and shooting.)

183
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,870
(I see other teams this year.
They have large bodies.)

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,410
(But we can go against them.)

185
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Coach Tuan.

186
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,870
He's a famous basketball coach.

187
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,450
He has made National Junior Team
win aboard many times.

188
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,250
I'd love to be in his team.

189
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,080
But I need to be better.

190
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,910
How much better you need to be?

191
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,450
I need to be top 12 in the country.

192
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,200
Top in the country?

193
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,620
(Thank you for all your support.)

194
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:58,250
(I hope this gold medal put a smile
on Thai people's face again.)

195
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,120
In my first game,

196
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,830
I failed so hard.

197
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,000
So, my dad took me to a place like this one,

198
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,990
told me to close my eyes,

199
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,410
and take a deep breath.

200
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,410
I really felt better.

201
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,200
Try it.

202
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,000
Torn.

203
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,700
Shoot.

204
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,330
Just shoot.

205
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,990
Don't be afraid.

206
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,950
Did you just do...

207
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,750
- a rebound.
- a rebound.

208
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,040
Yay, I did it.

209
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,370
I finally did it.

210
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,370
And I made a shot.

211
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,540
I did it.

212
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,540
Yay!

213
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,700
See?

214
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,000
Torn.

215
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,950
A sport at which you don't need to be the best.

216
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,410
When you miss a shot,

217
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,370
your friends will be there.

218
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,950
This...

219
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,990
is basketball.

220
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,500
We had so much fun today.

221
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,990
It's a medal ceremony.

222
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,290
In TV, athletes stand on the podium,
raise their hands and bow their heads.

223
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,120
Then, someone below places a medal around their neck.

224
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Can you place a medal around my neck?

225
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,700
That is so cool! Can I get a medal too?

226
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,080
Of course, we're in the same team,
get the same medal.

227
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,160
I think you have a knack for basketball.

228
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,290
Earlier, we were like the basketball duo.

229
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,040
Bro,

230
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,370
the other day, I asked my uncle
if I can play basketball.

231
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,410
But he said it's a waste of time.

232
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,870
This...

233
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,990
It's for you.

234
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,990
Practice and be better at basketball.

235
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,750
Then, follow me,

236
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,830
at Taweemitre-Wittayalai School.

237
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,830
There's a basketball scholarship.

238
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,950
We will play together again.

239
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Okay, my duo?

240
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,120
We will be school champions,

241
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,750
university champions.

242
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,990
Promise?

243
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,000
Be the national champions!

244
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,080
Oh!

245
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,870
Awkward.

246
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,870
You don't play along.

247
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,790
Do you like it?

248
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,660
Do you like it, kids?

249
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,160
You like it, don't you?

250
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,330
If you like it,

251
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,910
let's move to our next activity.

252
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,500
And our next activity is...

253
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,950
- is...
- is...

254
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,290
Paddle Dance!

255
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,790
You know what I want to know?

256
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,330
Crush Paddle Dance.

257
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,290
I want to know if some freshmen
have a crush on our seniors.

258
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,540
Don't waste any time.

259
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,750
Let's start our first dance.

260
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,200
- Ready?
- How?

261
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,160
Start!

262
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,500
♪Let's paddle a boat♪

263
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,910

266
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,910
But when we're paddling, an orange rolled over...

267
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,580
rolled over…

268
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,160
over here!

269
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,910
Freshman who has a crush on senior...

270
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,620
- please paddle!
- Stand up! It's you, isn't it?

271
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,450
No, I can't do it.

272
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,950
You can't leave a mark by being ordinary.

273
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,840
Sorry, I'm not ordinary.

278
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,580
Fearless!

279
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,000
You're fearless!

280
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,580
Wait! I'm gonna interview him.

281
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,370
The public need to know.

282
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,910
I don't mean to pry.

283
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,410
But I need to know.

284
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,040
Whom do you have a crush on?

285
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,750
Whoa, he's being silent.

286
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,670
It's okay.

287
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,290
We can keep guessing.

288
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,160
He's a freshman.

289
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,160
So, it must be...

290
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,250
Second-year?

291
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,910
Right?

292
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:07,870
Right?

293
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
It isn't.

294
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,410
Not you! Fly away!

295
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,660
So, we're going to...

296
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,790
Third-year?

297
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,410
Right?

298
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,700
It isn't!

299
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,000
Neither you!

300
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,330
Fly away!

301
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,370
Last guess, right?

302
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,700
Fourth-year?

303
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,680
He's looking at Student Association.

304
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,140
Who is it?

305
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,330
Oh, my god!

306
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,040
Is it Aai?

307
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,720
(Fourth-year love freshmen)

308
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,910
This is what we call twisted blushing.

309
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,620
I'm twisted, you see?

310
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,540
Let me untwist.

311
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,120
Untwisted!

312
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,290
Okay, okay.

313
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,620
It's none of our business.

314
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,660
Don't violate his privacy. You know?

315
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,500
Thank you very much, darling.

316
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,950
Please give him a round of applause.

317
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,700
I liked that!

318
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,520
Bold!

319
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,700
The next Paddle dance...

320
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,040
is the Paddle of pride.

321
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,460

322

Right!

323
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,660
For that reason,

324
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,700

325
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,910

Right!

328
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,040
Okay.

329
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120

♪Still waters run deep,
think of the paddler♪

341
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,580
(National Junior Team first selection)

342
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,210
Satit Sueksa School.

343
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,450
Sirisuk School.

344
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,210
Taweemitre-Wittayalai School.

345
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,660
The National Junior Team camp, this year,

346
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,660
we're going to have two rounds of selection.

347
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,000
After a month of practicing,

348
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,830
we're going to announce

349
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,990
the 12 main players.

350
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,000
Your coach is me, Coach Big...

351
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,290
What are you talking about?

352
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Coach Big is speaking.

353
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,330
Why don't you listen?

354
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,300
You two, run two laps.

355
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,450
Yes, Coach.

356
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,800
And the rest, don't look at them.

357
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,990
If you're here to have fun,

358
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,000
go home now.

359
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,080
If you want to join my team,

360
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,000
you have to be the first to wake up,

361
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,910
be the last who finishes practicing.

362
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,660
You have to work harder than others,

363
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,660
so that you'll go further than others.

364
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,410
Do you understand?

365
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,870
Yes, sir.

366
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,870
How are you going further
when you weakly said like this?

367
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,470
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

368
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,080
The plan is to practice a lot
and seem to be more determined than others.

369
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,980
When Coach Tuan sees us,
he'll think that we are freaking good.

370
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,830
Five o'clock in the morning?

371
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,330
Do you think Coach's already up?

372
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,660
Only maid sees us.

373
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,080
Come on, let's warm up.

374
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,290
Don't forget.

375
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,910
Freaking good.

376
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,250
Are you alright, Chet?

377
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,300
Are you bleeding?

378
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,240
Is the game over?

379
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,120
Why don't you keep playing?

380
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,410
When you're in the court,

381
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,080
just focus on you and your team.

382
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,410
If you're still not doing your best,

383
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,370
don't help others, you just waste their time.

384
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Go back and finish your game.

385
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,450
Yes, Coach.

386
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:22,940
You're okay?

387
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,980
Ah! Blue team, come here.

388
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,320
Come on.

389
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,750
Are you here to win or to make friends?

390
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,080
You played like old people.

391
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,120
Afraid of being hurt?

392
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,830
He was coming too strong, Coach.

393
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,200
I thought I let him shoot.

394
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,330
And I could score the next round.

395
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,950
Don't think that way.

396
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,620
Fa.

397
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,250
That play, if you had struck him harder,

398
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,000
you could have stolen the ball.

399
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,200
And what about the rest?

400
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,830
What were you doing?

401
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,870
Why didn't you help him get the ball?

402
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,580
If you see that formation again,
wait under the hoop,

403
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,620
try to pass the ball
to your teammate for a rebound.

404
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,080
Got it?

405
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,080
Yes, sir.

406
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,040
Remember,

407
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,750
don't be afraid to hurt the other.

408
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,160
Now, they are not your friends.

409
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,250
This is a competition.

410
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,450
Understand?

411
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,120
Yes, sir.

412
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,540
Back to the court and be better.

413
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,080
Go.

414
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,580
Hey, kids.

415
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,750
Where have they gone?

416
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,290
Man!

417
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,790
Where have those two gone? Get down.

418
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,080
He comes this way.

419
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,540
He's gone.

420
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,290
He's gone.

421
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,790
Are you disappointed?

422
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,000
That Coach Tuan's not who you thought he was.

423
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,200
Nope.

424
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,660
He just might be straightforward.

425
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,950
Uh-huh.

426
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,250
The camp will be over in a few days.

427
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,620
What we will be after this?

428
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,080
Well, National Junior Basketball players.

429
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,660
At least, you will be, for sure.

430
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,620
Play with me.

431
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,330
Sure.

432
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,580
In the National Team.

433
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,000
Then, we'll be coaches.

434
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,660
And we'll open a school.

435
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,200
Whatever you want.

436
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,330
I think so.

437
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,580
So...

438
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,370
we'll see.

439
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,450
Then we'll have enough money.

440
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,700
You always read my mind.

441
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,830
Bummer.

442
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,750
Torn.

443
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,330
Give me two shots of free throw,

444
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,990
then you can have a break.

445
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,830
Yes, sir.

446
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,040
Just shoot.

447
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,790
Don't be afraid.

448
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,990
That's enough.

449
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,000
When you always lean on the other,

450
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,160
you will be like this.

451
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,080
If you can't even rely on yourself,

452
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,000
don't think to carry the team.

453
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,290
Fa.

454
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,700
Today, you play with Shane.

455
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,540
Yes.

456
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,910
Are you tired?

457
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,580
Exhausted.

458
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,290
I can't even.

459
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,580
Oh.

460
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,160
Cooling compress ball.

461
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,580
Thank you.

462
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,700
Do you have a plan tonight?

463
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,910
Wanna eat pork hot pot?

464
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,950
Hey!

465
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,160
Fa, you can take him with us
for grilled prawns.

466
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,370
What do you say, Torn?

467
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,450
Poh's mom will pay for everything.

468
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,870
I'm allergic to seafood.

469
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,790
You guys have fun.

470
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,080
Actually I need to be home early.

471
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,870
I don't want to make my uncle wait.

472
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,910
Get up.

473
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,120
Back to practice.

474
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,220
I need to go.

475
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:01,580
Yay, my team!

476
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,700
Okay, they seem to play well together.

477
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:18,620
Hey, here it is.

478
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,660
Look, my name is on the list.

479
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,660
- It's my name!
- Come and see.

480
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,660
- Wait for me.
- Oh, jeez.

481
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,700
Oh, man!

482
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,620
- It's you.
- I'm on the list.

483
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,420
You're not on the list?

484
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,040
I can't see my name.

485
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,870
Shane, you're also on the list.

486
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Awesome.

487
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,900
You're in National Junior Team!

488
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,500
That's a relief.

489
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,380
- Congratulation.
- It's the National Team!

490
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,000
It's your dream.

491
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,580
Yeah.

492
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,580
Your dream too.

493
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,620
I've worked hard for today.

494
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,790
Finally.

495
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,580
I'll be back.

496
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,580
Okay.

497
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,700
I'm sorry.

498
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,290
I should have...

499
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,160
sprayed more water on my face.

500
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,080
I would have looked more committed.

501
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,120
Don't give up, Torn.

502
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,250
Aim to the same University as mine.

503
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,450
Coach Tuan's actually a nice guy.

504
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:34,790
Coach Big said that Coach Tuan
will write a recommendation letter for me.

505
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,660
So that I can apply for Chaiyakorn.

506
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,120
You'll go to Chaiyakorn?

507
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,120
Uh-huh.

508
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,700
Cool.

509
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,290
Follow me.

510
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,870
Not only Chaiyakorn,

511
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,450
I'll follow you to the National Team.

512
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,790
Yeah.

513
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,200
National Team.

514
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,950
Promise.

515
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,540
Have we done that long time ago?

516
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,410
Yeah, right.

517
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,200
Come on.

518
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,820
Pork hot pot, my treat.

Oh!

524
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,540
Let me tell you.

525
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,660
You'll watch everything you want to watch.

526
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,160
You'll see everything you want to see.

527
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,870
Okay, next Paddle dance.

528
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,450
This Paddle dance will be on a speed boat.

529
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,410
Lightning-fast.

530
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:22,290
It's a Paddle dance for track runners.

Freshman can join the dance?

537
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,000
Actually, I'm undercover.

538
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,750
You cutie pie, cutie little sweet pie.

539
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,450
Okay, let introduce him to our freshmen.

540
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,870
This is Vee, a senior from Track and Field.

541
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,950
Track runners have been
making a new record every year.

542
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,990
Every year!

543
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,750
Kids, you know what's the record last year?

544
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,000
What is the record for
running up this building?

545
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,330
Under 25 seconds!

546
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,060
So fast!

547
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,620
But this year...

548
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,620
- Will you break the record, Vee?
- Yeah!

549
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,910
Even by a bit, it would be nice.

550
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,290
A little bit.

551
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,500
It would be nice.

552
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,990
We'll see, kids. Can Vee break the record?

553
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,120
Show us, please.

554
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,830
Where is the start line, Vee?

555
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,990
Okay, over there.

556
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,250
Please give a round of applause for him.

557
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,700
He'll start running over there.

558
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,410
Can someone give me a stopwatch, please?

559
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,200
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

560
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:01,830
Ready?

561
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,950
Are you ready, Vee?

562
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,620
He's ready.

563
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,910
So, ready...

564
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,250
Set...

565
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,250
Go!

566
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,790
He's so fast.

567
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,450
And the record is...

568
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:25,990
is...

569
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,370
is...

570
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,410
23 seconds!

571
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,330
But the party is not over yet.

572
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,500
We have plenty of Paddle dancers.

573
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,660
Too much to remember!

574
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,000
Let me ask our entertainers. Give me a sec.

575
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,200
What is our next Paddle Dance?

576
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,080
Give me a hint, please.

577
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,790
Hint, what's next?

578
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,700
What is it?

579
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,830
What?

580
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
I know, I know.

581
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,540
Basketball team.

582
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,540
Just shoot.

583
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,750
Practice and be better at basketball.

584
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,450
Then, follow me.

585
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,040
We will be school champions,

586
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,410
university champions.

587
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,330
Well, National Junior Basketball players.

588
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,000
National Team,

589
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,950
I promise you.

590
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,290
Why didn't you dance?

591
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,620
Do you give up?

592
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,700
Senior Fa.

593
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,450
Wanna play basketball with us?

594
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,620
We'd love to play with you,

595
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,790
before you quit.

596
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:55,870
Alright, champ?

597
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:57,830
Professor Wiroj,

598
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,620
I can't find my partner.

599
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,660
Sorry, Professor.

600
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,830
We need to be in sync when running a relay race.

601
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:05,790
Like our Coach always says,

602
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,500
"Relationship is the most important".

603
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:09,990
Drop this class!

604
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,660
When I have a feeling for someone,
I'll use the eye contact technique.

605
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,700
It'll be okay, since we're both here.

606
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,250
We're basketball duo.
