1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,420
(This series was being filmed
under the regulation of Emergency Decree)

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,420
(Footage is used according to preventive
measures for infectious diseases)

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,750
The following program is suitable
for people 18 years of age or older.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,700
It may contain disturbing
content and graphics,

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,160
violence, sexual activity
and coarse language.

Viewer discretion is required.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,370
People under 18
should view with an adult.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
(This series is fiction. Names and/or
events are created for entertainment.)

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,400
(Viewer discretion is required.)

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,840
And will you be able to enter the match?

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,340
I will. Easy.

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,460
That community member interviews
this weekend. Let me look for a community.

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,560
Okay, let's assign roles.

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,920
We can use that court near your house.

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,960
You do some with Torn.
Does that mean you like Torn?

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,500
And what was wrong with you today?

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,820
Please tell me.

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,370
Okay.

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,110
Better if you don't know.

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,400
(Tupfa)

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,900
(Torn)

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,480
(Saen)

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,940
(Aai)

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,770
(Dome)

25
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,070
(Vee)

26
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,910
(Pete)

27
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,750
(Tupbok)

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,440
(Special Guests)

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,840
(The series was adapted from
'You're My Sky')

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,900
I don't understand why
they brought their girls to the match.

31
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,780
I lost focus
and then jammed my finger.

32
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,140
Maybe love?

33
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,710
Love?

34
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,020
Is it love? Does love
make you good at basketball?

35
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,860
No, but practice does.

36
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,280
I'm so bummed.
I want to play basketball.

37
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,060
I haven't asked my uncle.
I'm afraid he'll say no.

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,150
Go-no-go.

39
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,740
A critical moment when you
have to decide whether to go or not.

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,730
If you go, you might score,

41
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,940
or you might lose.

42
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,900
My teacher said it is a go-no-go moment.

43
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,780
Think about it, Torn.

44
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,420
If you ask him, you might have a chance.

45
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,300
But if you don't...

46
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,230
I definitely won't be
playing basketball with you.

47
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,140
So? Go or no-go?

48
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,680
Hey, out again?
Where are you going this time?

49
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,400
I have basketball practice.

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Why is it so often?

51
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Stay at home for once.

52
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,500
So? Go or no-go?

53
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,940
Go, of course.

54
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,620
(Municipality Pier)

55
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,180
What? You've been
aiming for this scholarship.

56
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,360
Pete even booked
a place for the celebration.

57
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,770
Why do you suddenly hesitate?

58
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,660
(You know...)

59
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,660
(You know... About Saen...)

60
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,100
I'll feed you
so your hand won't get dirty.

61
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,450
Tsk. Almost got it.

62
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,940
One down, one day left to go.

63
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,250
Are you tired?

64
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,160
We'll go to the car for our stuff,
then to the hotel.

65
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,820
- It's just right next from here.
- Uh-huh.

66
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,400
- Let's wash our hands and eat ice cream.
- Yay!

67
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,420
Back then,
I envied the families in TV dramas.

68
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,390
I've been eating dinner alone
since elementary school.

69
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,920
My parents are busy with
the restaurants.

70
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,100
Is it ironic? They open restaurants
but don't have time to dine with me.

71
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,770
You know? Some kids want their mom
to stop telling them to eat.

72
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,620
You are one of them?

73
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,620
Mhm.

74
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,020
My family is bossy.
They order me around.

75
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,540
So, I'm not comfortable
while being at home.

76
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,730
When I see another family,
I'm not feeling that way.

77
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:56,300
And when I was interviewing those people,
I mean, I didn't know how to act around them.

78
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,460
What the heck. I want that.

79
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,640
I asked my parents to stay
with my grandma every summer.

80
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,880
I got into soccer because
I wanted to be home late.

81
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,010
I did everything just not to be alone.

82
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,020
That bad?

83
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,140
It isn't fun when you have to
sleep alone on the couch every night.

84
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,140
Take your time.

85
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,220
Think about it.

86
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,740
You can tell us everything.

87
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,800
This is where we're going to stay.

88
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,780
Where have you taken me?

89
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,780
It doesn't look like a hotel.

90
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,100
Is it a homestay?

91
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,600
Nope.

92
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
It looks like someone's house.

93
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,480
Oh! You're here, Saen.

94
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,820
And who's that lady?

95
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,650
She's too old
to be a hotel staff member.

96
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,120
Seriously, Saen, tell me now.

97
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,660
Easy, bro.

98
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,160
It's a homestay,

99
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,340
the home which is a house.

100
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,180
My grandma's house.

101
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,380
- Saen!
- Ouch! It hurts.

102
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,380
You tricked me into your house?

103
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,340
I just told you that I'm not
comfortable around seniors.

104
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,100
- How sneaky you are!
- Ouch! Ouch!

105
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
- I'm off.
- Where are you going?

106
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,860
- Get back in here.
- Off to my grandma.

107
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,540
No! Get back.

108
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,580
- Grandma.
- Saen.

109
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,380
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

110
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,420
Ow! Enough!

111
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,420
Enough with the hug.

112
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,750
Where is your "friend"?

113
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,180
The one you'll introduce me to.

114
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,780
Well, he is... What?

115
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,180
Over there.

116
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,060
Hello.

117
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,100
What are you standing here for?
Why don't you wait at the restaurant?

118
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,100
I want to wait until you're done,
so we can go together.

119
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,380
Let's go.

120
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,340
Are you excited about the competition?

121
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,250
How are you with Vee?

122
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,620
Well, it's okay.

123
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,060
Is it really okay?
Vee also gave me that answer.

124
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,540
Normally, he wouldn't stop talking.

125
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,540
It is really okay.

126
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,700
Your brother is a good boy.
We all like each other as a team.

127
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,580
That includes you?

128
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,470
I'm glad.

129
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,050
You two have been in the same club for
a year but don't talk about each other.

130
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,730
I thought you didn't get along.

131
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,500
Let's take a selfie.

132
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,330
Here.

133
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,860
Hold on. Okay.

134
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,220
One, two...

135
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,820
One, two...

136
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,780
Here.

137
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,580
Let's eat.

138
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,680
Yeah.

139
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,130
Grandma.

140
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,130
Why did you go by yourself?

141
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,540
Oh, I can walk.

142
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,020
What if you get in an accident,
who's gonna help you, huh?

143
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,420
Not gonna happen.
I am still in good shape.

144
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,620
You listen to no one.

145
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,600
I don't know. It's my house.

146
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,210
What I do is my business.

147
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,620
If you want to complain,
move to be here with me.

148
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,380
Aai, wait a second.
He's changing the bedsheet.

149
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,660
Could you believe it?

150
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,020
He nagged my ear off
just right after we met.

151
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,120
Saen is a nagger,
he nags the whole family.

152
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,180
Aai, have you ever gotten annoyed by him?

153
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,080
- No.
- Really?

154
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,780
You can stand him?

155
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,520
Yes.

156
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,380
I'm sorry.

157
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,800
Even though he's a nagger,

158
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,980
when his grandpa was stationed
near the frontier,

159
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:27,260
if Saen didn't fuss around
every summer, I would've been lonely.

160
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,980
When you were far apart,
did you miss him?

161
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,470
The missing part was nothing.

162
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,340
When you had been together,
and then had to be apart,

163
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,380
it makes you worry about everything.

164
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,340
You worry if he is well-fed,

165
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,900
who does his laundry...

166
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,140
And in my day, Aai,
there was no phone,

167
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,910
only letters.

168
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,810
It takes days to get one.

169
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,410
The day you read the letter,

170
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,590
we couldn't know for sure that
"I'm fine" in the letter...

171
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,500
was still "I'm fine".

172
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,980
Aai, they've announced the scholarship.
You've fulfilled your dream.

173
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,470
Lesson learned.

174
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,750
When I had a daughter,

175
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:39,370
I told her to find someone
who can always be with her.

176
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:45,540
If that person has to be stationed
at another province or get deployed,

177
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,950
you shouldn't be together
from the start.

178
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,500
Well, you mean
if you could turn back time,

179
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,420
you wouldn't marry grandpa.

180
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,370
I would.

181
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,830
I was just whining.

182
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,520
I would marry his grandpa again.

183
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,500
Grandma.

184
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,200
What have you said to Aai?

185
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,950
Hey, can't I just talk to you friend?

186
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,380
Oh, yeah, Aai.

187
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,180
There's a dip in the mattress.

188
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,500
You sleep on the right side.

189
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,620
And let Saen sleep on
the left side where the dip is.

190
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,640
Huh? Where is Saen going to sleep?

191
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,080
Left side, and you on the right side.

192
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,080
No, I mean which room
you're gonna sleep in.

193
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,340
In your room.

194
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,570
Huh?

195
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,080
- Is it okay?
- Yeah...

196
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,810
Uh, yes.

197
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,290
And, Aai,

198
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,620
if you need that thing,
I'll leave it on a nightstand.

199
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,450
That thing?

200
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,160
What is that thing you're talking about?

201
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,770
The pointy thingy that you use at night.

202
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,500
I'll get that for you.

203
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,100
- I don't think I need, uh...
- You're definitely gonna need it.

204
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,940
You can't get sleep easily
when you lie next to Saen.

205
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,970
You're gonna need those earplugs.

206
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:28,040
He's a loud snorer. Take a couple?

207
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,260
Yes, please.

208
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,100
Tsk, tsk. Keep that in your mind.

209
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,500
Ing is free today,

210
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,520
so she dropped by.

211
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,780
I've told her not to come.

212
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,160
But she said she can watch
while waiting.

213
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,450
So I took her with me.

214
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,000
You can play even with her watching?

215
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,870
Torn.

216
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,980
Why can't you stop asking?

217
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,330
If you're going to be this worried,
you shouldn't have brought her.

218
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,200
- Ouch.
- Oh, hey, bro.

219
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,040
Fa.

220
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,450
Oh my.

221
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,710
What's going on?

222
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,200
Is it jammed?

223
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,620
Want me to buy some ice for that?

224
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,540
It's okay, Ing.

225
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,500
It's gonna be swollen.

226
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,700
I'll go get some ice.

227
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,040
I said no.

228
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,620
Please look after him, Ing.

229
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,370
It isn't her business.

230
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,610
It doesn't hurt that much.

231
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,290
Why do you have to be so stubborn?

232
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,400
Is it a good thing
that you two will be alone?

233
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,290
I'll go.

234
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,620
Is there something I should know, Torn?

235
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,740
No, nothing.

236
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,220
I feel like I'm a bother.

237
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,140
Sorry.

238
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,660
Not to worry.

239
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,410
A boy brought his girlfriend
to practice,

240
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,410
it's very common.

241
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,500
Not a girlfriend.

242
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,410
But soon-to-be.

243
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,830
I don't think he has a feeling for me.

244
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,900
Maybe he did,

245
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,080
but I think he no longer does.

246
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,000
What makes you think that way?

247
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,450
It's just a hunch.

248
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,380
Actually, I just felt that today.

249
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,790
- Torn, do you think...
- Ing.

250
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,910
I don't think I can go on playing.

251
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,940
Do you want to go now?
So we won't be home late.

252
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,750
Let's go.

253
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,120
You can move if you want to,
don't be afraid.

254
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,990
Whoa, my grandma doesn't love me.
She made me sleep on a saggy mattress.

255
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,260
Your grandma told me
that you're a nagger.

256
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,870
Yeah.

257
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,720
But you've never nagged me.

258
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,160
I nag because I don't like what I see.

259
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,340
But I don't nag you,

260
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,140
because I like it all.

261
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,450
You're rolling eyes at me, aren't you?

262
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,870
And you just changed
your facial expression, right?

263
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,270
Whoa!

264
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,200
I like everything about you.

265
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,990
Is there any part of me that you like?

266
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,200
You can tell me if there isn't.

267
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,080
I can't tell if you're being silent.

268
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,250
I don't dislike you.

269
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,160
- Hey.
- Huh?

270
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,700
Nothing.

271
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,990
You asked me to say what was in my mind.

272
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,540
But now you're being silent?

273
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,410
I want to kiss you.

274
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:17,750
But it's alright, forget about it.
It's late anyway.

275
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,500
Saen.

276
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,120
I won't mind.

277
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,330
Pete.

278
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,910
Can you press my back?

279
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,780
Huh? What about Dome?

280
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,280
Dome is too soft,
he doesn't press hard enough.

281
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,040
Well, okay.

282
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,370
Be careful what you wish for.

283
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,290
Ugh!

284
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,740
Ugh!

285
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,060
Why do you have to say "Ugh"
when passing the baton?

286
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,950
Actually, you can say anything.

287
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:09,000
So let's change it to
a thing that you like.

288
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,940
How about Pan? You like her.

289
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,370
Vee.

290
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,440
Fa.

291
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,620
Do you still want to be with me?

292
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,770
Hey...

293
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,080
Don't you feel guilty.

294
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,700
I'm sorry, Ing.

295
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,000
Why?

296
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,750
I don't like you that much.

297
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,190
Can I say that out loud?

298
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,200
It hurts you no more, right?

299
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,760
Ing...

300
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,500
I'm the one who feels guilty.

301
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,620
I didn't like you but...

302
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,330
still didn't let you go.

303
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,370
You really treated me well.

304
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:43,540
I just didn't want to lose someone
who had a feeling for me.

305
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,790
Aren't you mean?

306
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,500
Sorry.

307
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,330
So...

308
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:55,910
Let's be friends.

309
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,910
Friends.

310
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,000
Aren't you relieved?

311
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,160
Hey.

312
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,160
Aren't you relieved?

313
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:10,880
Mhm.

314
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,700
Well, goodbye. Thank you for the ride.

315
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,120
Mhm.

316
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,080
And...

317
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,910
Won't you tell me who it is?

318
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,910
Just messing with you.

319
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,160
Torn.

320
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,510
Get in the car. I'll take you home.

321
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,540
What?

322
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,660
I'm sorry.

323
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,700
Why did you say that? You did nothing.

324
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,220
Let's go.

325
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,790
You can go by yourself.

326
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,790
Torn.

327
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,250
About Ing...

328
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,370
Well...

329
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,250
I don't like her anymore.

330
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,080
And have you told her that?

331
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,020
Yes, I have.

332
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,950
We were just talking.

333
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,450
What did she say?

334
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,200
To tell you the truth,

335
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,530
Ing never had a feeling for me.

336
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,750
It was one-sided love.

337
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,180
- Lame.
- Uh-huh.

338
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,200
How is your finger?

339
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,790
It doesn't hurt that bad.

340
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:55,200
A critical moment when you
have to decide whether to go or not.

341
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,540
Torn.

342
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,500
Can I ask you something?

343
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:13,000
Why did you draw a picture
of me in your cheer-book?

344
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,200
(Poker Face Fa)

345
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,660
Done.

346
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,120
Try moving your fingers.
Can you do that?

347
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,040
I'm going.

348
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:40,830
Torn.

349
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,910
I'll take you home.

350
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,250
No, I can go by myself.

351
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,000
How will you go?

352
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,200
I've told you that a good relationship
is important for our relay team.

353
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,970
It's almost the day.

354
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,770
You've been doing a good job.

355
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,620
Will you sink your ship just
because of this, Dome?

356
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,750
I'm done talking.

357
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,500
You're grown-ups.

358
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,300
I let you decide what you want to do.

359
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,160
Aren't we gonna talk?

360
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,000
What to talk about?

361
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,750
Want to clear things up?

362
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,080
What is it?

363
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,750
I'm sorry.

364
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,200
Even when I'm with Pan,

365
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,080
all I can think about is Vee.

366
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,040
I can't stop.

367
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,160
I want to see you all the time.

368
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,650
Mhm.

369
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,790
Aren't we gonna talk?

370
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,200
How do you really feel about me?

371
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,690
Well...

372
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,340
Why do you want to
know about my feeling?

373
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:09,250
I just want to be sure.

374
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,920
That isn't one-sided.

375
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,660
I'm sorry.

376
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,570
I really have no idea.

377
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,750
Bye.

378
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,750
Fa.

379
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,410
Breakfast is ready.

380
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,410
So?

381
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,290
Did you use that thing last night?

382
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,830
Well, not the same thing as yours,

383
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:53,870
but we used it.

384
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:58,080
Get a shower
and come down for breakfast.

385
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,700
Today, I'll show you the market.

386
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,460
- Don't smile.
- Ouch!

387
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,120
Why didn't you lock the door?

388
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,040
Whoa.

389
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,410
How can I go down there
and face your grandma?

390
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:25,770
So don't go down.

391
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,540
Saen, don't! Don't.

392
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,720
Whoo! Woo-hoo!

393
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,580
Go away, Saen!

394
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,620
Go! Don't come near me!

395
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,370
Enough! I'll kick you!

396
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,250
Bro.

397
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,430
Should we tell our teammates?

398
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,370
Win over Coach Tuan's team.

399
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,580
And get the gold medal.

400
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,250
As we promised.

401
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,580
How is it going? Won his heart yet?

402
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,410
Are you crazy, Oak?

403
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,950
But the way I know from someone else.

404
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,700
I feel bad anyway.

405
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,910
I have decided.

406
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:31,040
I might break up with Pan.
