Can we talk later, coach?

172
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,780
But please, don't tell anyone.

173
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,780
Yes.

174
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,810
What's going on?

175
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,490
Nothing.

176
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,430
Hold on.

177
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,780
Hey, kids.

178
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,320
Uh, just want to check on you.

179
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,610
Please hurry up.

180
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,280
I'll be with you in a sec.

181
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,360
How?

182
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,030
Coach saw you kiss my knuckle.

183
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,530
Dang!

184
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,700
See?

185
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,400
Individually.

186
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,610
Bro.

187
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,280
Forget about that for now.

188
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,530
Win over coach Tuan's team.

189
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,860
And get the gold medal.

190
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,900
As we promised.

191
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,650
And the winner is...

192
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,490
- Chayakorn University.
- Wooh!

193
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,240
Wooh! Whoopee!

194
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,740
Great job.

195
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,780
Excellent.

196
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,740
Chayakorn!

197
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,450
Chayakorn!

198
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
Chayakorn!

199
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,740
Chayakorn!

Now! Put it in the pot now.

209

Darley and Ice,
you'll play in the next round.

210
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,150
Torn and Tupbok,

211
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,870
use man-to-man defense, don't lose them.

212
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Can you do it?

Yes!

214
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,990
- Can you do it?
- Yes!

215
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,110
Do your best! Go!

216
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,740

Awesome!

219
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,450
Can I have someone to help me stretch?

220
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,240
May I ask for someone else?
I prefer the fourth-year senior.

221
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,690
He has strong hands.

222
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,940
- Ow!
- Want someone with strong hands?

223
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,880
Ouch!

224
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,120
Enough.

225
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,400
If you won't stop,

226
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,450
I'll tell coaches that you
take poorly care of athletes.

227
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,650
We'll see.

228
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,780
Who they will believe
between you and me?

229
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,140
Ow! Ow! Ow!

230
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,790
What's going on between you two?

231
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,010
- Aai.
- What?

232
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,940
I remember his love confession for you
at the Warm-Up event.

233
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,320
How are things going,
win your heart yet?

234
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,110
Are you crazy, Oak?

235
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,520
Me and him dating?

236
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,320
Ridiculous.

237
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,610
Here we are.

238
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,360
- Woo-hoo!
- Show off!

239
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,320
Too bad for the last shot,
you should have passed it to me.

240
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,780
Right. Why didn't you pass?

241
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,110
What?

242
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,780
Our teammates still don't know.

243
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,990
Just this one time.

244
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,150
You're so obsessive.

245
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,240
Guys.

246
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,360
What happened?

247
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,630
The final game has been postponed.

248
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,690
Saint-Belon said there's
something wrong with the court.

249
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,380
So we just reschedule.

250
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,200
Uh.

251
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,150
The thing is,

252
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,540
they just announced a date change.

253
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,570
And it happens to be
on the same day as Fah's tryouts.

254
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,490
Can't you say something to the referee?

255
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,200
I can't.

256
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,360
Because they have planned
all the backup dates.

257
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:55,110
In case of rescheduling,
it has to be on that day.

258
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,680
Do you think it's a coincidence?

259
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,070
The exact same date.

260
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,990
Mmm.

261
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,640
Well, okay.

262
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,610
I have something to tell you.

263
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,850
I thought it wasn't big of a deal.

264
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,150
But now it comes to this.

265
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,450
The club that Fah's going to tryout for.

266
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,360
Coach Tuan works there as a consultant.

267
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,280
Huh?

268
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,650
Since the voice clip leak,

269
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,650
Saint-Belon no longer wants coach Tuan.

270
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,280
He might seek some backup plan
if they don't renew their contract.

271
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,320
And I think,

272
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,900
after this year's Union Game,
he maybe works for the club officially.

273
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,650
He's coaching Saint-Belon.

274
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,030
He works for the club.

275
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,150
And now he reschedules.

276
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,950
He intends to sabotage our team.

277
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,780
By getting rid of you.

278
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,180
Seem like you know me so well.

279
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,990
Without talking to me.

280
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,740
Hi, coach.

281
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,030
Chayakorn.

282
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,900
Congratulations.

283
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,180
I'm happy for you to be in the final.

284
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,340
I hope...

285
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,650
We both do our best in the final.

286
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,490
Eh?

287
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,820
What's wrong?

288
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,700
Aren't you happy?

289
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,200
Do you deliberately reschedule the final
as the same day as the tryouts, coach?

290
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,780
Low blow.

291
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,240
Do you think I would go that far?

292
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,030
It's the committee's decision.

293
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,120
What can I do?

294
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,720
Even now,

295
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,070
you still think of a scheme for winning?

296
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,780
Do you believe that I am
corrupt as coach Big told you?

297
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,120
Sorry, but we need to
get back to the practice.

298
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,000
- Please, excuse us...
- You need to reevaluate the situation

299
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,940
before all three of you
misinterpret even more.

300
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,890
You were weak.

301
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,210
You really were...

302
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,990
in the day you didn't get
past the first round in the draft.

303
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,570
That's why.

304
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,900
Toranin.

305
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:35,240
I didn't expect your rebound
to be a great support to my team.

306
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,820
That was it.

307
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,570
I didn't need to cheat.

308
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,950
I had my ideal team in my mind.

309
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,950
You weren't in it.

310
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,820
You too.

311
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,580
You made it through the first round.

312
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,610
You were a good player.

313
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,150
But you hadn't made any progress.

314
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,150
Stuck on the same path.

315
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,820
You were not what I expected.

316
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,990
That is why I couldn't be your coach.

317
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,530
Despite all that, when I and the scout team
had watched your exhibition game,

318
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,400
you have progressed.

319
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,150
So I want to ask you this.

320
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,530
Are you still willing to be on my team?

321
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,030
I give you a chance.

322
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,280
When I draft someone to my team,

323
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,900
I have thought about it thoroughly.

324
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,200
So it won't be necessary
to cheat to succeed.

325
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,780
When I draft a player,

326
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,030
I'll choose a great player
and put him in the right spot.

327
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,610
It is your last year as a student.

328
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,090
Don't waste your talent.

329
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,450
See you later.

330
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,400
Whether at the final game or at my club.

331
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Whew!

332
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,420
Woah!

333
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,610
What's wrong, kid?

334
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,490
Bro.

335
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,820
How can someone be in a relationship

336
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,190
but keep that relationship a secret?

337
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,400
So you and Aai are in a relationship?

338
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,270
Not anymore.

339
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,110
Or perhaps only when we're alone.

340
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,780
Saen.

341
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,260
Aai has never been with a man before.

342
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,380
Not everyone is ready to come out.

343
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,540
It's not your fault
when you think it's easy.

344
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,990
But neither his fault
when he feels uncomfortable.

345
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,200
Give him time.

346
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,610
I've never seen him
care about someone this much.

347
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,280
How do you know he cares about me?

348
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,580
Look at your left.

349
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,460
He wouldn't be staring at you
if he didn't care.

350
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,280
Discuss it with him.

351
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,690
Woah!

352
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,690
I think...

353
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,740
No!

354
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,360
You have to go to the tryouts.

355
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,620
I won't leave my team for coach Tuan.

356
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,450
Hey.

357
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,400
I know you want to.

358
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,140
I saw it in your eyes at the time.

359
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,200
Woah!

360
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,820
Our team isn't that terrible.

361
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,060
We can manage that.

362
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,450
Fah.

363
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,450
I've been seeing you
working hard since I was a kid.

364
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,030
Go get what you want.

365
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,370
We're talking about
the top coach in our nation.

366
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,570
But I can't leave our team.

367
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,110
I made up my mind.

368
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,810
I'll stay for the team.

369
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,240
If that's what you really want.

370
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,140
Hello, hi.

371
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,820
Oh, okay, yes.

372
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,700
If you're gonna exhale this hard
when thinking about it.

373
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,700
Go for it.

374
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,780
I just want everyone to be happy.

375
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,990
Your everyone,

376
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,860
is it included you?

377
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,070
If Champ needed to tryout
the same day as the final game.

378
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,610
Would you ask him to stay?

379
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,650
Everybody would think that too.

380
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,690
Even the team wins
but you can't get in any club.

381
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,240
Who could be happy?

382
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,820
Go to the tryouts.

383
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,900
I won't lose.

384
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,540
Promise.

385
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,320
Here's a guarantee.

386
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,610
Mmm.

387
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,230
Dude, let's go.

388
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,820
I don't want them to wait.

389
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,690
I'll be with you in a minute.

390
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,570
Do you need a hand?

391
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,200
Why is it so hard?

392
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,110
Can I ask you something?

393
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,780
I am the first guy you be with?

394
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,780
Yeah.

395
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,550
Got it.

396
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,570
It's my fault to rush you into this.

397
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,750
I forgot that you're not used to this.

398
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,030
In the future,

399
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,490
if you're not okay,

400
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,530
you can tell me.

401
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,570
Okay.

402
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,860
Be patient with me, Saen.

403
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,860
No need to hurry, I can wait.

404
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,570
I am good at waiting.

405
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,020
What?

406
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,650
At least, can I have moral support?

407
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,520
No.

408
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,900
Please.

409
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,070
No.

410
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,860
But we're alone.

411
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,320
Please.

412
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,200
Fine.

413
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,700
Where do you keep the spray?

414
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,260
I don't know.

415
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,860
Oh, hey, Aai.

416
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:07,320
I can't make it to the
party this Friday, sorry.

417
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,040
What party?

418
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,280
To celebrate his scholarship in Japan,
at that place behind University.

419
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
Let's go.

420
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,990
Bye. See you.

421
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,490
Scholarship in Japan?

422
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,280
I'm sorry.

423
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,450
I got that scholarship in Japan.

424
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,110
But I didn't know what to tell you.

425
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,240
I was afraid that

426
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,450
you would feel bad if you knew.

427
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:08,020
But the fact that I know it
from someone else,

428
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,950
still makes me feel bad.

429
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,780
Vee.

430
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,450
Are you okay?

431
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,490
Vee.

432
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,030
Can you stop bothering me?

433
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,450
Give your attention to my sis,

434
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,200
like answer her text.

435
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,740
I...

436
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,310
have decided.

437
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,070
I might break up with Pan.

438
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,490
Hello.

439
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,780
I'm here to give you support. Here.

440
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:18,150
After this match,
I'll treat you to a buffet place.

441
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,780
For you.

442
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,070
Vee.

443
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,200
Are you okay?

444
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,110
I'm afraid I might lose.

445
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:47,780
Woah!
Who could keep winning every match?

446
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,530
You do your best though.

447
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,450
If you do your best,

448
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,530
people won't criticize you
no matter what the result will be.

449
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,030
Don't think about it.

450
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,570
The only thing you have to
think about today is Dome.

451
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,530
Run the fastest as you can
once you receive the baton from him.

452
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,220
Got it?

453
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,610
Take care of Vee for me.

454
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,740
I love you.

455
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,010
Don't forget to eat that.

456
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,990
Torn, Focus.

457
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:25,360
(Registration for Basketball Tryouts)

458
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,150
Now, we only have one substitute player.

459
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,070
So everyone, do your best.

460
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,110
Play well.

461
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,700
We will win not because of one player.

462
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,110
But because of our cooperation.

463
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:44,990
Teamwork.

464
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,450
Remember, teamwork.

465
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,780
We'll do our best. Okay?

466
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,990
Go out there and get the medal.

467
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,660
Go for it! Come on!

468
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,070
On three.

469
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,220
One, two, three, Chayakorn!

470
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,200
Torn, if we do this,
we're gonna win for sure.

471
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,570
How could we lose the game?

472
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,610
Don't worry, I see their strategy.

473
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,740
Actually, it is easy to answer.

474
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,510
Do you love me enough
to try a long-distance relationship?

475
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,980
If you're not with him,
you're really gonna be happier?

476
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,380
Saen.

477
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,150
Don't say you're afraid of getting hurt.

478
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,970
You know I feel bad hearing that?

479
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,320
Hey! Vee! Vee!

480
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,740
- What's wrong with him?
- Vee! Vee!

481
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,340
- Breath slowly, Vee.
- Relax.

482
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,030
Dang! Coach Tuan's team is going hard.

483
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,620
Kids, please go inside after
I check your name on the list.

484
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,610
I have a question
that I always want to ask you.

485
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,650
Are you as elite as I am?

486
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,940
