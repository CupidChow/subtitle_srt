10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,000
Can I have your contact?

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,500
We haven't got an assignment.
We don't need to talk.

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,250
Come on.
The worst that could happen is losing.

13
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,410
I've been playing basketball
for many years.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,870
I'm not in the National Team
nor some club.

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,540
Shouldn't I do something else?

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,160
But it was because of
that freaking special deal.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's take back
our stolen victory from him.

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,450
I'll think about it.

19

(The series was adapted from
'You're My Sky')

29
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,370
I'm here for the answer.

30
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,030
So, are you getting back to
playing basketball with me?

31
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,990
Oh.

32
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,700
- I...
- Fa!

33
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,540
Let's go get some grilled prawns.

34
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,920
Shane just asked me first.

35
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,250
So, I have to play with him.

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,460
Sorry.

37
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,120
But, uh...

38
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,540
wanna join us for prawns?

39
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,160
My treat.

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,150
Hey,

41
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,910
he's allergic.

42
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,690
Don't you remember anything about him?

43
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,120
Right.

44
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,580
I forgot.

45
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,220
We're not that close.

46
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,730
So, see you around.

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,270
And keep fighting about basketball.

48
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,050
Let's go.

49
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,340
Where are you going?

50
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,000
Who wants to play
with an untalented player like you?

51
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,160
Let skillful people play together.

52
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,620
You'll never be in the National Team
as long as I'm the coach.

53
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,660
You suck!

54
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,140
Always rely on others.

55
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,540
If you can play just this good,

56
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,410
I think you'd better play
in your front yard.

57
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,000
The corruption scandal is getting big.

58
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,250
It's on the news.

59
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,200
Everyone,

60
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,870
there's a leaked voice recording
going viral.

61
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,790
The owner of that voice
is suspected to be Coach Tuan,

62
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,580
a former Junior National Team's coach

63
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,870
who had been winning aboard
for several years in a row.

64
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,790
And in this clip,

65
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,200
Coach Tuan told his assistant coach
to cut two kids from the list

66
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,370
in exchange for
some sort of a special deal.

67
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,540
Our crew has dug deeper and found that

68
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,560
children from the school mentioned

69
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,500
had been getting in
practically the same amount every year...

70
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,870
Kids.

71
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,330
The Freshman Sports Day is drawing near.

72
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,250
Stands decoration
needs to be put up within tomorrow.

73
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,790
And please don't buy any lunch today.

74
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,040
We seniors have ordered some
from "Puu Kee Prik".

75
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,830
Another thing,

76
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:53,200
I need two freshmen who will coordinate
with the Student Association.

77
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,620
Is there any volunteer?

78
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,040
Torn and I.

79
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,120
Anyone?

80
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,410
Over here.

81
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,080
No one?

82
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,750
Torn and I, bro.

83
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,790
Here we are.

84
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,290
No volunteer?

85
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,830
Hello.

86
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,790
What about you, Ting Lui?

87
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,000
Aai, Saen volunteers.

88
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,390
I know. I was pretending not to see.

89
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,490
Oh, really?

90
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,830
Fa!

91
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,290
Run! There's a bunch of journalists.

92
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,340
Please, kid.

93
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,580
- Can I get an interview?
- Please.

94
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,780
Oh man, it's locked.

95
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's find another way.

96
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,450
It's good.

97
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,620
Try it.

98
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,020
Oh, aromatic.

99
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,720
Do you like it?

100
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,800
Yeah.

101
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,000
Athletes always
drink this after practice.

102
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,580
Hi, Fa.

103
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,700
Yes, professor.

104
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,990
You're famous now.

105
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,330
A bunch of journalists
is waiting for you.

106
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,540
I want to talk to you about basketball.

107
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,790
The dean has responded to me.

108
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,200
He said our basketball team
had failed for many years.

109
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,750
Plus, kids have lost interest.

110
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,700
So, he refused to hire a new coach.

111
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,990
But...

112
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,700
How can we make our name,
if we don't have a coach?

113
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,790
It's not the whole story.

114
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,400
I've negotiated
and got a small fund for a coach.

115
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,660
But I think no one wants this job.

116
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,080
What do you say, sir?

117
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,470
I said...

118
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,080
It's not the whole story.

119
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,080
I've negotiated
and got a small fund for a coach.

120
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,120
But I think no one wants this job.

121
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,450
15,000 Baht

122
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,040
a year.

123
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,450
Gee!

124
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,160
And there's also a deal.

125
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,950
I happened to brag that
we have a national player.

126
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,250
Fa, can you tell Torn
to win on the Freshman Sports Day?

127
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,830
But our team hasn't won for ages.

128
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,990
The dean said the deal wouldn't happen
if we didn't win.

129
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,000
Please.

130
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,870
Tell him that.

131
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,160
Yes, sir.

132
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,330
Forget about it.

133
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,120
We don't have money for a coach
even if we win.

134
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,410
Torn.

135
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,250
What are you thinking?

136
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,830
I'm thinking

137
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,200
whom can I recruit
for the Freshman Sports Day?

138
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,580
And...

139
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,280
I'll contact some friends,
asking for any coach that we can approach.

140
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,870
Even for only 15,000,

141
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,700
we'll practice just until the end of
the Sports Science Confederation match.

142
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,620
And if we win a gold medal,
we can ask for more funds.

143
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,120
What?

144
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Okay.

145
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,410
I'll ask my little brother.

146
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
He plays basketball at school.

147
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,080
I think he can join us.

148
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,510
When do you have a brother?

149
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,370
We're not close.

150
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,840
He studied abroad when he was little.

151
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,080
You can tell me if you need any help.

152
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,620
Easy.

153
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,830
I can help.

154
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,650
How could I say "easy"?

155
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,580
I'm the only freshman
who can play basketball.

156
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,330
What can I bring
to win on the sports day?

157
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,500
My soccer team
just scored our own goal.

158
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,590
I was stunned.

159
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,540
I acted cool
and told him that would be easy.

160
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,540
What can I do?

161
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,250
Listen to me.

162
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,500
If we have only one peanut,

163
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,080
it's easy to break.

164
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,660
But what if we have five?

165
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,540
I think I better eat them.

166
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,880
What's wrong with you?

167
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,160
Well, and what about you and Fa?

168
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,950
And not about basketball.

169
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,870
He likes a girl,

170
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,500
and has been approaching her.

171
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,120
What?

172
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,990
My sixth-sense is wrong?

173
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,990
I really think
Fa treats you differently.

174
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,870
What's your next move?

175
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,500
I don't know.

176
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,160
Listen.

177
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,660
If you can't be number one,

178
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,000
you should reserve for number two.

179
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,390
When he gets his heart broken
by his number one, he'll come back to you.

180
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:54,760
Believe me.

181
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,910
He likes girls.

182
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,250
How can he like me?

183
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,830
He told you that he likes only girls?

184
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,950
What I see is that
he oddly cares for you.

185
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,160
I really mean that.

186
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,660
Believe me, there's still a chance.

187
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,870
You can start with this.

188
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,340
If you win on the Freshman Sports Day,

189
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,500
you'll surely get support from Fa.

190
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,120
Come on, I'll help you.

191
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,820
Wanna wait for him?

192
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,330
- Ready?
- Yeah.

193
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,370
Let's go.

194
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,680
Is there really
an indoor track for running?

195
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,580
There is!

196
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,830
Yeah. I constantly run back and forth.

197
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,030
Really?

198
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,790
Just follow me.

199
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,330
Where is it?

200
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,700
The basketball court.

201
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,620
You donkey.

202
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,370
What're you looking at? Pass the ball.

203
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,950
Come on, faster.

204
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,420
Woohoo, good job, everyone.

205
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,910
You did a good job.

206
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,080
It's awesome. You're awesome.

207
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,790
Found you.

208
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,960
What's up?

209
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,000
I was passing the store,
so I've brought you a crepe.

210
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,750
Eat it while it's hot.

211
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,990
What are you doing?

212
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,790
I'm organizing some stuff
for the sports day.

213
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,910
Uh-huh.

214
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,120
Thank you.

215
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,450
Hey! Are you okay?

216
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,540
I'll get a gel pad.

217
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,990
Here.

218
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Thank you.

219
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,040
How come we've never talked?

220
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,690
And you're my sister's boyfriend.

221
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,660
You've got a lot of attention, Vee.

222
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,120
How can I get to talk to you?

223
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,580
What do you think after we've talked?

224
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
You're just like Pan.

225
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,120
But a male.

226
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,830
Nope, I'm spicier.

227
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,750
What about your trick?

228
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,410
You're not gonna teach me?

229
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,450
Oh.

230
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,990
That trick?

231
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,370
Alright, I'll show you.

232
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,910
Woah!

233
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,200
It won't work
because you avoid my eye contact.

234
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,410
But I can't.

235
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,250
Alright!

236
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,120
I'll use that trick with someone else.

237
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,870
Let me help you.

238
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,250
This one?

239
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
It's okay?

240
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,200
It's okay.

241
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,330
What about the rest?

242
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,120
Anything else?

243
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,620
This part is okay, but this part isn't.

244
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,160
Okay, I'll help you with that.

245
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,290
How come you don't look like Fa?

246
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,910
I'm sorry that
I don't look like my own brother.

247
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,080
Why do you have an accent?

248
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,260
That's because
I just got back from the USA.

249
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,450
Say something, man.

250
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,450
Yo, what's good?

251
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,540
I'm Tupbok.

252
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,410
I'm a first-year student here.

253
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,660
Nice to meet you.

254
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,540
Umm.

255
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,990
Tupbok.

256
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,450
It's a cool name.

257
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,870
I didn't know that Fa had a brother.

258
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,370
Are you his boyfriend, so that
you need to know everything about him?

259
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,200
What next?

260
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,620
Are we gonna practice
or you'll keep staring at me?

261
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,500
Relax, dude.

262
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,580
Don't do that
just because you can't have his brother.

263
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,160
No, I was shocked.

264
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,450
So? They're all waiting.

265
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,330
Oh my!

266
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,200
Well, everyone,

267
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,990
thank you very much for coming.

268
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,000
And please don't be worried.

269
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,450
I'll teach you from the beginning.

270
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,250
So, where will we start, dude?

271
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,540
We're starting at changing clothes.

272
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,540
Tee!

273
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,120
Hey, Tee!

274
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,950
Tee!

275
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,040
Ouch!

276
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,200
Oh, my god. I'm sorry.

277
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,750
Dome.

278
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,910
There's no one?

279
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,790
None.

280
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,040
I've asked everybody.

281
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,750
I don't believe that
you've really asked everybody.

282
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,290
Yeah!

283
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,660
It was Pete, actually.

284
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,540
Asked about what?

285
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,410
Asked if there's anyone
who can drive a manual.

286
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,830
That freaking Joe lent me
a manual car for picking up food.

287
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,700
I can't find someone who can drive that.

288
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,620
Oh, right.
You're in your second year, Vee.

289
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,250
I'll invite you to a group chat
for the Freshman Sports Day.

290
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,750
We can have more options
when we have more people.

291
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,870
I told you!

292
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,120
There's only one.

293
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,700
You have two options, Aai.

294
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,830
No food for all the students,

295
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,750
or let him help you.

296
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,120
Why does it have to be him?

297
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,250
Fine!

298
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Who is it?

299
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,540
You'll see.

300
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,990
Oh, yeah, you'll stay late
practicing with Dome, right?

301
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,250
Yes, bro.

302
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,000
Dome helps me a lot.

303
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,410
I think I'll repay him.

304
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,750
Why will you do that?

305
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,450
Just use him for free.

306
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,160
Pete.

307
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,250
It'll be done after checking this part?

308
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,370
Do I have to notify someone?

309
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,790
Well...

310
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,950
you don't need to.

311
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,740
(Flirty Black Cat Restaurant)

312
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,990
I'm coming back with the food.

313
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,330
Lucky that you found someone. LOL!

314
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,000
Do you think
Aai considers it good or bad luck?

315
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,990
So, who is it? I want to know.

316
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,580
You regularly chat
but you don't seem to answer my text.

317
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,450
If we aren't in the same group chat,
I think you've blocked me.

318
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,370
I actually have no problem
with blocking you.

319
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,950
Well, you can only block my text,

320
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,620
but you can never
block your heart from me.

321
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,250
I'll start with blocking your text.

322
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,830
No, no, don't!

323
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,160
How can we discuss
professor Wiroj's class if you block me?

324
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,330
And another thing.

325
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,540
This food is for whom?

326
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,500
Well, freshmen and staff.

327
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,950
Will it be enough?

328
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,330
It seems not.

329
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,200
I noticed that we have more people.

330
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,080
Did you count?

331
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,330
Nope.

332
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,410
- I...
- I did.

333
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,700
I did the headcount.

334
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,290
This is more than enough.

335
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,700
You can't conclude that
just by guessing.

336
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,000
I don't work that way.

337
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,410
Woah, I'm sorry.

338
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,790
- I'm just saying...
- Don't touch me.

339
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,000
Please don't overthink.

340
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,450
The last batch.

341
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,660
Okay, right?

342
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,040
Ladies and gentlemen.

343
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,160
Now, it's time
for the basketball championship.

344
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,620
Today's match is between two teams

345
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,580
which are both considered
the Faculty of Tough Men.

346
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,910
The first team is...

347
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,540
Faculty of Engineering!

348
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,200
Yes, Engineering.

349
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,330
And the other team.

350
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,080
They've won by default like...

351
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,660
like they're almost running out of luck.

352
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,540
And that is...

353
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,330
my faculty, Sports Science!

354
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,200
You can do it!

355
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,990
Yeah, Faculty of Sports Science.

356
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,830
You can do it!

357
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,660
Believe me.

358
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,990
We'll win!

359
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,000
We'll win!

360
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,620
We'll win! Woo!

361
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,990
- Yeah.
- We'll win.

362
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,000
We can do it.

363
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,870
Alright,

364
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,330
after the introduction for both teams.

365
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,120
The game's starting now.

366
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,120
And which team will be the champion?

367
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,620
We'll see!

368
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,450
It's okay, everyone.

369
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,160
We can make it next time.

370
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,580
Come on.

371
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,220
(Don't give up)
(Sports Science)

372
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,500
Tee.

373
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Bro.

374
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,080
I don't think we can make it.

375
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,580
Yes, we can!

376
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,200
We're only a few points behind.

377
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,790
Dude, we're all useless.

378
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,540
Yes, I know that we have to dribble
and can't pass the ball while standing still.

379
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,950
No!

380
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,990
We can do that.

381
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,120
- Wait
- Can we?

382
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,120
Can we do that?

383
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,040
The problem is
we don't know how to play basketball.

384
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,790
Okay.

385
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,790
I'll explain what you all need to do.

386
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,540
While you're playing, you need to
block the pass, seek the opportunity...

387
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,870
A sport
where you don't need to be the best.

388
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,990
When you miss a shot,

389
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,910
your friends will be there.

390
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,950
This...

391
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,700
is basketball.

392
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,540
I've got an idea.

393
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,080
You can do it
even if you're not the best.

394
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,120
I've got a way.

395
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,620
Come on.

396
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:12,790
And we're back to the...
second quarter.

397
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,620
Okay?

398
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,330
Okay.

399
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,620
Let's go!

400
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,370
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

401
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,450
Sports Science!

402
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,080
On three?

403
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,450
One, two, three,

404
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,330
Sports Science, hey!

405
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,700
Woo!

406
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,700
Wow.

407
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,580
The Sports Science team is on fire.

408
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,790
I don't know what's happening
but they look exciting.

409
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,410
We're not gonna play basketball.
Change the direction to our expertise.

410
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,000
Sports Science has the ball.

411
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,990
He stole the ball.

412
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,790
Run, run!

413
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,830
You're a runner.

414
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,370
So, you run.

415
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,830
Make them confused.

416
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,370
But he has no ball.

417
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,080
Engineering got fooled.

418
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,830
Big time.

419
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:01,120
They got played like a fiddle.

420
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,330
And you,

421
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,910
just block them.

422
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,450
Now, Sports Science got a hunk...

423
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,700
sorry, a swimmer blocked the other team.

424
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,790
They've been blocked.

425
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,870
You can set the ball, right?

426
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,370
Yes.

427
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,410
Do that.

428
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,950
The volleyball player just set the ball.

429
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,580
When you have the ball,
pass it to me or Tupbok.

430
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,540
We'll do the rest.

431
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,450
Don't think it's a competition.

432
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,160
Just do what you're good at.

433
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,700
And now,

434
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:51,330
they've changed their playing style
into something they're good at.

435
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,330
We can say this is a very strange match.

436
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,200
Extraordinary...

437
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,620
Oh my!

438
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,700
I'm sorry.

439
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,080
Sorry, I'm used to doing that.

440
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,950
It's alright.

441
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,330
It's good.

442
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,990
And the winning team is...

443
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,620
Faculty of Sports Science.

444
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,620
Awesome!

445
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,200
Let's have something to eat.

446
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,700
Your treat?

447
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,620
Let me think about it.

448
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,620
- Wanna eat?
- If you pay.

449
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,830
Okay!

450
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,870
For everybody?

451
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,540
Yes.

452
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,250
And the special one?

453
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,450
Did you forget?

454
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,290
I didn't.

455
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,700
I've noted that on the box.

456
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,250
Thank you so much.

457
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,290
Just go.

458
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,580
Aai.

459
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,540
We don't have enough
for three departments.

460
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,540
Medics, swimming and volleyball.

461
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,830
What?

462
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,080
I wasn't informed about those.

463
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,540
How many boxed meals do we need?

464
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,990
About 30 to 40.

465
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm not sure.

466
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,500
It's okay.

467
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,990
I'll get into that.

468
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,660
Hello.

469
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,750
Is it possible
if I order 50 more boxed meals?

470
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,950
What time will it be done?

471
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,450
Oh.

472
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,660
Never mind. It will be too late.

473
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,540
(Saen Aad Haan Kitchen)

474
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,910
My family's business.

475
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,120
Are you the owner
of Saen Aad Haan Kitchen?

476
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,750
The one that has many chains?

477
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,990
Umm.

478
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,910
I asked my dad to send a food truck.

479
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,660
There are about 80 boxed meals.

480
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,540
You can give away the rest
to other faculties.

481
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,200
Okay.

482
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,410
Tell me how much it is.

483
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,250
Here.

484
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,620
Don't forget to eat or you'll faint.

485
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,660
I specifically asked the chef
for this one.

486
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,040
(Saen)

487
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,000
It's your name.

488
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,000
Why did you give me this?

489
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,540
It is my name.

490
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,410
But if we include what in parenthesis,

491
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,990
it means you.

492
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,300
(Saen)

493
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,260
(Saen's special one)

494
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,500
Mixed fruit drinking yogurt.

495
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,700
Chocolate cake.

496
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,160
Fried chicken.

497
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,450
Don't forget sticky rice.

498
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,160
All your food jokes.

499
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,450
You're also on the running app?

500
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,450
Let me add you as a friend.

501
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,450
Do it yourself.

502
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,830
Here.

503
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,620
You were so cool, this afternoon.

504
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,120
Pete was just staring blankly.

505
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,040
That was just an easy part.

506
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,290
It's hard.

507
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,790
It's not.

508
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,830
You just need to look into the eyes.

509
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:44,410
Use it with my sis,
and her heart will skip a beat.

510
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,370
Seriously?

511
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,790
Seriously.

512
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,450
But you have to do it for
more than eight seconds to make it.

513
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,250
You always avoid eye contact.
You look just after a few seconds.

514
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,250
Here.

515
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,160
Have a staring contest with me.

516
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,830
Oh boy!

517
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,000
Kids.

518
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,040
Meal break.

519
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,250
What to eat, bro?

520
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,120
All are seafood stir-fried with basil.

521
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,750
Cool. I love shrimp.

522
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,060
(Fried rice with pork, Torn)

523
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,000
What?

524
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,910
He said they are all seafood.

525
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,620
But here's pork.

526
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,790
And it's written in your name.

527
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,870
Bro!

528
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,500
Won't you eat?

529
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,330
Well, no.

530
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,250
There is only enough for you.

531
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,320
And are you hungry?

532
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,580
As I promised,

533
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,330
I won the game.

534
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,620
Now...

535
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,790
find a coach, right?

536
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,870
You're better, Tohranin.

537
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,460
You can act as captain now.

538
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,120
Coach Big will be our coach.

539
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,370
I called him last night.

540
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,750
Did you tell him how much he will earn?

541
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,870
I definitely asked about salary
before taking the job, Tupfa.

542
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,200
I have no excuse for what happened.

543
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,330
I feel regretful

544
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,830
that I didn't stand up
and tried more to protect you.

545
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,290
And my apology...

546
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,040
how about the gold medal from
the Sports Science Confederation match?

547
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,710
I'll hold tryouts for the new team.

548
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,370
There's no fast track even for you two.

549
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,500
You need to sign up.

550
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,330
I gotta go.

551
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,870
Just want to check out
a former national player.

552
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,660
See you at the practice.

553
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,710
See you, Coach.

554
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,160
Bye.

555
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,660
Why did Coach Big agree to be our coach?

556
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,330
How did you negotiate with him?

557
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:24,660
I heard that he took a lot
from Coach Tuan.

558
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,830
Thank you,

559
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,750
for everything.

560
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,120
By the way, bro.

561
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,330
This court is open in the morning?

562
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,910
I think I should get back
to my morning practice.

563
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,580
You can come if you're free.

564
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,250
I'll get sleepy when I'm alone.

565
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,910
But it's okay if you don't come.

566
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,910
Chill.

567
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,040
I haven't got up early for ages.

568
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,790
I'll try to set the alarm.

569
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,180
(Aai, the bill for the food...)

570
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,460
You've read my message!

571
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,350
(Saen is glad)

572
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,590
(Saen is happy)
(Saen is surprised)

573
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,670
(Saen Aad Haan Kitchen
Catering and Delivery)

574
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,830
Whew. I thought I'd melt your heart.

575
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,290
I don't wanna read too much text.

576
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,200
Thanks for today.

577
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,790
You're welcome.

578
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,410
Is this short enough?

579
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,710
Or too short?

580
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,080
Do I need to add an emoji?

581
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,290
So that it won't look dry.

582
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,970
(Saen loves it)

583
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,200
About the current scandal,

584
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,910
I didn't want it to be like this.

585
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,250
But the school board
has pressured me to dismiss you.

586
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,830
I totally understand, Dean.

587
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:48,200
But I want you to reconsider
if it's worth it.

588
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:53,040
It's okay if it is only for me.

589
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:57,040
But I worry about you.

590
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,580
Your dream for Saint-Belon
to excel at sports.

591
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,200
Who's gonna make that for you?

592
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:14,830
If I'm not here, who will bring you
the fourth champion?

593
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,790
Uh,

594
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:23,540
or Saint-Belon will return to the dark age
where nobody knows its name.

595
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,750
So, bring me the fourth champion.

596
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:34,540
Before I can't find any way to help you.

597
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,710
I thought you'd never come.

598
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,580
I think we know each other too much.

599
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:02,870
Enough.

600
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,540
I don't know if you get hit by a car
and die or break your leg.

601
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,830
But you have to come now.

602
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,660
Don't be a burden.

603
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,210
What?

604
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:11,500
I'm sorry I'm late.

605
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,910
Can I sign sitting next to you?

606
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,750
Who hasn't signed Torn's cheer-book?

607
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,580
Me.

608
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,160
Are you serious

609
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:24,250
about me?

610
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,660
If you flirt just for fun,

611
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,630
I'm not having fun.
