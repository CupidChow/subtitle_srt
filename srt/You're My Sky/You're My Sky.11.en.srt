(Viewer discretion is required.)

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,820
I have already contacted the athlete
who has gotten a torn ligament.

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,020
He said he could come back this fast,

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,530
because Coach Tuan
helped him did physical therapy.

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,420
I don't want you to be with Coach Tuan.

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,260
Pan already knew it.
At the resort's swimming pool.

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,880
- Then I'll wait.
- I won't promise that I can do it.

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,460
Do you really want me to go?

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,460
If you want to go, you should go.

18
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,580
You go there to know what you don't know.

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,320
if they aren't what you want,
then just come back.

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,060
Coach Tuan's way will
make you have no one left around.

21
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,940
If one day, I'll have no one left,

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,920
it's probably because they leave me.

(Five months before)

57
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,720
Why did you move in
with Saen without telling me?

58
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,220
You suddenly packed
your stuff and moved out.

59
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,220
I called you, but you didn't answer my phone.

60
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,820
Did you cut me out?

61
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,250
I still don't want to see your face.

62
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,660
Do you want me to leave the club?

63
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,670
No, I don't.

64
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,620
Do you want to?

65
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,940
Like I already said,

66
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,510
I didn't know what to do.

67
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,420
You wanted me to live in the condo with you,

68
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,620
but you hardly were there.

69
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,740
Not only I can't go to practice,

70
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,600
but my leg still hurts like this.

71
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,260
I can do nothing, but overthink.

72
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,130
Staying with Saen,
at least there is someone to talk to.

73
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,100
Please give me some time, bro.

74
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,960
You just concentrate on your practice.

75
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,810
Then we'll meet again in Thai League.

76
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,300
Maybe, that's all I can do.

77
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,820
- Do your best.
- Do your best.

78
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,300
Good luck.

79
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,300
Hello.

80
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,260
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

81
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,820
Anything interesting happened today?

82
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,060
Look. Is that interesting enough?

83
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,740
Go along with our plan.
If we encounter the game like this.

84
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,140
Don't forget. These two must switch
their positions immediately,

85
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,860
then another one must run back here.
Standby right there.

86
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,500
Do not lose sight of them.

87
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Isn't it a bit disrespectful to coach Big?

88
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,180
The whole team is meeting next to him,

89
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,180
but he goes to talk with Coach Tuan.

90
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,940
Why does he have to do like this?

91
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,940
This competition, the stakes are high.

92
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,540
Torn.

93
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,740
Hello, Coach Tuan. I'm Thoranin.

94
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,060
I heard that you helped Wittawat when
he had gotten a torn ligament,

95
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,200
and made him come back to play very quickly.

96
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,040
So, I want to know...

97
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,230
if you could come to help me as well?

98
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,420
Do you want to come back to play?

99
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,850
Yes.

100
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,300
You can wait a little longer. In just a
few months, you'll be fully recovered.

101
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,200
"Well, I want to be able to come back
to play as fast as possible."

102
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,880
If you really want to come back to play,

103
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,670
that reason is not enough.

104
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,560
There must be something more than that.

105
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,420
Wittawat was able to come back
to play within seven months,

106
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,000
and then joined the national team,

107
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,800
because he didn't just want
to come back to play.

108
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,800
After he had an accident,

109
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,180
everybody told him that he might have lost
his future to join the national team.

110
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,880
because his ligament
had torn since this age.

111
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,400
So, he came to me,

112
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,770
in order to get revenge with
everybody who used to insult him.

113
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,740
And how is he now?

114
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,190
How far can he go?

115
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,860
If your answer is just wanting to come back
and play as fast as possible,

116
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,980
I refuse your request.

117
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,540
Is it about Torn?

118
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,120
Yeah.

119
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,700
I know I was wrong,
but he was too much as well, wasn't him?

120
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,360
I can't even talk with him right now.
He just keeps avoiding me.

121
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,750
Does I play with you
mean I don't love him?

122
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,630
Well, he's sad. You must understand that.

123
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,600
You two have always played together,

124
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,910
and then one day
you don't play together anymore.

125
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,910
Moreover, you're the one who can go further.

126
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,500
When he was in the first year,
he saw you like that,

127
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,960
but had he ever given up on you?
The answer is 'no'.

128
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,710
Don't leave anyone
go through their worst time alone.

129
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,660
Don't you miss me at all?

130
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,330
Let's go back to be together.

131
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,780
Being together but feeling lonely,
is it better not to go back?

132
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,580
I'll make time for you.

133
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,680
You can't do it.

134
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,500
You're a professional player.

135
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,880
How could you make time for me?

136
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,540
I have thought it through.

137
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,060
I thought about it over and over every day.

138
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,320
If I was more selfish,

139
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,820
I would have told you
to leave the club already.

140
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,660
But how can I pull you down?

141
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,400
But if I have to wait all day
to talk to you just a few sentences,

142
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,700
I'm not okay with it as well.

143
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,300
Like I already said on that day,

144
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,380
I didn't really know what to do.

145
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,880
It may be something unsolvable.

146
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,460
Right?

147
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,500
I'm going.

148
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,380
What a waste of money on flowers.

149
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,490
I made an effort to buy it for him.

150
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,160
I don't know what to do anymore.

151
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,270
I already told you. Be patient.

152
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,400
So, I won't be regret, will I?

153
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,810
Or should I just quit and let it be.

154
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,660
Torn doesn't want you to quit.

155
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,220
I can't stay, I can't quit,

156
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,770
nor I can't play with anybody.

157
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,750
Everybody always tells me what to do,

158
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,660
but no one ever asked me

159
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,850
if I want to do it, or not.

160
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,020
Can't I be happy in my life, just for once?

161
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,340
I'm sorry.

162
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,000
I shouldn't have insisted you
to go make up with him at all.

163
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,060
I don't know anymore. How do I feel about him?

164
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,620
To that degree?

165
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,920
This is the first time

166
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,900
that I asked myself
is this person really right for me?

167
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,480
Did you get the answer?

168
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,900
I want to know it, too.

169
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,400
Are we still the right person
for each other?

170
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,180
If not, just tell me.

171
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,420
I understand.

172
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,380
What do you want?

173
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,230
I want to be number one.

174
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,380
Can you help me?

175
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,640
I still can't find a reason
to waste my time helping you.

176
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,440
What you want me to do,

177
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,970
I can do it all.

178
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,660
I want a player to join my team.

179
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,130
If that so, can I join your team?

180
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,910
You don't fit in.

181
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,160
Didn't I already tell you?

182
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,600
The 'Best point guard' award
of the Sports Science Federation,

183
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,120
I think I didn't get by chance.

184
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,160
Hmm.

185
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,030
I mean, your attitude doesn’t fit in.

186
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,680
How do you want my attitude
to be like? Just tell me.

187
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,090
What's the matter with you?

188
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,220
I'm going to watch you practice once a week

189
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,830
to see your development, and
to plan a training schedule for you.

190
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,260
You have to practice by yourself.

191
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,580
If you slack off, I'll know.

192
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,370
And if I say you can't go on,

193
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,800
that means you can't go on.

194
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,120
I'm not Coach Big.

195
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,360
My every word, I say what I mean.

196
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,880
Bargaining is not allowed.

197
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,670
Thank you, coach.

198
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,810
No matter what you've come across,
I want you to remember this feeling.

199
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,350
The way to your destination is not easy.

200
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,240
One day, if you feel discouraged,
remember this day

201
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,490
that you came to me to say everything,
and asked me to help you.

202
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,680
Hmm.

203
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,440
And do not waste my time.

204
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,220
Torn, aren't you tired?

205
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,060
Ice.

206
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:47,980
Hey. it's okay.

207
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,530
Darn.

208
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,660
Wooh!

209
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,660
Yeah!

210
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,220
Don’t.

211
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,320
What?

212
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,320
You let me get the ball just now.

213
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,420
Let's play fair.
I won't be proud to win like this.

214
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:04,860
Get scolded?

215
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:05,950
Serves you right.

216
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,200
If I was him, I would be angry, too.

217
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,600
I won because you pulled your punch?
Are you crazy?

218
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,510
Alright, let's get serious.

219
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,700
Here. Drink some water.

220
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,100
Thank you.

221
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,260
Coach.

222
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,510
Why when we were in the camp,

223
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,040
you usually told us
to focus only on ourselves.

224
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,780
I’m just wondering why
can't we go together as a team?

225
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,850
Every day I walk down to the court,

226
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,980
I have a demand for you guys
to practice as hard as you can.

227
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,260
No need to worry about
what others are doing.

228
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,060
If so, how can you
practice with your full effort?

229
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,210
You must be responsible for yourself.

230
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,620
Will that boy be able to play?

231
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,540
Or what more does he need to practice?

232
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,060
Those kinds of things, that's the coach's job,

233
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,140
not teammates.

234
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,380
If you feel that you have to
do something like those,

235
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,160
that means

236
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,360
the coach is not...

237
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,300
doing their job.

238
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,220
I know that the way I think

239
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,820
is not agreed by some people.

240
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,940
It's like teaching children to be selfish.

241
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:32,300
But who could lead the youth team
to get a gold medal every time like me?

242
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,500
Well,

243
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,180
each individual person
has their own opinion.

244
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:52,540
But I believe that everyone
has the same purpose and hope…

245
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,180
because we love basketball. Right?

246
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,260
Alright. Go. Keep practicing.

247
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:38,800
(Coach Tuan is freaking cool.)

248
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,760
(Be Blooming)

249
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
Okay.

250
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,760
Today, I will divide you guys into two teams.

251
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,800
Fluke, Darlie, come here.

252
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,950
You two are team leaders.

253
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,860
For you team member,

254
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,420
I will let you choose them by yourselves.

255
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,680
- Okay?
- Okay, sir.

256
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,860
Tupbok. Come here.

257
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,330
Ice. Come here.

258
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,050
Mark.

259
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,270
Peter.

260
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,060
So, do I have other choice?

261
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,840
Why did they take it out on me?

262
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,380
It was them who didn't try hard enough.

263
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,140
The person who has changed
is you. Not your team.

264
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,420
You already speak a different
language with your team.

265
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,820
Chayakorn, It's not your team anymore.

266
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,700
For Thai League,
if your performance is good,

267
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,360
I'll let you join my club.

268
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,000
So, how will my performance get better

269
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,860
if the team is still like this?

270
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,320
Do you understand now?
As I said, do not rely on others.

271
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,330
The only one you can trust is you.

272
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,900
From now on, you must put
yourself in the right place. And that's all.

273
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,040
Oh no!

274
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,860
Woo!

275
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,710
Wooh!

276
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,580
What's wrong with you?

277
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,000
You made the same mistake.

278
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,380
Hey, bro. Take it easy.

279
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,380
Darn.

280
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,860
I don't care whether he is
my friend's boyfriend or what.

281
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,840
He's barking like a dog.

282
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,930
The whole court already hated him.

283
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,340
Hey, don't scold your teammates.

284
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,840
You can say like this,
because your points are more than ours.

285
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,900
- Woo!
- Yay!

286
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,780
Bangkok Phoenix got a free throw.

287
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,140
Woo!

288
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,360
Good job!

289
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,700
Team Chayakorn made a foul.
Bangkok Phoenix got a free throw again.

290
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,020
Woo!

291
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,100
I told you.

292
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,610
Come here.

293
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,120
I know that team is good.

294
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,140
but us, we have to be more focused.

295
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,140
Torn.

296
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,420
He was meant to get on my nerves, coach.

297
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,020
I know, would you let them?

298
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:45,440
Listen to me. If you make one more foul,
go sit on the bench,

299
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,360
entire game!

300
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,540
I'm serious.

301
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,540
Everyone needs to be focused.

302
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,140
Okay?

303
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,550
Don't give up!

304
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,060
Chain.

305
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,380
I beg you.

306
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,900
I didn't start it.
What's wrong with that boy?

307
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,340
Hey, but he has already made three fouls.

308
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,540
Do I have to apologize to you
for wanting our team to get points?

309
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,220
I knew, you guys did it as well during
the Sports Science Confederation game.

310
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,290
What are you smiling at?

311
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,020
Fudge!

312
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,220
Are you alright?

313
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,860
- Hey!
- Ow!

314
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,340
- Ow!
- Oh!

315
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,340
- God!
- He's bleeding.

316
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,420
- What was that?!?
- What the heck?

317
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,460
- What wrong with you?
- How could you do that?

318
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,000
Are you still hurt?

319
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,220
Fa.

320
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,900
That's okay, Torn.

321
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,220
I'm here with you now.

322
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,220
Don't cry.

323
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,130
Don't cry.

324
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,600
I don't know what's wrong with me, bro.

325
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,110
I've never been like this before.

326
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,120
Now, all of my teammates, they all hate me.

327
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,220
Fa, could you please not hate me?

328
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,020
I have no one left.

329
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,030
I'm sorry.

330
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,440
Torn.

331
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,660
Listen to me.

332
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,890
I could never hate you,

333
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,580
and I will never hate you.

334
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,830
I understand, Torn.

335
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,830
I understand everything.

336
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,280
Coach.

337
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,460
Coach.

338
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,740
Umm.

339
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,740
I'm sorry that I've made you feel difficult
over the past several months.

340
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,380
I've always seen
what has been happened to you.

341
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,720
If you feel pressured, it's not unusual.

342
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,780
If normal people like us
expect too much of something,

343
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,050
it will turn out like this.

344
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,700
Go apologize to them.

345
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,700
Me? I'm okay.

346
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,780
The first year Thai League,
we might have come only this far,

347
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,580
because we met such a
talented club from the first game.

348
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,500
Let's go and leave them some impressive
memories in this big league, shall we?

349
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,480
Can I, coach?

350
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,480
- But...
- Not make a foul.

351
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,020
For sure.

352
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,790
Come on.

353
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,580
Thank you, coach.

354
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,500
Couldn't you just pull your punch for me?

355
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,870
Our score is so terrible.

356
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,420
Well, somebody told me to not to.

357
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,380
Bro.

358
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:17,530
Hmm?

359
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,940
From now on,
I might not know what will happen,

360
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,420
I might become a moron again,

361
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,820
or maybe, we might have more fight.

362
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,220
But I'm not telling I will not try.

363
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,820
But this effort,

364
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,430
it makes me lose.

365
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,700
If the day comes.

366
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,180
I want you to know

367
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,210
that I love you.

368
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:10,980
Torn.

369
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,900
I used to be an idiot. I used to lose
my heart. I used to lose my way.

370
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,580
Why can't I understand you?

371
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,380
On my darkest day,

372
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,060
you're always the person
who gives love to me.

373
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:31,140
Even if I die, I will never forget about it.

374
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,100
You can doubt anything,

375
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,100
but don't doubt whether I love you or not.

376
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,420
Because I love you every day.

377
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,300
Me too.

378
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,850
Don't ever leave me again.

379
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,320
I'm not going anywhere.

380
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,570
Whether we are in the same team or not,

381
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,340
I'm always with you.

382
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,340
I'll always be with you.

383
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,020
Let's go home.

384
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,500
Where are you going?

385
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:35,660
My condo?

386
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,340
Can I?

387
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,140
Definitely.

388
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:49,380
Ouch!

389
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,780
- Wait for me.
- Hurry up.

390
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,300
Let me play so well, but I have no one left,

391
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:13,300
I think I'm not okay.

392
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:15,780
Are you in your room? There will
be something delivered to you.

393
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,780
Please wait to receive it.

394
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,850
I know that you love me.

395
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:23,850
I know you feel guilty.

396
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:27,070
You already tried cutting him out,
and tried talking someone else.

397
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,220
If you've tried every method,
but they don't work,

398
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,900
you should go back to
the right person, shouldn't you?

399
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,420
Being a consultant, a brother,

400
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,100
and a friend.

401
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,100
If you could be my boyfriend as well,
that would be great.
