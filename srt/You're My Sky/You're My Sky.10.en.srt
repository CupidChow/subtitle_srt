Woah. That's Japan.

there is no mini pancake roll in Japan.

70
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,170
Yeah.

71
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,850
He practices all day.

72
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,850
When I woke up,
I couldn't find him anymore.

73
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,820
And when I asked him about what happened
in the club, he didn't want to answer.

74
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,650
So, I dare not to ask him now.

75
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,300
Have you told him about this?

76
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,180
He might be adjusting himself.

77
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,870
Besides, he is still considerate of you.

78
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,450
Your leg still hasn't been fully recovered.

79
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,300
To talk about basketball,
it should be a bit awkward.

80
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,580
Otherwise,why you don't talk with him about
the Chayakorn basketball team.

81
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,860
Fa maybe dare to talk with you
about this topic rather than the club.

82
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,380
Next week, Coach Big will call us back to practice.

83
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,040
I think I will go there to practice.

84
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,600
What do you think?

85
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,360
Fa.

86
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,900
Fa.

87
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,900
Hmm. What did you say?

88
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,790
Does the club train you too hard?

89
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,340
Not only you come back late,

90
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,720
you also have to go practice so early.

91
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,380
Just tell me anything.

92
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,890
I want to listen.

93
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,460
The coach will announce
the selected 12 players soon.

94
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,790
During this time, everyone has to
practice harder than before.

95
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,570
Especially when I am a new kid,

96
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,870
I must be the first one to come practice
and the last one to go back home.

97
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,250
The day before, Champ got a fever.

98
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,700
Really?

99
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,120
There is something I can't refuse to do.

100
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,540
Otherwise, I definitely
won't be the selected one.

101
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,370
They are all national team players there.

102
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:07,950
Umm.

103
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,280
Hey! The other day, I saw in
the basketball chat group.

104
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,480
Will Coach Big call us back to practice?

105
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,080
Yes, he will.

106
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,760
Don't go yet, Torn.

107
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,810
Wait for the leg to be fully recovered.

108
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,600
Okay?

109
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,420
Okay.

110
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,560
(Be blooming)

111
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,100
Huh? People who
practiced all went back home.

112
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,100
Why people who didn't practice
haven't gone back home yet?

113
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,710
Today, I will have dinner with Fa
at the restaurant behind the university.

114
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,840
Is it normal for the club
to practice hard like this, Coach?

115
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,380
Fa comes back so late every day.

116
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,210
I hardly see him.

117
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,620
Athletes, if they want to go far,
practicing hard is a normal thing.

118
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,820
I want to go back and practice sometime.

119
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,770
Ten months, it's not that long.

120
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,000
It's been over a month now. See?

121
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,000
If you come back to play too fast, it's risky.

122
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,490
But if I'm willing to take that risk?

123
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,980
I won't let you do that.

124
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,180
There is some coach
who doesn't listen to the doctor,

125
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,910
and trains the athletes
before the doctor allows them.

126
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,660
But in the end, if that athlete gets injured,

127
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,240
how much can that coach
be responsible for that consequence?

128
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,580
Finally, there will be only you
who will regret about it.

129
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,040
That athlete, how many months did he take
to come back to play, coach?

130
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,280
You know it, right?
I will finally manage to find an answer.

131
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,670
Seven months after the surgery,
he could enter the field normally.

132
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,760
But you know what? The coach who
trained him is Coach Tuan.

133
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,780
That's why I told you not to do that.

134
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,780
I'm going.

135
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,460
Please turn off the light for me.

136
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:17,920
Okay.

137
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,100
Here we are. Let's see our conditions.
I can't do this anymore.

138
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,900
I'm so tired.

139
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,160
(Straight face)

140
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,040
Bro.

141
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,570
Where are you now?

142
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,100
I haven't finished practicing yet.
The restaurant is almost closed.

143
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,000
Are you okay if I change the plan to
take it home and eat in the room instead?

144
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,040
Alright.

145
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,880
I'll order and take it home for you.

146
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,580
What time will you finish?

147
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,540
Can I text you again? I'm not sure yet.

148
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,580
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,900
It's okay.

150
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,810
Keep practicing.

151
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,820
See you at our room.

152
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,860
Let's take a photo.

153
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,940
Bring yourself here first.

154
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,700
You look terrible. Do you know that?

155
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,140
Apply a lot of it.
Your face will be more brightening.

156
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,610
If I'm getting more handsome,

157
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,610
won't you be jealous?

158
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,980
Thank you, Torn.

159
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,830
And…

160
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,960
Sorry about today.

161
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,300
- Bro.
- Huh?

162
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,260
Today I heard that there is someone who can
be fully recovered within seven months.

163
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,900
Umm.

164
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,380
Should I make a call and consult with him?

165
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,660
He might have some good advice.

166
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,990
Alright.

167
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,830
Who?

168
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,420
Coach Tuan.

169
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,610
Actually, I…

170
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,400
have already contacted the athlete
who has gotten a torn ligament.

171
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,340
He said he could come back this fast,

172
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,940
because Coach Tuan
helped him do physical therapy.

173
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,270
Are you serious?

174
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:16,980
Can I?

175
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:21,940
Umm.

176
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,070
You can say it.

177
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,930
I want to hear your opinion.

178
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,380
If you want me to speak, I will.

179
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,480
I don't want you to be with Coach Tuan.

180
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,820
Even we knew the truth that he didn't cheat,

181
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,540
but the way of he thinks, he practices,
he's still the same.

182
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,980
Is there no other way?

183
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,780
If that's so, I'll have to wait for ten months.

184
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,570
I understand.

185
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,190
I'll try to find another way.

186
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,170
I just want to come back and play
with you as fast as possible.

187
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,820
Let's drink together.

188
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,440
I'm not thirsty.

189
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,670
Why do you keep hiding your face lately?

190
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,540
(Are you home yet?)

191
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:53,980
At the pool,

192
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,360
I saw it.

193
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,540
Why is Dome so mean?

194
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,800
He never told me why we broke up.

195
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,780
Do you know?

196
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,250
I keep asking myself over and over again.

197
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,330
Have I done something wrong?

198
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,640
I just came to know

199
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,500
that I didn't do anything wrong.

200
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,680
He just wasn't into me.

201
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:41,920
Sister.

202
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,580
- The thing is…
- I used to tell Dome that

203
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,600
if he met the right person

204
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,420
he could go anytime.

205
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,460
But when it really happened,

206
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,280
I was completely at a loss.

207
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,670
Before I broke up with Dome,

208
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,420
- have you and Dome ever...
- Never.

209
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,620
That was the one and
only time we've done it.

210
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,570
I'm just wondering

211
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,290
that everything in the past,

212
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,100
was it true?

213
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,340
Was there any love, or not?

214
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,100
Fa.

215
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,990
Fa.

216
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,300
(Incoming call)

217
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,020
Hey! Are you sleeping?

218
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,860
Hey.

219
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,500
It's me, Torn.

220
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,440
Fa is sick.

221
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,500
Please tell the coach for him, bro. He might
not be able to go practice in the morning.

222
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,690
For the evening practice, I will tell you again.

223
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,130
Oh. That's alright.

224
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,090
The morning practice, there is
only me and him. Not the whole team.

225
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,310
Uh-huh.

226
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,480
Normally, how do you guys practice?

227
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,480
Gee, Fa has gotten so much better.

228
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,710
He's able to rebound every time.

229
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,710
So freaking awesome!

230
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,050
How is Fa at the club?

231
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,420
Why? Just practice. The same as usual.

232
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,530
Hey, Torn. Can I say something?

233
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,610
I understand

234
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,090
if you're uncomfortable
about me practicing with Fa.

235
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,120
But what would you have me do?

236
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,570
Don't you want to see Fa getting better?

237
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,260
He really wants to be the selected one
among the twelve players. You knew it.

238
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,700
To be honest,

239
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,540
Fa is having a hard time as well.

240
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,700
On one hand, he'd like to go as far as possible,

241
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,780
but on the other hand,
he is afraid that he will have to leave you.

242
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,180
I don't know that how are you guys doing now?

243
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,960
But I think you better
try talking with him first.

244
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,170
Let's not give each other more worries.

245
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,970
Thanks, bro.

246
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,700
- What time is it?
- Just take some rest.

247
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,620
I already told Chain
that you were not feeling well.

248
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,880
If I did something
that make you uncomfortable,

249
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,760
I'm sorry.

250
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,190
If you want to be
one of the selected 12,

251
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,190
or want to play with Chain,

252
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,190
just go for it.

253
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,060
Torn.

254
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:45,180
Between me and Chain,
there is really nothing.

255
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,190
I know.

256
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,440
So, I just don't want you to be worried.

257
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:58,880
I just…

258
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,020
want to know

259
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,530
what do you do in every day?
How do you practice?

260
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,900
I just want to talk with you.

261
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,180
Because I miss you.

262
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,460
I'm sorry.

263
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,660
From now on, if there is
anything, I'll tell you first.

264
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,900
And on any given day, if
you need me, just tell me.

265
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,080
I will reserve my time for you.

266
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,760
Sounds good?

267
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,240
Aai's farewell party
will be the first reservation.

268
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,780
No surprise. Did you forget it?

269
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,780
On Songkran day.

270
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,320
What should we buy for Aai?

271
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,580
Can you help me think? I'll go buy it for you.

272
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,580
Look.

273
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,190
About Aai's gift.

274
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,190
I'll handle it.

275
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,580
Can I trust you?

276
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,380
Of course.

277
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,020
I promise.

278
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,080
Your hand is cool.

279
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,000
Can you give me a full body hug?

280
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,240
You're crazy.

281
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,620
We'll both catch a fever.

282
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,060
Take some rest.

283
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,120
Bro.

284
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,550
(Aai, the Manly Man, will go to Japan soon.)

285
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,060
What do you think? Surprised?

286
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,440
Your farewell party,
I invited everyone myself.

287
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,120
What's wrong, bro?

288
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,120
Saen.

289
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,760
I'm not going to Japan anymore.

290
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,760
I already told professor Wiroj.

291
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,300
There is a faculty's scholarship
that I can pursue a Doctoral degree,

292
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,680
and become a professor here as well.

293
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,490
I'd rather take that scholarship.

294
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,300
What's wrong?

295
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,530
Hey, Saen. Talk to me.

296
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,160
It's possible, bro.

297
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,820
That long distance relationship.

298
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,380
You can do it, but I don't know
whether I can do it or not.

299
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,310
It's not just a month or two.

300
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,510
If I take this scholarship,
not only I can further my studying.

301
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,750
But...

302
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,460
I also can be with you here
as well. Isn't that good?

303
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,630
So, you really don't regret it,
do you? If you don't go…

304
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,680
If I go, and I have to break up
with you, will you regret it?

305
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,460
Here we are!

306
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,940
- Hi, mate.
- Looks good.

307
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,060
May I help you set the table?

308
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,340
- Come on, I'll help you.
- God, they look delicious.

309
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,180
Oh, Vee, come on!
I thought you wouldn't come.

310
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,810
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, sit.

311
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,740
Looks delicious.

312
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,060
- This big piece is mine.
- Eat more.

313
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,260
This one is mine.

314
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,900
Looks so yummy.

315
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,860
Would you like some vegetables, bro?

316
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,220
Yes.

317
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,460
I'm going to boil some pork.
No place for it now.

318
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,100
Care whom, bro?

319
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,500
- 'Carrot'.
- Ha!

320
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,820
Right, where is Fa?
Has he finished practicing yet?

321
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,420
Oh, yeah. I'll check him.

322
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,420
Yeah, you'd better call him here.

323
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,740
Here.

324
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:14,780
Chain. I won't practice late today.
I'm going to have a dinner with my friends.

325
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,040
Hey, you.

326
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,280
Today, Jib told us that the coach will
announce the selected players.

327
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,020
Coach, I'll go back first. Evening.

328
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,660
But I can't break the promise with Torn again.

329
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:42,420
Honestly, I think you can go.

330
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,420
You will be selected anyway.

331
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,660
You don't practice late for just one day,

332
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,660
the coach wouldn't take your name
off from the selected player list.

333
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,690
Well, that's enough for today. New kids,
continue to practice 300 more balls. Go.

334
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,260
Practice.

335
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,800
What time did you make
an appointment with him?

336
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,800
Right now.

337
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,500
Fa, Chain. Practice.

338
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,010
Aai.

339
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,980
I'll give mine to you later. It's with Fa.

340
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:36,080
(We made it.)

341
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:41,980
(Great job. Duo.)

342
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:58,500
(I will go in no time
because you are my heart.)

343
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,260
Hey! Fa.

344
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,580
Do you come to clean up the place?

345
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,920
Sorry, the practice finished late.

346
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,340
(Fa. You have got into the selected 12!)

347
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,420
(Congratsss.)

348
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,820
(Freaking awesome.)

349
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,260
(You've gone too far.
I can't catch you up anymore.)

350
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,840
What about Aai's gift?

351
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,940
Hey.

352
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,940
Where should I keep it?

353
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,440
Under the stairs.

354
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,770
Here. Drink this.

355
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,740
Saen. Oops!

356
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,760
I'm sorry.

357
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,540
Wait a minute, I'll get you a tissue paper.

358
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,900
It's okay, bro. I'd better go wash it now.

359
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,320
Congratulations.

360
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,530
I think I'll call Coach Tuan.

361
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,740
Don't you really wait?

362
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,100
It's just a few more months.

363
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,220
If that day comes, maybe I still
can't play normally as before.

364
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,740
The doctor hasn't confirmed anything yet.

365
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,740
Whether it will come back
to the way it was, or not.

366
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,400
I'll try doing something anyway.

367
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,440
It's better than doing nothing.

368
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,840
Is there anything I can do for you?

369
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,000
You don't even have time for me at all.
So, what else you can do?

370
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,220
Coach Tuan's way

371
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,340
will make you have no one left around.

372
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
I never left anyone.

373
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:45,820
If one day, I'll have no one left,
it's probably because they leave me.

374
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,820
What's wrong?

375
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,300
Pan already knew it.

376
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,410
She saw us

377
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,760
at the resort's swimming pool.

378
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,440
Are we doing the right thing, bro?

379
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,280
If it's right,

380
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,680
why do we have to keep hiding?

381

We did our best.

382
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,980
Maybe, we just have to wait
for people to forget about it.

383
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,280
Nobody will forget

384
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,540
that I and my sister
share the same boyfriend.

385

looking at my sister's face,

I'm still too ashamed to do that.
