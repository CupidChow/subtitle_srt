I didn't blame anyone.

I think I'm not okay.

Can I come back to play with you guys?

62
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,660
No worries. I'm good, bro.

63
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,620
You should go to talk with the others.

64
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,940
I would be happy to speak for you.

65
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,760
I'm the one who did it.

66
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,820
You should not be the one to apologize.

67
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,680
Thank you very much, bro.

68
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,960
Do you feel better now?

69
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,240
Well, I'll go change my clothes.

71

(Like I said, you were in the wrong team.
Leave your team, and join my club.)

72
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,980
(Torn: Sorry, Coach. I might
not really fit in with your team.)

73
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,900
Hi. Sumimasen. Sayonara. Arigato.

74
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,160
What's wrong with you?

75
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,980
Well, my boyfriend speaks Japanese,

76
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,980
I need to practice speaking
some Japanese as well.

77
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,170
Hey, are you in your room?

78
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,020
Why are you asking, bro?

79
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,820
There will be something delivered to you.
Please wait to receive it.

80
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,900
Wow. Now, you know how to surprise.

81
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,110
That's so cute.

82
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,140
But there is no way you can be
good at surprise as good as I can.

83
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,340
I know, give me some time to practice.

84
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,940
Just wait to receive it. That's all.

85
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,900
How was it? My surprise?

86
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,900
Good enough?

87
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,500
How did you come?

88
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,100
I flew.

89
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,180
So, why didn't you tell me first?

90
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,680
If I told you before, it wasn't a surprise.

91
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,580
I'm sorry, I guess you're not very happy...

92
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,220
Hey!

93
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,180
I had a slow response.
I just realized I had to hug,

94
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,700
and just realized that
I must kiss your cheek.

95
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,830
Didn't you say you couldn't
come to my commencement?

96
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,980
I just finished all my works.

97
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,980
But I can stay here for a moment,
then I have to go.

98
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,760
Huh? Where are you going to stay tonight?

99
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,110
You had returned your dorm, hadn't you?

100
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,110
Or you'll go home?

101
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,050
Well,

102
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,620
I've planned to collect my things,
and come to sleep here. Can I?

103
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,050
Of course.

104
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,860
But I charge for rent.

105
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,860
One night, one kiss. Is that too expensive?

106
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,520
Too expensive. I can't afford it.

107
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,940
I'm almost not your boyfriend anymore.

108
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,640
We're almost siblings.

109
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,020
We're almost not lovers anymore.

110
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,700
Here, the rent.

111
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,320
The rent for my second night.

112
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,220
Ah. I forgot.

113
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,630
"There are also water
and electricity bills here."

114
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,100
- Woo!
- Ouch!

115
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,540
Don't move!

116
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,420
Ouch! Ouch!

117
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,040
Vee!

118
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,430
Please come to take a look
for me whether this is okay,

119
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,120
or this one better?

120
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,240
Um.

121
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,780
This is much cheaper than
hiring a makeup artist.

122
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,900
Not only I have to pay for a graduation gown,
I also have to hire a camera man.

123
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,420
I'm so excited.

124
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,840
Tomorrow is my last day
for going to the faculty.

125
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,710
Come here.

126
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,200
Come over here.

127
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,780
It's been a long time.

128
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,240
Do you still like him?

129
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,850
I don't know,

130
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,750
but I can't stop thinking about him.

131
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,760
It's been several months already.

132
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,780
I still can see you sitting sad.

133
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,380
You should go to talk with Dome tomorrow.

134
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,580
No. What do you want me to talk about?

135
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,500
I don't know either.

136
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,740
But will you keep being like this?

137
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,220
Tomorrow is the last day.

138
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,940
Stop feeling guilty.

139
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,940
Just do whatever you want to do.

140
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,320
I know that you love me.
I know you feel guilty.

141
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,940
But you already tried cutting him out,
and tried talking with someone else.

142
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,060
It's been a long time.

143
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,620
If you've tried every method,
but they don't work,

144
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,740
you should go back to
the right person, shouldn't you?

145
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,740
(Alarm)

146
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,620
Wake up.

147
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,870
It's five o'clock.

148
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,680
Wake up!

149
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
I still don't want to wake up.

150
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,900
Can I sleep a little bit more?

151
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,740
It's five o'clock, Fa.

152
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,980
Umm.

153
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,180
I already told you not to do it last night.

154
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,020
See?

155
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,180
Now, you are too lazy to get up.

156
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,020
Go take a shower!

157
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,180
Hm. I will. Let me sleep a little more.

158
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,980
Go!

159
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,460
Go take a shower.

160
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,780
Ow!

161
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,420
Go take a shower!

162
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,310
- Alright.
- Go!

163
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,030
It's the last day of your university life.

164
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,690
How do you feel?

165
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,690
I'm a little bit shocked.

166
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,470
I'll go to the basement for the last day.

167
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,780
Do you think will we
be in the same team again?

168
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't know.

169
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,000
Maybe.

170
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,360
Or two of us could be separated.

171
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,020
But you knew that?

172
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,320
Playing with you makes me feel the happiest.

173
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,480
Me too.

174
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,690
I might meet someone
who plays better than you.

175
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,740
Like you met Chain.

176
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,500
But...

177
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,130
I think it is not the same.

178
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,180
Playing with someone else,

179
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,260
I just think, I will help the team
to get the gold medal.

180
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,350
But playing with you...

181
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,420
When I am in the court,

182
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,290
I feel that

183
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,740
there is nothing to fear anymore.

184
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,080
All these times,

185
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,060
it had been such a mess.

186
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,770
And, now, I'm not used to with

187
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,280
this.

188
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,280
Well, two of us.

189
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,850
Yeah.

190
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,820
But I've thought for a while.

191
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,010
The two of us, let's make it more officially.

192
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,020
Torn.

193
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,270
Thank you very much

194
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,680
that you came into Chayakorn.

195
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,680
You're like everything to me.

196
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,300
You're my consultant, my brother, and my friend.

197
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,020
But I think…

198
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,470
If you could be my boyfriend as well,
it would be great.

199
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,800
What do you say?

200
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,100
Go, or no go?

201
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,280
If I am everything to you like this,

202
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,050
being one more thing
probably doesn't matter.

203
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,080
I must ''Go".

204
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,760
Fa, can I take a picture with you?

205
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,540
Sure.

206
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,820
Congratulations.

207
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
Thank you.

208
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,820
Did Pete forget that he had to come here
and take a picture with us?

209
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,700
Tupbok, please go follow Pete for me.

210
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,100
Roger!

211
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,380
Bro.

212
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,340
The basketball team
started asking for you.

213
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,700
Okay, just wait for Pete to
take a picture with us, then we'll go.

214
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,220
Are you guys going to take
a group photo without me?

215
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:34,890
Hey!

216
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,700
- Aai!
- Aai.

217
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,600
Aai!

218
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,540
You jerk, didn't you
tell me you couldn't come?

219
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,020
Your IG story
this morning is still in Japan.

220
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,040
I just posted those things to fool you guys.
I freaking miss you.

221
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,500
Yeah. I miss you, too.

222
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,220
I think you might miss your boyfriend more.

223
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,260
There are still some hickeys on your neck.

224
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,660
What? Really?

225
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,620
Ha! I got you man.

226
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,120
- Seriously?
- Really?

227
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,100
Is it last night, bro?

228
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,300
- Hey!
- Tsk!

229
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,700
Yo, Aai. Do you also come here?

230
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,280
I freaking miss you.

231
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,660
Where have you been for so long, Pete?

232
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,620
He might have been waiting
in line to take photos with Vee.

233
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,560
The line is so long.

234
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,420
Hey, let's go take a picture.

235
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,180
- Yeah. Let's go.
- Let's go take a picture.

236
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,100
- Hey, Dome! Let's take a picture.
- Tupbok, please help us take some pictures.

237
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,030
Okay.

238
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,540
Dome, come here.

239
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,540
Aai, come here.

240
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,300
- Come on, come on.
- Come.

241
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,340
Is this alright, Tupbok?

242
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,780
Hey, bend your knee a bit for me.

243
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,180
Alright, ready?

244
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,780
One. Two. Three.

245
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,340
Torn, Saen, Come here.

246
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,380
Come on.

247
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,660
Hey, bend your knee a bit.

248
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,740
- Stand close to him a bit.
- Closer.

249
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,260
- Go over there.
- Closer.

250
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,260
- Closer.
- Move a little closer.

251
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,380
Closer.

252
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,500
One. Two. Three.

253
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,160
Come on, ready?

254
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,580
One. Two. Three.

255
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,420
I just know that taking
a graduation photo is so freaking tiring.

256
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,090
- Want to eat some?
- Um.

257
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,070
Woahh!

258
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,020
Do you want to eat some? I'll feed you.

259
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,660
Please, just one bite.

260
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,260
- Hey, just one bite.
- Just one.

261
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,260
Please?

262
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,300
Um.

263
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,060
Aww.

264
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,540
What?

265
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,860
Stay still.

266
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,860
- So fierce.
- Um.

267
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,670
Dome, do you want some?

268
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,060
Hey, hey! You cannot!

269
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,500
Sorry, sorry.

270
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,940
It can't be.

271
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,140
When will I be with you
all together like this again?

272
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,860
Hey, don't start! Pete will cry.

273
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,940
Hey, you guys. I'm going
to apply for a flight attendant.

274
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,820
What?

275
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,960
Yeah.

276
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,960
I don't like our career path that much.

277
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,930
When I applied for this faculty, I chose it
because I wanted to follow you guys.

278
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,670
But to let me stay with this path forever,

279
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,240
I don’t think I can make it.

280
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,260
Dang! Here he come.

281
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,780
Aeronautical science?

282
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,180
What about you, Dome?

283
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,060
What's next? Go back
to work in your family business?

284
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,490
I think so.

285
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,630
Just being childish so that I could come to
study here with you, I was very fortunate.

286
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,820
Are you going to play
for the club in the long run?

287
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,820
I hope so.

288
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,460
I can't figure out
what else do I want to do.

289
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,740
Yeah. That's great.

290
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,120
At first, I thought that
when you guys graduated,

291
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,860
you will meet each other often,
and then I'll be in the doghouse.

292
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,940
But now, it seems that each of you guys
will live in different worlds like me.

293
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,940
Hoy, Aai.

294
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,300
You live in Japan, your life is the best.

295
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,060
- Yeah.
- Why do you have to curse us?

296
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,460
Not at all. I'm so lonely.

297
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,260
Please text something in the group
when you guys are free.

298
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,380
I keep calling Saen till he annoys me.

299
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,580
Alright.

300
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,980
You're so good.
You were still lonely at first,

301
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,540
but in the end, you just wanted
to show your boyfriend off.

302
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,120
You jerk.

303
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,100
Already?

304
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,680
Do you guys have to go?

305
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,750
Yeah. Sorry.
I have to go meet the basketball team.

306
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,900
Well, I have to go now, too.

307
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,420
Yeah. Me too.
I have to go meet my friend, too.

308
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,080
Okay, dismiss. We'll see each other in
our gang meeting next time.

309
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,020
You guys.

310
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,820
Before we go, let's take a picture.

311
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,940
- Alright
- Yeah, Okay.

312
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,660
Come on.

313
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,310
One, two, three.

314
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,820
We're going.

315
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,860
- See you.
- See you.

316
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,700
- See you.
- See you, bro. Bye.

317
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,900
- Will you be alright?
- I will.

318
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,340
- Are you sure?
- See you.

319
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,380
Will you be alright?

320
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,200
Dome.

321
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:44,460
Dome.

322
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,140
Let's take a photo together.

323
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,580
One, two, three.

324
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,820
- That's beautiful. Thank you.
- Thank you.

325
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,890
Well, Dome.

326
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,580
How is it going with Vee?

327
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,370
We didn't talk at all.

328
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,660
Um. I know.

329
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,740
I'm not angry with you anymore. You know that?

330
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,700
Well,

331
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,080
I don't want to be nosy,

332
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:41,820
but I think...

333
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,470
my brother still can't forget about you.

334
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,980
Could you go to talk with him?

335
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,700
Today is the last day.

336
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,260
Don't end up like this.

337
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,420
I feel pity for my brother.

338
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,660
Hey. What's up, you two?

339
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,140
- Hi, Coach.
- Hello.

340
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,750
Congratulations.

341
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,760
Your next step is do your best
with whatever path you chose. Okay?

342
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,020
Thank you, coach,

343
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,340
for saying yes to take
care of our team that day.

344
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,660
No need to thank you. I was so very happy.

345
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,300
And two of you are really good at it.

346
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,220
It's just only a year but you guys
have come this far. That's fantastic.

347
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,320
What is your plan in the future?

348
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,220
I would go back to play
with our team as before.

349
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,300
So, shall we go back and get a gold medal in
Sports Science Confederation again?

350
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,140
Will you still be a coach for our team?

351
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,740
Of course. You guys have been
practicing this much, how can I leave you?

352
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:10,100
Well, I have to go now. See you
at the basketball court. Okay?

353
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,300
- Okay, Coach.
- Okay.

354
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,980
Okay.

355
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,290
Alright, let's go.

356
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,420
Hello.

357
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,580
Are you Thoranin?

358
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,060
Yes.

359
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,300
I contacted you on behalf of
Bangkok Phoenix Club.

360
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,540
Well, our coach saw your performance
in Thai League and was interested in you.

361
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,450
So, we would like to invite you
to the club's audition.

362
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,150
I don't know whether
you're interested or not.

363
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,700
Yes, I am. Okay. I will go.

364
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,980
Okay. Okay.

365
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,320
Thank you.

366
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,380
Did you know it all along?

367
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,580
Congratulations.

368
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,140
Please come back and play together.

369
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,060
No matter what, my team must have you.

370
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,650
Alright.

371
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,820
Partner.

372
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,380
Thank you, Vee.

373
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,260
Can we talk now?

374
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,060
How are you?

375
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,580
So so.

376
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,880
Well, don't you play Running Club anymore?

377
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,860
Yeah.

378
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,170
I deleted it.

379
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,260
Congratulations on your graduating.

380
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,700
I don't know what to give you.

381
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,420
I only know a few of your favorite foods,

382
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,820
so I bought them.

383
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,180
Sorry.

384
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,670
Since the incident, I haven't
really apologized to you yet.

385
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,730
You weren't wrong.

386
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,920
You just felt it.

387
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,560
Right person, wrong time.

388
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:46,140
Do you think, is there any chance of being
the right person at the right time?

389
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,970
If there is not, it's okay.

390
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,420
Are you still waiting?

391
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,340
Will you tell me stop waiting?

392
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,830
I don't know, bro.

393
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,730
Do you still have some feeling for me?

394
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,260
So, it's still the same.
I will wait until you tell me to stop.

395
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,180
Woah.

396
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,220
Let's see what did you buy?

397
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,760
A lot.

398
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,540
Have you eaten
anything since this morning?

399
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,860
Not yet. So hungry.

400
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,060
What?

401
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,360
I came back to Thailand to surprise you,

402
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,770
but you just gave this to me?

403
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,910
You lose.

404
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,100
Calm down, bro.
This is just a graduation gift.

405
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,460
But the real gift is here.

406
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:56,980
Are you joking me?

407
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,900
I'm not joking. Open it.

408
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:09,940
That's lame.

409
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,980
No, bro. Unfold the paper first.

410
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,140
This school break, I don't have any plans.

411
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,660
I want to ask you if I could go to see New
Year's Eve fireworks over there with you?

412
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,460
You can come anytime.

413
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:50,940
I'm sorry.

414
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,300
I'm not very good at speaking.

415
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,380
Just tell me you love me, that's enough.

416
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,620
I love you.

417
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,060
I love you, too.

418
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,600
Can you stay with me
like this for a long time?

419
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,700
I'm going. See you everyone. Bye-bye.

420
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,700
- Goodbye.
- See you at the basement.

421
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,200
- Congratulations.
- Goodbye, coach.

422
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,940
Take a picture or video?

423
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,420
See. It can do both at the same time.

424
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,500
Yeah, it's so clear.

425
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,200
Take this one,

426
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,770
and then this.

427
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,820
Alright! How? How?

428

(Your arrival brings us joy,
your departure leaves us good memory.)

429
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,700
Oh oh! The crowds are overwhelming.
The juniors are all waiting here.

430
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,700
But the seniors have not yet to come.

431
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,700
This was very sad.

432
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,900
If you guys haven't come yet,
I will sing a song right now.

So hard, so hard. There is someone
hit my back so hard. Who did that?

461

Who?

462
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,900
Ah, let's review our memories
throughout these four years.

463
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:33,320
But, but...
Some people are seven years.

Okay. Next.

471
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,620

the seniors, they will be like,
order the juniors, right?

- Yeah!
- They loved it!

481
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,060
This time, this time is our turn!

482
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:41,420
Alright. What should I order?
The seniors must do whatever I order.

483
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,040
So, what are we waiting for? Well, ready?
