00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,290
That trick?

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,990
Alright, I'll show you.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,450
It won't work
because you avoid my eye contact.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,410
What is it?

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,990
It is my name.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,750
But if we include what in parentheses,

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,370
it means you.

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,990
We're not gonna play basketball,
we change the direction to our expertise.

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,040
I won the game.

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,620
I think I'll get back
to my morning practice.

Oh!

33
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,770
I thought you'd never come.

34
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,870
I was gonna call you this morning.

35
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,580
But I wasn't sure if you were asleep.

36
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,750
Actually, I was sleeping.

37
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,000
But feel free to call.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,580
In case I oversleep.

Same?

40
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,910
Slightly more.

41
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,620
Show off!

42
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,870
Tell me how much you want.

43
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,450
I think we know each other too well.

44
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,360
Enough already.

45
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,760
One more try.

46
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,330
Come at me, Torn.

47
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,120
Ready?

48
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,410
Are you hurt?

49
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,040
You fell so hard.

50
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,450
No. I'm okay.

51
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,700
We really know each other too well.

52
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,360
Right.

53
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,700
Why are you smiling?

54
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,160
Nothing.

55
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,620
It just...

56
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,990
feels good.

57
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,870
That's why I told you to get back.

58
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,830

This week is Cheer-Book Signing Veek.

63
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,200
If I went up there,
that brat would do something.

64
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,990
So let Pete do it.

65
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,120
Ah, poor kid.

- I don't want you to feel forced.

(Poker Face Fa)

70
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,660
When I was in my first year here,
I had to put three times more papers.

71
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,160
Now, let's begin.

72
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,620
Can I have your autograph?

73
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,790
How do you handle your study?

74
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,080
It's okay.

75
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,120
Okay, right?

76
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,200
For those who have children at home,
you can adopt our theory.

77
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,830
In the community which
includes some children in the habitat,

78
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,160
it is necessary
to provide a safe space for children.

79
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,250
For example,
use sand as a playground surface,

80
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:02,660
or avoid hard and sharp objects
including edges and corners.

81
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,290
Because it might be harmful due to...

82
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,410
Where are you? It's nearly our turn.

83
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,870
Aai, I have some problems.

84
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,830
Can you ask the professor
to put us as the last group?

85
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,790
What have you been doing?

86
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,910
Whoever has children at home
can apply our method

87
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,250
- in the community.
- Fine! I'll talk to him.

88
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,260
We're done with our presentation today.

Okay, next, please.

92
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,580
May I do the presentation
later, professor?

93
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,200
We're not ready.

94
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,900
Oh, is Saen being late?

95
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,200
So, who is next to Aai?

96
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,950
Are you ready?

97
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,910
I've never said "not ready"
before in my entire life.

98

Where are you?

99
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,290
I'm on my way.

100
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,000
I give you 15 minutes.

The information about
senior-friendly communities.

102
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,990
They should have
easily accessible areas for elders.

103
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,420
The floor should be level,
with no stairs or as few as possible.

104
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,540
Saen!

105
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,540
The last one is about to
do the presentation.

106
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,830
If you don't take the class seriously,
and weigh me down,

107
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,990
do me a favor.

108
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,540
Drop this class!

109
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:09,330

for elders is very important.

I don't know if you get hit by a car
and die or break your leg,

but you have to come now.

115
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,980
Don't be a burden.

116
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,630
So, Aai?

117

Saen is not here yet?

118
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,000
May I do the presentation alone?

119
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,280
What?

120
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,950
What have you done
to be in this condition, Saen?

121
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,040
An accident at soccer practice, sir.

Is it him?

Okay, let's begin now.

144

Today, we're going to start
with the sprinting drill.

145
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,330
How many laps, coach?

Come on, faster! Go!

149

The reason why I'm coaching here,

150
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,120
is a gold medal from
the Sports Science Confederation match,

151
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,080
which is a sports event between faculties
of Sports Science from all over the country.

152

And this year it will be held
by Saint-Belon University,

I hold a basketball tryout,

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,910
- Hey. Are you okay?
- Huh?

159
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,370
Okay, okay.

160
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,950
- Aright?
- Alright.

161
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,700
Those who cannot meet the standard

162
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,500
need to work harder.

163

Surpass your limitation.

Asking help from an experienced teammate

also helps, Tupbok.

Remember, our team will grow together.

169
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,000
Coach bought us some pizzas.

170
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,450
Thank you, coach.

171
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,910
- Go ahead. Enjoy.
- Yes, sir.

172
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,470
Cool.

173
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,910
What's wrong?

174
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,020
Want some drinks?

175
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,280
Here.

176
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,890
Oh, I almost die
from the first-day drill.

177
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,500
You normally
train this hard on the national team?

178
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,500
Even harder.

179
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,500
I actually need a morning practice,

180
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,330
training the dribbling,
crossover and some shooting.

181
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,410
Really?

182
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,580
Well, may I join your morning practice?

183
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,500
Please.

184
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,540
I want to be better quickly.

185
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,290
I promise not to be a burden.

186
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,040
Whatever you say.

187
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,250
Cool.

188
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,830
See you tomorrow.

189
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,450
Here, I'm done with the signing.

190
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,410
Who hasn't signed Torn's cheer-book?

191
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,870
We're all done, Tupbok.

192
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,660
Me.

193
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,660
What you're holding is a cheer-book.

194
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,560
(Poker Face Fa)

195
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,540
Can you do it later?

196
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,130
I need to go.

197
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,140
Here.

198
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,340
Sign this one instead.

199
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,780
(Thanks for your help. My team needs you
to help get on the medal podium again. -Torn)

200
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,000
...feels good.

201
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,660
That's why I told you to get back.

202
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,990
The team needs you.

203
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,610
(Thanks for your help. My team needs you
to help get on the medal podium again.)

204
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,450
One.

205
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,830
But you have to do it for more than
eight seconds to make their heart flutter.

206
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,580
Two.

207
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,660
You always avoid eye contact.
You look away just after a few seconds.

208
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,000
Three.

209
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,630
Four.

210
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,910
Have a staring contest with me.

211
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,870
Come on.

212
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,450
Five.

213
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,950
Six.

214
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,700
Seven.

215
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,250
Eight.

216
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
Hey, bro.

217
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,750
You came?

218
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,580
You two...

219
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,040
are good?

220
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,080
We're good.

221
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,410
Why?

222
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,450
Nothing. It's good.

223
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,790
Ready?

224
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,370
I saw what you did yesterday,
you were awesome.

225
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,120
So cool.

226
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,330
Aren't you sore?

227
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,160
Wow, I'm in dreadful pain.

228
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,000
You want me to go left or right?

229
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,490
Whichever way you want,
but the point is not letting me know.

230
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,790
Darn it, I'm afraid.

231
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,120
You'll know for sure.

232
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,370
Just try it first.

233
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,580
I'll do it.

234
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,450
Jeez, don't be so hard on me.

235
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,990
Whew!

236
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,580
Tired?

237
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,660
So much.

238
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,410
Are you going?

239
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,830
Umm.

240
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,660
I have a class
at eight o'clock tomorrow.

241
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,040
Can you sign my book before you go?

242
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,990
Where's my book?

243
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,160
Where did you leave it?

244
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,250
Your dorm?

245
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,580
I don't remember.

246
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,950
It's alright.

247
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,330
I'll do it when you find your book.

248
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,580
I gotta go.

249
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,040
Bro.

250
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,700
Never mind.

251
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,080
It's nothing.

252
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,000
Here you go.

253
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,540
Boost the protein or you're
gonna lose some muscle mass.

254
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,330
Here.

255
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,580
Torn's book.

256
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,200
Someone found it.

257
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,080
Give it to him.

258
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,160
- Why are you sighing?
- Why are you sighing?

259
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,730
I won't tell you.

260
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,410
I won't if you won't.

261
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,950
It's your call.

262
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,120
But I'm the only person
you can open up to.

263
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,120
Fine.

264
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,430
Darn you.

265
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,000
Fa...

266
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,580
What would you do if you
accidentally verbally hurt someone?

267
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,250
Apologize then.

268
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,910
What would you do?

269
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,330
Laugh?

270
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,290
But if you can't say it to his face,
just text him.

271
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,660
It doesn't sound sincere, does it?

272
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,700
Is there a way to apologize directly to him
without seeing his face?

273
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,950
So call him?

274
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,620
Only voice and you won't see his face.

275
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,370
Dang!

276
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,870
Why is it so hard?

277
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,080
It seems so easy for everybody,

278
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,500
but why is it hard for me to say?

279
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,500
Jeez!

280
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,500
You're right.

281
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,790
It's a shame for my old cheer-book.

282
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,080
Our seniors have signed plenty.

283
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,950
You can tell them you lost it.

284
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,910
But I think,

285
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,140
you're sadder for
your doodle dedicated to Fa.

286
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,000
Do you think I did wrong to Fa?

287
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,660
What?

288
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,100
I can't answer your own question.

289
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,250
You fool.

290
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,410
I can't simply explain.

291
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:34,370
I didn't let him sign my cheer-book or
invite Tupbok to our morning practice.

292
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,290
If I do that to you,

293
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,750
- it will be nothing, right?
- Umm.

294
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,000
But when I did that to Fa,

295
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,660
I feel like...

296
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,370
he felt neglected.

297
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,870
You're so full of yourself.

298
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,950
Dunno.

299
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,450
I might be overthinking.

300
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,410
You can prove it,

301
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,160
if it's just you
or he really felt neglected.

302
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,830
Just do something,

303
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,500
or keep being a sad puppy.

304
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,700
Can I leave you alone?

305
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,040
Chill, dude.

306
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,790
Who wants to sign my book,
he'll come to me.

307
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,790
I just rest here.

308
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,200
So, I'll go.

309
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,330
See you.

310
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,330
See you, dude.

311
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,500
Do you want to go somewhere?

312
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,450
To the bathroom.

313
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,120
Oh.

314
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,990
I need to go to the bathroom as well.

315
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,500
Want me to help carry you?

316
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:39,950
But if you can't say it to his face,
just text him.

317
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,870
It doesn't sound sincere, does it?

318
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:49,660
Is there a way to apologize directly to him
without seeing his face?

319
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,760
Saen, don't come out yet.

320
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,950
The voice clip I sent you this morning,

321
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,200
I didn't mean it.

322
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,500
I thought you overslept.

323
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,720
And I don't like irresponsible people.

324
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,870
That's why I was mad.

325
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,320
And you haven't responded to my text.

326
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,150
Why didn't you tell me
that you hurt your leg?

327
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,040
How about getting scolded for nothing?

328
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,120
Are you done?

329
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,000
So, can I come out?

330
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,700
Yeah, that's...

331
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,620
you know...

332
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,790
So, I forgive you.

333
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,660
I didn't say it yet.

334
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,950
So say it.

335
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,870
Fine.

336
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,120
I'm sorry.

337
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,750
Here.

338
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,910
Can I have your autograph?

339
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,700
Why didn't you tell me about your leg?

340
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,250
I'm not that mean.

341
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,250
Next time, tell me
if something comes up.

342
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,790
Don't be silent like that.

343
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,950
Why were you practicing that much?

344
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,250
Your club makes you come every morning?

345
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,200
Nope.

346
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,370
I do that by myself.

347
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,450
Do you like soccer that much?

348
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,080
As much as I like you.

349
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,250
Saen.

350
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,950
Are you serious?

351
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,660
About me.

352
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,990
If you flirt just for fun,

353
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,580
I'm not having fun with you.

354
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,790
Why do you think I'm just joking around?

355
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,370
I'm dead serious when I say I like you.

356
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,700
And why me?

357
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,410
Last year's Open House,

358
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,080
don't you remember?

359
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,790
When you told us
why you chose Sports Science.

360
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,580
When I watch a game,
I'm always wondering

361
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,040
if there's someone
who takes care of an injured athlete.

362
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,250
- I want to be that person.
- I want to be that person.

363
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,990
Do you still remember what I said?

364
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,200
You told me once,

365
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,060
you athletes just do your training.

366
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,220
And let you do your job of taking care.

367
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,000
I don't know if you remember.

368
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,700
But I still remember.

369
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,790
I was just saying.

370
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,160
Oh, really?

371
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,710
Why?

372
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,160
It's just...

373
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,040
what you said that day

374
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,580
made me want to come here.

375
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,950
In a hope that you'll treat me
like you said.

376
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,290
Come on, I meant when we work.

377
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,580
But each one's on his own
when it comes to study.

378
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,580
So, you do your study,

379
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,910
and the job of taking care of you,

380
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,700
can I take it?

381
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,950
It's already late.

382
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,250
I need to go.

383
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,120
You take yourself home.

384
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:38,950
Aai.

385
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,330
Huh?

386
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,200
Have a sweet dream.

387
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Umm.

388
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,290
I lost the old one.

389
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,000
You can sign this one.

390
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,660
Here.

391
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,040
Someone found it.

392
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,910
So, please sign it.

393
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,450
And tell Tupbok
not to come for the morning practice.

394
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,790
Okay.

395
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,160
So we can have serious training.

396
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,950
Uh-huh.

397
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,000
I hope you and Fa win over that coach.

398
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,790
You're fantastic
but your goal is to be like Fa?

399
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,370
However Fa has a poker face,
he's actually kind.

400
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,870
Communicate more and
you'll understand each other.

401
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,120
But it's even harder with Fa, I Know.

402
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,990
Four years from now on,

403
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,120
I wish you happiness.

404
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,870
If you need some help,

405
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,540
you can ask me for anything.

406
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,040
It'll be my pleasure.

407
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,010
I'll get others' signatures.

408
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,750
Umm.

409
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,910
Is the study hard for a freshman?

410
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,660
Kinda.

411
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,910
Plenty of assignments.

412
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,910
Can I sign sitting next to you?

413
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,470
So? Can you handle it?

414
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,340
It'll get better, I hope.

415
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,180
Hello, Coach Tuan.

416
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,990
Hi, Big.

417
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,990
Am I bothering you?

418
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:12,970
Not at all.

419
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,080
That's good.

420
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,750
I call to congratulate you.

421
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,370
I heard
that you're coaching at Chaiyakorn.

422
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:27,160
We might be up against each other
if you get through the first round.

423
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,160
We might be.

424
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,750
Especially with Tupfa and Tohranin.

425
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:37,620
You've said it yourself,
those two play well together, haven't you?

426
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,700
Good.

427
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,040
Another thing, Big.

428
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,160
Don't accidentally
record a voice clip again,

429
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,040
or...

430
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,200
your annual salary of 15,000
from Chaiyakorn,

431
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,580
you will no longer get it.

432
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,410
Don't worry about that.

433
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,700
But what more to worry about is

434
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:01,330
journalists who are waiting
to interview those two.

435
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:07,660
I don't know when they'll give in
and do the interview.

436
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,830
Uh,

437
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,250
I need to go now.

438
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,330
Bye.

439
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,620
Torn.

440
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,620
Are you up?

441
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,170
Coming for today's practice?

442
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,120
You're up?

443
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,990
Ummm.

444
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,330
You're coming?

445
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,120
Do you want
some fried dough and soy milk?

446
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,750
I can stop by.

447
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,200
This is because of my cheer-book?

448
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,870
No.

449
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,620
Dunno.

450
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,460
Playing with you...

451
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,110
is the best.

452
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,700
So, fried dough and soy milk?

453
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,870
No topping.

454
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,620
I know.

455
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
So,

456
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,670
see you at the court.

457
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,250
Okay.

458
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,830
Adorable.

459
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,860
(I stop being a poker face)

460
00:41:53,130 --> 00:42:00,820
(Let's play basketball
- Fourth-year poker face)

461
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:06,170
(Be always blooming)

462
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:22,300
(Be always blooming)

463
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,750
Is this after you've straightened?

464
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,170
So tense.

465
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,950
How do you behave
when you like someone?

466
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,560
You miss that person,

467
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,120
wanna be with him,
hug and pet his head.

468
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,160
You want the best for him.

469
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,160
Nonsense.

470
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,790
Your theory is wrong.

471
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,640
Cause you do some with Torn.

472
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,080
Bro...

473
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,920
I think we need to stop.
