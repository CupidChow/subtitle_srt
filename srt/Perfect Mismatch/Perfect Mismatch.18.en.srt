My girlfriend.

351
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,650
I can do whatever I want.

352
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,020
Mr. Zhou,

353
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,170
good luck.

354
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,290
See? I told you

355
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,470
we need to be careful at the company.

356
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,300
Why?

357
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,580
You are my girlfriend.

358
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,390
Huahua,

359
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,480
I want to tell Grandpa

360
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,390
that we're seeing each other.

361
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,720
Will you go home with me?

362
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,980
No way.

363
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,800
That's too soon.

364
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,980
How?

365
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,700
Hey,

366
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,750
are you having second thoughts?

367
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,070
Shi Huahua, listen,

368
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,040
you have to be responsible for me.

369
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,950
All right, all right.

370
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,840
I will go home with you.

371
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,560
Then,

372
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,550
let's continue.

373
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,390
Take your medicine first.

374
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,230
About the patent authorization.

375
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,690
Have you thought about it?

376
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,490
Yes.

377
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,920
Go ahead.

378
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,700
What tricks are you playing?

379
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,680
I want your shares of Feiran.

380
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,880
What did you say?

381
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,270
I said I want your shares of Feiran.

382
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,210
You own shares in other companies, too, right?

383
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,760
Give them to me and you can't lose.

384
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,910
Besides, we can exchange shares.

385
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,650
You can take a stake in Xingchen Capital.

386
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,680
Do you think I'm stupid?

387
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,110
Why am I doing this business

388
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,710
if I'm giving my shares of Feiran to you?

389
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,160
The money I make can't get into my pocket anyway.

390
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,760
As far as I know, this deal

391
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,050
doesn't profit for sure.

392
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,710
But it can get you

393
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,800
a position in Zhou Zhifei's heart.

394
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,170
Shi Huahua closed the deal of the Yundian Village project.

395
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,730
What have you done for Zhou Zhifei?

396
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,620
You keep saying that you like him,

397
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,630
but you don't even want to pay such a small price.

398
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,800
Seems your affection is cheap.

399
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,570
No wonder he doesn't care for you.

400
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,780
Stay out of my business.

401
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,660
Zhifei,

402
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,200
Huahua,

403
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,670
aren't you busy at work?

404
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,890
Why did you come home at this time?

405
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,690
Grandpa,

406
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,650
we are here today

407
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,840
to tell you something very important.

408
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,000
Don't be afraid.

409
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,420
No matter what happens,

410
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,110
you have my support.

411
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,120
Grandpa,

412
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,120
Huahua's been our spokesperson

413
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,350
for a while.

414
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,750
You told me not to replace her before.

415
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,750
And I listened to you.

416
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,830
I didn't.

417
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,040
But now…

418
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,370
What?

419
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,510
You're thinking of replacing her again?

420
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,620
-No.
-No.

421
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,310
It's…

422
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,490
I…

423
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,740
Huahua.

424
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,900
It's okay.

425
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,280
I got your back.

426
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,910
Is he bullying you again?

427
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,790
Come here. Come.

428
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,120
No, Grandpa.

429
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,090
Grandpa,

430
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,140
in fact, we are…

431
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:29,770
Chairman,

432
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,210
Zhi'ang is back.

433
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,950
Let him in.

434
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,380
Okay.

435
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,960
Grandpa.

436
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,740
Zhifei, Huahua, you are here, too.

437
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,490
Great.

438
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,380
I took…

439
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,980
Wait a minute.

440
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,270
Xiaoxiao, why didn't you come inside?

441
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,110
Zhi'ang, I can't do it.

442
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,430
I've never met my boyfriend's parents.

443
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,800
Maybe next time.

444
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,140
No way.

445
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,820
Zhifei and Huahua are inside.

446
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,440
We can share the good news

447
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,070
with them.

448
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,390
Zhou Zhifei is here?

449
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,070
Yeah.

450
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,810
Come on.

451
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,550
Don't worry.

452
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,580
I'm here with you.

453
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Wait.

454
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,760
We have to have the right demeanor.

455
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,680
Let's keep a distance.

456
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,260
I'm right behind you.

457
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,700
Grandpa,

458
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,400
this is Xiaoxiao.

459
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,470
Hello, Chairman Zhou.

460
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,750
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

461
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,880
Hello, Huahua.

462
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,730
Have a seat.

463
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,040
Why is Xiaoxiao here?

464
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,690
I don't know.

465
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,720
Take a seat.

466
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,060
Come on.

467
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,430
Be seated.

468
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,170
Sit.

469
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,600
Do you think Xiaoxiao is strange?

470
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,160
She is very strange.

471
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,530
Zhi'ang,

472
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,400
I know

473
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,300
you are not interested in the company's affairs.

474
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,330
Why did you bring Xiaoxiao home today?

475
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,790
Are you

476
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,870
collaborating lately?

477
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,560
Grandpa,

478
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,060
not collaborating.

479
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,040
We're in love.

480
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,310
Xiaoxiao is my girlfriend now.

481
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:27,850
Huahua,

482
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,140
pinch me.

483
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,560
Does it hurt?

484
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:33,930
Yes.

485
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,520
Great, Zhi'ang.

486
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,840
You are bringing me

487
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,260
great news today.

488
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,960
I think if I'm seeing someone,

489
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,790
I should let you know first.

490
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,380
Xiaoxiao,

491
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,350
I thought

492
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,700
you and Zhifei have been

493
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,790
studying and working together

494
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,650
and could make a good couple.

495
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,180
But I didn't expect

496
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,610
you're going out with Zhi'ang.

497
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,590
Good.

498
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,820
Great.

499
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,490
Secretary Zhang, add some good dishes for lunch today.

500
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,130
We're having

501
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,320
a nice family meal.

502
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,130
Sit. Sit.

503
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,820
Right, Zhifei.

504
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,810
What did you want to say just now?

505
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,670
Just some company stuff.

506
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,580
Forget it.

507
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,580
No business talk today.

508
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,460
Zhi'ang, tell me.

509
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:36,500
How did you and Xiaoxiao fall in love?

510
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,360
Mr. Zhou,

511
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,560
you got new packages.

512
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,110
Just let Chi

513
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,600
do these errands.

514
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,430
How could your things be just errands?

515
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,550
Besides,

516
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,190
I'm your vice president now.

517
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,140
It is my duty to take care of you.

518
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,460
Thank you,

519
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,530
Vice President Shi.

520
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,970
Open your packages first.

521
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,990
[Zhou Zhifei]

522
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,340
Did you write this?

523
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,020
You got a lot of packages.

524
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,270
So I thought

525
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,360
if I put a name tag on each one,

526
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,120
the packages won't be taken by mistake

527
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,920
or missed.

528
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,730
Smart, right?

529
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,920
And,

530
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,590
[Zhou Zhifei]

531
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,650
it's for you exclusively.

532
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,830
Exclusively?

533
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,320
Huahua,

534
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,100
[Zhou Zhifei]

535
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,900
you are also exclusive to Zhou Zhifei.

536
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,440
I won't lose you

537
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,230
or

538
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,190
let anyone take you.

539
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,730
[Zhou Zhifei]

540
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,690
Open it.

541
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,990
[Zhou Zhifei]

542
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,940
Xiaoxiao.

543
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,470
Huahua,

544
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,690
why are you smiling?

545
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,930
I'm not.

546
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,910
It's okay. I'll stop asking.

547
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,800
I want Zhifei to sign these for me.

548
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,160
Please take them to him.

549
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:35,720
Okay.

550
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,960
Xiaoxiao, are you going out?

551
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,630
No.

552
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,130
It's more convenient for you to do it, right?

553
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,550
Thanks, Huahua.

554
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,850
You're welcome.

555
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,600
Why didn't she do it herself

556
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,410
but asked you?

557
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,640
Xiaoxiao said it's more convenient for me to do it.

558
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,210
Give me those.

559
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,550
I have to talk to her about something.

560
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,290
Okay.

561
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,050
Huahua,

562
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,680
good news just came in.

563
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,620
Look.

564
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,120
The water plant we invested in Yundian Village

565
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,000
was approved,

566
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,600
and all the qualifications for the elementary school

567
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,450
have also been completed.

568
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,880
We'll hold a press conference

569
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,350
before the construction begins

570
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,680
The village chief and Erniu will be there.

571
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,070
Aren't you worried about

572
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,790
the children in the village?

573
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,540
Now you can rest assured.

574
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,600
Zhou Zhifei, you're awesome!

575
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,110
You did a good thing, you know?

576
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,760
You've been helping Feiran Group and me.

577
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,360
Hello, Shen Jun.

578
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,870
I agree to the offer you made yesterday.
