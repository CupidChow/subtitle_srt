5
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,580
It's been a long day, Mr. Zhou.

6
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,590
We have fine water here,

7
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,830
but the distance is a bit long,

8
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,800
so it may take some effort to get there.

9
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,120
By the way, Mr. Zhou,

10
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,050
our Yundian Village

11
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,880
not only has high quality water, but also good tea.

12
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,520
We have a large tea plantation over there.

13
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,500
If you are making sports drinks,

14
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,180
how about stopping by and taking a look?

15
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,540
There's no need.

16
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,100
Sure.

17
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,150
But Mr. Zhou,

18
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,100
that mountain looks beautiful.

19
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,620
We are here for inspection,

20
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,479
not to relax.

21
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,820
I've understood the general situation of Yundian Villiage.

22
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,860
Tea is not within

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,620
the scope of our inspection trip.

24
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,480
After we go back,

25
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,170
I will make the final decision

26
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,000
after checking up on several other water plants

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,730
and combining all the factors.

28
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,000
I understand.

29
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,220
Mr. Zhou, we are already grateful

30
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,000
that you came here to inspect us in person.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,980
With all due respect,

32
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,310
I can't make any promises to you right now.

33
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,180
We understand. We understand.

34
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,040
We understand.

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,079
Shi Huahua,

36
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,030
where are you going?

37
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:45,990
Mr. Zhou.

38
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,900
Doesn't it mean that you've directly rejected them,

39
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,030
leaving them no hope at all?

40
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,920
Bigger hope means greater disappointment.

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,600
Besides, it's a fact that

42
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,340
the fundamental facilities of Yundian Village are poor.

43
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,340
If we use this place as our water plant,

44
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,320
we'll spend a lot on the initial investment,

45
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,460
which is not conducive to cost recovery.

46
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,540
But it is also because of this

47
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,780
that the place is not polluted

48
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,240
and the water is kept pure.

49
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,610
Isn't it a good thing?

50
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,340
With the same water quality,

51
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,750
there must be a place with more advanced facilities.

52
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,550
What I'm going after is the highest rate of return.

53
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,090
Give me that.

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,260
Don't these kids need to go to kindergarten?

55
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,050
Mr. Zhou,

56
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,820
the nearest kindergarten is in town,

57
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,850
and their parents are too busy working

58
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,060
to take care of them.

59
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,300
This place

60
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,530
always reminds me of my hometown.

61
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,060
In fact, our company has many water plants to choose from

62
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,390
in developing this functional drink.

63
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,500
However, Grandpa highly recommended this place

64
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,660
and asked us to inspect it in person.

65
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,730
I think there should be other deeper considerations

66
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,510
besides financial interests.

67
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,950
Brats, it's time for you to suffer a little.

68
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,040
Mr. Zhou,

69
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,220
how come I didn't realize you are so childish before?

70
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,640
Leave them alone.

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,010
OK.

Mr. Zhou,

79
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,820
help me hold the kite reel.

80
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,670
Hold it.

Woman.

144
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,240
Zhi'ang,

145
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,320
I thought we'd made this

146
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,640
crystal clear before.

147
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,180
Yes, we had.

148
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,030
Then since you've already known

149
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,570
that our relationship is nothing more than a game between adults,

150
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,960
why are you still coming here to see me?

151
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,890
A game?

152
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,580
I don't think it's a game.

153
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,290
Besides, you said before it's the attitude of adults.

154
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,850
The attitude of adults is to be responsible for each other.

155
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,060
Moreover,

156
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,840
your refusal of the advances of other men

157
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,440
shows you are responsible for me.

158
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
I promise to be responsible for you.

159
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,870
Xiaoxiao, what's the matter?

160
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,039
Are you not feeling well?

161
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,559
Didn't you hear what I just said?

162
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,270
I did.

163
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,980
Isn't that an excuse for you

164
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,049
to reject others?

165
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,549
No, it's not.

166
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,309
Haven't you

167
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,200
heard anything about my reputation before?

168
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,120
Xiaoxiao,

169
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,600
I don't care about that.

170
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,400
You did those things because you

171
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,770
hadn't found your fateful partner in a romantic relationship.

172
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,050
But now you are different.

173
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,540
You have me now.

174
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,560
I promise to treat you well.

175
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,250
And from now on, you will have a harbor in your heart

176
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,920
and no longer have to drift.

177
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,680
Zhi'ang.

178
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,430
Zhou Zhi'ang.

179
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,890
Maybe I didn't make myself clear last time.

180
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,420
I'll tell you one more time.

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,200
I've never thought about

182
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,060
being in a relationship with you.

183
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,480
Do you hear me clearly?

184
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,600
Then...

185
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,220
Then do you have any intention of being in a relationship with others?

186
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,060
No.

187
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,110
Then I understand.

188
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,400
Xiaoxiao, I'll leave.

189
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,420
Goodbye.

190
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,120
What do you understand?

191
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,030
Do you really know what I'm talking about?

192
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,010
Mr. Zhi'ang.

193
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,210
What brings you here?

194
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,310
I'm here for Zhifei.

195
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,100
Where is he?

196
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,320
Why am I unable to get in touch with him lately?

197
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,460
Mr. Zhou has gone to a mountain village for inspection.

198
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,520
He's in a mountain?

199
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,770
Which mountain?

200
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,130
There's even no signal?

201
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,060
Is it dangerous?

202
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,630
It is certainly not dangerous.

203
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,510
This is specially arranged by Chairman Zhou.

204
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,580
Moreover, the spokesperson was asked to accompany him personally.

205
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,910
Grandpa arranged this?

206
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,350
I understand.

207
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,590
This is for my brother to take my sister-in-law

208
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,720
to the mountains to cultivate a romantic relationship.

209
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,070
Did you hear that?

210
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,840
Did you hear that?

211
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,730
Is it just me,

212
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,860
or did Mr. Zhi'ang call Huahua his sister-in-law?

213
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,300
Isn't this the certification from the family?

214
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,090
My goodness.

215
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,470
It's so sweet for your romance to be blessed by a family member.

216
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,000
Where are you going?

217
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,930
Aren't we gonna leave tomorrow?

218
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,120
Since we are already here,

219
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,470
I still want to pay the tea mountain a visit.

220
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,130
Shi Huahua, how could you still say you are not here to relax?

221
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,410
Since we are already here, it's better not to leave with any regrets.

222
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,660
Do you wanna come with me?

223
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,830
I'm not going.

224
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,180
What to see in such nasty weather?

225
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,360
Which way to go?

226
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,590
This way.

227
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,600
Mr. Zhou.

228
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,220
Mr. Zhou.

229
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,670
You are not worn out again, are you?

230
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,940
I can keep going.

231
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,210
Mr. Zhou, look.

232
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,770
Isn't it beautiful there?

233
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,670
Mr. Zhou.

234
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,030
Thank you for admiring the scenery with me.

235
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,560
I didn't do it for your sake.

236
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,840
I'm afraid that if anything happens to you,

237
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,800
it not only will bring me trouble,

238
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,330
but also will waste my time.

239
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,460
Don't worry.

240
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,940
I grew up in the mountains,

241
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,300
what could happen to me?

242
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,390
You'd better mean it.

243
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,890
I'll protect you.

244
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,280
Mr. Zhou, we'll reach the summit soon.

245
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,630
Run, sprint.

246
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,820
Hurry.

247
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,490
Slow down.

248
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,870
Mr. Zhou, do you wanna have a try?

249
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,530
I don't. How childish.

250
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,680
Mr. Zhou.

251
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,170
I'm just messing with you.

252
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,170
The scenery here is marvellous.

253
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,570
You must think it's marvellous too, right?

254
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,320
The scenery is good,

255
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,140
but the person is not.

256
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,690
You...

257
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,510
You'd better get sick more often.

258
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,650
Shi Huahua, why are you running so fast?

259
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,900
Didn't you say you will protect me?

260
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,040
You are the one running too slow.

261
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,440
How can a grown man have such little stamina?

262
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,700
I have little stamina?

263
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,500
Let me tell you...

264
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,200
If you keep talking,

265
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,190
I'll leave you here.

266
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,820
Hurry.

267
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,630
How dare you.

268
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,840
Wait for me.

269
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,270
Come on.

270
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,140
I'm too tired to walk, carry me.

271
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,890
Mr. Zhou,

272
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,000
you really need to exercise more.

273
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Carry me, carry me, carry me. Hurry.

274
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,710
Fine.

275
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,640
Carry me.

276
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,380
This won't work.

277
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,310
Come down.

278
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,370
You'd better walk on your own.

279
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,650
It's all your fault.

280
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,920
You insisted on watching the scenery,

281
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,350
and see?

282
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,570
It's dark already, and it's raining heavily.

283
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,830
Moreover, we are lost.

284
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,680
It pisses me off!

285
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,940
Mr. Zhou, slow down.

286
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,080
The ground is slippery.

287
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,110
Watch out or you may slip.

288
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,970
Leave me alone.

289
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,120
You are so annoying.

290
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,020
Mr. Zhou.

291
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,620
Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhou.

292
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,360
Mr. Zhou.

293
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,800
Mr. Zhou. Are you alright? Are you OK?

294
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,630
Are you injured? Is it serious?

295
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,430
Mr. Zhou.

296
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,870
Mr. Zhou.

297
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,340
Mr. Zhou.

298
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,110
Mr. Zhou. Wake up. Mr. Zhou.

299
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,870
Mr. Zhou. Wake up. Mr. Zhou.

300
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,140
Mr. Zhou.

301
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,980
Don't leave me behind.

302
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,100
Mr. Zhou.

303
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,020
Mr. Zhou. You are awake.

304
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,750
Are you alright?

305
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,420
Mr. Zhou.

306
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,700
It's you.

307
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,180
I've got a weird disease,

308
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,800
every time I see a great amount of blood

309
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,920
I will faint,

310
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,040
and I don't remember what happened during that time.

311
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,150
Yes, it's me.

312
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,570
We've met before.

313
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,660
Am I dead?

314
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,220
How could you die?

315
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,200
You only fell into a trap.

316
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,960
It hurts.

317
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,960
Does it hurt a lot?

318
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,600
How about this? I'll go up first

319
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,690
and then help you get out of here immediately.

320
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,580
Sounds good?

321
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,690
Don't leave me behind.

322
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:26,940
Don't worry.

323
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,470
I will not leave you behind.

324
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,060
Trust me, OK?

325
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,540
Mr. Zhou, wait for a bit.

326
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,490
I'll pull you out immediately.

327
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,820
Lemme find a tool first.

328
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,690
Mr. Zhou,

329
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,810
here, grab this.

330
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,840
Grab it.

331
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:33,830
Hurry.

332
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,380
Step there.

333
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,040
Here, grab my hand.

334
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,900
Come on.

335
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,350
Hurry.

336
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,300
Come on.

337
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,140
Everything is OK now.

338
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,400
It's OK, it's OK.

339
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,300
Don't be scared, don't be scared.

340
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,030
There, there.

341
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,240
Well, how about I take you back?

342
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,180
Done.

343
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,780
Thank you.

344
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,650
Miss, are you hurt, too?

345
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,080

00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,900
to take care of Mr. Zhou after all.

518
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,930
Besides, he took the initiative to invite me this time,

519
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,400
which means he finally recognizes my value.

520
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,050
This kid was used to being a lone wolf.

521
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,550
He used to travel alone,

522
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,610
but this time he invited you,

523
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,650
which means you get along well, right?

524
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,250
We're good. We're good.

525
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:15,160
I asked you to take care of Zhifei before,

526
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,070
and I can see he looks better recently.

527
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,810
Thank you for your effort.

528
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,670
Grandpa,

529
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,190
in fact, I came to you today

530
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,190
because of him.

531
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,130
Mr. Zhou's health condition

532
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,380
is far more complex than I thought.

533
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,250
He...

534
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,170
Keep going.

535
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,000
From our visit to Yundian Village this time,

536
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,130
I found he

537
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,240
also has a quite lively and sunny side.

538
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,040
Usually, he just deliberately closes himself off

539
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,460
and always acts like

540
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,890
he is powerful in front of outsiders.

541
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,630
In fact, he is soft on the inside.

542
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,810
He carries too much on his shoulder

543
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,090
and it takes a heavy toll on his mind,

544
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,320
which is the real cause

545
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,700
of his weak and frail condition.

546
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,250
This kid

547
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,670
used to be too competitive.

548
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,350
Thank you for putting up with him.

549
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,830
Therefore,

550
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,920
I need to further strengthen the recuperation process

551
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,920
according to his health condition.

552
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,080
Huahua.

553
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,760
How about we treat Zhifei like this

554
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,660
in the future?

555
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,030
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

556
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,770
What are you doing?

557
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,620
Mr. Zhou,

558
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,220
according to the arrangement of Chairman Zhou,

559
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,140
from now on,

560
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,230
Miss Shi Huahua

561
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,360
will live in Southside Apartment with you.

562
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,570
Sh-she'll live with me?

563
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,480
What gives? I don't agree.

564
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,950
Shi Huahua,

565
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,400
didn't you promise

566
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,330
you don't need a big house?

567
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,530
Why did you change your mind so quickly?

568
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,830
Or

569
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,060
have you been corrupted and assimilated

570
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,990
by the luxurious life you disdain?

571
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,410
Moreover,

572
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,870
as a young girl,

573
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,550
don't you feel ashamed

574
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,010
to move in and live with a man all alone?

575
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,150
You are wrong, Mr. Zhou.

576
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,190
The benevolence of a doctor has no gender.

577
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,860
The reason I live with you is that

578
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,730
I was ordered by Grandpa Zhou to take care of you.

579
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,540
It's more convenient to carry out

580
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,820
your follow-up recuperation process by living together.

581
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,170
Luxury or shabby abode,

582
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,810
I see no difference.

583
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,050
Because the only thing I care about

584
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,480
is your health.

585
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,230
Don't worry,

586
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,180
I'll take full responsibility for your well-being.

587
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,340
Let me tell you again.

588
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,350
I do not need it.

589
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,210
No, you do need it.

590
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:24,870
I don't.

591
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:25,240
You do.

592
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,570
I...

593
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,380
Miss Huahua.

594
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,430
All your luggage has been put in,

595
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,710
please take good care of our Mr. Zhou.

596
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,860
Thank you, Secretary Zhang.

597
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,860
Please tell Grandpa Zhou

598
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,770
that he has nothing to worry about.

599
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,260
OK.

600
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,740
Bye, Secretary Zhang.

601
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,830
Have a safe trip.

602
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:39,770
Well...

603
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,100
Shi Huahua,

604
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,080
what in the world have you told Grandpa?

605
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,010
I just said your health needs further recuperation.

606
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,700
Wh-what's more?

607
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,270
Nothing.

608
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,800
You didn't tell Grandpa about Fei?

609
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,980
Didn't you tell me to keep it a secret?

610
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,520
Besides, even if you didn't say anything,

611
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,460
out of my medical ethics,

612
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,340
I will not disclose your privacy anyway.

613
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:01,970
Don't worry,

614
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,900
I'll keep your secret safe for you.

615
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,590
Well, I'll decoct your medicine first.

616
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,900
Shi Huahua.
