00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,380
Well, if there's nothing else,

6
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,580
I'll get back to work.

7
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,110
Work?

00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,729
What work can you do well?

9
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,479
For this morning's meeting,

10
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,140
do you think you did a good job?

11
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,610
You said a lot of so-called inspirational words.

12
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,180
But they all applauded!

13
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,370
Listen,

14
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,420
they did that just to please me.

15
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,410
But,

16
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,290
as the spokesperson for Feiran,

17
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,310
do you know what our company does?

18
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:04,960
Selling drinks.

19
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,560
Okay.

20
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,260
Even if our company sells drinks,

21
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,410
do you know how many products we have?

22
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,050
Where do we get our raw materials from?

23
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,300
And what kind of distributors and suppliers are they?

24
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,040
A company is run by professionals

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,540
and professional knowledge.

26
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,860
Do you know marketing?

27
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,730
Do you know the market?

28
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,620
Do you know management?

29
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,300
Do you think our company

30
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,579
suits everyone?

31
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,890
Let me tell you.

32
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,570
Even the most basic interns of our company

33
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,980
are social elites

34
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,740
selected strictly.

35
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,530
I can learn.

36
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,660
I can learn from the basics.

37
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,950
My master said,

38
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,000
carving something but giving up halfway, we cannot even carve rotten wood.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,040
But if we carve with perseverance, metals and stones are able to be shaped well.

40
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,810
I believe

41
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:52,960
if I work hard,

42
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,790
I can definitely become a qualified employee.

43
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,550
The so-called inspirational words again.

44
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,350
That's good.

45
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,910
If you still insist,

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,030
then I'll ask Chi

47
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,540
to give you the company's information.

48
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,740
After you've memorized the most basic information about the company,

49
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,510
come back to me.

50
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,890
Okay. See you then, Mr. Zhou.

51
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,540
So many?

52
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,260
Yes.

53
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,480
They're just the last quarter's files.

54
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
There's a lot more in the warehouse.

55

56
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,450
Which university did you graduate from?

57
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,579
One of the top universities?

58
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,460
I graduated from Newcastle University in England.

59
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,720
I'm a graduate of the School of Business.

60
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,320
That sounds great.

61
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,500
No.

62
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,800

63
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,480

Is this your way to kick her out?

She must know

76
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,590
this modern society

77
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,710
is not a place where she can survive so easily.

78

I'd like her to shrink back from difficulties.

79

I can make copies of these materials and take them home to read.

Although I know I'm not doing a good job,

hard work will make up for it.

Shi Huahua, don't you understand what I mean?

89

There is no need for you to read.

It's emotional intelligence.

cannot help you

Are you sure you don't want to give her a chance?

Mr. Zhou.

149
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,640
Mr. Zhou, what's wrong?

150
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,560
Not so serious.

151
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,400
Mr. Zhou!

152
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,540
Mr. Zhou, wake up! Don't scare me!

153
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,840
I'm the one with the nosebleed.

154
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,370
Why did you faint, Mr. Zhou?

155
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,210
Mr. Zhou?

156
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,990
Are you... are you okay?

157
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,810
Why did you suddenly faint?

158
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,810
Are you okay?

159
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,660
Mr. Zhou?

160
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,410
Mr. Zhou?

161
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,660
What happened to you?

162
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,950
Are you all right?

163
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,780
Who are you?

164

I'm Shi Huahua.

Mr. Zhou, don't scare me.

Mr. Zhou, why are you acting so strange?

167
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,660
I don't mean any harm.

168
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,890
Mr. Zhou, trust me.

169
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,240
Give me your hand.

170
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,300
Get up first, okay?

171
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,260
Okay.

172
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,030
If you're afraid,

173
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,850
then I won't go there first.

174
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,010
You're hungry?

00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:38,850
Come out.

348
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,200
Or I'll call security.

349
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,390
I... I'll call security.

350
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,720
Mr. Zhou, about your illness yesterday...

351
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,580
Shi Huahua,

352
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,370
I don't have to

353
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,480
tell you everything.

354
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,340
You've been bugging me all day.

355
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,550
Don't you understand?

356
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,700
But it looks

357
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,040
like a serious illness.

358
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,380
So if you don't tell me,

359
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:35,900
how will I...

360
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,380
I don't need you to care.

361
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,860
But Mr. Zhou...

362
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,320
It's Grandpa Zhou.

363
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,790
I...

364
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,410
Hello, Grandpa Zhou?

365
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,030
I'm fine. Everyone's kind.

366
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,420
He's...

367
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,990
He's kind of good.

368
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,280
Tonight?

369
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,250
Okay.

370
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,450
I'll bring him along then.

371
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,450
See you tonight, Grandpa Zhou.

372
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,820
See you tonight?

373
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,650
What did my grandpa say to you?

374
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,920
Grandpa Zhou asked me to come to his house for dinner tonight.

375
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,520
He said it's a family dinner.

376
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,310
And he wanted me to bring you along.

377
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,130
Why didn't he just call me?

378
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,160
It's like I'm the outsider.

379
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,570
Dad,

380
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,010
I've recently acquired two more companies.

381
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,080
This morning our stock...

382
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,340
Guess what?

383
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,820
It went up again.

384
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,920
Yes, Dad.

385
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,960
Recently, Zhou Wei has been busy

386
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,960
with all these things.

387
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,280
Zhi'ang,

388
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,050
what have you been up to?

389
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,090
Grandpa, I've been

390
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,500
[Director of Hemispheric Swimming Club, Zhou Zhifei's Cousin]

391
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,500
[One of the heirs of Zhou Group]

392
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,500
[Zhou Zhi'ang]

393
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,800
training at my swimming club.

394
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,790
Training?

395
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,270
Do you know how old you are?

396
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,100
You've been training for so many years.

397
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,340
What have you achieved?

398
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,780
We didn't want him

399
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,390
to be an athlete.

400
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,580
And now he's opening a swimming club.

401
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,200
Can he be promising?

402
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,480
Dad, please talk to him.

403
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,160
He's old enough,

404
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,630
but not clear-minded.

405
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,500
Mom, I can take care of myself.

406
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,440
Still laughing?

407
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,550
You know

408
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,190
you're not even as good as your younger brother.

409
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,510
I'm not even talking about Zhifei.

410
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,740
Let's talk about Zhiran.

411
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,150
His studies

412
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,210
are so good that

413
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,410
he's become your grandpa's assistant.

414
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,700
He's got his own ambitions too.

415
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,520
See?

416
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,070
Now you even need your younger brother to speak for you.

417
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,530
All you do is smirk!

418
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,770
I'm so angry at you.

419
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,860
That's enough!

420
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,250
Zhi'ang has his own pursuit.

421
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,390
Stop it!

422
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:41,980
Zhifei.

423
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,200
Huahua.

424
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,360
Zhiran. Grandpa.

425
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,230
Uncle. Auntie. Zhi'ang.

426
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,060
Zhifei, sit down.

427
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,450
Zhifei.

428
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,530
You don't look so good.

429
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,940
You didn't get much rest last night?

430
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,110
Mr. Zhou has been working too hard lately.

431
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,530
This is Feiran's new spokesperson,

432
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,710
Shi Huahua, right?

433
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,840
Hello, Auntie. Hello, Uncle.

434
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,910
You're so cute.

435
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,150
No wonder you can be the new spokesperson for Feiran.

436
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,810
What's this look?

437
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,070
And your bangs...

438
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,210
I... I think it's good.

439
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,610
All split ends.

440
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,100
You need to keep your image anytime now.

441
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,510
Otherwise you'll be a disgrace to Feiran.

442
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,900
And

443
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,160
what's this costume?

444
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,160
Don't you have any normal clothes?

445
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,650
I'll teach you later.

446
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,580
I'll make you look nice.

447
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,320
Mom.

448
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,140
Hello, Huahua.

449
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,300
I'm Zhifei and Zhiran's cousin.

450
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,480
My name is Zhou Zhi'ang.

451
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,410
Nice to meet you.

452
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,160
Hello, Zhi'ang.

453
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,120
We're all here today.

454
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,020
Let's have a meal together.

455
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,500
Today's dinner is

456
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,300
to let Huahua know you all.

457
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,730
Huahua is the spokesperson for Feiran.

458
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,540
She'll be the face of the Zhou family.

459
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,460
Come on.

460
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,100
We also have to thank Huahua.

461
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,250
I heard Miss Lin Yiru

462
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,660
couldn't perform suddenly.

463
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,800
Luckily you're there.

464
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,510
Otherwise,

465
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,890
we would have made a fool of ourselves.

466
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,150
At that time, Miss Lin Yiru

467
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,530
was not feeling well.

468
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,640
But from what I saw, there was some hidden reason.

469
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,050
Hidden reason?

470
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,720
With Lin Yiru's background,

471
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,530
I'm sure she wouldn't dare to offend our company.

472
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,820
She did this,

473
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,900
so there must be bigger benefits and rewards behind it.

474
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,250
From what you analyzed,

475
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,110
I smell a rat.

476
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,890
Is it possible that the rival firms are behind this?

477
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,320
Don't worry, Zhifei.

478
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,620
We'll help you investigate it.

479
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,650
As for Lin Yiru,

480
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,950
we'll shut her out.

481
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:11,770
That's right.

482
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,450
How can she break her word like that?

483
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,950
Don't worry, Auntie and Uncle.

484
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,100
I will definitely find the person behind it

485
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,270
and let him know

486
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,560
the consequence after he pissed me off.

487
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,910
Shi Huahua, what are you doing?

488
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,160
Mr. Zhou,

489
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,570
why are you picking out the green peppers again?

490
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,390
I don't like green peppers. Leave me alone.

491
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,460
No.

492
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,260
Green peppers are full of vitamins.

493
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:41,990
Cheers, Dad.

494
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,220
It's good for your health.

495
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,590
What do you think, Grandpa?

496
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,030
Okay, I'll eat it.

497
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,980
I think

498
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,810
Huahua knows some medical skills.

499
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,810
I've studied Chinese medicine with my master since I was a child.

500
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,940
When people in the village had a headache or a fever,

501
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,170
they all came to me for medicine.

502
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,090
Really?

503
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,080
Uncle Zhou, your skin looks sallow and oily.

504
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,270
You're with a white tongue.

505
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,340
So you should eat less

506
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,220
fatty foods and sweets.

507
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,040
Eat more beans and grains.

508
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,160
Exercise more and scratch less hair.

509
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,010
Then

510
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,480
you won't have to wear

511
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,210
that wig.
