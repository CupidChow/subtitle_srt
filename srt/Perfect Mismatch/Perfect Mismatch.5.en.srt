[Episode 5]

5
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,880
I've studied Chinese medicine with my master since I was a child.

6
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,930
When people in the village had a headache or a fever,

7
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:42,910
they all came to me for medicine.

8
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,070
Really?

9
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,039
Uncle Zhou, your skin looks sallow and oily.

10
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,479
You're with a white tongue.

11
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,390
So you should eat less

12
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,220
fatty foods and sweets.

13
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,120
Eat more beans and grains.

14
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,250
Exercise more and scratch less hair.

15
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,140
Then

16
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,670
you won't have to wear

17
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,240
that wig.

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,370
Wig?

19
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,110
What are you talking about?

20
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,130
Uncle, on your head, there is...

21
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,420
What?

22
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,940
Don't talk nonsense.

23
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,850
There's no such thing.

24
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,240
My hair is dark and shiny,

25
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,460
and it's in great condition.

26
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,180
Uncle, what's on your head then?

27
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,340
My own hair, of course.

28
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,970
You are too young

29
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,990
to be reliable.

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,840
Let's dig in.

31
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,620
Enjoy your meal.

32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,980
Don't hit me. Don't hit me.

33
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,770
I won't.

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
It was an accident last time.

35
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,860
Huahua.

36
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,260
Are you getting used to life here recently?

37
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,080
I feel pretty good.

38
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,010
Everyone's been taking care of me.

39
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,280
Did you know?

40
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,040
I've watched your video

41
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,560
at the launch many times.

42
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,910
The kung fu you demonstrated is amazing.

43
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,890
Does it have any connection

44
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,260
with Shaolin Long Fist?

45
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,900
In fact, all the martial arts in the world are interlinked.

46
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,120
For example, our Shi's kung fu.

47
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,870
Our Shi's kung fu

48
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,880
is like a fast-flowing river, endless and everlasting.

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,820
It's pretty interesting.

50
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,880
Well, could you teach me?

51
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,510
I've been practicing it since I was a child,

52
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,810
it's a virgin kung fu.

53
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,180
It's not something

54
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,120
you can learn in merely several days.

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,900
That's true.

56
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,120
Then, have you been to the downtown area recently?

57
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,820
I was busy recently,

58
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,160
so I haven't gotten a chance.

59
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,020
How about this?

60
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,270
It'll be the weekend in two days,

61
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,050
and we can hang out together.

62
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,620
I can show you around.

63
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,300
It's great.

64
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,700
But I might not be available on weekends.

65
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,110
I have to work overtime.

66
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,820
It's fine.

67
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,230
I'll tell my brother,

68
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,270
he won't say no.

69
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,500
Zhifei,

70
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,560
although Feiran's business

71
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,240
seems to be booming recently,

72
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,220
in fact, the little turnover it makes

73
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,150
is just a morning's worth of ups and downs

74
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,080
for the company's stock.

75
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,840
Uncle,

76
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,940
let's drop this topic

77
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,940
because it's too boring.

78
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,140
How about we talk about something else?

79
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,420
Grandpa, do you know that

80
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,570
Huahua's martial art

81
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,990
is not just for display,

82
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,460
but real kung fu?

83
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,720
Do you know?

84
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,570
Last time

85
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,710
I sneaked up behind her like this

86
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,900
to spook her a little bit.

87
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,300
I only tapped her lightly

88
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,180
and she almost slammed me to the ground.

89
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,020
Huahua,

90
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,270
how about you demonstrate it to all of us?

91
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,000
Show it to us.

92
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,790
It's pretty simple.

93
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,500
Just put your hand here,

94
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,860
Yes, like this.

95
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,340
and then

96
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,980
use your strength like this.

97
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,760
No.

98
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,470
Sorry, I'm sorry, Uncle.

99
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,290
My apology. My apology.

100
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,000
L-let me do it myself.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,920
It's fine. It's fine. Let me wipe it for you.

102
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,850
Let me...

103
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,830
I'm sorry, Uncle.

104
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,750
I didn't mean to.

105
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,130
Dad, it's getting late.

106
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,150
We should head back.

107
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,100
Zhi'ang.

108
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,280
Grandpa, see you.

109
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,940
Thank you, sir.

110
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,550
We're here.

111
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,320
Mr. Zhou, thank you for sending me home.

112
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,850
This is where you live?

113
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,740
Why is it so shabby?

114
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,150
Is it?

115
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,980
I think it's fine.

116
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,030
Shi Huahua.

117
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,930
When Grandpa asked you to live in a better place,

118
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,930
why didn't you go?

119
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,590
Wouldn't it be better

120
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,100
to live more comfortably?

121
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,180
Master once said that

122
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,800
it's better to teach a man to fish than feed him.

123
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,060
I should start from the beginning

124
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,600
when I engage in the society for my spiritual practice.

125
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,510
Besides, Grandpa Zhou

126
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,660
has already given me the opportunity to work,

127
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,030
I am already very grateful

128
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,830
and dare not ask for more favors.

129
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,370
Shi Huahua,

130
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,790
all you talk about is

131
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,950
words that your master once said.

132
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,730
Do you know that

133
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,610
what your master has taught you is toxic?

134
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,500
If you want to survive in this society,

135
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,200
you have to learn to

136
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,570
accept others' kindness.

137
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,600
Because you'll never know

138
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,920
when your possessions

139
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,090
will all vanish into thin air.

140
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,860
You have to seize every given chance,

141
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,060
for the goddess of fortune will not always be by your side.

142
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,240
Mr. Zhou.

143
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,220
Since ancient times, people who have been able to achieve great feats

144
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,050
not only have extraordinary talents,

145
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,510
but also must have the will of perseverance.

146
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,430
Although I am not doing very well now,

147
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,659
I believe that

148
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,810
through my efforts,

149
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,230
I can gain a firm foothold step by step

150
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,230
and will be able to help more people.

151
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,760
I don't know what to do with you.

152
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,420
Since you refuse to accept it,

153
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,200
I'll leave.

154
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,500
Mr. Zhou,

155
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,380
about your illness yesterday...

156
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,700
I've got a weird disease,

157
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,380
every time I see a great amount of blood,

158
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,560
I will faint,

159
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,100
and I don't remember

160
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,360
what happened during that period.

161
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,290
If I offended you during that time,

162
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,760
I sincerely apologize.

163
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,910
No, no.

164
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,540
We got along pretty well.

165
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:24,810
You...

166
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,210
Mom.

167
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,860
But

168
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,030
why does such a weird disease exist?

169
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,840
Do we have a way to cure it?

170
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,230
No cure

171
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,460
has been found so far.

172
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,880
Only a few people

173
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,240
know about this matter,

174
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,530
and if I ever find out that you tell...

175
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,630
Mr. Zhou, you can rest assured that

176
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,610
the protection of patients' privacy

177
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,300
is the fundamental rule of being a doctor.

178
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,470
However, I'll definitely find a way

179
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,740
to cure you.

180
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,220
Don't worry about that.

181
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,700
I only ask you to not bring me more trouble.

182
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,650
OK.

183
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,230
See you, Mr. Zhou.

184
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,010
Zhiran, let's rest a bit.

185
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,409
But, Zhifei,

186
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:39,429
we haven't even played a few rounds yet,

187
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,130
and you are already tired?

188
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:40,900
I'm worn out.

189
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,600
I need to sit and rest a bit.

190
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,550
Zhiran,

191
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,270
you've improved a lot recently.

192
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,260
Not really,

193
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,130
it's because you haven't exercised for a long time.

194
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,590
It didn't take long for you to get exhausted.

195
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,680
But why did you suddenly want to

196
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,730
invite me to play tennis today?

197
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,920
I've been busy before,

198
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,080
and it's been a while

199
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,140
since we two brothers hung out last time.

200
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,020
True.

201
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,970
You haven't been with me much lately.

202
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,820
Speaking of which,

203
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,310
Zhiran, do you have a girl you've got a crush on recently?

204
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,220
Why do you suddenly want to know about this?

205
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,860
Because you are nearly 20,

206
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,010
it's about time.

207
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,120
I just want to know

208
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,460
which girl is lucky enough

209
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,730
to be favored by my excellent little brother.

210
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,520
None.

211
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,110
I don't have a crush.

[No Smoking]

213
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,520
And Zhifei, why are you worrying about me

214
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,460
when you have never been in a relationship yourself?

215
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,220
I...

216
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,330
I've been focusing on work.

217
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,510
By the way,

218
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,270
I've heard that you are gonna

219
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,260
hang out with Shi Huahua tomorrow?

220
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,850
Yeah.

221
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,290
I want to show her around the city

222
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,660
since she's not familiar with the environment.

223
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,360
Zhiran,

224
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,390
why did you mess with her?

225
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,960
She's a bane.

226
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,910
I don't think so.

227
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,150
I found her nice.

228
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,430
You have too little social experience

229
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,300
to judge people accurately.

230
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,080
She's practically a savage.

231
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,320
Zhifei, you've gone too far in saying that about her.

232
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,030
I think she's endearing.

233
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,910
She's smart, beautiful, outgoing, and energetic,

234
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,250
not like any girl I've seen.

235
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,150
You cannot be mesmerized by her.

236
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,190
What if I say I have feelings for her?

237
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,440
You don't have a fever.

238
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,280
I can be your matchmaker

How come you're into someone like her?

241
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,580
Zhifei, are you jealous?

242
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,660
How's that possible?

243
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,170
I just worried that

244
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,080
you may fall into her palm.

245
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,000
As your big brother, I have been trapped

246
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,710
in the abyss of suffering and couldn't escape her.

247

Zhifei, why are you still regarding me as an outsider?

262
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,090
You should call me sister-in-law now.

H-how come you're marrying Shi Huahua?

Because we are truly in love with each other.

since our very first date.

269

commit to each other for life

Let me go first.

528
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,640
I found her lovable, lively,

529
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,500
and

530
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,600
she's not like any other girls.

531
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,850
I have feelings for her,

532
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,290

What about you?

534
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,080
She's barbarous, rude and unreasonable.

535
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,390
But,

536
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,100
her presence

537
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,340

00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,010

what kind of feeling this is,

541
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,270

542
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,180
