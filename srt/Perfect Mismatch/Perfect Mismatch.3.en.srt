she has such a steady stance,

177
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,340
can you push her?

178
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,810
Do you think I'm as barbaric as she is?

179
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,300
Civilized people

180
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,310

181
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,680
Mr. Zhou, you want to see me?

182
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,870
Huahua, come and sit down.

183
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,150
What would you like to drink? Black tea?

184
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,450
No need.

185
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,080
Here's the thing.

186
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,110
We had some conflicts before.

187
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,770
I think it was caused by poor communication.

188
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,420
So today I want to ask you here

189
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,660

190
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,790
Okay.

191
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,860
I also think we should have a chat.

192
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,550
In fact, I have done something wrong before.

193

I have this problem that

194

when I get anxious,

195
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,830
my hands move faster than my mouth.

196
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,290
I'm really sorry about this morning.

197

202

203
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,110
I must say that

Now you know how good it is.

207
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,430
You know what,

208
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,720
the Chinese medicine treatment

209
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,180
is a gradual process.

210
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,960
You only need to drink the medicine for three months first,

211
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,360
then you will feel ...

212
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:21,980
I understand.

213

Of course.

Do you know Renji University?

223
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,960
It's a nationally renowned Chinese medicine college.

224
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,540
It just happens to have academic cooperation with Feiran.

225

227

228

What do you think?

229
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,110
Really?

230
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,470
Of course.

231

No, no.

I can't owe you such a big favor.

You want to use this opportunity

No.

Okay.

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,450
Why are you yelling?

519
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,520
I'm not a child,

520
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,180
would I lie to you?

521
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,210
Sorry, Mr. Zhou.

522
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,570
But the best time to take this medicine is now.

523
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,630
If you don't drink it,

524
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,830
I'll feed you forcibly.

525
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,410
Okay, I'll drink it.

526
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,360
Let me open it for you.

530
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,380
What happened?

531
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,490
Unbelievable.

532
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,570
Mr. Zhou has been controlled.

533
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,900
It's the first time I've seen him so obedient.

534
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,690
I've already felt strange about that.

535
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,390
Our company has never had

536
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,430
the position of Senior Vice President of Administration.

537
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,030
I think she will be the president's wife in the future.

538
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,940
No way. Mr. Zhou won't like her.

539
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,740
No.

540
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,640
When you fall in love with someone,

541
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,520
your eyes do not lie.

542
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,380
You're angry early in the morning.

543
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,910
Your eyes are on fire.

544
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,390
She won't be happy for long.

545
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,250
Today,

546
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,990
I'll make her leave of her own accord.

547
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,090
What are you going to do?

548
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,600
Ask her to attend

549
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,880
the executive meeting later.

550
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,200
What are you going to do?

551
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,920
I'll make her lose face in front of the whole company,

552
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,110
and let her know that

553
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,300
it's not easy to stay in the company.

554
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,030
All right.

Don't touch it.

558
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,150
If I don't eat it,

559
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,060
she'll come back to bother me later.

560
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,320
It tastes awful.

561
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,140
The main content of today's meeting is to discuss

562
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,430
the expansion of the offline stores of Light Oxygen Series,

563
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,460
as well as the product planning for the next quarter.

Next, Product Development Department

565
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,470
will make a presentation first.

566
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,700
Okay.

567
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:12,910
First of all,

568
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,260
let's see a set of data.

569
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,410
This year, we have achieved

570
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,060
106.8 percent of the goal

571
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,360
for the second half of the year.

572
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,060
Next year,

573
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,500
if we want to achieve this good result again,

574
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,630
we must first understand

575
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,730
our own strengths and weaknesses.

576
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:24,740
Our strengths are that

577
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,290
our enterprise is relatively large

578
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,520
and has abundant funds.

579
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,980
Our weakness is that our product has just entered the market.

580
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,960
And now it is still...

581
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,980
First of all, let's look at the data.

582
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,790
Many employees came to work late and left early.

583
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:40,940
Miss Shi.

584
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,780
Miss Shi.

585
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:45,940
Miss Shi.

586
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:49,930
What?

587
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,380
I said that

588
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,990
finally, our senior administrator,

589
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,730
Shi Huahua,

590
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,930
would make a comment.

591
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,780
Me?

592
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,400
We all know that

593
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,830
you must have a lot of good ideas,

594
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,470
so please give us an answer.

595
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,360
Miss Shi, please.

596
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,820
As the new leader

597
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,120
and new spokesperson,

598
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,780
Miss Shi must have a lot of good ideas.

599
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,550
Tell us,

600
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,080
then we can learn from you.

601
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,330
Yes, go ahead.

602
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,470
We are all eager to hear

603
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,250
your opinion.

604
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,130
Tell us.

605
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,740
Miss Shi, just tell us.

606
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,580
Go ahead.

607
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:39,800
Come on.

608
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,970
Just tell us.

609
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,350
Say it.

610
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,450
It doesn't matter.

611
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,090
We're all on the same side.

612
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,220
Say it, Miss Shi.

613
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,300
Miss Shi, say it. It's okay.

614
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,420
Miss Shi, say it.

615
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,070
Let him be strong.

616
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,450
The wind is blowing on the hill.

617
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,830
Let him be rude.

618
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,790
The moon shines on the river.

619
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,740
My master said,

620
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,030
the world is changing.

621
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,570
If we can be as stable as the mountain,

622
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,970
even if the wind is strong,

623
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,980
it will not be able to blow us.

624
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,600
If we can be as calm as the river,

625
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,380
having peace of mind,

626
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,720
even if the moon shines,

627
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,760
it will not be able to move us.

628
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,170
As Zen said,

629
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,320
the greatest enemy of human beings is

630
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,840
anxiety, uneasiness,

631
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,960
cowardice and ignorance generated in their hearts.

632
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,260
All the truths of the world

633
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,350
are in it.

634
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,060
What are you talking about?

635
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,310
Good point. Good point.

636
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,710
Miss Shi means that,

637
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,300
on the premise of the current route of Light Oxygen,

638
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,880
we can add the natural elements of  mountains and rivers

639
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,630
to cure the anxiety of modern city people.

640
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,340
Right?

641
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,940
It's really brilliant.

642
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,700
Yes, this is a big picture.

643
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,100
It's a big picture.

644
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,950
Exactly. Miss Shi, you're great.

645
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,620
Miss Shi, you're great.

646
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,750
Miss Shi, you're great.

647
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,730
Miss Shi, you're great.

648
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,590
Good point.

649
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,480
Great.

650
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,250
Miss Shi, you're great.

651
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,220
No, no.

652
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,940
Miss Shi, you're great.

653
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,130
Thank you, thank you.

654
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,980
Did you see it in the meeting just now?

655
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,390
He spoiled her so much.

656
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,700
So sweet.

657
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,010
And he kept glancing at her.

658
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,360
Yes, oh my god.

659
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,670
His eyes were full of love.

660
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,010
Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhou.

661
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,210
Mr. Zhou.

662
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,220
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

663
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,860
Shi Huahua, what are you trying to say?

664
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,920
Mr. Zhou,

665
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,800
I have to say that

666
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,650
your eating habits are really bad.

667
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,220
It's none of your business.

668
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,270
Mr. Zhou,

669
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,500
even the children in our village know

670
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,440
we can't be picky eaters.

671
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,790
You're a grown-up and you're still picky.

672
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,790
And all you're picking out

673
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,700
is nutritious food.

674
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,740
What a waste.

675
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,310
As the saying goes, tonic food is better than medicine.

676
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,360
Mr. Zhou,

677
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,090
you really need to pay attention

678
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,090
to the nutritional balance of your three meals a day.

679
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,050
I said I'm healthy.

680
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,180
It's none of your business.

681
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:30,210
Mr. Zhou.

682
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,180
This is

683
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,760
the tonic meal I specially cooked for you,

684
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,790
porridge with dried longan, lotus seeds, wolfberry and quail.

685
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,170
I also added various herbs such as

686
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,850
rehmannia root, liriope sticata and polygonatum odoratum.

687
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,320
In a word, after you eat it,

688
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,500
you'll be stronger,

689
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,440
and get better.

690
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,450
I refuse.

691
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,600
If Chairman Zhou knows that

692
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,780
you're still a picky eater at your age,

693
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,790
he will be very upset.

694
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,280
Here you are, Mr. Zhou.

695
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,210
Please.

696
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,770
Let me help you.

697
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,040
How's that? Isn't it delicious?

698
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,110
Looks like I came at the wrong time.

699
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:47,530
I'm leaving.

700
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,350
Xiaoxiao, listen to me.

701
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:48,870
Mr. Zhou.

702
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,450
Miss Xiaoxiao,

703
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,340
come and eat with us.

704
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,180
Eat and sleep in silence.

705
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,920
You shouldn't talk when you're eating.

706
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,020
Come on.

707
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,980
Come on, Mr. Zhou.

708
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,180
Okay.

709
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,630
I'm all done.

710
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,870
I'll go back to work.

711
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,670
Wait.

712
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,350
Mr. Zhou, I've asked Chi

713
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,890
to postpone all your afternoon work.

714
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,030
You need to go with me to do one more thing.

715
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,420
What?

716
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,130
As the saying goes,

717
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,470
an after-lunch walk a day keeps the doctor away.

718
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,860
A proper walk after a meal

719
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,060
can promote intestinal peristalsis,

720
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,600
which helps the secretion of digestive juices,

721
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,710
and the digestion and absorption of food.

722
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,010
Mr. Zhou, follow me.

723
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,170
Mr. Zhou,

724
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,230
why did you stop again?

725
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,110
Go, go, go.

726
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,840
Shi Huahua, I hate you.

727
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,840
Come on.

728
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,360
They have developed to the stage

729
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,550
of walking together as a married couple.

730
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,170
So sweet.

731
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,370
Walking together and enjoying the wind,

732
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,350
watching the sunset and people passing by.

733
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,810
So jealous.

734
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,580
In our traditional medicine,

735
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,970
sunbathing can

736
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,940
enhance the yang qi of the human body.

737
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,410
Head is where

738
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,790
all yang qi converges.

739
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,570
All the blood and qi of the viscera

740
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,870
converge in the head.

741
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,970
The sun shines on Bai Hui acupoint on the top of the head

742
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,940
and it can warm the body, improve immunity,

743
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,100
and promote the development of the brain

744
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,620
and the growth of bones in the head.

745
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,530
It is also good for hair growth.

746
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,930
My hair is healthy

747
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,870
and doesn't need to grow.

748
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,250
You stay up all night working,

749
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,650
you must be starting to lose hair.

750
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,830
We need to prepare ahead of time.

751
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,310
Do you want to become a bald president?

752
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,020
You...

753
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,730
It's effective.

754
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,180
Mr. Zhou,

755
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,120
as long as you

756
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,140
keep repeating these movements every day,

757
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,580
I believe that your physical condition

758
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,880
will soon be improved.

759
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,290
Well, if there's nothing else,

760
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,430
I'll get back to work.

761
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,310
Work?

762
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,720
What work can you do well?

763
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,270
For this morning's meeting,

764
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,710
do you think you did a good job?

765
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,200
You said a lot of so-called inspirational words.

766
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,070
But they all applauded!

767
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,340
Listen,

768
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,120
they did that just to please me.
