00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,310
Did Zhou Zhiran come to you?

351
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,060
What do you mean?

352
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,120
Huahua, tell me the truth,

353
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,740
did Zhou Zhiran

354
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,090
persuade you to leave this time?

355
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,400
No.

356
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,700
It's my own decision.

357
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,480
It's the best for everyone

358
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,820
that I leave.

359
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,730
Huahua.

360
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,120
Huahua.

361
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,900
You can't hide anything

362
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,830
from us now.

363
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,480
Otherwise, there is no way to

364
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,750
resolve the matter between you and Zhifei.

365
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,500
Some time ago,

366
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,840
I found out that

367
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,080
Zhiran

368
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,350
has always

369
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,430
liked me.

370
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,940
He asked me out that day.

371
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,910
In fact, I fell in love with you

372
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,450
the first time I saw you.

373
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,360
I know you are with my brother.

374
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,780
I will hide my feelings well

375
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,550
and not disturb you.

376
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,510
Later I thought that

377
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,530
if Zhifei knew about Zhiran's feelings for me,

378
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,660
he would definitely blame himself

379
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,470
and feel sorry for Zhiran.

380
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,700
And I don't want to see Zhiran suffer

381
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,260
to escape his feelings.

382
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,320
So I thought that

383
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,150
as long as I disappeared,

384
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,300
everything

385
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,940
would return to the way it was before.

386
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:40,800
Huahua.

387
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,950
Did you misunderstand what Zhiran meant?

388
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,070
It's not that Huahua misunderstood Zhiran,

389
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,570
but that you never understood

390
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,820
your younger brother.

391
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,350
We have been dependent on each other since we were kids.

392
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,640
I know his every illness,

393
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,690
every award he won,

394
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,390
and every friend he made.

395
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,550
How could I not know him?

396
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,910
Do you know

397
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,140
how many love letters he destroyed for you

398
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,540
from junior high school to university?

399
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,390
I know.

400
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,310
He was afraid that puppy love would affect my study.

401
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,390
Let's forget about junior high school and high school.

402
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,920
Is college love also considered puppy love?

403
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,350
Zhiran liked to peek at your schoolbag since he was a child,

404
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,900
to see if there were

405
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,890
any love letters or gifts

406
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,300
from other girls.

407
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,860
When he grew up,

408
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,170
he attended any banquet

409
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,160
you attended,

410
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,900
because he didn't want anyone to approach you.

411
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,720
He has the contact information

412
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,320
of all the friends around you,

413
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,150
so that he can monitor you

414
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,460
at any time through them.

415
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,950
He is wary of any men and women

416
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,220
within a radius of five meters around you,

417
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,060
including me.

418
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,360
He thought it was impossible for us to be together,

419
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,630
so he disarmed me.

420
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,380
He's just childish.

421
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,320
He cares about me.

422
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,670
What about Huahua?

423
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,160
You could say Zhiran was childish

424
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,450
before Huahua appeared.

425
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,060
But he's about to graduate from college,

426
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,950
and he should grow up.

427
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,920
Huahua is your girlfriend, which everyone knows.

428
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,740
But he tried everything to drive her away.

429
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,270
I still can't believe

430
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,740
he would do such a thing.

431
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,290
Xiaoxiao, go downstairs quickly.

432
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,020
Let's have lunch.

433
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,320
I have something to do.

434
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,480
Come here.

435
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,950
Zhou Zhifei.

436
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,590
Do you have to hear Zhiran's own confession

437
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,800
before you believe it?

438
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,200
I have a way.

439
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,510
Shi Huahua didn't come back as I expected.

440
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:55,980
[Hang up] [Answer]

441
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:55,980
[Zhi'ang]

442
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,420
Hello.

443
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,370
Hello, Zhiran.

444
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,290
Zhifei wants to propose to Huahua.

445
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,040
What?

446
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,750
Huahua seems to be leaving.

447
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,890
In order to keep her,

448
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,840
Zhifei's planning to propose to her.

449
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,840
As his brothers,

450
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,780
we have to be there.

451
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,320
Where are you now?

452
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,470
I'm on my way.

453
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,080
We are on the rooftop of Zhou Group's building.

454
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,020
Come over now.

455
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,670
Shi Huahua!
