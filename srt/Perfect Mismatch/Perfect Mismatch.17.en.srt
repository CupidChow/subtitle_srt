[Where are you?]

178
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,530
Where are you?

179
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,929
Eat something.

180
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,930
[I'm home.]

181
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,930
[Where are you?]

182
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,710
I am home.

183
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,560
I am leaving.

184
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,460
Mr. Zhou.

185
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,920
Stay here.

186
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,860
Everyone is here.

187
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,100
Yes, play with us.

188
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,510
No, I need to feed the cat.

189
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,130
Bye.

190
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,140
Mr. Zhou.

191
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,780
Chi.

192
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,560
When did Mr. Zhou adopt a cat?

193
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,910
Well...

194
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,930
There seems to be one.

195
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,000
What breed?

196
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,600
It seems to be a Chinese pastoral cat.

197
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,740
Right?

198
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,340
Yes.

199
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,110
There is one.

200
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,870
Director Ji, let's continue.

201
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,620
Director Ji.

202
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,050
Huahua.

203
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,870
Have you slept?

204
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,360
How could she fall asleep?

205
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,700
Let's go on tonight.

206
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,490
Sure.

207
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay.

208
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,690
Tonight...

209
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,150
Miss Ji, I am not going.

210
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,150
Huahua.

211
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,890
Join us.

212
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,040
Why not?

213
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,490
Come have fun with us.

214
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,890
All right.

215
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,390
Drink with us.

216
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,100
No.

217
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,760
I can't.

218
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,670
You have to practice.

219
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,400
You learn martial arts and have a fast metabolism.

220
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,500
Chi.

221
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,580
Why don't you drink with them?

222
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,640
Director Ji.

223
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,920
Why do we have team building every night?

224
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,340
I am rewarding you.

225
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,370
Aren't you happy?

226
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,430
Then why is there no Mr. Zhou

227
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,320
when there is Miss Shi,

228
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,030
and no Miss Shi

229
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,290
when there is Mr. Zhou?

230
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,270
Come here.

231
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,620
Chi, those who are too smart

232
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,800
will be beheaded.

233
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,620
Got it.

234
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,010
Nice wine.

235
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,060
Hello, everyone.

236
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,370
Take a seat.

237
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,350
Duan Jiayang.

238
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,050
So cool.

239
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,240
Why is he here?

240
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,020
Gosh, he's so cool.

241
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,880
Chi.

242
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Serve them both two glasses of wine.

243
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,620
I don't drink.

244
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,560
Miss Shi.

245
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,750
I'll order you a non-alcoholic drink.

246
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,120
You...

247
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,280
Huahua, long time no see.

248
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,980
Long time no see, Jiayang.

249
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,210
Why are you here?

250
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,430
Miss Ji asked me to come and play together.

251
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,670
I was free, so I came.

252
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,310
Miss Shi, your non-alcoholic drink.

253
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,990
Thank you.

254
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,820
Mr. Jiayang.

255
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,640
Can we have a drink with you?

256
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,340
Sure.

257
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,280
Me, too.

258
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,580
Thank you. Cheers.

259
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,510

260
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,500
How have you been recently?

261
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,870
Pretty good.

262
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,510
Did you have the answer

263
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,670
to that question last time?

264
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,700
What question?

265
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,720
Do you know who is the person

266
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,000
who fills your heart?

267
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,340
Bless you both.

268
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,530
Thank you, Jiayang.

269
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,980

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

276
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,330
Why are you here dressed like this?

277
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,400
Why are you here?

278
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,510
I happened to pass by.

279
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,020
Since everyone is here,

280
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,070
it's my treat today.

281
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,380
Okay, thank you, Mr. Zhou.

282
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,350
Mr. Zhou, cheers.

283
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,080

287
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,410
Let's have fun tonight.

288
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,480
I can't make it.

289
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,840
Miss Ji, I can't make it.

290
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,450
Miss Ji, my sister is divorced.

291
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,910
I have to keep her company.

292
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,590
We are actually triplets.

293
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,650
What about you, Chi?

294
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,500
I...

295
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,910
What's your reason?

296
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,360
Chi.

297
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,570
Come to my office.

298
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,020
Okay, Mr. Zhou.

299
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,240
You are back.

300
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,560
Wash your hands and come eat.

301
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,540
It's good to see you

302
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,930
as soon as I get home.

303
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,950
It seems like we haven't been

304
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,090
at home together for a long time.

305
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,290
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

306
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,820
What are you talking about?

307
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,860
Let me go.

308
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,990
I am cooking.

309
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,890
Go get the chopsticks.

310
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,490
The dish is ready.

311
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,110
Go.

312
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,220
What are you doing?

313
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,350
Get ready to eat.

[Honor certificate]

316
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,190
Mr. Zhou.

317
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,670
Long time no see.

318
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,600
Mr. Shen, long time no see.

319
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,780
We haven't seen each other for three years.

320
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,060
How did you lose so much weight?

321
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,650
Take a seat.

322
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,660
Why did you come back

323
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,650
this time?

324
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,650
Lately I've heard that Feiran

325
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,660
is gaining momentum.

326
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,870
This year you also acquired the Haige Group in Germany.

327
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,720
Naturally, Xingchen Group cannot miss out on

328
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,220
the profits in the Greater China region.

329
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,140
Seems like you're here to challenge me.

330
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,960
But

331
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,070
if you're trying to take

332
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,790
a piece of Feiran's market share,

333
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,380
you'd better not waste your time.

334
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:51,910
Mr. Zhou.

335
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,040
What are you talking about?

336
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,880
Harmony brings wealth.

337
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,430
If we join forces,

338
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,920
it can be a win-win situation.

339
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,680
Sounds like you are confident in our cooperation.

340
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,280
I'd like to know the details.

341
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
Do you have

342
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,800
any decent plans

343
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
to tempt me?

344
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,160
Mr. Zhou, no worries.

345
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,450
Even if we can't be friends,

346
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,550
we can be partners.

347
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,620
By the way,

348
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,160
I have just returned to China,

349
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,680
so I am not very familiar with the domestic market.

350
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,640
I got some old classmates

351
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,270
and decided to run

352
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,690
a traditional relay marathon.

353
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,060
Hope you will be there.

354
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,260
Sorry,

355
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,350
I'm busy with work

356
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,180
and don't have time for recreational activities.

357
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,350
I knew you would say that.

358
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,700
So I specially arranged the time for the weekend.

359
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,510
Are you afraid of displaying your ignorance

360
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,700
in front of our old classmates?

361
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,310
Although you were indeed not that good at sports

362
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,300
while we were in school,

363
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,850
you're not that bad.

364
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,030
Nonsense.

365
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,250
I am outstanding in all aspects.

366
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,770
Isn't it just a relay marathon?

367
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,000
Feiran will definitely win the championship.

368
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,490
Okay.

369
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,230
Let's see.

370
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,920
The Charity Run of the Chinese Alumni Association of Kelu University

371
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,460
will be held at the Rainbow Stadium this weekend.

372
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,700
[Everyone is welcome to participate.]

373
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,700
[The Charity Run of the Chinese Alumni Association of Kelu University will be held at the Rainbow Stadium this weekend.]

374
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,550
Everyone is welcome to participate.

375
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,010
So are we going to a running race?

376
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,690
Yes.

377
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,510
The competition was initiated by my university alumni.

378
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,260
There must be many acquaintances then.

379
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,140
So Feiran has to win this time.

380
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,140
Mr. Zhou, don't you never care about

381
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,710
these boring competitions?

382
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,520
You have no idea.

383
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,700
Mr. Zhou has been an all-powerful figure

384
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,540
since he was in college.

385
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,490
At that time, his grades were outstanding,

386
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,570
but his sports performance

387
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,320
was poor.

388
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,090
This also became

389
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,190
the topic of conversation.

390
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,430
So this time Mr. Zhou probably wants to

391
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,450
participate in this competition to justify his name.

392
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,350
Xiaoxiao.

393
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,990
You don't need to explain it in such detail.

394
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,080
All in all,

395
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,180
since we're going,

396
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,490
we have to win.

397
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,770
Mr. Zhou, I will definitely do my best.

398
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,450
I feel so warm-blooded.

399
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,530
Let's work together.

400
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,410
Come on.

401
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,070
Come on.

402
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,540
Alright, I now appoint Shi Huahua

403
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,620
as the captain of this competition,

404
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,740
she will be arranging your training.

405
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,460
Everyone has to obey her arrangement.

406
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,320
Yes, sir. I'll complete the task.

407
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,020
Of course.

408
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,170
If you can win the championship,

409
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,840
this month's bonus

410
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,010
will be doubled.

411
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,910
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

412
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,820
Mr. Zhou, we will definitely work hard together.

413
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,550
Come on!

414
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,860
Why

415
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,240
so serious?

416
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,640
Zhiran, here you are.

417
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,710
As soon as Huahua told me, I came.

418
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,860
Of course I have to be here.

419
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,530
And Zhi'ang.

420
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,870
It's about Zhou's honor,

421
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,100
so I have to be here.

422
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,770
Hello, Xiaoxiao.

423
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,510
Alright, now that everyone is here,

424
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,590
let's get started.

425
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,710
Okay, let's go.

426
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,170
Xiaoxiao.

427
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,140

428
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,550

429
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,500
Let's go first.

430
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,930
Come on.

431
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,700
Zhiran runs so fast.

432
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,330
Of course.

433
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,430
He has participated in

434
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,160
college sports competitions.

435
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,450
As his brother, you can't be left behind.

436
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,540
I...

437
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,570
Okay, let's go.

438
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,490
Let's get started.

439
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,020
Hurry up.

440
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,840
Xiaoxiao.

441
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,000
Save it.

442
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,060
Zhou Zhi'ang, why are you so slow?

443
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,280
No, Zhiran runs so fast.

444
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,040
And I'm an athlete in the water.

445
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,070
I hate men

446
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,850
who make excuses for their failures.

447
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,840
Xiaoxiao.

448
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,260
We're here to win.

449
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,520
If not,

450
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,650
just go home.

451
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,300
Xiaoxiao.

452
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,960
Zhou Zhi'ang, if you run so slowly

453
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,040
during the race,

454
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,700
I'll

455
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,450
kick you to death.

456
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,190
Run!

00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,630
I will try my best.

460
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,060
Speed up.

461
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,520
Come on.

462
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,950
Chi, come on.

463
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,550
I'll introduce you to beautiful girls.

464
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,350
I'll take you on a date with them.

I saw that the employees outside were all wearing sportswear.

471
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,150
Why are you in business attire?

472
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,430
Are you pushed aside?

Don't be so polite to me.

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,720
There are two modes of cooperation.

482
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,310
One, give the patent directly to Feiran

483
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,240
for product and R&D.

484

Two,

485
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,260
Xingchen and Feiran open a new sfiliale,

486
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,550
and you will become a shareholder of technology.

Choose one.

488
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,790
To make it simple,

489
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,620
I choose option one.

490
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,870
So straightforward.

492
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,970
You have to know that

493
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,930
everything I do

494
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,040
is for you.

495
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,070
Then just don't charge royalties.

496

I'm not going to charge it.

I am not doing this project

499

for money.

500
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,630
Let me make it clear.

501
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,560
Don't be delusional

502
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,270
because you are not worthy.

503
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,670
I am not worthy?

504
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,880
Do you think you are?

505
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,550
Yes.

Miss Ji stands high above the masses.

507
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,010
Of course I am not worthy.

508
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,300
But your attitude towards me now

509
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,790
is the attitude Zhou Zhifei treated you three years ago.

510
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,650
I feel like I'm perfectly capable

511
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,580
of pulling you into the dirty water

512

Are you not afraid of failing the project

514
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,280
by treating me like this?

515
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,690

just take a look.

524

Why is he cooperating with Feiran on such a good project?

525
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,750
What does he mean?

526
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,110
For me.

527
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,820
Many people like me.

528
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,740
I brought you such a good project

529
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,190
when I first joined Feiran.

530
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,510
Don't treat me badly.

531
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,390
Ji Qing.

532
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,150
If you don't want to have more contact with him,

533
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,550
we can quit this project.

534
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,780
No one dares to force me.

535
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,560
Moreover,

536
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,230
he can't get anything.

537
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,520
He lacks sincerity.

538
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,400
When Feiran chooses partners,

539
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,730
character is an important criterion.

540
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,520
Why are you so indecisive?

541
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,110
Don't you always

542
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,160
put the interests of the company first?

543
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,890
The project of Yundian Village

544
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,510
made me understand a truth.

545
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,120
Shi Huahua?

546
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,320
Forget it.

547
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,820
Anyway, I will proceed with this project.

548
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,600
I will follow up myself.

549
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,930
You know that he is plotting against you,

550
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,070
why do you still do it?

551
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,070
You have no sense of security at all.

552
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,030
Are you worried about me?

553
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,090
You think too much.

554
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,350
Don't worry.

555
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,120
This project

556
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,900
is of no harm to Feiran.

557
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,240
Trust me.

558
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,200
The woman who can help you in the end

559
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,630
is surely me.

560
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,810
Mr. Sun, the project is up to you.

561
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,090
See you next time.

562
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,240
Sure.

563
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,300
Bye.

564
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,850
Mr. Sun, wish you a safe trip.

565
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,490
Okay.

566
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,100
Go back early.

567
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,460
Xiaoxiao, how are you going back?

568
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,190
Someone would pick me up.

569
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,690
We are leaving.

570
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,980
Take care.

571
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,030
Bye.

572
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,740
Bye.

573
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,840
I am drunk.

574
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:56,270
[Didn't you say you'd protect me anytime? Where are you? Come over.]

575
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:56,270
[I am drunk. Come to pick me up.]

576
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:56,270
[Zhou Zhi'ang]

577
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,600
Come to pick me up.

578
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,550
Didn't you say

579
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,120
you would protect me anytime?

580
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,170
Where are you?

581
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,860
Come over.

582
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,050
Xiaoxiao.

583
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,030
Xiaoxiao.

584
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,900
Are you okay?

585
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,030
Here you are.

586
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,050
I don't want to see anyone today

587
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,560
but you.

588
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,710
Get in the car.

589
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,590
You are drunk.

590
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,190
Could you stand up?

591
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,820
I need a hug.

592
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,500
Zhou Zhi'ang, a hug.

593
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,690
Zhou Zhi'ang, a kiss.

594
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,400
A kiss.

595
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,610
A kiss.

596
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,290
You are drunk

597
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,690
and it's not consensual.

598
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,690
I will never take advantage of this.

599
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,740
Go to bed early.

600
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,610
I am leaving.

601
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,430
Sleep?

602
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,520
I haven't removed my makeup yet.

603
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,850
I need to remove my makeup.

604
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,740
Remove makeup.

605
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
No.

606
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,520
Nothing.

607
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,110
Nothing here.

608
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,500
Sleeping without makeup remover will rot my face.

609
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,600
Alright, alright.

610
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,550
Calm down.

611
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,310
I can't sleep.

612
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,830
I have to remove my makeup.

613
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,720
I haven't removed my makeup yet.

614
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,190
Hello, Wang.

615
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,630
I need your favor.

616
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,780
Did you get it?

617
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,430
Yes.

618
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,640
How to use it?

619
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,710
Never mind. I have no idea.

620
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,150
Good luck.

621
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:27,850
Come on.

622
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,740
Xiaoxiao.

623
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,990
Xiaoxiao, wake up.

624
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,100
We can't be late

625
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,740
for today's marathon.

626
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,870
Here.

627
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,310
Take some honey water.

628
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,710
You were drunk last night

629
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,630
and asked me to pick you up.

630
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,880
And you asked me to carry you.

631
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,590
Stop!

632
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,620
What's wrong, Xiaoxiao?

633
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,820
You saw me without makeup.

634
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,030
Is there any difference?

635
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,780
You look beautiful either way.

636
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,420
Zhou Zhi'ang, leave!

637
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:52,610
[Start]

638
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,280
Don't worry.

639
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,370
Mr. Shen.

640
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,230
Isn't today a charity run

641
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,320
organized by our alumni?

642
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,920
What about other companies?

643
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,140
No other companies.

644
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:54,740
Just us.

645
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,500
I lied to you.

646
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,250
What?

647
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,390
I said I lied to you.

648
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,120
If I hadn't used the alumni association as a cover,

649
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,300
it would be impossible for you to come.

650
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,060
Just kidding.

651
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,310
Don't take it seriously.

652
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,860
Is it really hard for you?

653
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,980
Mr. Zhou is as fit as a fiddle.

654
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,860
I have the most say in this matter.

655
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,250
Is this the legendary new spokesperson

656
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,330
of Feiran, Miss Shi Huahua?

657
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,410
Hello, I am from Xingchen Group...

658
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,600
Shen Jun.

659
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,340
Shen Jun.

660
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,510
Mr. Shen, Mr. Zhou

661
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,020
is totally different now.

662
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:23,790
He will impress you

663
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,470
in the next game

664
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,090
and lead Feiran to win the championship.

665
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:27,570
Right?

666
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,250
Yes!

667
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,540
Great.

668
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,410
I really hope to see you

669
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,670
win the championship.

670
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,340
But I have

671
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,960
a very strong support today.

672
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,510
Miss Ji Qing.

673
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,480
[Start]

674
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,830
Miss Ji.

675
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:43,950
Long time no see.

676
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,640
Ji Qing, what's wrong with you?

677
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,830
What's wrong with me?

678
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,970
Last time Huahua beat me in the martial arts competition,

679
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,240
of course

680
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,540
I have to win this time.

681
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,520
Miss Ji.

682
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,960
I don't mind a rematch with you.

683
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,310
But aren't you a member of Feiran?

684
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,770
You are betraying us in this way.

685
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,410
I have shares in Feiran.

686
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,630
And Xingchen as well.

687
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,950
So it's up to me

688
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,600
to choose which side I'm on.

689
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,960
Zhifei.

690
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,530
Ji Qing has chosen me now.

691
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,050
Hope you don't mind.

692
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,300
You two

693
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,980
are a perfect match.

694
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,040
See you at the race course.

695
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,970
Let's go.

696
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,870
[Start]

697
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:27,780
Come on.

698
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,360
