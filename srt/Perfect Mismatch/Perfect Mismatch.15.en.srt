would also experience these confusions and struggles.

174
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,720
Jiayang, you are truly amazing.

175
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,050
For the last two years,

176
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,760
I have been maintaining a positive image

177
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,020
in front of outsiders,

178
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,880
and I felt exhausted occasionally.

179
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,290
Several times I was about to give up,

180
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,990
but luckily, you showed up.

181
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,530
In front of you,

182
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,620
I can completely take off my idol's facade

183
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,350
and be relaxed and comfortable with my real self,

184
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,340
even if the real me is unbearable.

185
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,250
Don't say that, Jiayang.

186
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,890
You already showed great courage

187
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,730
when you overcame yourself.

188
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,380
It was you who gave me the courage.

189
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,540
Huahua.

190
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,240
Would you like to always be with me?

191
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,970
Always be with you?

192
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,390
Huahua, I have feelings for you.

193
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,020
Be my girlfriend.

194
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,200
I-I'm sorry, Jiayang.

195
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,320
This is too abrupt.

196
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,320
Then start thinking about it now.

197
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,710
I've been attracted to you

198
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,580
since the first time you said

199
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,690
you'd help me get back into swimming.

200
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,330
At first,

201
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,510
I thought I had found my opportunity.

202
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,880
It's OK, Huahua.

203
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,910
If you don't feel anything for me,

204
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,570
you can just say so.

205
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,830
I-I've never thought about this before.

206
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,330
I'm sorry, Jiayang.

207
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,180
I

208
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,970
can't reciprocate your feelings.

209
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,530
It's not your fault that you don't feel anything for me.

210
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,470
But,

211
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,440
thank you, Huahua.

212
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,440
I have to go.

213
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,260
Something's on your mind.

214
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,760
What's the matter?

215
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,480
In fact,

216
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,790
someone confessed to me yesterday.

217
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,730
Who?

218
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,100
Jiayang.

219
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,700
I knew it.

220
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,400
Did you accept his feelings?

221
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,270
I...

222
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,200
What's so great about him?

223
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,880
Isn't it that he's just a little taller than me,

224
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,600
runs a little faster than me, and can swim?

225
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,120
You won't be happy being with him.

226
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,250
Shi Huahua, I'm warning you.

227
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,300
You are my senior vice president of administration,

228
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,360
you can't leave me.

229
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,610
I didn't say I'm going to leave you.

230
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,780
I mean you cannot leave me, forever.

231
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,250
Forever?

232
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,250
What...

233
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,950
What do you mean?

234
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,220
M-Mr. Zhou.

235
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,060
Don't go away.

236
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,220
You just said forever.

237
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,350
What does that mean?

238
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,740
Wait, why are you walking so fast?

239
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,700
Make it clear to me.

240
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,170
Mr. Zhou, make it clear to me.

241
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,230
You can't run away.

242
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,100
Mr. Zhou.

243
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,150
Why are you running away?

244
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,150
Can you outrun me?

245
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,210
You just said forever.

246
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,740
What do you mean by forever?

247
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,280
Just the literal meaning.

248
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,630
What does "the literal meaning" mean?

249
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,960
Forever has a lot of meanings.

250
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,300
Forever working for you,

251
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,170
or forever living with you.

252
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:05,980
If you don't make it clear,

253
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,150
how could I know

254
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,660
if what you think is the same as what I think?

255
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,680
Shi Huahua,

256
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,430
what do you mean by that?

257
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,540
Nothing.

258
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,700
Sh-Shi Huahua.

259
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,700
Shi Huahua. Make it clear.

260
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,910
-Nothing.
-Shi Huahua.

261
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,740
Don't follow me.

262
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,400
Shi Huahua.

263
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,700
Shi Huahua, why are you running?

264
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,340
Gimme a certain message, Shi Huahua.

265
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,270
Don't follow me.

266
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,210
Zhou Zhifei.

267
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,760
Are you alright?

268
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,820
My ankle sprained.

269
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,510
Your ankle?

270
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,580
I'll help you stand up. Lemme carry you to the hospital.

271
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,380
Be careful.

272
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,580
Come here.

273
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,140
Shi Huahua,

274
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,820
I have feelings for you.

275
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,350
Would you be my girlfriend?

276
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,590
You clearly care deeply about me,

277
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,850
why don't you admit it?

278
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
You have feelings for me too, right?

279
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,570
It seems

280
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,480
like it.

281
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,430
Really?

282
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,270
I knew it.

283
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,520
Then from now on,

284
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm your boyfriend.

285
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,150
L-let...

286
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,310
Let's get home and take your medicine.

287
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,700
Shi Huahua.

288
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,250
Shi Huahua.

289
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,760
You are my girlfriend, Shi Huahua.

290
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,110
I-I...

291
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,410
-I regretted it.
-Shi Huahua.

292
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,280
I regretted it.

293
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,480
Shi Huahua.

294
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,360
A new phase of my life

295
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,780
is about to begin, right?

296
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,930
Shi Huahua.

297
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,110
You are my senior vice president of administration,

298
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,190
you can't leave me.

299
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,260
I mean you cannot leave, forever.

300
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,870
You clearly care deeply about me,

301
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,300
why don't you admit it?

302
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,000
I have feelings for you.

303
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,530
Would you be my girlfriend?

304
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,140
Gosh,

305
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,630
I can't believe I have a boyfriend.

306
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,800
Give me some music.

307
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,550
Zhou Zhifei.

308
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,710
You've got a girlfriend.

309
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,860
How happy you are.

310
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,320
Why hasn't he gotten up yet?

311
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,570
He can't be sleeping in, can he?

312
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,840
Mr. Zhou, it's time for breakfast.

313
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,620
Morning.

314
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,710
Morning.

315
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,530
I was doing...

316
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,560
Doing morning exercise.

317
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,630
Don't worry.

318
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,340
My lips are sealed.

319
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,740
Do you need any help?

320
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,330
I'm good.

321
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,080
Breakfast will be ready soon, you can have a seat.

322
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,900
You cooked a lot.

323
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,800
I heard the triplets talking earlier that

324
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,310
when you eat with someone you like,

325
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,750
you are going to eat a lot.

326
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,210
Mr. Zhou, do you want to eat this?

327
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,080
I-I'll put it on your side.

328
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,570
Just leave it on your side.

329
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,560
Thank you, Huahua.

330
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,060
What's the matter?

331
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,780
Well, about yesterday...

332
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,910
What's about yesterday?

333
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,850
Are you serious about

334
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,540
what you said yesterday?

335
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,090
Of course I am.

336
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,510
So we're really a couple now?

337
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,320
You are not changing your mind, are you?

338
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,270
No, no.

339
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,860
I just want to make sure.

340
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,360
It's just...

341
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,110
It doesn't feel real.

342
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,590
I am your boyfriend.

343
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,420
You just need to remember that.

344
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:46,770
Well,

345
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,420
I have another question.

346
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,670
Shoot.

347
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,310
Why do you like me?

348
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,590
Because you are...

349
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,570
You have a lot of strength.

350
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,030
Also,

351
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,050
you eat a lot.

352
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,950
For example, no matter how much food is in the fridge,

353
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,020
you can finish it all

354
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,920
and not waste anything,

355
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,570
which I especially like.

356
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,880
Just...

357
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,100
Just because of this?

358
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,670
No other reasons?

359
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,740
Like because I'm cute or pretty?

360
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,130
This is also one of the important reasons.

361
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,450
Come on, eat more.

362
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,400
Eat more.

363
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,290
What are you laughing about?

364
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,420
I'm not laughing.

365
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,600
Right,

366
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,910
with such a handsome boyfriend,

367
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,240
you would wake up laughing in your dreams.

368
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,060
Huahua.

369
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,810
After thorough consideration,

370
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,210
I think it's better not to

371
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,720
let anyone in the company know that we are dating.

372
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,770
Why?

373
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,060
Because I have explicitly prohibited

374
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,310
office romances before,

375
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,280
and I fired some employees

376
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,790
after finding out they were dating in the office.

377
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,580
Then,

378
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,620
you are not thinking about firing me too, right?

379
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,540
Of course not.

380
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,160
We just need to act like we used to

381
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,880
and not let others find out.

382
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:42,640
OK.

383
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,670
Don't worry, Mr. Zhou.

384
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,060
I will certainly cooperate well with you.

385
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,650
Then you can also rest assured that

386
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,530
I will make it up to you later for all the things

387

that couples usually do when dating.

388

What do people usually do

389
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,390
when they are dating?

390
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,500
You've never been in a relationship before?

391

for the next quarter's sales program.

400

They want to know if you would like to attend the meeting.

401

which will definitely make your significant other feel your love.

412
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,550

Yes.

But I don't have time to discuss it with you now.

427

514
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,840
What do you say?

515
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,770
Sounds like a good idea.

516
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:17,910
Great.

517
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,060
Then since it's the lunch break,

518
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,540
let us two besties

519
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,800
go shopping.

520
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,520
Let's go.

521
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,770
Let's go.

522
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,710
What just happened?

523
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,410
I have no clue. I have no clue.

524
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,450
Huahua.

525
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,480
You should pick more clothes today.

526
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:50,110
[d'zzit]

527
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,960
I'm good, Miss Ji.

528
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,390
I'm not short on clothes.

529
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,260
This one looks good on you.

530
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,250
How come you're not short on clothes?

531
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,450
Look at how you usually dress yourself,

532
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,660
it doesn't look good at all.

533
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,260
We'll buy a lot for you today.

534
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,020
This is our new arrival,

535
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,050
see if you like it.

536
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,900
Well, Miss Ji, I'm good, really.

537
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,980
I mean it. I mean it.

538
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,560
M-Miss Ji.

539
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,320
You don't have to pick anymore.

540
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,980
I can't accept gifts from you.

541
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,730
How come?

542
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,150
We are besties after all.

543
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,210
You don't have a pair of black trousers, do you?

544
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:06,810
Hold it.

545
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,450
Are we besties?

546
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,920
Of course we are.

547
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,590
I haven't had many friends since I'm little,

548
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,790
and you caught my eye the most.

549
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,790
You are my bestie.

550
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,520
Fine, even if we are besties,

551
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,610
the relationship between besties is equal.

552
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,730
See, if you buy me so many gifts,

553
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,650
I have to buy you something in return, right?

554
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,950
But I don't think you need anything,

555
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,420
so you really don't need to buy me any gifts.

556
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,180
I need company,

557
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,120
so if I invite you to hang out with me in the future,

558
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,370
you have to go with me.

559
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,550
OK, I promise.

560
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,300
Th-then, you have to promise me as well

561
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,690
that you won't buy these for me.

562
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,240
Why not?

563
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,150
It really isn't necessary.

564
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,640
My apologies. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

565
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,540
[d'zzit]

566
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,260
Wang,

567
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,170
are you sure the flowers have been delivered?

568
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:53,940
Yes.

569
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,420
You can trust me in my work.

570
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,370
Then why haven't I heard anything from her the whole day?

571
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,500
She hasn't contacted me the whole day.

572
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,110
From my experience,

573
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,430
you have to take the initiative in pursuing girls.

574
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,880
You have to see each other often.

575
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,170
Shi Huahua.

576
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,540
You are not allowed to get off work

577
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,750
until you have finished the assignments in this document today.

578
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,390
But I...

579
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,490
You don't have the right to reject me.

580
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,220
Huahua,

581
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,890
what assignments do you have this time?

582
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,130
How about we help you out?

583
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:41,930
It's fine. It's fine.

584
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,210
I'll do it myself.

585
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,380
You should hurry up and get off work.

586
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,280
But can you do it all by yourself?

587
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,880
I have to even if I can't.

588
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,660
After all, I was the one who offended him this afternoon.

589
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,500
So it's right for him to give me a hard time.

590
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,630
It's fine. Don't worry, I can do it.

591
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,450
You can do it, Huahua.

592
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,010
OK.

593
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,090
We'll see you around.

594
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:02,480
OK.

595
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,390
See you.

596
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,150
Bye. Bye.

597
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,830
Goodbye.

598
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,840
Later. Later.

599
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,630
[We'll meet at this park after work and walk home together.]
