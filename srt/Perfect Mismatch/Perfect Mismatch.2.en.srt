She said she came from Jicheng County.

I remember that you

7
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,570
had lived there for a while,

8
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,640
so I took her straight to you.

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,500
Many years have passed,

00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,300

The master of this little girl

14
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,100
is my lifesaver.

15
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,130
Back then,

16
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,639
being young and reckless,

17
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,240
I climbed a mountain and was in danger.

18
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,360
It was Qingquan who put his own safety aside,

19
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,880
climbed on the unstable rock with bare hands,

20
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,550
and carried me down.

21
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,829
After that,

22
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,930
I visited him in the county every year,

23
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,040
but he thought I brought too many gifts,

24
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,640
and said he only did what he was supposed to do at that moment.

25
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,079
When I visited him again,

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,700
he had already gone

27
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,480
and left no trace behind.

28
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,950
Not being able to properly repay my lifesaver

29
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,340
is one of my regrets in my life.

30
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,960
Master had been living in the county when he was young,

31
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,430
but then he moved back to the village.

32
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,630
He said that hidden in the mountains and woods was more to his liking.

33
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,670
Qingquan told me in the letter

34
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,830
that the one he worried about the most

35
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,380
was you, his grandniece.

36
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,040
He asked me to help you as much as I could.

37
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:09,950
OK.

38
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,190

42
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,240
Grandpa, l-look at this little girl,

43
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,960
she's about our age.

44
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,250
If you adopt her as your daughter,

45
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,380
she's gonna be one generation older than my brother and me.

46
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,770
Should we call her aunt?

47
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,960
Besides,

48
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,190
even if we are willing to do that,

49
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,860
she might not be willing to be called that.

50
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,280
That aside, we should settle Huahua down first.

51

Grandpa, you scared her.

58
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,110
Right, Qingquan turned his back on me

59
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,660
since he thought I tend to take care of things too subjectively.

60
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,540

61

00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,510
I feel like I had a terrible nightmare.

344
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,880
What's wrong with me?

345
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,050
You are suffering from qi and blood deficiency

346
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,270
caused by overwork.

347
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,160
Fortunately, I made Zuogui Soup for you.

348
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,330
Shi Huahua?

349
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,580
Mr. Zhou, I'm here. Don't get excited.

350
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,770
Come on, drink this soup.

351
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,440
Don't come over.

352
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,200
Where's Mr. Zhao? How is he?

353
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,470
Mr. Zhao saw you faint and left first.

354
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,000
We'll discuss the matter of the Yingyi Group another day.

355
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,740
Shi Huahua, what in the world are you doing?

356
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,190
Why did you hit

357
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,160
our important partner?

358
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,540
No. I was treating him.

359
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,890
Mr. Zhou, don't get so excited.

360
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,480
You stood up so fast

361
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,280
that you'll get dizzy again.

362
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,220
Drink the medicine first.

363
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,670
No need.

364
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:28,740
So

365
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,850
it was you

366
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,480
who poured the medicine into my cup?

367
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,270
Yes, it's my fault.

368
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,160
I should have told you first.

369
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,840
But I couldn't find you.

370
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,740
Then I was so busy that I forgot it.

371
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,590
Did you clean up the things on my desk too?

372
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,500
Yes.

373
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,600
Who told you to be so reckless?

374
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,350
You.

375
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,620
Me?

376
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,030
Didn't you ask me to be more proactive?

377
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,920
Well, I... I was...

378
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,540
Since I'm already working here,

379
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,210
I hope I can really contribute.

380
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,650
Zihui...

381
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,730
Zihui said that

382
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,470
the job of an assistant

383
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,020
is to take care of every aspect of the boss.

384
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,850
So I organize your things,

385
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,380
take care of your health, and help you save money.

386
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,360
I never said I needed your help.

387
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,300
Wait.

388
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,640
Save money.

389
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,880
What else did you do?

390
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:13,890
How is it?

391
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,400
Did I do a good job?

392
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,760
The dry cleaner said it would take at least four days.

393
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,470
But

394
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,680
I can dry it tomorrow.

395
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,080
My wool suit.

396
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,930
Have you ever seen Mr. Zhou get so angry?

397
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,160
The last time Fei'ang Group poached people,

398
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,190
he was half as angry as he is now.

399
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,890
The HR department fired half of the people at that time.

400
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,560
It seems that Shi Huahua is doomed.

401
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,030
Shi Huahua.

402
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,260
I'm here.

403
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,300
Go, come with me to see Grandpa.

404
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,860
What's going on here?

405
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,070
Go to the other side.

406
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,640
Zhifei, Huahua, why are you here?

407
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,160
Grandpa, let's talk alone.

408
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,040
Let's talk alone.

409
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,710
Zhifei,

410
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,430
why did you bring Huahua back again?

411
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,700
Grandpa, the Shi family has been kind to you.

412
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,150
We should take care of their descendants.

413
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,460
But

414
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,500
I really don't think

415
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,570
this Shi Huahua is suitable to work at Feiran.

416
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,020
Maybe we can

417
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,250
send her to your friend's company,

418
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,380
or not to rush her into society first,

419
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,320
and send her to a university for further education.

420
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,580
It's OK to send her abroad.

421
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
I will pay for the expenses.

422
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,310
Anyway, the farther the better.

423
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,700
Surprise.

424
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,840
Surrender.

425
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,300
Sorry.

426
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,460
Are you okay? Conditioned reflex.

427
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,960
Are you a heroine from a kung fu movie?

428
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,780
That was amazing.

429
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,890
You just appeared from behind me.

430
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,150
That's how a normal person would react, right?

431
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,220
No.

432
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,130
The normal reaction of a young girl

433
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,600
should scream first,

434
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,050
then she'd slap me and say, annoying.

435
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,420
That's right.

436
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,010
Did we meet the other day?

437
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,830
We haven't properly introduced ourselves yet.

438
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,870
My name is Zhou Zhiran.

439
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,970
I'm Zhifei's younger brother.

440
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,700
You can also call me Ran.

441
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,290
Your name is Shi Huahua, right?

442
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,700
Nice to meet you.

443
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,000
In fact,

444
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,830
the first time I saw you before,

445
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,370
I thought you were very interesting.

446
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,560
Looks like Zhifei likes you too.

447
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,740
It's only been two days,

448
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,360
and he's taken you home again.

449
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,650
I don't think Mr. Zhou took me home

450
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,520
because he likes me

451
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,380
for any reason.

452
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,420
Doesn't he?

453
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,650
It seems you don't know my brother very well.

454
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,060
He looks tough,

455
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,300
but inside

456
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,540
he is actually a wooden head,

457
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,880
simple and cute.

458
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,810
Besides,

459
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,250
he's the president of Feiran now.

460
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,790
You are the spokesperson of his company.

461
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,290
That is enough

462
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,330
to make him have butterflies in his stomach.

463
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,530
Butterflies in his stomach?

464
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,430
Why?

465
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,480
Don't you know that?

466
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,420
Because of our dad and mom.

467
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,140
Since I took over Feiran,

468
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,430
I have never met a girl

469
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,540
who behaved so out of line.

470
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,930
Without saying a word,

471
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,930
she replaced my coffee with her Chinese medicine.

472
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,890
Today I had to meet a very important client,

473
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,600
but she stepped on him on the couch.

474
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,570
I still can't figure out

475
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,720
why she even touched my stuff.

476
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,110
Besides,

477
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,010
she was proud of

478
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,280
hand washing my suit.

479
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,500
You know what, Dad?

480
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,650
That product spokesperson you assigned to me

481
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,670
is unbelievable.

482
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,800
She's always arguing with me about everything I say.

483
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,300
Now,

484
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,860
all my schedules

485
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,120
are in a mess

486
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,770
because of her.

487
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,730
She was so proud of

488
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,970
hand washing my suit.

489
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,460
She said I taught her to do that.

490
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,610
I've never said anything like that.

491
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,780
Actually,

492
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,950
our father and mother

493
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,210
were the president and the spokesperson.

494
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,810
So, maybe this fate

495
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,840
can be extended to you and my brother.

496
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,380
No... no way.

497
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,480
Mr. Zhou and I just met.

498
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,980
I came for Grandpa Zhou on the order of my master.

499
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,530
I'm grateful to Grandpa Zhou and Mr. Zhou

500
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,500
for giving me a chance.

501
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,180
But...

502
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,110
Anyway, there is no possibility

503
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,110
for me and Mr. Zhou to be together.

504
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,570
Really?

505
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,190
Yes.

506
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,200
Are you sure?

507
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,760
Yes.

508
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,310
Then I'm relieved.

509
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,560
Nothing.

510
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,180
By the way, you're new here.

511
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,110
You are not familiar with the city yet, right?

512
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:42,900
Let's exchange

513
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,720
our contact number.

514
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,450
I'll show you around in a few days.

515
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,450
No need, that's too much trouble for you.

516
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,370
You don't know

517
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,140
how to use a cell phone, do you?

518
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,150
How come?

519
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,500
Isn't using a cell phone

520
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,700
a necessary skill in the city?

521
00:25:58,970 --> 00:25:59,910
I know how to use it.

522
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,070
Okay.

523
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,870
Ran, what are you doing?

524
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,910
Nothing.

525
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,800
Just talking casually.

526
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,120
Huahua, come here.

527
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,580
Let's go.

528
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,690
Grandpa Zhou, did Mr. Zhou

529
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,940
come to tell on me just now?

530
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,910
I think he's quite unhappy with me.

531
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,340
But in fact,

532
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,240
many things are not like what he saw.

533
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,550
I know.

534
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,200
You don't have to say anything else.

535
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,130
I believe that

536
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,780
you're not as unreasonable as Zhifei said.

537
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,310
I knew right away that you were a good girl.

538
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,940
You must have your reasons for doing what you do.

539
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,880
I won't blame you.

540
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,760
Actually, I just want to have a chat with you.

541
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,120
Chat?

542
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,230
What do you think of Zhifei?

543
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,110
He is good.

544
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,530
Actually, I haven't

545
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,860
talked much with Mr. Zhou.

546
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,000
But he seems like

547
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,080
a very good and powerful person.

548
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,500
Really?

549
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,510
What else?

550
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,290
You can say whatever you want.

551
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,820
Then I'll be frank.

552
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,240
Actually, I'm worried about him.

553
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,520
Worried?

554
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,150
In my opinion,

555
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,640
his body is completely

556
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,580
in a state of sub-health.

557
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,440
He lacks care and attention for his body.

558
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,990
It's not okay.

559
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:50,850
Really?

560
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,260
He's working too hard.

561
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,020
I've heard that

562
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,570
he often works late at night.

563
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,020
And judging from his face,

564
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,570
he must not have rested well.

565
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,950
He doesn't eat three meals a day on time.

566
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,710
And I think

567
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,620
he always gets angry easily,

568
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,700
so it must have something to do with this.

569
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,570
He is now deficient in both qi and blood.

570
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,400
If we don't take care of that in time,

571
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,350
there will be big problems for him in the future.

572
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,380
That's true.

573
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,490
I also feel that Zhifei is not as cheerful as before.

574
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,010
He likes to

575
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,510
take things on his own.

576
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,690
Huahua,

577
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,770
how do you think Zhifei

578
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,560
should take care of himself now?

579
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,330
Grandpa Zhou, in fact,

580
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,830
there are many ways to nourish qi in our Chinese medicine.

581
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,210
These herbs

582
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,130
can only play a supplementary role.

583
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,940
What really helps Mr. Zhou

584
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,150
is actually himself.

585
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,070
He must work and rest regularly and exercise moderately.

586
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,260
He must not be reckless just because he is young.

587
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,480
Otherwise, he will regret it in the future.

588
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,480
But he is as stubborn

589
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,440
as his father.

590
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,540
If only someone could take care of him now.

591
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,610
Huahua,

592
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,020
I have something

593
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,940
to ask you for help.

594
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,130
Mr. Zhou.

595
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,720
Have you arranged a meeting with Mr. Zhao again?

596
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,050
Yes, but...

597
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,400
Let's talk about it in my office.

598
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,440
I didn't get much rest last night.

599
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,230
I need my coffee urgently.

600
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,930
Mr. Zhou, there's something you should know.

601
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,760
Mr. Zhou.

602
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,060
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

603
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,600
Shi Huahua?

604
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,390
Why are you here?

605
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,010
I'm here to work.

606
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,250
Weren't you...

607
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,280
She was...

608
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:21,910
I...

609
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,980
Let me explain it.

610
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,390
According to the request of Chairman Zhou,

611
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,140
Miss Shi Huahua was hired

612
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,480
as Senior Vice President of Administration of Feiran Group.

613
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,370
Effective immediately.

614
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,540
Senior Vice President of what?

615
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,020
Senior Vice President of Administration.

616
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,640
This position never existed in the company.

617
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,700
It was newly set up by Chairman Zhou.

618
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:42,000
Her main responsibility

619
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,720
is to participate in all aspects of your daily work,

620
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,830
and assist you in better organizing your daily schedule.

621
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:46,740
First,

622
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:47,900
I already have my secretary

623
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,210
help me with these things.

624
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,310
Second,

625
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,040
I don't need any help from others at all,

626
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,430
let alone from her.

627
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,140
You need it.

628
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,900
I don't need it.

629
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,850
You do.

630
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,200
I've learned that before

631
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,360
that you barely eat breakfast

632
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,200
and only drink a cup of espresso every morning.

633
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,510
Caffeine is refreshing,

634
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,820
but you know how bad the side effects

635
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,660
are on your body?

636
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,150
Besides,

637
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,250
you often forget the time when you work.

638
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,790
Most of the time, you order take-outs.

639
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:10,740
First of all, you need to

640
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,850
change your diet,

641
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,000
not to mention your schedule.

642
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,150
Zihui can carry out your orders,

643
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,060
but can they monitor you and make demands on you?

644
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,720
They can't.

645
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,240
So Grandpa let me

646
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,870
supervise you.

647
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,070
There is nothing wrong with my body,

648
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,250
I don't need to take care of it.

649
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,110
You do.

650
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,890
No.

651
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,300
Sorry.
