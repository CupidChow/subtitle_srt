5
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,940
Stop!

6
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,910
Don't say yes.

7
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,100
Shi Huahua,

8
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,950
is this what you called

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,310
the best way for everyone?

10
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,840
You should've disappeared

11
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,830
from our lives completely,

12
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,090
instead of standing here

13
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,050
and trying to be my brother's wife.

14
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:05,850
You…

15
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,140
Zhifei, get up.

16
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,790
You played a trick on me.

17
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,690
You're fooling me

18
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,520
with this nobody.

19
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,640
Zhiran,

20
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,370
why did you force Huahua to leave me?

21
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,660
Why?

22
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,950
Zhifei, don't you know

23
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,530
why I did it?

24
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,360
Do you think Shi Huahua is good enough for you?

25
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,390
With straight-A double master's degrees,

26
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,180
you started running Feiran at 22.

27
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,310
You're in charge of hundreds of millions every year.

28
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,040
And her?

29
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,820
She's just a village girl from the mountains.

30
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,980
She has no diploma

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,370
or any ability.

32
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,300
She approaches you

33
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,790
just for your money and property.

34
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,460
Zhifei, you just got carried away.

35
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,450
It's okay, let me help.

36
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,340
I'll help you get rid of this person

37
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,760
who shouldn't exist in the first place.

38
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,110
Zhou Zhiran, grow up already.

39
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,520
Don't you know how important

40
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,990
Huahua is to Zhifei?

41
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,450
Zhiran,

42
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,510
you grew up with Zhifei.

43
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,090
Now he found

44
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,070
someone he likes,

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,750
how can you break them up?

46
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,740
And I saw

47
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,110
how sad and heartbroken she was

48
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,070
when you showed Miss Shi

49
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,560
the wounds on your arm.

50
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,079
Wounds?

51
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,500
Wait.

52
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,990
Zhiran,

53
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,670
did you do all these

54
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,130
because you like Shi Huahua?

55
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,110
I like her?

56
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,250
How is that possible?

57
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,330
How could I like such a person?

58
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,370
It's all because

59
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,720
she came out of nowhere,

60
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,790
became Feiran's spokesperson,

61
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,320
and threw herself at you.

62
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,220
You talk about her all the time

63
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,590
even when you're with me.

64
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,190
I worked so hard

65
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,660
to finish school early and come home.

66
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,610
You didn't say a word.

67
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,270
She's the only one

68
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,960
you care about.

69
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,530
And,

70
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,690
I was the last to know about

71
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,100
you two being together.

72
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,070
Zhifei,

73
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,540
am I still

74
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,470
the younger brother that you like?

75
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,710
Zhiran.

76
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,810
That's why I approached her

77
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,870
and studied her

78
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,890
to find her weaknesses.

79
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,330
I said I liked her,

80
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,180
that's simply because

81
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,460
I wanted her to consider our brotherhood

82
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,970
and leave you.

83
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:00,720
Zhiran,

84
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,450
I'm sorry that I ignored

85
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,250
your feelings.

86
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,330
But I really love Huahua.

87
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,170
I'll spend the rest of my life with her.

88
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,260
She'll be our family

89
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,580
and your sister-in-law.

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
No.

91
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,100
I'd rather you be with Xiaoxiao

92
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,300
or Ji Qing.

93
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,540
I don't want you

94
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,330
to be with this Shi Huahua.

95
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,400
She's just nobody.

96
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,030
She's not good enough for you.

97
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,640
She will only suck you dry,

98
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,460
make you unlike

99
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,450
the Zhou Zhifei I know,

100
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,850
and ruin our relationship.

101
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,510
She's a monster.

102
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,930
She should get lost!

103
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,180
Zhou Zhiran!

104
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,400
Zhifei.

105
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,830
I've been

106
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,060
working so hard

107
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,080
to give you a better life.

108
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,180
I've tried so hard to give you double the love

109
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,310
because I hope

110
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,880
you won't feel inferior because our parents passed away.

111
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,860
I want you

112
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,290
to grow up like a normal child.

113
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,550
But now,

114
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,990
you disappointed me so much.

115
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,520
Zhifei,

116
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,380
don't you think I'm disappointed?

117
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,870
My two most beloved brothers

118
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,360
betrayed me

119
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,640
and played me like a fool.

120
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,500
Don't you think I'm disappointed?

121
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,090
Zhiran.

122
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,220
Zhifei.

123
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,810
Zhifei.

124
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,430
Zhifei. Zhifei.

125
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,820
-Zhifei.
-Zhifei.

126
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,110
Get out of the way.

127
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,309
Zhifei, wake up.

128
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,480
Zhifei.

129
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,270
Please wake up.

130
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,370
Zhifei.

131
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,250
Zhifei.

132
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,900
Are you all right?

133
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,530
Zhifei, you're awake.

134
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,260
Zhifei.

135
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,640
Zhifei.

136
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,480
What's wrong?

137
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,550
Fei.

138
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,150
Huahua.

139
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,440
Fei, don't be afraid.

140
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,950
I'm here for you.

141
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,460
Don't be afraid.

142
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,980
Fei?

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,430
Why do you call him Fei?

144
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,020
What's going on here?

145
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,870
Don't be so loud.

146
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,020
You'll scare him.

147
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,400
I know it's hard for you to accept.

148
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,780
But your brother now

149
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,800
is different

150
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,050
from the way he always is.

151
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,360
Right now,

152
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,700
he's just a kid.

153
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,240
A kid?

154
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,880
When your parents had the accident,

155
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,300
you were too young to remember.

156
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,520
But Zhifei

157
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,190
witnessed the whole thing.

158
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,180
And he was

159
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,140
seriously traumatized by it.

160
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,210
After that, every time he saw blood,

161
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,840
his body triggered a stress response

162
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,750
and became

163
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,170
what you see now.

164
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,670
Huahua,

165
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,820
who is he?

166
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,700
I'm so scared.

167
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,510
Zhifei, it's me.

168
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,280
I'm Zhiran. Your brother.

169
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,500
Don't look, don't look.

170
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,130
Zhifei, it's me, Zhiran.

171
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,390
He doesn't remember you now.

172
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,720
It's all right.

173
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,350
How can my brother not remember me?

174
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,290
Are you guys fooling me again?

175
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,390
How can my brother not remember me?

176
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,960
Impossible.

177
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,080
Okay, Fei, he's gone.

178
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,200
Don't be afraid.

179
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,640
It's all right. Don't be afraid.

180
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,090
Zhifei, I don't want to go to school.

181
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,530
They said I'm a wild kid.

182
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,140
But I'm not.

183
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,720
Of course you're not a wild kid.

184
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,370
Why do all the other kids

185
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,210
have mom and dad,

186
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,180
but we don't?

187
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,190
Why?

188
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,140
You have a brother.

189
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,130
I will always be there for you,

190
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,120
okay?

191
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,220
Thank you, Zhifei.

192
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,130
You're welcome.

193
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,940
What did you promise me yesterday?

194
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,390
Zhiran,

195
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,460
you're a big boy now.

196
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,340
We can't share a room anymore.

197
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,190
Good night, Zhifei.

198
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,620
Good night, Zhiran.

199
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,710
Zhiran, are you home?

200
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,920
I knew you're home.

201
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,220
You don't want to open the door, do you?

202
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,720
You don't even listen to me anymore.

203
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,270
Good for you.

204
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,940
You think you can stop me

205
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,620
just because you don't open the door?

206
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,290
I'm telling you, you're too young.

207
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,740
There's plenty I can do to deal with you.

208
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,930
Get up.

209
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,530
Get up.

210
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,240
Come here.

211
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,820
Have some.

212
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,500
Your favorite.

213
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,360
Well,

214
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,700
you've been spoiled

215
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,130
by Zhifei since you were little.

216
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,810
Aren't you too old

217
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,800
for that?

218
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,130
What a baby.

219
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,140
You grew up with Zhifei

220
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,460
who's been a father and a brother to you.

221
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,700
Now he is in love,

222
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,160
and it is normal for you to feel lost.

223
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,140
Zhiran,

224
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,720
Zhifei is almost 30,

225
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,830
and he will get married sooner or later.

226
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,830
Now he found someone he likes.

227
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,590
Huahua is a good girl.

228
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,090
It's nice to have her as your sister-in-law.

229
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,070
Why are you all

230
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,570
speaking up for her?

231
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,770
Zhiran,

232
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,770
you know,

233
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,600
many girls are pursuing Zhifei,

234
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,580
but he doesn't even look at them.

235
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,630
When Huahua showed up,

236
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,320
he fell in love at first sight.

237
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,260
Even if you don't believe us,

238
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,240
you have to believe Grandpa, right?

239
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,180
So you think

240
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,180
it's the right decision

241
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,970
for them to be together?

242
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,630
There's more.

243
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,290
Your brother's stubborn.

244
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,710
He listens to no one

245
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,160
but Huahua.

246
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,450
Now he has someone

247
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,710
who can share his worries

248
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,500
and help him manage the company.

249
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,350
You should be happy for him.

250
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,390
Yeah.

251
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,340
How come

252
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:34,840
no one told me this earlier?

253
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,630
It's not too late now.

254
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,910
All right.

255
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,090
After you figure it out,

256
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,220
just go apologize to Zhifei and Huahua.

257
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,260
You're family after all.

258
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,770
And you'll be much happier

259
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,410
having two people

260
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,630
taking care of you.

261
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,250
Okay, I got to go.

262
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,180
Cheer up, okay?

263
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,280
Bye.

264
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,720
Zhifei, you're awake.

265
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,510
So Zhi'ang and Zhiran

266
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,390
know it too, right?

267
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,440
It seems Zhiran couldn't accept it for now.

268
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,500
Huahua,

269
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,500
I'd like to be alone for a little while.

270
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,140
Don't move.

271
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,910
Let me recharge.

272
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,890
Here's more energy for you.

273
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,320
Huahua, I'm sorry

274
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,190
for making you worry about me.

275
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,670
I always thought I was a good brother.

276
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,450
Actually, I wasn't.

277
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,940
Don't say that.

278
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,050
You've done a great job.

279
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,060
When my parents left,

280
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,730
Zhiran was only a few months old.

281
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,080
Watching him crying in my arms,

282
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,050
I swore

283
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,920
to give him the best life possible

284
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,650
and all my love

285
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,110
so that he wouldn't think

286
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,480
he's different from other kids.

287
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,450
So I focused

288
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,460
all my time, energy,

289
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,130
and emotions on him.

290
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,520
Now that I think about it,

291
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,530
it was me who ruined him.

292
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,230
I knew he'd rely on me,

293
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,180
but I didn't stop him in time.

294
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,630
I didn't

295
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,440
guide Zhiran well.

296
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,810
I think

297
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,990
you need to talk about it.

298
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,130
But not now.

299
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,170
We both need

300
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,870
some time to calm down.

301
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,660
Huahua,

302
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,700
Zhiran is not a bad kid.

303
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,540
Don't be mad at him, okay?

304
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,010
Of course I won't.

305
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,490
You said,

306
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,060
we are family.

307
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,570
I'm here for you.

I've been waiting for you.

I'm not interested in you.

Ji Qing,

332
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,380
you put such a large sum of money in our group.

333
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,050
You really trust our Zhou family.

What do you mean?

335

Grandpa is getting old,

yet the successor of Zhou Holdings is not settled.

337

Don't you worry at all?

338

Zhi'ang is not

339

a businessman,

340
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,560
and you are still young.

Who else could it be but Zhou Zhifei?

342
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,170
There's nothing to wonder about.

343
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,690
Ji Qing,

344
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,750
it seems you don't know my brother well enough.

345
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,770
What makes you say that?

346
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,280

Mr. Shen, he's here.

351
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,210
Isn't this Zhiran as in Feiran?

352
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,150
Exactly.

353
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,180
It seems you're impressed with me.

354
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,220
Kid, I'm pretty busy right now.

On the surface, you're attracted to Ji Qing

sweetener patent to Feiran Capital,

365
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,460
however, you secretly

366
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,930
exchanged our shares.

367
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,760
Congratulations on all that.

368
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,560
That was a nice trick you played, Mr. Shen.

369
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,630

according to the law.

372

Even if the Zhou Group

373
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,910
is the issuer of the stock,

374
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,110
you have no right to interfere.

375
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,230
You're overthinking it.

376
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,330
Just 2.5 percent.

377
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,880

378
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,440
if it's in your hands.

379
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,840
But,

380
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,140
do you really want my brother

381
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,480
to take charge of your money?

382
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,510

If it's announced now,

394
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,580
it's probably him.

395
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,720
It won't do us any good.

396
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,300
We need to do something about it.

397
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,910
Maybe get something against him.

398
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:45,110
Don't just focus on that.

399
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,500
We have to make sure nothing goes wrong.

400

00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,460
I finished my dual degree in business administration

412

413
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,130
and my research project has been going well recently.

414
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,400
I think

415
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,570
I'll come to the company more often later.

416
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,860
So you're coming

417
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,920

418
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,750
Internship?

419
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,330
Can I do an internship for the position of president?

420
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,840
Zhiran,

421
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,090
are you kidding?

422
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,860
Do you want to replace your brother?

423
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,500
Can't I?

424
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,860
I'm sure you will come to attend

Grandpa sent me to tell you.

430
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,380
Remember to come,

431
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,500
Uncle, Aunt.

432
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,300
We should call Dad and ask.

433
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,200
No.

434
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,570
Didn't you say

435
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,820
we need something against Zhou Zhifei?

436
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,860
Whether it's true or not,

437

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,150
they'll get the blame for

the bad blood between brothers.

442

This is the last thing Dad wants to see.

At that time,

444
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,770
Zhi'ang will be

when Zhi'ang went to see him yesterday,

00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,880
he was nice to him.

453

Maybe he just doesn't know

how to face you.

455

To be honest,

I don't know how to face him, either.

I don't even recognize this brother

you can be Fei sometimes.

463
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,380
So there must be a reason

464
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,450
why he refused to communicate.

Can we talk?

471
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,540
When you were little,

472
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,050
you were very clingy to me.

473
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,040
Zhifei,

474
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,380
you know what?

475
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,110
When I was a kid, all I wished for every day was to grow up fast

476
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,020
so I can share it with you earlier.

477

But now that I'm grown up,

478
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,320
it seems I'm getting farther and farther away from you.

479
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,130
I can't believe

480
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,520
I didn't know something as big as this.

481
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,970
Zhiran,

482
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,000
I didn't mean

483
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,220
to hide it from you.

484
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,870
I didn't tell you

485
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,220
because you are my beloved little brother,

486
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,690
and I don't want you to worry about me.

487
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,670
So,

488
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,130
if I hadn't seen it yesterday,

489
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,250
you would've hidden it from me for life?

490
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:13,900
Yes.

491
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,070
It turns out that in your eyes,

492
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,740
I'm still the timid kid

493
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,610

494
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,710
That's not what I meant.

495
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,890
Then what do you mean?

496
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,920
You say

497
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,310
I'm the closest person to you in the world,

498
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,290
then what?

499
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,300
You carry it all on your own.

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,010
Is this what the closest person means to you?

I told you everything.

But what about you?

You only told me good news.

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,040
To stand up for me,

521
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,690
you were injured during fights.

522
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,020
You hid in your room

523
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,390
to apply medicine.

524
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,930
When you had a fever and couldn't walk,

525
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,690
you still insisted on taking me to school.

526
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,520
When you first took over Feiran,

527
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,520
you got an ulcer from socializing every day.

528
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,670
But you would rather let Chi go with you

529
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,580
than tell me.

530
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,550
You wiped out all the bad things

531
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,170
from my world.

532
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,050
Do you think

533
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,300
that would make me happy?

534
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,060
I worked hard

535
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,700
to become excellent

536
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,220
and skipped several grades to get a double-major diploma,

537
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,050
so that one day,

538
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,720
I can proudly step into Feiran

539
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,900
and fight side by side with you.

540
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,120
I want to show you that

541
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,590
I accept your protection,

542
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,640
I can also be your shelter.

543
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,640
I am

544
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,190
the one who is most qualified

545
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,460
to stand by your side.

546
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,740
I'm sorry.

547
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,210
It's all my fault.

548
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,850
I didn't even notice

549
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,140
my little brother had grown up long ago.

550
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,580
Zhifei, you've done nothing wrong.

551
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,090
You just never believed I could make it.

552
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,480
I want to accept that

553
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,200
I stand at your side.

554
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,800
But I can't accept that

555
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,940
you carry it all on your own every day

556
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,140
and make me stay behind you.

557
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,110
Zhifei, you should go.

558
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,980
I need a few minutes alone.

559
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,990
Go.

560
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,360
Zhifei,

561
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,590
you pushed me to this.

562
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,060
I'm sorry.
