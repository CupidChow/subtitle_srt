please put on our traditional costume.

520
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,240
This is our highest welcome etiquette.

521
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,630
Please change your clothes.

522
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,870
This is Miss Shi's clothes.

523
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,980
Thank you. Thank you.

524
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,040
This is Mr. Zhou's.

525
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,280
You get changed first.

526
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,370
This is Mr. Zhou's room.

527
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,200
Miss Shi, that's your room.

528
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,670
Okay, thank you.

529
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,620
Please change your clothes.

530
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,080
See you later.

531
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,080
Okay.

532
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:32,760
Let's go.

533
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,910
Let's go.

534
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,500
Mr. Zhou,

535
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,030
I'll put all your things inside.

536
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,350
Mr. Zhou, let's change our clothes.

537
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,610
What's this?

538
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,440
Too ugly.

539
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,830
I don't want to change.

540
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,250
Mr. Zhou,

541
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,070
have you ever heard the saying,

542
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,030
a handsome man looks good even in a sack?

543
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,490
Are you

544
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,800
not confident in your face?

545
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,850
Look at my face and my body.

546
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,100
Wait here.

547
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,720
Mr. Zhou, are you ready?

548
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:36,860
Come in.

549
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,520
What's wrong?

550
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,790
Check the button for me.

551
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,410
It's too tight.

552
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,210
I can't buckle it.

553
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,940
So annoying.

554
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,980
Why are you laughing?

555
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,500
As an adult,

556
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,600
can't you even fasten the buttons?

557
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,410
Do it for me.

558
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,280
Me?

559
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,220
All right.

560
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,850
Your buttons are all misplaced.

561
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,680
What are you doing?

562
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,600
Mr. Zhou.

563
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,840
Shi Huahua, I warn you that

564
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,300
sexual harassment is illegal.

565
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:17,980
No.

566
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,450
I just didn't expect you to be deficient in qi and blood,

567
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,620
but your pectoral and abdominal muscles can be so strong.

568
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,800
Of course.

569
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,730
I am outstanding in everything.

570
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,210
Let me see it again.

571
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,550
Let me take a look.

572
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,860
Don't do that.

573
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,870
I... I'm not.

574
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,100
I just rarely meet someone

575
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
so suitable for martial arts as you.

576
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,210
Mr. Zhou,

577
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,790
why don't you practice martial arts with me?

578
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,470
Seriously.

579
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,460
I can teach you our Shi's 24 fist positions,

580
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,250
which can strengthen your body and mind.

581
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:42,910
How's that?

582
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,770
I don't need it. Stay away from me.

583
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,050
Then how can I help you tie your buttons?

584
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,060
Let me tie up your buttons first.

585
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,130
No need.

586
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:50,960
Why?

587
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,650
Didn't you ask me to do it?

588
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,660
I...

589
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,700
I...

590
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,370
I can do it.

591
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:54,930
No need.

592
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:55,880
Don't move.

593
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,700
Are you going to eat naked?

594
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,870
It's okay.

595
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,990
I just came to inform you that

596
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,310
it's time for dinner.

597
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,400
I'll do it myself.

598
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,780
Shi's 24 fist positions.

599
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,220
Think about it.

600
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,160
Mr. Zhou, hurry up.

601
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,030
What kind of clothes is this?

602
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,870
It's perfect for you.

603
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,430
It's so ugly.

604
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,700
I don't think so.

605
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,600
Shi Huahua, I seriously doubt your aesthetics.

606
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,800
What's wrong with my aesthetics?

607
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,260
You should wear more plain clothes like this,

608
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,990
and less of your fancy clothes.

609
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,320
Village Chief.

610
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,170
Mr. Zhou.

611
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,040
Miss Shi.

612
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,220
Come on, come over.

613
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,290
Are you going to faint again?

614
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,150
No way.

615
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,460
Village Chief.

616
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,280
Return the gift.

617
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,190
Mr. Zhou,

618
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,480
according to our village tradition,

619
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,670
after the guests come

620
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,600
to wash and change clothes, you have to return a gift,

621
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,360
which is to perform a show.

622
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,360
If you can't,

623
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,750
just say a few words.

624
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,350
Okay, then I'll...

625
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,360
Let me do it first.

626
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:34,650
Okay.

627
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,460
Thank you.

628
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,160
Come on.

629
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,660
Thank you.

630
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,400
Come all over here.

631
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,360
Great!

632
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,520
Come over here.

633
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,600
Come on.

634
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,160
Come over here.

635
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,490
Watch Miss Shi perform.

636
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,310
Come on.

637
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,380
Great!

638
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,120
Well done!

639
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:00,930
Great.

640
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,430
Really different.

641
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,480
Yes.

642
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,780
Great!

643
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:06,480
So great.

644
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,540
We should learn from her.

645
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,390
Great!

646
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,610
Mr. Zhou, you should also participate.

647
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,280
Right?

648
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:15,940
Yes.

649
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,050
Come on.

650
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,150
Go up, go up.

651
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,420
Go up, go up, go up.

652
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,480
I'll teach you.

653
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,020
Come on, learn from me.
