00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,170
chose a spokesperson for your dad.

175
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,860
As soon as your dad met your mum, you were born.

176
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,870
Your description is a bit quick, isn't it?

177
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,840
So,

178
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,560
if we did get together,

179
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,570
as I have so many rumoured boyfriends,

180
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,540
your grandfather would throw a big check in front of me

181
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,870
to force me to leave you.

182
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,900
I don't care what Grandpa thinks.

183
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,700
But I really don't have any plans to start a family right now.

184
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,870
And I really hate

185
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,420
this kind of arranged marriage.

186
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,320
You don't let your family introduce any girls to you,

187
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,450
and you even never go out to socialize.

188
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,840
Are you waiting for Mrs. Zhou to

189
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,950
fall from the sky?

190
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,240
It doesn't matter, just don't hit me.

191

00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,510
Hello. What can I do for you?

195

Can I come in? I'm looking for someone.

You're not doing live streaming, are you?

Where's the camera on your body?

203

I'm really looking for Zhou Hongsheng.

My master and he are good friends.

205

I've got a letter here

206
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,910
that my master asked me to give it to him.

207

Come on, don't make up stories with me.

208

you can call him.

210
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,690
Just ask him to send someone down to pick you up, that's all.

211
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,830
But I don't have his contact details.

You're so considerate.

It's good to be in charge, isn't it?

Not bad at all, Grandpa.

If I could be freer to show my talent,

255

Don't worry about that, Grandpa.

Then what should I worry about?

266
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,490
Worry about

267
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,180
how many cents the Group's stock went up?

268
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,910
Or how many cents did it go down?

market capitalisation or personal assets

271

All you eat is three meals a day.

All your sleep is in a bed.

All you think about every day

275

354
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,720
What's wrong, Miss Lin?

355
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,670
Xiaoxiao, what should we do?

356
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,860
Don't panic.

357
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,710

358
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,860
Go on.

As long as the numbers you said remain the same,

360
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,600
I promise to screw up this show.

361

Yes, what should we do?

What should we do? What should we do?

368
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,380
Should we call an ambulance?

369
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,950
Should we?

370

Don't panic.

380
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,390
Miss Lin is deficient of both qi and blood.

381
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,490
Let me help her to relax her muscles and bones.

382
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,320
She'll be fine in no time.

383

Who are you? Are you sick?

384
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,090
Miss Lin looks so good now.

385
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,580
Then you should get ready.

386
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,570
There are so many people waiting to see you perform.

387
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,760
It's not a virtue to fail to keep your word.

388

You're all bullying me!

390
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,310
I can't perform now.

391
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,240
I'm sure I can't dance.

392

It's your business.

397
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,310
Just let someone announce that the show is cancelled today.

398

514
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,110
to surprise you.

515
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,220
For this side, you already lost.

516
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,160
It seems that your chess practice

517
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,930
is not very effective.

518
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,670
Grandpa, I retract a move.

519
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,020
You brat.

520
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,830
How could you regret?

521
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,250
How many years have you played chess?

522
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,700
I'm still a green hand.

523
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,950
Chairman, Zhifei is back.

524
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,790
And he's brought a girl with him.

525
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,670
That's something new.

526
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,320
This dog and the one in your office are a pair, right?

527
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,290
They were bought by Grandpa.

528
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,070
And it used to be his office.

529
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,080
So your company

530
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,560
is the same as our Shi's kung fu.

531
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,180
It's been passed down from generation to generation?

532
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,950
No.

533
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,600
Isn't it?

534
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,900
You... your grandfather passed it on to your father.

535
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,420
And your father passed it on to you.

536
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,180
Business management is not a hereditary system.

537
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,270
You have to be good enough to become the boss.

538
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,390
But you have the privilege, right?

539
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,290
Just like me.

540
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,380
In my village,

541
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,530
when I was young, there were so many boys who were stronger than me.

542
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,840
They all wanted to learn Shi's kung fu.

543
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,060
But my master turned them down

544
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,410
just because I was the girl from the Shi family.

545
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,600
And he, as my uncle,

546
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,590
had to teach it to me.

547
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,900
You can't say

548
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,660
there are so many talents in this world

549
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,520
and you're the heir to the family.

550
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,630
Then you're the most suitable person in the world

551
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,590
for this position.

552
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,050
Just because I'm the heir,

553
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,140
I have to be...

554
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,870
Are you angry?

555
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,840
I didn't say anything.

556
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,890
At the company before,

557
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,610
you looked angry too.

558
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,070
You're so irritable.

559
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,600
Prosperity of hepatic fire?

560
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,960
You usually don't sleep well?

561
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,400
Do you often have a dry mouth?

562
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,660
Do you have dry stools?

563
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,080
Zhifei,

564
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,290
why are you back?

565
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:52,820
Grandpa.

566
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,140
Zhiran, what are you doing here?

567
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,450
Don't you have class today?

568
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,900
We have a visiting professor today,

569
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,530
whose lecture is so boring.

570
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,140
So I skipped it.

571
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,790
How could you skip class?

572
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,970
It's okay.

573
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,370
Zhiran knows I'm back.

574
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,650
He wanted to see me.

575
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,970
Cut him some slack.

576
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,310
Who's this little girl?

577
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,880
You must be Grandpa Zhou.

578
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,690
Hello, Grandpa Zhou. My name is Shi Huahua.

579
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,290
My master asked me to see you.

580
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,420
Master?

581
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,830
Who is your master?

582
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,960
My master's name is Shi Qingquan.

583
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,620
He says he's a very good friend of yours.

584
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,270
By the way, there's a letter here.

585
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,260
Master asked me to bring it to you.

586
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,660
[To Zhou Hongsheng]

587
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,470
Qingquan.
