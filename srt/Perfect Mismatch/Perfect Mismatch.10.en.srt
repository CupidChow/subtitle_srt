00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,580
Mr. Zhou.

00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,460
Shi Huahua.

7
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,500
Do you know what time it is?

00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,560
What are you doing?

9
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,500
I called you at your bedroom door several times,

10
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,120
but you didn't answer me.

11
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,130
I had no choice but to do this.

12
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,630
Mr. Zhou, you can't sleep anymore.

13
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,260
Why?

14
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,220
It's the weekend.

15
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,280
But it's time for your morning class.

16
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,290
Morning class?

17
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,540
How come I didn't know?

18
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,940
I made it for you last night.

19
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,400
According to your work schedule

20
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,770
and your break time,

21
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,380
I made you a customized

22
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,010
physical fitness schedule.

23
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,170
From now on, every morning

24
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,600
you have to exercise in the nearby park

25
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,350
with me.

26
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,280
I don't need it. I have a personal trainer.

27
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,240
I take gym classes every week.

28
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,300
That's different.

29
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,620
What you need more is to be in nature.

30
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,380
As the sun rises and the moon sets each day,

31
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,850
you need to absorb the essence of heaven and earth

32
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,190
to cultivate your mind, energy, strength and spirit.

33
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,190
Ultimately you can achieve harmony between yin and yang,

34
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,620
man and nature.

35
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,340
I'll say it one last time,

36
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,620
I don't need it.

38
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,290
Mr. Zhou, hurry!

39
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:04,940
No!

40

Come on, Mr. Zhou. Straighten your back and throw a punch.

Higher.

51
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,560
You can do it. Mr. Zhou. Come on.

52
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,030

53
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,200
I can't do it anymore, Shi Huahua.

Shi Huahua, what are you doing?

60
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,820
Mr. Zhou.

61
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
When I moved into your house yesterday,

62
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,370
I noticed that the feng shui here was not good.

63
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,320
Are you superstitious?

64
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,660
Mr. Zhou, don't slump here.

65
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,079
Hurry up!

66
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,410
Help me move it.

67
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,180
Where are you going?

68
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,930
I'm going to take a bath.

69
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,390
Do you want to come with me?

70
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,790
Hurry up, then.

71
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,019
She moved into my house without my permission.

72
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,500
The so-called physical fitness program

73
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,450
is even stricter than military training.

74
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,100
I am the president.

75
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,400
How could I be abused by her every day?

76
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,060
You...

77
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,080
Why did you come out without your clothes on?

78
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,290
This is my home.

79
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,680
I can do whatever I want.

80
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,670
I don't wear clothes at home.

81
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,300
If you want to live in my house,

82
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,340
just get used to it.

83
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,460
How can I get used to this?

84
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,860
It burns my eyes.

85
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,650
Pardon?

86
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,909
It burns your eyes?

87
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,000
What are you doing?

88
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,450
Take a look.

89

You're so lucky to see my perfect figure.

90
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,240
How dare you say it burns your eyes!

91
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,490
Are you crazy? I don't want to see it!

92
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,060
Let go of me!

93
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,170

I'm warning you.

95
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,700
I won't do that again.

96
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,580
Then... let's eat.

97
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,390

98
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,620
Come in.

99
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,800
Straighten your back.

100
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,550
Raise your head.

Shoulders down.

102
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,600
Don't cross your legs.

103
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,900
Straighten up.

Were we enemies in the past life?

106
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,980
Mr. Zhou, I'm doing this for your own good.

107
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,420
You're not sitting right.

108
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,160
Not only will your bones and muscles be deformed,

109
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,770
but your internal organs will be damaged.

110
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,690
I'm here to bring you some water.

111
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,020
Come on, drink your water.

112
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,350
Drinking warm water is good for your body.

113
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,850

Why is the power out?

117
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,760
It's not a blackout.

118
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,310
I turned off the switch.

119
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,460
Why?

120
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,540
It's time to turn off the lights.

121
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,180
Didn't you read

122
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,530
the physical fitness schedule I gave you?

123
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,800
Ren Liwei?

124
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,620
You mean the one from Qingyuan Water Plant?

125
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,250
Yes.

126
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,920
He knew we are developing a new product.

127
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,550
So he reached out to me

128
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,800
and said he wanted to transfer

129
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,640
the Water Plant Group.

130
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,020
When the Light Oxygen Series was first launched two years ago,

131
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,730
I did have an interest in their Water Plant.

132
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,240
But at that time he was not willing to sell it.

133
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,840
You said it was two years ago.

134
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,380
Times have changed.

135
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,240
Furthermore,

136
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,950
Qingyuan Water Plant is next to our R&D centre.

137
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,340
We would save a lot of money

138
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,540
in transportation.

139
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,490
I've made a rough estimation that

140
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,900
we could reduce costs by 10%.

141
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,480
If I'd known you had a more suitable plan B,

142
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,190
I wouldn't have gone to that shitty Yundian Village.

143
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,850
Well, I can't be predictable.

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,990
Besides...

145
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,960
With Huahua with you,

146
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,170
what's wrong with an in-depth tour of the countryside?

147
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,340
It's a nightmare.

148
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,450
But I saw that Huahua

149
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,740
was in a good mood.

150
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,550
She...

151
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,260
Why do you care about her?

152
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,810
New product development is the priority now.

153
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,659
If there's no problem with Qingyuan Water Plant,

154
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,840
we must finalize the deal as soon as possible.

155
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,580
I've already sent someone to do a preliminary investigation.

156
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,080
Its qualifications are complete,

157
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,860
so its quality can be guaranteed.

158
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,460
Good.

159

I'll meet him personally.

00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,340
Yes.

163
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,990
I got the package.

164
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,900
They're my medical books.

165
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,890
Don't worry.

166

do you have any other photos?

I've never seen Mr. Zhou wearing such clothes.

Sure.

You rise and fall together.

He's a lustful and lascivious man.

It's better not to publicize the molestation.

So?

358
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,970
Just because he looked at you one more time,

359
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,040
you think he's a pervert?

360

Xiaoxiao,

369
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,160
you've done a very detailed investigation

370

of Qiangyuan Water Plant and Ren Liwei.

371
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,430
All the figures show that if we acquire it,

372
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,820
it would be extremely cost-effective.

373
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,620
There is no need

374

to waste time

375
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,540

But I know that character shows the true person.

379

Ren Liwei has no class.

380
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,349
Such person

381
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,930
isn't worth working with.

382
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,050
It's not up to you to decide if he's worth working with.

383
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,880

After all, Huahua is well-meaning.

Zhifei,

393
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,040
you've always been cautious when it comes to investments and partnerships.

394
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,270
So we'd better look deeper into Ren Liwei's personal life.

You don't like my medicine, do you?

It's up to me whether I like it or not.

The medicine you are decocting

519
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,040
isn't poisonous, is it?

520

I didn't want you to follow Ren Liwei.

Why are you so angry?

522
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,240
I'm angry because you don't distinguish between good and evil

523
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,620
and insist on working with such a cheater.

what this man's personal life is like

Do you want to be a successful man

but with a moral blemish?

533
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,860
Of course not.

534
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,060
But if you work with people like this,

535
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,750
you're actually conniving with them.

536
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,050
You make them think

537
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,110
that even if they don't discipline themselves morally,

538
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,920
they can still get money, fame and status.

539
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,860
In this way, morality

540
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,830
is worth nothing.

541
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,080
The values of society will collapse.

542
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,280
It's just a collaboration.

she didn't want people to see you coming to Feiran to see her.

At first, I misunderstood her when I heard that.

Then I went back and thought about it.

582
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,790
Doesn't that mean she has feelings for me?

Depending on the stress of this sentence,

594
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,470
there are several interpretations.

595
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,130
The first is

596
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,390
she didn't want anyone to see me coming to “Feiran” to see her.

597
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,690
This means that

598
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,580
she actually wants to see me

599
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,570

Sure.

There's a second interpretation.

She didn't want me to be “seen” coming to Feiran.

604
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,070
It means

that as long as no one can see me,

684
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,060
it's too late.

685
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,490
You don't know yet, do you?

686
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,640
To make it easier to take care of him,

687
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,230
Grandpa Zhou has asked me

688
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,330
to move in with him

689
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,430
Move in?

690
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,380
You mean you're living in Southside Apartment now?

691
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,310
I used to see his long face

692
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,870
in the office every day.

693
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,120
Now when I get home,

694
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,450
I still have to face him.

695
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
It's hard to pay a debt of gratitude.

696
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,700
It's okay, Huahua.

697
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,280
How about this?

698
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,080
I'll go there every day

699
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,700
to keep you company, okay?

700
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,010
Then it's a deal.

701
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:06,540
Okay.

Zhou Zhifei, you want proof?

704
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,530
Sure.

705
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,030
I'll show you.

709
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:42,940
Mr. Zhou,

710
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,160
according to your instructions,

711
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,930
all the media and relevant units

712
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,260
have all been notified.

713
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,390
You've changed the time of the meeting on the spur of the moment.

714
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,570
That's not your style, Zhifei.

715
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,200
I am against the clock.

716
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,800
You know?

717
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,530
Is Shi Huahua still not here?

718
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,500
No, Mr. Zhou.

719
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,620
No wonder

720
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,500
the gate is locked during the day.

721
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,030
So many shady things.

722
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,870
You don't deserve the name of Qingyuan.

723
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,780
What are you shooting?

724
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,970
It's you again.
