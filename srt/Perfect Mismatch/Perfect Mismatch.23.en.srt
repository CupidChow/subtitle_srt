5
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,020
Morning, Mr. Zhou.

6
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,310
Good morning, Zhifei.

7
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,300
Zhi'ang?

8
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,289
Chi?

9
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,180
Why are you in my place early in the morning?

10
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,320
Look, Zhifei.

11
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,360
I talked to Chi last night.

12
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,060
We customized

13
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,280
a treatment plan for your blood phobia.

14
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,470
Why does it sound familiar?

15
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,289
Huahua.

16
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,000
Zhifei, don't worry.

17
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,480
Zhi'ang and Chi don't know anything about medicine.

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,050
They won't force you to take medicine.

19
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,420
You can try their treatment.

20
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,419
First of all, the red substitution method.

21
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,020
If you can adapt to a large area of red,

22
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,810
when you see blood again,

23
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,820
just consider it's a red dye spill,

24
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,400
and you'll be fine with it.

25
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,560
Mr. Zhou,

26
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,160
let's put on some music.

27
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,140
Mr. Zhou, do you feel anything?

28
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,120
Chi Miqi,

29
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,620
do you think I'm a bull?

30
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,780
It's okay.

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,690
Wrong music.

32
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,840
Let's change it.

33
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,310
Mr. Zhou,

34
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,200
can you feel it?

35
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,130
Chi Miqi, enough.

36
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,020
Useless.

37
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,280
Next.

38
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,520
Fear comes from insecurity.

39
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,290
If you're afraid of something,

40
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,800
you have to face it,

41
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,000
feel it,

42
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,110
and defeat it.

43
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,880
So I prepared this for you.

44
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,200
Sensory stimulation therapy.

45
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,000
Zhifei,

46
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,450
this might be slightly uncomfortable.

47
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,410
But no matter what, you must not run away.

48
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,370
Remember, we're all here for you.

49
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,700
What are you doing?

50
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,400
Zhifei,

51
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,640
this is fresh pig blood.

52
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,850
Straight from the slaughterhouse via air.

53
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,640
Look, how fresh.

54
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,280
I don't need it.

55
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,260
You do.

56
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,010
I don't.

57
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,710
Zhifei,

58
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,250
look,

59
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,800
I'll demonstrate for you.

60
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,660
Mr. Zhou,

61
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,920
don't mind Zhi'ang.

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,470
It's okay.

63
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,480
Let's move on to the next.

64
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,370
There's more?

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,050
Yeah.

66
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,110
Zhi'ang, it doesn't work very well.

67
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,800
It seems that we have to find another way.

68
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,970
No matter what,

69
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,620
I have to cure my brother.

70
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,710
Guys, enough already.

71
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,710
No.

72
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,860
Get some rest today.

73
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,990
We'll be back tomorrow.

74
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,580
Chi,

75
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,530
let's go.

76
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,970
See you tomorrow.

77
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,390
I didn't know Zhi'ang's creative.

78
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,310
Chi is quite something, too.

79
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,800
I'm exhausted hanging out

80
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,170
with them today.

81
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,780
Zhifei,

82
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,850
there's something I want to tell you.

83
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,950
Do you have to say it now?

84
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,630
Want to come to my room

85
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,330
and have a good chat tonight?

86
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:19,690
You…

87
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,290
All right.

88
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,210
Just kidding.

89
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,870
Let's talk tomorrow.

90
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,910
I'm really tired.

91
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,800
Okay.

92
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,310
Sorry, Huahua.

93
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,040
You must've been disappointed

94
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,270
by my cowardice.

95
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:38,820
Zhifei,

96
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,750
wake up.

97
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,250
Huahua.

98
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,909
Are Zhi'ang and Chi here?

99
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,610
I talked to Xiaoxiao

100
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,340
and we decided

101
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,370
to stop this unreliable treatment.

102
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,380
Why?

103
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,450
How will we know unless we try?

104
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,340
I think Zhi'ang must have many ways

105
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,020
to cure me.

106
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,280
I want to try them all.

107
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,440
But do you think that's going to work?

108
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,880
I see.

109
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,070
You're getting upset.

110
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,950
From now on, only you get to heal me.

111
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,980
Other people won't have the chance.

112
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,980
All right, Huahua.

113
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,180
Don't be upset, okay?

114
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,220
Why don't you teach me kung fu?

115
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,510
Didn't you say

116
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,940
Shi's kung fu can cultivate our body and mind?

117
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,170
Or

118
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,820
let's just go back to the mountains.

119
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,900
You've been out for so long.

120
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,960
You must miss home.

121
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,820
Zhou Zhifei,

122
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,340
do you mean it?

123
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,050
Go back to the mountains with me

124
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,570
and hide?

125
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,410
Is this the life you want?

126
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,480
I think it's good.

127
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,110
Didn't you tell me to get out into nature?

128
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,210
If I go home with you

129
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,820
to a picturesque place,

130
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,290
maybe it's good for my health.

131
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,410
You have no physical problems at all.

132
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,690
Zhou Zhifei,

133
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,460
what exactly are you escaping from?

134
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,080
Can you afford to lose Feiran?

135
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,020
Are you willing to spend the rest of your life hiding

136
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,250
and have everyone mocking you,

137
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,310
admitting you're just a sick person?

138
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,760
I know

139
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,280
what Zhiran did was a big blow to you.

140
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,360
But now you have to pull yourself together

141
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,020
and find the man you used to be.

142
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,900
You can't just run away from it

143
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,730
like what you do now.

144
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,740
The man I fell for

145
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,070
shouldn't be like this.

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,830
Huahua,

147
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,860
I'm useless, aren't I?

148
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,180
I've been

149
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,140
running away from it till now.

150
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,530
You used

151
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,580
to be afraid.

152
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,800
You were afraid of facing it alone.

153
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,880
But now it's different.

154
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,890
I'm here for you.

155
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,780
You can rest assured that

156
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,440
whatever problems you'll have,

157
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,440
we'll deal with them together.

158
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,030
Zhou.

159
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,780
Ji Qing,

160
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,280
no one's on my side now,

161
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,820
I hope you can help me.

162
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,510
I'm glad you came to me.

163
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,640
You see, there's always a way out.

164
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,220
I know what happened to me

165
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,720
was a shock to everyone.

166
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,540
But I have never made any mistakes

167
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,990
throughout my years running Feiran.

168
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,780
As a major shareholder of the Zhou Group,

169
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,560
you should

170
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,350
know better than anyone about this.

171
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,400
You don't have to explain that much to me.

172
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,260
I have every faith in your ability

173
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,340
and I know why you came to me.

174
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,270
I can give you

175
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,950
all my shares in the Zhou Group

176
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,280
on one condition.

177
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,430
Let's get married.

178
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,060
Sorry.

179
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,430
The person I love is Shi Huahua.

180
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,510
I can't accept

181
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,950
your condition.

182
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,460
Seriously?

183
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,410
You don't get to refuse.

184
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,070
Shi Huahua can offer you nothing.

185
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,920
I'm the only one who can help you now.

186
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,560
I'm serious.

187
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,290
So am I.

188
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,020
Zhou Zhifei,

189
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,680
when you took over Feiran,

190
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,300
I also took over the Ji Group.

191
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,240
Step by step, we get

192
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,110
where we are right now together.

193
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,990
Are you really willing to let Zhiran

194
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,620
steal the company you built?

195
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,220
Feiran is owned by Zhiran and I from the beginning.

196
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,650
No matter what,

197
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,010
"steal" should never

198
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,130
be used on my brother.

199
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,560
And,

200
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,950
Huahua is never

201
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,170
a bargaining chip.

202
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,080
Sorry.

203
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,030
Excuse me.

204
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,470
Zhou Zhifei.

205

206
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,620
[Feiran Capital]

207
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,220
Mr. Zhou?

[Feiran Capital]

209
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,220
Right.

210
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,320
You're not the president anymore.

211
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,470
Guess now I can

212
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,220
just call you Zhifei.

213
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,770
Shen Jun,

214
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,590
I don't have time to waste.

215
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,790
Hold that thought.

216
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,190
I know

217
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,950
you're going through a hard time.

218
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,990
It could've happened to anybody.

219
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,530
But, as your senior,

220
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,260
I'd like to help you out.

221
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,000
Are you upset

222
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,150
about the shares?

223
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,770
Just 2.5 percent,

224
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,320
keep it for yourself.

225
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,310
Better than nothing, right?

226
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,880
If you want to get back on top,

227
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,080
there's only one way.

228
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,290
You have to conquer the small shareholders one by one.

229
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,360
If you'll return

230
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,940
Professor Yu's sweetener patent

231
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,410
to me,

232
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,970
I'll give all my shares to you.

233
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,550
What do you think?

234
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,470
It's a win-win.

235
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,580
I want you to understand two things.

236
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,440
First,

237
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
learn some manners.

238
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,500
It's not your place to remind me.

239
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,340
Second,

240
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,530
I don't believe

241
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,990
you'd be so kind to help me.

242
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,660
So, just drop your act.

243
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,080
Zhifei,

244
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,630
stop being patronizing, okay?

245
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,380
You're like a stray dog with nothing left to lose.

246
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,930
What's the point?

247
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,510
[Feiran Capital]

248
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,010
You have nothing left.

249
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,270
You're selling your car

250
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,730
and your property in a couple of days, right?

251
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,730
Please tell the one who's barking downstairs

252
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,860
to come up for a chat.

253
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,370
Zhiran,

254
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,600
how did you know I'm here to see you?

255
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,050
Don't be paranoid.

256
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,110
I'm not interested in you.

257
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,030
What did you say to my brother?

258
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,190
Nothing much.

259
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,010
I'm just curious.

260
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,010
What is it

261
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,790
between you and your brother

262
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,300
that you run him to death?

263
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,480
Uncle Shen,

264
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,830
loose lips sink ships.

265
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,070
All right. All right.

266
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,330
I couldn't care less.

267
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,730
I'm here today for business.

268
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,170
Now you are the only one in your family.

269
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,900
Are you worried that

270
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,390
Zhou Zhifei will come back one day

271
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,370
to destroy you?

272
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,330
I've been waiting for him.

273
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,500
Let's not put it like that.

274
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,380
A bit of advice.

275
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,110
The thing about shares is

276
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,860
the bigger piece, the better.

277
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,650
I don't have much.

278
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,030
But it's better than nothing.

279
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,760
If you'll return

280
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,820
Professor Yu's sweetener patent
to me,

281
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,700
I'll transfer all my shares to you.

282
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,390
It's the same speech you gave my brother, right?

283
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,430
No way.

284
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,670
You got rejected

285
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,410
and gave me the same offer?

286
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,760
What's wrong, Uncle Shen?

287
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,420
You don't want to get into the Zhou Holdings now?

288
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,410
I've seen enough drama of your family,

289
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,500
and I want to withdraw my investment.

290
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,340
Let me say it for you.

291
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,630
You want to use Professor Yu's free tech to cash in

292
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,510
and cheat Zhou Holdings out of its shares.

293
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,480
Well,

294
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,840
if Professor Yu knows about this,

295
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,210
how do you think that will make him feel?

296
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,690
How do you know?

297
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,940
[Authorization Contract]

298
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,800
You know,

299
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,750
word always gets out.

300
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,390
I think

301
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,950
Professor Yu's legal team

302
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,460
is on their way now.

303
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,110
What?

304
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,210
Shen Jun, I'm telling you,

305
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,330
no outsiders are allowed

306
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,420
to get their hands on our Zhou family's stuff.

307
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,680
My brother

308
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,050
will never be insulted by people like you.

309
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,380
Anyone who does harm to my brother

310
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,160
won't end well.

311
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,440
Zhou Zhiran, you psychopath!

312
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,030
You and your brother are both psychopaths!

313
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,830
Zhifei,

314
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,440
I know you don't have a stake in the group now.

315
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,420
But you don't have to eat this.

316
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,590
This is too shabby.

317
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,870
Don't laugh. I'm serious.

318
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,370
I'll support you.

319
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,430
You gotta eat meat.

320
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,700
Huahua's still growing.

321
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,660
Zhi'ang, you're overthinking it.

322
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,110
We're not that broke.

323
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,430
You see,

324
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,740
Zhifei's been running around for the company stuff.

325
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,300
I don't want him to get inflamed,

326
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,260
so I prepared this

327
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,820
mushroom soup pot today.

328
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,430
These are all healthy vegetables.

329
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,790
No meat.

330
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,510
I'm sorry.

331
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,730
It's okay.

332
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,510
You should've told me earlier.

333
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,360
Let's eat.

334
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,040
Well, how's the equity thing going?

335
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,280
Getting anywhere?

336
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,120
Zhiran holds all the shares of Feiran,

337
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,480
let alone of Fei'ang Group.

338
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,260
Now, among the company's major shareholders,

339
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,070
Ji Qing is our only hope.

340
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,620
But I can't

341
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,980
accept her condition.

342
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,580
It's okay. Take your time.

343
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,670
I'm here for you.

344
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,610
What time do we have to wait?

345
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,390
I can't believe my parents.

346
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,060
I wonder when

347
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,690
they'll change their minds.

348
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,530
Speaking of which,

349
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,200
they have done

350
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,570
many private transactions in the dark.

351
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,150
Do you think

352
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,400
it could be a bargaining chip for us?

353
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,740
Where do people usually put this kind of evidence?

354
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,090
Mom, I'm home.

355
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,130
What's the code to the safe?

356
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,300
It's your birthday.

357
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:36,730
Okay.

358
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,160
What are you looking for?

359
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,440
Just some stuff.

360
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,910
[File Cover]

361
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,580
Mom, I got to go.

362
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,580
I'll go have dinner with my friends.

363
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,300
Drive safe.

364
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,170
Zhifei,

365
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,810
have you really decided?

366
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,320
I'm Zhiran's brother.

367
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,800
His mistake has a lot to do with me.

368
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,700
Of course I should be the one to solve it.

369
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,220
I just need to untangle what is tangled.

370
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,260
Then let me recharge you.

371
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,540
Since you decided,

372
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,900
just go all out.

373
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,000
I'll be there for you.

374
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,640
Zhifei, you're here.

375
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,190
I've been waiting for you.

376
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,340
Zhiran,

377
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,670
at this point of time,

378
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,810
you still think you're doing the right thing?

379
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,030
What did I do wrong?

380
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,220
These days,

381
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,760
everything's been under control at Feiran.

382
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,610
I'm waiting for you to come back

383
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,180
so we can share

384
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,180
what belongs to us together.

385
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,340
Okay.

386
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,920
If that's the case,

387
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,150
let's go.

388
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,210
Why is this outsider still here?

389
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,170
Grandpa asked me to come.

390
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,360
Zhiran,

391
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,960
you called a board meeting

392
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,820
with several major shareholders

393
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,280
and had my position removed.

394
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,280
I'm worthless now.

395
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,440
To you,

396
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,360
am I an outsider now?

397
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,710
Zhifei, you know

398
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,140
that's not what I want.

399
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,620
Have a seat.

400
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,010
What's all this?

401
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,000
It seems it's a crusade against me.

402
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,730
You really threw me under the bus.

403
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
That's why you came home that night.

404
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,010
Shame on you.

405
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,380
Uncle,

406
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,620
Aunt,

407
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,040
I have nothing to lose now.

408
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,450
But you are different.

409
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,250
If these internal transactions in Fei'ang

410
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:41,990
get exposed,

411
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,070
the consequences

412
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,700
should be more than just a drop

413
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,710
in market value, right?

414
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,500
I don't think

415
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,340
you want that, right?

416
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
You're threatening me, too?

417
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,770
I wouldn't dare.

418
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,470
Let's get it straight.

419
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,080
Feiran and Fei'ang have different priorities for development.

420
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,040
I have no intention of competing with you for resources.

421
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,300
I just want to get back what belongs to me,

422
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,460
and I don't think you're going to sit back and do nothing.

423
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,240
Mom, Dad,

424
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,980
you were always going against Zhifei

425
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,190
and has done so many unethical things.

426
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,160
I have seen it all these years.

427
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,780
I'm doing this now

428
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,310
not only for Zhifei,

429
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,880
but also for you.

430
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,200
I want you to stop before it's too late

431
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,930
and get back on the right track.

432
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,220
After all, we're family.

433
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,210
Zhiran,

434
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,010
why did you say that?

435
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,030
We're family.

436
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,290
How can this be a crusade?

437
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,620
Yeah.

438
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,650
You and Zhifei are brothers,

439
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,030
and you were brought up by Zhifei.

440
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,200
Is that really necessary?

441
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,140
Uncle,

442
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,150
Zhi'ang and I are brothers, too.

443
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,610
Are you saying

444
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,660
I have a share of Fei'ang's dividend, too?

445
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,870
No, you…

446
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,490
Cousins are different from brothers.

447
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,790
No wonder

448
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,340
you wanted to see my brother fall before,

449
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,440
but now you're so dedicated to defending him.

450
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,630
If it's not for interest,

451
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,870
you wouldn't have done that, right?

452
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,690
Zhiran,

453
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,390
I've been indulging you for a long time,

454
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,280
yet you never know to dial it back.

455
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,920
When will you

456
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,600
stop making a scene?

457
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,980
Grandpa, I'm not.

458
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,210
Zhou Holdings is the hard work of your life.

459
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,550
I know you think highly of my brother

460
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,580
and you wanted him to take over the chairmanship.

461
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,810
But you saw it last time.

462
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,100
People will doubt

463
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,920
if he can take over the job

464
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,120
with his blood phobia issue.

465
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,060
I agree with Zhiran.

466
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,870
Ji Qing, you're a stockholder.

467
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,150
Of course you have the right to object.

468
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,930
Zhou Zhifei,

469
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,490
I gave you the chance.

470
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,980
And my answer is clear.

471
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,930
Zhou Zhifei has a serious mental illness.

472
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,480
He'll act like a kid at the sight of blood,

473
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,820
and people will take advantage of that.

474
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:04,810
So,

475
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,780
I object that Zhou Zhifei rejoins the board.

476
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,000
It seems

477
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,390
many people have the same concerns as me.

478
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,310
What do you say?

479
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,200
At the last shareholders' meeting,

480
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,360
my grandfather vouched for me with the reputation of Zhou Holdings.

481
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,320
My brother made me swear

482
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,900
out of concern for the reputation

483
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,380
of Zhou Holdings.

484
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,130
I will give you an answer

485
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,910
to the vow I failed to fulfill

486
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,400
on that day.

487
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,510
As you can see on that day,

488
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,560
I did once suffer from

489
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,130
a strange illness.

490
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,250
I faint at the sight of blood and would act like a kid

491
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,380
with only memories before I was seven.

492
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,060
The reason for this is that

493
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,290
I witnessed the death of my parents

494
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,900
when I was young,

495
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,460
which traumatized me severely.

496
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,210
Until now, I still can't face it.

497
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,680
It was like

498
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,210
a nightmare,

499
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,920
bringing me painful memories over and over again.

500
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,670
It's still difficult for me to talk about that.

501
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,160
But today I'm telling this story

502
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,910
because I found a way

503
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,180
to fight this illness.

504
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,730
When I was young, I was afraid of being abandoned,

505
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,830
but now,

506
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,080
I have found the person who's always there for me.

507
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,340
She let me know that

508
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,860
I'm no longer alone in the world,

509
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,300
and I'll never feel lonely again.

510
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,980
Wake up, guys.

511
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,290
It changes nothing.

512
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,220
Zhifei,

513
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,410
I don't want to go against you.

514
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,570
But do you think you can convince everyone

515
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,570
with just a few words?

516
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,080
I'll show them.

517
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,840
Zhiran.

518
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,800
If you still think of me as your brother,

519
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,350
stop hurting yourself,

520
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:34,930
okay?

521
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,790
Zhifei,

522
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,580
you're scared?

523
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,200
I do not want to see you

524
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,150
repeatedly revealing your scars.

525
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,540
It breaks my heart.

526
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,750
So why can't it be me?

527
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,930
Why can't I be

528
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,020
the one who stands by your side?

529
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,420
Because I never wanted to leave you behind!

530
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,240
Liar.

531
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,250
Zhiran,

532
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,830
if you want to prove it,

533
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,390
I hope you're not the one bleeding today.

534
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:31,500
Zhifei.

535
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:31,990
Zhifei.

536
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,680
You've recovered?

537
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,840
Huahua has cured me.

538
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,610
Since Zhifei has been cured,

539
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,680
I agree that Zhifei should come back

540
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,080
and continue to be the president of Feiran.

541
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,430
Agreed.

542
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,500
Agreed.

543
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,600
Zhifei is our best choice.

544
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,110
Yes, that's right.

545
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,560
You're all crazy.

546
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,980
And you, Zhifei.

547
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,620
Remember your choice today.

548
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,880
I hope you don't live to regret it.

549
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,310
Zhiran!

550
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,620
Zhifei.

551
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,290
Let him be.

552
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,300
Zhifei,

553
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,530
I thought you were young

554
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,260
and still need more experience.

555
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,690
Today, it seems

556
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,270
I was overthinking it.

557
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,240
You have

558
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,870
Huahua with you in the future.

559
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,130
I'm relieved.

560
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,620
Zhifei,

561
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,040
come here.

562
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,380
I would like to announce that

563
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,020
from today,

564
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:22,860
I step down as Chairman of Zhou Holdings.

565
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,830
Zhou Zhifei will take over the position

566
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,040
and be in charge of all matters in the group.

567
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,730
Zhifei,

568
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,560
you did it.

569
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,480
Because you are

570
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,710
the cure I need.

571
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,610
I know you have something on your mind.

572
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,920
I'm here for you.

573
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,320
Huahua,

574
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,200
I'm so lucky to have you.

575
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,240
Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhou.

576
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,330
Congratulations!

577
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,820
You guys…

578
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,900
Congratulations on your promotion.

579
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,070
[Staff Card]

580
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,220
You're now the Chairman of Zhou Holdings.

581
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,550
Mr. Zhou's awesome. You made a grand a comeback!

582
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,440
Together you can do so much as a couple!

583
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,850
Get married! Get married!

584
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,440
Get married! Get married!
