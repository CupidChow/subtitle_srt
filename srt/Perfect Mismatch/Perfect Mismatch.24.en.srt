Master.

19
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,650
Master, what brings you

20
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:34,960
here?

21
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,220
I'm here to pick on him.

22
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,050
Zhou Hongsheng,

23
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,810
I asked you to take care of my apprentice,

24
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,090
but I didn't ask you to take her

25
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,910
as your granddaughter-in-law.

26
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,370
Master, it's not what you think.

27
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,410
Do you think you can

28
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,580
hide it from me?

29
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,180
Are you Zhou Zhifei?

30
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,230
Hello, Master.

31
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,480
Don't call me that.

32
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,590
You don't just call people Master.

33
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,600
You can call him Master Qingquan.

34
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,280
Hello, Master Qingquan.

35
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,720
Zhou Zhifei,

36
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,570
do you know that

37
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,650
since ancient times, you have to

38
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,079
go through a trial to marry a girl from our Shi family?

39
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,060
Only those who pass the test

40
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,530
can be qualified to be

41
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,180
the son-in-law of our Shi family.

42
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,500
Master,

43
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,329
do we really have this rule?

44
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,560
We do if I say so.

45
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:47,950
Zhou Zhifei,

46
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,070
do you accept the challenge?

47
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,420
Of course I do.

48
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,410
My love for Huahua

49
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,640
will withstand any test.

50
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,060
Good.

51
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,290
The traditional test is to walk across the fire pot,

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,839
roll over the nail board, and lift a big tripod.

53
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,280
Since you know nothing about martial arts,

54
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,810
you don't have to do that.

55
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,230
But I tailored for you

56
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,690
a new test.

57
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,950
There are three levels.

58
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,340
What are you doing here?

59
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,950
Your grandpa asked us to come.

60
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,220
He told us to fully cooperate with Master Qingquan.

61
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,610
First level.

62
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,730
I want Zhou Zhifei to have a race with this turtle

63
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,420
to see who's slower.

64
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,680
Huahua,

65
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,190
this level is to test

66
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,600
Zhou Zhifei's patience.

67
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,010
I hope your future husband

68
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,030
have enough patience with you.

69
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,990
You can't stop

70
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,390
or step back.

71
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,470
That's cheating.

72
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,650
Master.

73
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,240
Is it so difficult to race with a turtle?

74
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,890
It may seem simple,

75
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,290
but it's very difficult.

76
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,190
To race with a turtle, you need to keep the running pose

77
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,650
and make sure you're slower than the turtle.

78
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,680
It's a test of

79
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,750
the ability to control your body.

80
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,670
The first level is so hard already.

81
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,600
Mr. Zhou, go for it.

82
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,360
Zhifei, you can do it.

83
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,100
Go, Mr. Zhou.

84
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,160
Almost there.

85
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,680
Great! Great!

86
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,090
Master, he did it.

87
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,790
Mr. Zhou, you're amazing!

88
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,120
You're great, Mr. Zhou!

89
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,300
If you want to be together,

90
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,660
you can't leave each other

91
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,870
in sickness and poverty.

92
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,930
So this level

93
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,740
is a weight bearing test.

94
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,040
You have to carry Shi Huahua.

95
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,240
This is easy.

96
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,520
Mr. Zhou is different now.

97
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,890
He's quite tough

98
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,370
after all those training.

99
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,720
Such a sweet scene!

100
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,220
If you don't drink it,

101
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,420
I'll have to feed you.

102
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,680
Her appearance

103
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,030
changed my life.

104
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,510
She makes my life more colorful.

105
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,340
Sit up.

106
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,550
Did I find your button?

107
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,590
But I just want to get close to her all the time.

108
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,940
Shi Huahua is my girlfriend.

109
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,490
And I'm

110
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,170
her boyfriend!

111
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,560
Okay. Okay.

112
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,830
Zhou Zhifei,

113
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,610
remember how you feel today.

114
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,850
You can't abandon Huahua

115
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,860
in the future whatsoever.

116
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,130
Running towards the finish line alone is not a success.

117
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,549
A couple has to make it to the finish line together

118
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,539
with no one getting left behind.

119
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,280
That's what real success looks like.

120
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,960
This third level

121
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,270
is to see if you're meant to be together.

122
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,800
Zhou Zhifei, you have to

123
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,020
find Huahua blindfolded

124
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,360
within ten seconds.

125
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,480
Remember,

126
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,620
this is your only chance.

127
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,650
If you fail,

128
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,070
you won't pass the test.

129
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,220
Master, this is too hard.

130
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,630
The first two levels were reasonable.

131
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,650
I don't think they're reasonable.

132
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,900
Better than this, right?

133
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,000
Why is this level so reckless?

134
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,480
Cultivation is all about harmony with the world,

135
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,790
so providence matters.

136
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,320
Go ahead.

137
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,270
I can do it.

138
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,740
Mr. Zhou, good luck.

139
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,730
Chi, slowly.

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,620
Okay.

141
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,950
All right, Mr. Zhou.

142
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,370
Huahua.

143
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,270
Go back with me.

144
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,200
Master.

145
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,290
Master, I won't.

146
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,830
Master,

147
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,300
I've always listened to you since I was little.

148
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,690
But times have changed.

149
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,240
We have the right to fall in love.

150
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,120
I like Zhou Zhifei.

151
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,620
I've chosen him

152
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,330
and I'm going to stay with him.

153
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,100
What if I insist to take you back?

154
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,500
You have to go through me first.

155
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,440
You've grown up.

156
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,660
Now that you've decided,

157
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,190
what else can I say?

158
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,070
Master, do you agree to our relationship?

159
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,190
Zhou Zhifei,

160
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,620
I want you to know that

161
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,050
our Shi family

162
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,990
are behind Huahua all the time.

163
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,710
If you don't treat her well,

164
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,910
I won't spare you.

165
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,920
I understand, Master.

166
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,600
Thank you, Master.

167
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,210
Now, the first thing's solved,

168
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,460
let's move on to the next.

169
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,200
Zhou Hongsheng,

170
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,500
where is Zhou Zhiran?

171
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,810
Who are you?

172
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,550
Master.

173
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,720
Come in.

174
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,230
Zhou,

175
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,350

Niuniu suddenly collapsed for some reason.

347
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,620
Can you help us?

348
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,300
Doctor.

349
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,150
Doctor.

350
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,280
Put her down.

351
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,280
Put her down.

352
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,150
Okay.

353
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,480
You'll save her, right?

354
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,240
Doctor, please save my child.

355
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,570
I told myself

356
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,540
I am a doctor.

357
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,480
Please.

358
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,070
If I quit when things get hard…

359
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,850
Let me feel her pulse.

360
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,930
...how can I save lives and heal the wounded?

361
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,720
How is she?

362
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,510
Anything?

363
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,930
Did she squat for a long time before she fainted?

364
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,480
Yes.

365
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,460
That's right.

366
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,700
Here's some brown sugar water.

367
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,500
It might help.

368
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,310
All right.

369
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,160
Open up.

370
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,800
She woke up.

371
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,700
She woke up.

372
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,180
Niuniu, you really scared me.

373
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,120
You woke up, Niuniu.

374
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,730
I was so worried.

375
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,810
She fainted due to low blood sugar.

376
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,960
Nothing serious.

377
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,510
But if you have time,

378
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,370
take her to the hospital

379
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,370
in the morning.

380
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,970
Okay, okay.

381
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,690
All right.

382
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,900
Thank you, doctor.

383
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,160

384
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,920
