5
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,900
Miss Nangong, you are so busy.

6
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,789
Not as busy as you.

7
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:46,570
Thank you, Mr. Zhou,

8
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,700
for bringing it to me in person.

9
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,600
Save it.

10
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,310
If you're not busy,

11
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,450
why don't you come to me in person,

12
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,640
instead of asking Huahua to send it to me?

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,590
I'm doing this

14
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,810
to give you some time to be alone.

15
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,380
I will get to the point.

16
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,310
Tell me honestly

17
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,180
what you did to Zhi'ang.

18
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,900
What do you mean?

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,160
Your brother is not a girl.

20
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,180
You make it sound like I'm bullying him.

21
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,940
Listen.

22
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,669
Zhi'ang is very simple.

23
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,000
If you just want to have fun,

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,680
I have to...

25
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,570
I am serious.

26
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,150
I don't deny that

27
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,930
my emotional life was rich before.

28
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,960
But I was single at the time,

29
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,490
and it was up to me

30
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,380
what kind of life I wanted to live.

31
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,750
But

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,030
I have decided to be with Zhi'ang.

33
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,560
I can give up my so-called freedom

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,660
and take responsibility for my own actions.

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,960
From now on,

36
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,090
I only love one person.

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,480
You...

38
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,490
I really didn't expect Zhi'ang

39
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,050
to get you down.

40
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,730
Zhou Zhifei.

41
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,900
You'd better

42
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,590
treat me better in the future.

43
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,260
After all,

44
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,950
I will be your sister-in-law.

45
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,360
Nangong Xiaoxiao.

46
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,820
How dare you?

47
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,420
Alright, boss.

48
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,350
But seriously,

49
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,620
Zhi'ang is lucky

50
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,950
to have a brother like you.

51
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,130
Of course.

52
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,940
I can tell that

53
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,700
Zhi'ang is very happy

54
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,540
with you.

55
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,180
I wish you a happy marriage.

56
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,140
May you have a baby soon.

57
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,440
Be nice to my brother.

58
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,020
The same to you.

59
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,970
If you dare to bully Huahua,

60
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,910
I won't let you go.

61
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,870
It's as if you are her family.

62
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,320
Huahua, here.

63
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,780
Zhiran.

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,230
What's up?

65
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,210
Why so mysterious

66
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,920
and you don't want me to tell your brother?

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,829
Just follow me.

68
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,070
I will take you somewhere.

69
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,800
Okay.

70
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,690
Huahua, come in.

71
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,840
This is my house.

72
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,910
Zhiran.

73
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,790
The place you said

74
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,660
is your home?

75
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,850
Right.

76
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,970
Come in.

77
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,040
Go.

78
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:05,880
Take care.

79
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,910
It smells so good.

80
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,670
Are you cooking meat?

81
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,530
Yes.

82
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,810
I made lotus root and pork ribs soup.

83
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,260
Really?

84
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,350
What a coincidence.

85
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,230
It's

86
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,300
my favorite.

87
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,690
I know.

88
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,350
How do you know?

89
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,440
I know

90
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,130
everything about you.

91
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,900
All right.

92
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,900
Take a seat.

93
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,970
The meal will be ready soon.

94
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,650
Wait for me.

95
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,110
Let me help you.

96
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,710
No need.

97
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:42,940
By the way,

98
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,030
do you cook for yourself

99
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,450
at my brother's house?

100
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,980
What's wrong?

101
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,590
My brother

102
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,110
never cooks.

103
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,380
You have worked hard during this time.

104
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,470
Not at all.

105
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,040
Go take a seat.

106
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,090
I have magazines, comics

107
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,160
and a TV.

108
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,860
Make yourself at home.

109
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,700
Okay.

110
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,390
Zhiran.

111
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,550
Isn't this my video?

112
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,570
Why do you have it?

113
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,260
I didn't go that day.

114
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,560
Xiaoxiao sent it to me.

Is the photo album okay?

119
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,670
You have a lot of awful photos of mine.

120
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,110
Sorry.

121
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,800
It's just that I want to keep

122
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,830
every moment with you.

123
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Just keep them.

124
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,850
But never show them to anyone.

125
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,790
I won't.

126
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,310
I'll keep them to myself.

127
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:36,659
Is the meal ready?

128
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,690
Let's go to eat.

129
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,370
Okay.

130
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,450
Thank you.

131
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,550
How is it?

132
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,690
Nice.

133
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,100
Great.

134
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,700
If you like it,

135
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,220
I will often make it for you in the future.

136
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,000
No need.

137
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,470
You are busy with study.

138
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,410
And I can make it myself.

139
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,130
I would like to do it for you.

140
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,870
Although it's a trivial thing

141
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,150
for you,

142
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,730
as long as it's for you,

143
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,790
I will be very happy.

144
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,540
Zhiran.

145
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,830
It suddenly occurred to me that I have something else to do at home.

146
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,740
I have to go.

147
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,310
Huahua.

148
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,120
Huahua.

149
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,280
Actually, I fell in love with you

150
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,930
the first time I saw you.

151
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,070
Hello, Grandpa Zhou.

152
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,330
My name is Shi Huahua.

153
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,550
It was Master who asked me to come to you.

154
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,370
I desperately wanted to be close to you

155
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,570
and create memories of the two of us.

156
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,470
Surprise.

157
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,120
Your name is Shi Huahua, right?

158
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,330
Nice to meet you.

159
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,140
I am quite happy that

160
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,490
you came with me today.

161
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,130
So am I.

162
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,410
Thank you, Zhiran.

163
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,600
I feel

164
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,990
really relaxed

165
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,200
when I'm with you.

166
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,420
She's different from other girls.

167
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,240
I like her.

168
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,450
So I want to give her the best.

169
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,770
I thought we would be together.

170
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,730
I didn't expect that...

171
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,420
But you don't have to worry.

172
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,170
I know you are with my brother.

173
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,900
So I will hide my feelings well.

174
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,900
As long as I can see you,

175
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,510
even if I am far away,

176
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,660
I will be satisfied.

177
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,450
Zhiran.

We're still the same as before, okay?

179
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,780
Take a seat, let's continue eating.

Huahua.

181
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,740
May I hug you

182
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,990
one last time?

183
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,080
Zhiran.

184
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,780
It's okay.

185
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,030
You should go.

186
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,920
I am not going to see you off.

Surprise.

189
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,360
Xiaoxiao, Zhi'ang.

190
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,980
You...

191
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,890
Zhi'ang and I fell in love at the same time.

192
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,850
I just wanted to

193
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,640
have a date of two couples

194
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,060
and show them

195
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,660
how sweet we really are.

196
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,190
That's all?

197
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,250
Why are you kissing her forehead?

198
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,980
To take her temperature?

199
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,750
That's what normal couples should do.

200
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,440
We've done more drastic things.

201
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,350
Right, Huahua?

202
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,580
Don't talk nonsense.

203
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,500
What did you do?

204
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,670
He's talking nonsense.

205
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,550
We... We did nothing.

Shi Huahua.

207

Good for you.

Come on.

Zhou Zhifei.

217
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,200
Since college,

218
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,520
countless girls have liked you,

219
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,800
but you were unmoved.

220
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,480
I always thought you were an immortal.

221
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,850
I didn't expect to see you

222
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,350
fall into the mortal world in my lifetime.

223
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,910
Huahua.

224
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,960
For you.

225
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,340
Thank you

226
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,290
for saving the immortal Zhou Zhifei

227
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,620
who kept his virginity

228
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,480
in three generations

229
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,630
of reincarnation.

Xiaoxiao.

231

Nangong Xiaoxiao, what are you talking about?

232
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,720
Now that we are so happy today,

233
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,540
Xiaoxiao,

234
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,340
I have prepared a present

235
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,810
for you

236
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,470
for a long long time.

237
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,060
What is it?

238
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,550
Thanks for your tolerance.

239
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,630
I am going to the bathroom.

240
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,300
Xiaoxiao.

241
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,390
Huahua, I have something to tell you.

242
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,370
Zhi'ang, go ahead.

243
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,890
Zhifei's parents died early.

244
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,880
Zhiran is still young.

245
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,590
He gave up his right to be a child early on.

246
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,680
He has worked hard to support the family for Zhiran

247
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,740
like an adult since he was a child.

248
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,450
Later, when he grew up,

249
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,390
he had to work for Feiran

250
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,280
and had no life of his own at all.

251
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,690
As his brother,

252
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,170
I really feel sorry for him.

253
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,880
But now it's different.

254
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,560
Now he has someone he likes,

255
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,190
a life of his own,

256
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,470
and regained childishness.

257
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,740
I mean

258
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,890
I'm really happy for him.

259
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,180
And

260
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,360
I can tell that

261
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,270
Zhifei really likes you.

262
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,340
I have known him for so many years.

263
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,730
Except for Zhiran,

264
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,100
I've never seen him

265
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,770
be so gentle to any person.

266
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,050
So

267
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,550
we hope you can treat him well.

268
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,040
Even if he is domineering sometimes

269
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,260
and lacks a sense of romance,

270
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,790
don't take it seriously.

271
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,340
If you're really angry,

272
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,970
come to me.

273
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,340
I will beat him for you.

274
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,770
Zhi'ang.

275
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:29,440
Zhiran is very important to Zhifei,

276
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,020
right?

277
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,460
Of course.

278
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,950
The two of them grew up together.

279
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,870
Zhifei is both a father and a brother to Zhiran.

280
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,280
Zhiran is also very dependent on Zhifei.

281
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,390
When the two of them are together,

282
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,380
it is as if they formed a barrier of their own,

283
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,370
and no one else could penetrate it at all.

284
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,220
Seriously,

285
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,330
I didn't expect him to fall in love

286
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,300
and have a family of his own.

287
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,410
What are you talking about?

288
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,070
Just now we told Huahua that

289
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,860
if you don't know

290
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,670
what to do in a relationship,

291
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,790
come to me.

292
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,540
No need.

293
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,630
I have learned it.

294
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,710
He's learned it.

295
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,140
Has he?

296
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,450
It seems that

297
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,580
we shouldn't stay here

298
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,400
and disturb their world of two.

299
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,500
Let's go.

300
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,190
Let's go.

301
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,980
Xiaoxiao, Zhi'ang.

302
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,160
Come on.

303
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:36,900
Well...

304
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,020
Bye.

305
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,880
Take care, Xiaoxiao, Zhi'ang.

306
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,220
Huahua.

307
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,540
I really feel that I am so happy.

308
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,290
I have you, Zhiran

309
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,109
and my family.

310
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,540
But sometimes

311
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,230
I worry that

312
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,990
God will take

313
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,440
all my happiness away.

314
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,369
You fool.

315
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,500
You will always be happy.

316
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,770
I can only be happy

317
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,560
with you by my side.

318
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,300
No way.

319
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,070
I-I am drunk.

320
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,000
Time to sleep.

321
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,740
I know you are with my brother.

322
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,650
So I will hide my feelings well.

323
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,050
And I won't disturb you.

324
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,930
As long as I can see you,

325
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,140
even if I am far away,

326
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,410
I will be satisfied.

327
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,050
They are both thinking about each other.

328
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,910
Am I

329
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,240
the bad person?

330
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,530
Have you found out that

331
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,890
ever since Mr. Zhou and Huahua got together,

332
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,780
he has been as fit as a fiddle,

333
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,930
and even took the first place in the marathon?

334
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,210
He's just glowing.

335
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,400
But Huahua

336
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,910
used to be powerful,

337
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,570
now she is depressed

338
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,190
with sallow complexion every day,

339
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,020
as if

340
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,290
she was hollowed out.

341
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,190
It seems that being the president's wife is not easy.

342
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,730
Hello.

343
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,740
Okay, I am on my way.

344
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,020
Tell me what's up.

345
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,070
Something very important.

346
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,860

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,810
Well.

350
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,620
I miss you.

00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,520
This is the important thing you said?

353
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,110
Yes.

354
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,360
When I passed by you just now,

355
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,570
you didn't even look up at me.

356
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,700
My heart has been greatly traumatized

357
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,640
and I need your comfort to get better.

358
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,040
Your heart has been greatly traumatized?

359
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,580
Then I will traumatize your body too.

360
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,970
Enough.

361
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,130
Shi Huahua, are you trying to murder your husband?

362
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,770
I...

363
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,590
Zhou Zhifei, listen carefully.

364
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,570
If you mess around again during working hours,

365
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,760
I will tell Grandpa.

366
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,050
I promise not to delay work.

367
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,280
Alright.

368
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,000
If there is nothing else,

369
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,820
I am leaving.

370
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,040
By the way,

371
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,200
tonight Zhiran is coming to eat at home.

372
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,470
So let's go back

373
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,300
and get ready.

374
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,670
Zhiran is coming?

375
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,600
Yes.

376
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,470
He insisted on coming to our house

377
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,710
to try your cooking

378
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,750
since he knew we are together during the marathon.

379
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,290
I just finished my work today.

380
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,960
Let's go home.

381
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,050
Put this in the pool.

382
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,650
Okay.

383
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,180
What's up?

384
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,950
My wish will finally come true.

385
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,180
What's this?

386
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,470
Couple outfits.

387
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,720
I always wanted to wear it with you.

388
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,090
So which one is you and which one is me?

389
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,370
I am the fish.

390
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,480
You are the cat.

391
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,670
So you will

392
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,670
hold me fast.

393
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,060
Come on.

394
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,980
Are you helping me?

395
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,520
It's time to show off.

396
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,090
You?

397
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,730
Can you make it?

398
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,340
There is nothing in this world

399
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,470
that I can't handle.

400
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,180
Okay.

401
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,140
Your turn then.

402
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,480
Forget it.

403
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,270
Let me do it.

404
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,570
Go prepare the dishes.

405
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,800
Wait, what are you doing?

406
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,750
This is for baking cakes.

407
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,430
Really?

408
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,410
Let me do it.

409
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,050
Well...

410
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,650
All right.

411
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,600
Just wait for me.

412
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,800
Huahua, you are looking down on me.

413
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,920
No.

414
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,700
Specialist only masters his own field.

415
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,180
For safety's sake,

416
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:09,890
I think

417
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,630
you'd better stay out of the kitchen for now.

418
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,580
Alright.

419
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,300
Huahua, let me cheer for you.

420
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,280
When a couple is of the same mind, they can do anything.

421
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,540
Don't worry, I will never make trouble for you.

422
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,900
I support you in spirit.

423
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,640
Okay, I see.

424
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,230
What's wrong?

425
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,540
What's wrong with you?

426
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,960
Nothing.

427
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,160
It's just that Zhiran is coming.

428
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,770
I'm a little nervous,

429
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,140
and afraid that what I make doesn't taste good.

430
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,880
Huahua.

431
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,670
A sister-in-law is like a mother.

432
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,030
You have done a great job.

433
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,190
Moreover,

434
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,540
my wife's dishes

435
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,260
are of course delicious.

436
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,730
I'm going to open the door.

437
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,050
Zhifei.

438
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,530
This is...

439
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,620
This is the same couple's apron as your sister-in-law.

440
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,040
How is it?

441
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,000
Isn't it homey and cozy?

442
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,320
But didn't you say that

443
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,010
a gentleman stays away from the kitchen?

444
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,280
But now you...

445
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,550
Yes, a gentleman stays away from the kitchen.

446
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,580
But as a man,

447
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,810
how can you

448
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,020
leave your wife alone?

449
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,760
You will know

450
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,720
when you have a girlfriend in the future.

451
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,600
Men and women work well together.

452
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,360
But you have to learn to take care of people

453
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,380
like me, you know?

454
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,720
Come on.

455
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,040
Huahua.

456
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,540
Hard work for you.

457
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,750
Not at all. Take a seat.

458
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,050
We will hurry up.

459
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,950
Take a seat.

460
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,380
I am going to help Huahua.

461
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,610
Anything I can do?

462
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,590
Clean the long beans.

463
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,810
There are so many of them.

464
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,890
What a rich meal.

465
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,040
Of course.

466
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,220
Knowing you're coming,

467
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,220
Huahua has been busy all afternoon.

468
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,520
Thank you, Huahua.

469
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,000
You are welcome.

470
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,660
Take a try.

471
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,620
Here, Zhiran.

472
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,410
It tastes good.

473
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,600
Zhifei, I really envy you

474
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,330
for having such a good girlfriend as Huahua.

475
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,780
That's right.

476
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,340
Huahua is

477
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,700
unique to me.

478
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,790
Just eat.

479
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:37,740
Okay.

480
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,620
Zhiran, if you have time,

481
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,900
come to eat more often.

482
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,590
I will.

483
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,520
I've had enough.

484
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,210
Huahua.

485
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,090
Thank you for your hospitality today.

486
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,240
I haven't felt like home in a long time.

487
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:10,720
Thank you.

488
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:13,600
Huahua.

489
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,400
Why didn't you eat much today?

490
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,020
Let me feed you.

491
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,040
Come on.

492
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,380
Zhifei, I still have something to do.

493
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:29,870
I have to go.

494
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,000
You're leaving as soon as you are full?

495
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,570
I am leaving.

496
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,520
Take care.

497
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,140
Bye.

498
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,180
Zhifei.

499
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,300
In front of Zhiran,

500
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,030
we'd better not be too intimate.

501
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,720
It would have a bad influence.

502
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,900
How come?

503
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,070
He is my younger brother,

504
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,830
not an outsider.

505
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,440
But he is still young after all.

506
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,470
You are not that old.

507
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:06,940
I...

508
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,010
All right, I see.

509
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,710
It's the world

510
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,170
of a couple now.

511
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,080
Wash the dishes first.

512
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,840
Why is Huahua acting weird today?

513
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,500
The high school reunion will be on this weekend.

514
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,380
Come with me.

515
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,800
I am not going.

516
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,720
So embarrassing.

517
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,670
[Feiran Capital]

518
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,680
Do you still remember that?

519
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,590
What?

520
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,050
You have no idea.

521
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,180
When in college,

522
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,950
two boys chased Zile at the same time.

523
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,450
These two boys were good friends.

524
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,360
But they broke up because of this.

525
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,970
