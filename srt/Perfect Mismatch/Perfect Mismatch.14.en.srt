00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,180
I just don't understand.

513
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,040
You could

514
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,710
get into the pool.

515
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,490
Why can't you do it?

516
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,570
Can't you

517
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,170
swim at all?

518
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,380
I don't know, Huahua.

519
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,050
This is not a pool.

520
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,430
This is my battlefield.

521
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,580
That injury two years ago

522
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,260
totally knocked me down.

523
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,520
Thank you for being there for me

524
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,870
and helping me recover.

525
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,230
But... I really don't seem to have the courage

526
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,630
to go back.

527
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,450
I may never be able to swim again.

528
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,130
What did you say?

529
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,660
Zhi'ang.

530
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,720
You heard it all?

531
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,390
Duan Jiayang,

532
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,800
how long are you going to lie to everyone?

533
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,630
I've idolized you for a long time.

534
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,200
Zhifei even invited you to be the spokesperson.

535
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,000
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

536
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,930
Zhi'ang,

537
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,160
Jiayang has his reasons.

538
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,720
He didn't mean to hide it from everyone.

539
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,600
Stop it, Huahua.

540
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,670
It's all my fault.

541
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,670
I lied to everyone.

542
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,230
Huahua, wake up.

543
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,780
A man who ran away from the battlefield

544
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,380
can never be called as a hero.

545
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,130
Duan Jiayang,

546
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,620
I bought the same swimming goggles for you.

547
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,310
Zhi'ang, why are you here?

548
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,650
I'm here to see Zhifei.

549
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,800
He's been off early these days. He's in a bad mood.

550
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,680
Bad mood?

551
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,800
What's wrong?

552
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,010
Your brother is a jealous man.

553
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,440
He's trapped in love.

554
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,690
What's the matter? You want to see him?

555
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,700
Nothing. As he's in a bad mood,

556
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,320
I won't bother him.

557
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,250
Maybe next time.

558
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,050
We're shooting the commercial tomorrow.

559
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,020
Thanks for your help

560
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,170
for finding Duan Jiayang this time.

561
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,030
I'm so sorry.

562
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,910
I haven't even thanked you properly.

563
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,440
Xiaoxiao, you don't have to be so polite to me.

564
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,040
Work is work.

565
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,060
No time like the present.

566
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,780
Let's go. I'll buy you dinner.

567
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:00,780
Sure.

568
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,580
Zhi'ang,

569
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,940
I know your intention.

570
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,190
You're a good man. I know.

571
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,770
Can I say no to being friendzoned?

572
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,350
No. To be frank,

573
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,660
you're a good man.

574
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,140
But I'm a bad person.

575
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,990
There is no way that I, Nangong Xiaoxiao,

576
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,720
can be with you.

577
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,860
Xiaoxiao, you don't like me.

578
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,030
I understand.

579
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,270
Because even I don't like myself.

580
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,670
I've been swimming for so many years,

581
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,350
but I accomplished nothing.

582
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,820
I can't do anything right.

583
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,310
Even the idol I've always admired,

584
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,050
the goal I've been pursuing,

585
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,450
in the end, are shams.

586
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,610
My life is a joke.

587
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,120
Xiaoxiao,

588
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,480
I'm not good enough for you.

589
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,810
Don't worry.

590
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,300
From now on, I won't pester you.

591
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,630
I will retreat to the position of a stranger.

592
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,290
I won't bother you.

593
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,730
It's not your problem.

594
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,150
Even we can't be lovers,

595
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,650
we can be friends.

596
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,080
Come on, drink it up.

597
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,650
We're bros now.

598
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,370
Zhi'ang,

599
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,040
do you think I'm a terrible person?

600
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,660
No.

601
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,600
I think you're great.

602
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,070
It's not that I don't believe in you.

603
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,320
I just don't believe in love.

604
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,350
My first boyfriend chased after me for six years.

605
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,340
But we broke up a month after we got together.

606
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,310
After he got me,

607
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,710
I'd fallen from grace.

608
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,500
And then, all the hopes before

609
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,190
turned into disappointment.

610
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,210
Then he cheated on me.

611
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,510
That's men.

612
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,800
Xiaoxiao,

613
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,940
you have to believe

614
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,840
that you'll meet a good man.

615
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,500
Come on.

616
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,400
Xiaoxiao,

617
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,090
tonight,

618
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,900
you can tell me whatever you want.

619
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,760
I'm listening.

620
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,350
[Caution]

621
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,350
[Drive With Caution]

622
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,270
Xiaoxiao,

623
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,550
you are not

624
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,100
as heartless as you said.

625
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,980
And in this world,

626
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,380
there is still someone who loves you with all his heart.

627
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,550
Calm down, Nangong Xiaoxiao.
