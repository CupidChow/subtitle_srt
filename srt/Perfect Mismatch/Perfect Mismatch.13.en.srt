He's a good match for Huahua.

You don't know how to swim anyway,

342
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,420

It's actually pretty simple.

You can just ask Huahua to learn how to swim with Duan Jiayang.

676
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,930
Mr. Zhou.

677
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,130
I want to learn to swim as well.

678
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,320
Mr. Duan wouldn't mind if I join, right?

679
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,320
Of course not.

680
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,860
But Mr. Zhou, won't this delay your work?

681
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,950
I don't need others to worry about my ability to work.

682
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,780
Mr. Zhou,

683
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,270
let's try our best.

684
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,630
But Jiayang and I have to go to the fitness area

685
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,440
to adapt to the breathing pace during exercise,

686
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,370
how about you do some exercise alone here for a while?

687
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,700
I'm coming with you.

688
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,770
But you haven't learned

689
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,390
the basic upper body movements yet,

690
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,020
so it's not the time to jump right into practicing breathing.

691
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,080
I, Zhou Zhifei, am such a fast learner

692
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,130
that I don't need to spend too much time

693
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,530
on upper body movements.

694
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,830
Sir, you are not allowed to enter without a shirt.

695
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,220
Being shirtless is not allowed here, sir.

696
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,150
Zhifei, I have training clothes.

697
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,990
Zhi'ang.

698
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,750
Your system has design flaws

699
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,210
and needs to be fixed.

700
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,420
Excuse me.

701
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,420
Sorry.

702
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,390
When did Mr. Zhou become so sporty?

703
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,190
Huahua,

704
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:08,990
let's go.

705
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,110
Huahua, use your core strength.

706
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,820
Shi Huahua.

707
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,460
