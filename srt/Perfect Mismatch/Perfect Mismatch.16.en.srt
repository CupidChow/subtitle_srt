521
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,740
you don't need any makeup

522
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,270
or any changes.

523
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,080
Because I like you the way you are.

524
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,210
Shi Huahua, I like you.

525
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,470
I like you the most.

526
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,780
Don't cry.

527
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,700
You still think I'm ugly.

528
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,190
No, I don't.

529
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,560
Zhou Zhifei.

530
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,030
I think now I know

531
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,140
what it feels like to be in love.

532
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,010
Do you?

533
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,720
It's getting late.

534
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,690
Time for bed.

535
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,320
Early to bed, early to rise.

536
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,720
I have a very important meeting

537
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,030
tomorrow morning.

538
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,240
Then you should have a good rest

539
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,840
to build up your strength.

540
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,610
Okay.

541
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,810
You should get some rest, too.

542
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,200
Good night.

543
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,310
Let go of me.

544
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,830
You let go first.

545
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,170
You first.

546
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,440
You first.

547
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,710
It's really time to sleep.

548
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,490
All right, then.

549
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,430
See you tomorrow.

550
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,370
Starting now,

551
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,710
I won't see you for eight hours.

552
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,940
But you'll be sleeping.

553
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,120
Close your eyes and open your eyes,

554
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,250
then you'll see me tomorrow morning.

555
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,310
Okay.

556
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:41,970
Good night.

557
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,410
Huahua,

558
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,090
have you ever thought about it?

559
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,800
Actually, we don't have to wait until tomorrow morning.

560
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,790
What do you mean?

561
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,590
Come sleep in my room.

562
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,800
I mean…

563
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,660
You can

564
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,840
come sleep in my room.

565
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,310
What are you thinking?

566
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,980
No more talking. See you tomorrow.

567
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,540
Good night.
