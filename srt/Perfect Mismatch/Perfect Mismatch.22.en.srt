178
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,240
I, Zhou Hongsheng,

179
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,930
make a promise

180
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,390
in the name of Zhou Holdings that

181
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,320
the interests of all shareholders

182
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,950
will not be harmed.

183
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,260
That's all for

184
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,570
today's stockholders' meeting.

185
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,810
The rest is our family's business.

186
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,590
If it doesn't concern you, please leave.

187
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,070
Zhifei.

188
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,130
Are you really willing to watch Grandpa

189
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,790
destroy the Zhou family's reputation for you?

190
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,830
Do you dare to

191
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,170
say in front of everyone here that

192
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,300
you have no problem?

193
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,830
Do you dare?

194
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,480
Okay.

195
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,230
Let me announce the answer.

196
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,190
Zhiran, no!

197
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:36,680
Zhifei!

198
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,400
Zhifei! Zhifei!

199
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,690
Mr. Zhou! Mr. Zhou!

200
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,190
Zhifei!

201
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,140
Go.

202
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,890
Hurry up.

203
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,000
Come on.

204
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,550
Everyone.

205
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,610
I think

206
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,070
we have one more important thing

207
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,210
to do today.

208
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,140
Am I right, Grandpa?

209
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,030
Don't be afraid.

210
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,630
Fei.

211
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,420
It's me, Zhou Zhifei.

212
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,440
What you got is never hemophobia attack,

213
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,900
but anxiety.

214
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,120
The old you was afraid

215
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,640
of being left alone,

216
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,640
so I was by your side.

217
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,970
But you now have someone

218
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,450
you can rely on.

219
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,440
You mean...

220
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,380
Huahua will stay by your side

221
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,970
and protect you for me.

222
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,120
Don't worry.

223
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,810
I will never leave you.

224
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,830
Trust me, okay?

225
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,870
Come on, grab this.

226
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:12,310
Grab it.

227
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,460
You are actually

228
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,890
strong and tough enough.

229
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,220
Feiran's current results

230
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,670
are the best proof.

231
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,430
Countless people have witnessed

232
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,550
the miracles you created.

233
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,410
[Start]

234
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,400
Zhou Zhifei.

235
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,830
You will never be alone.

236
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,650
You will never feel lonely.

237
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,750
Let's move forward together,

238
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,050
shall we?

239
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,060
Will you leave me too?

240
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,020
No.

241
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,930
Huahua will always be with you.

242
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,020
Your past shouldn't be your weakness,

243
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,440
and now

244
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,390
you have an extra armor.

245
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,300
Miss Shi.

246
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,720
Mr. Zhou turned into a child

247
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,930
after he fainted last time.

248
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,220
It's been so long.

249
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,700
Shall we wake him up?

250
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,680
No way.

251
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,150
His scar was publicly exposed

252
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,500
by his own brother,

253
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,450
which was a huge blow

254
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,950
to him.

255
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,450
Let him have some more sleep.

256
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,020
Zhifei.

257
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,400
He's awake.

258
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,900
Are you Fei?

259
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,360
Fei.

260
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,080
Chi Miqi, what did you call me?

261
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,170
Mr. Zhou.

262
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,970
Zhifei, are you okay?

263
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,819
Of course I am.

264
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,119
Zhifei.

265
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,020
Do you remember that

266
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,790
Zhiran came to the company

267
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,650
later?

268
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,829
And then?

269
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,780
Zhou Zhiran teamed up with several shareholders

270
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,280
to vote you out of the board of directors.

271
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,990
They all defected?

272
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,900
Chairman Zhou tried his best to protect you.

273
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,420
But everyone saw you

274
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,600
faint in public,

275
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,360
so they lost confidence in you.

276
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,420
Zhou Zhiran is more thoughtful

277
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,070
than any of us.

278
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,170
He posted the video

279
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,040
of your illness on the Internet,

280
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,430
and it is now circulating.

281
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,000
I've already gotten the team

282
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,600
to delete the trending topics.

283
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,580
But...

284
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,250
Huahua, who is he?

285
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,570
I am afraid.

286
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,600
Mr. Zhou.

287
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,640
Based on the location of the video,

288
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,560
we have discovered

289
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,860
Zhiran's cameras installed in your home,

290
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,320
and there is more than one.

291
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,360
This is just one of them.

292
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,180
Don't be afraid.

293
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,690
Zhifei, it's me, Zhiran.

294
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,080
Your younger brother.

295
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,740
Zhou Zhifei, relax.

296
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,010
You are well prepared.

297
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,870
Zhifei.

298
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,020
Zhiran, the school is over?

299
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,340
I have an important meeting.

300
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,510
Do your homework in my office first.

301
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,110
Wait for me to come back.

302
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,750
Okay.

303
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:02,860
Zhifei.

304
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,660
What?

305
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,570
No matter what,

306
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,500
you are the most excellent

307
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,320
in my eyes,

308
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,120
much better than those in the conference room.

309
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,690
So I believe

310
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,750
you can make it.

311
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,900
Come on.

312
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,990
I see.

313
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,530
Zhiran, be good.

314
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,110
I will fight the world for you.

315
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,390
Zhifei.

316
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,100
Zhifei.

317
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,990
Zhifei, you drank?

318
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,790
Come on, let me help you to the sofa.

319
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,050
Why did you drink so much?

320
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,180
I had a few important clients today.

321
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,420
And I had to drink.

322
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,740
Zhiran, go get me some water.

323
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,690
Okay.

324
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:14,660
Zhifei.

325
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,140
How was your day at school?

326
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,590
Good.

327
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,930
Zhifei.

328
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,280
I want to grow up quickly.

329
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,530
That way

330
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,220
you won't have to work so hard.

331
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,650
You fool.

332
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,020
With me by your side,

333
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,850
you can always be a kid.

334
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,460
You are back.

335
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,810
I am talking to you.

336
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,910
What's wrong with your clothes?

337
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,570
What happened?

338
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,910
Did you get into a fight?

339
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,510
Did you win?

340
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,030
Did you beat him?

341
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,860
I did.

342
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:52,970
Great.

343
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,150
Otherwise I will avenge you.

344
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,540
Look at you.

345
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,300
Let me apply medicine for you.

346
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,450
Are your arms okay?

347
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,170
Zhifei, be gentle. It hurts.

348
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,220
Bear with it.

349
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,820
Why weren't you afraid of pain

350
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,080
when you fought?

351
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,270
Grandpa, calm down.

352
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,180
Grandpa, Zhi'ang.

353
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,520
In your eyes,

354
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,160
am I still your grandfather?

355
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,850
You impeached Zhifei from the board of directors

356
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,730
and monopolized Feiran's power.

357
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,790
Should I

358
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:04,190
abdicate for you too?

359
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,040
Grandpa.

360
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,650
I never wanted to

361
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,230
take anything from my brother.

362
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,530
What I did today

363
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,380
was only a last resort.

364
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,040
Grandpa, calm down.

365
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,640
Zhiran.

366
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,540
When I heard that something happened to Zhifei,

367
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,520
I rushed over.

368
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,380
Apologize to Grandpa first.

369
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,740
I did nothing wrong.

370
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,270
Why should I apologize?

371
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,120
Zhi'ang, did you hear that?

372
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,520
This is your younger brother,

373
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,800
and my grandson.

374
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,980
Why are you still speaking for him?

375
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,820
Grandpa.

376
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,040
Even you think I made a mistake?

377
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,280
Zhiran.

378
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,020
Why haven't you figured out yet?

379
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,190
You partnered with outsiders to seize power

380
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,590
and stole your brother's hard work.

381
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,790
Why does the Zhou family

382
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,230
have such a wicked child

383
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,750
like you?

384
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,680
Shi Huahua

385
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,390
is the outsider.

386
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,730
She's going to take my brother away.

387
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,170
Doesn't she just want money?

388
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,300
I helped my brother guard his things

389
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,120
and helped everyone make the right decision.

390
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,230
What's wrong with me?

391
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,370
Why are you all accusing me?

392
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,490
Zhiran, what are you talking about?

393
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,530
You jerk!

394
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,750
My brother doesn't understand me,

395
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,220
and you don't believe me either.

396
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,970
You'd rather believe that outsider.

397
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,880
My surname is Zhou.

398
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,030
How come

399
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,260
you still don't understand?

400
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,740
Zhiran.

401
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,900
Think about it.

402
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,830
Zhiran.

403
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,110
You went too far this time.

404
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,380
Mr. Zhou locked himself

405
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,520
in the room alone.

406
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,640
Would anything happen to him?

407
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,320
Mr. Zhou is brave and mighty.

408
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,580
Nothing would happen.

409
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,380
Huahua.

410
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,880
Why don't you go to see him?

411
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:50,860
Zhifei.

412
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,010
You are still here.

413
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,150
Just stay for dinner tonight.

414
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,260
Huahua, I'm hungry.

415
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,720
Let's cook together.

416
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,380
Miss Nangong.

417
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,110
Why do I feel like

418
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,840
Mr. Zhou's acting weirder?

419
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,750
He won't split into

420
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,200
a new personality, will he?

421
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,220
Why do you always think bad things?

422
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,530
What Zhiran did this time

423
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,800
hit him hard.

424
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,760
Since Zhifei doesn't want to

425
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,780
talk about these unhappy things now,

426
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,280
let him calm down.

427
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,840
He can take this opportunity

428
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,330
to rest.

429
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,260
Xiaoxiao.

430
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,220
Call Zhi'ang over.

431
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,140
Chi.

432
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,680
Ask the triplets to come here.

433
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,840
Let's have dinner

434
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,130
together tonight.

435
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,380
Okay.

436
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,120
What are you doing?

437
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,880
Let's eat.

438
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,860
This is my specialty.

439
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,280
Huahua taught me for a long time.

440
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,610
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes. Take a try.

441
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,140
What...

442
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,440
Delicious.

443
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,180
Zhifei's culinary skills have improved a lot.

444
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,660
Of course.

445
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,000
I plan to let Huahua

446
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,430
teach me a dish every day.

447
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,660
I can be the chef

448
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,580
during New Year's Eve.

449
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,340
Come to my house.

450
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,400
You'll get a feast for your appetite.

451
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,520
You guys, eat.

452
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,280
It's rare for me to be approachable.

453
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,410
Do you want me to serve you personally?

454
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,080
Chi, eat.

455
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,730
Okay.

456
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,220
Huahua, and you.

457
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,940
It tastes good.

458
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,010
Huahua is so lucky.

459
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,050
You are like a Michelin chef.

460
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,690
I'm not going to

461
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,570
lose weight tonight.

462
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,880
Come on, cheers.

463
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,670
Chi, serve the wine.

464
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,480
Cheers.

465
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,970
Mr. Zhou, don't do this.

466
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,630
I'm afraid.

467
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,000
I am no longer Mr. Zhou.

468
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,320
From now on, I will call you Chi Miqi,

469
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,160
and you will call me Zhou Zhifei.

470
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,340
You have worked hard

471
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,070
by my side for so many years.

472
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,060
Take this opportunity

473
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,110
to go wherever you want,

474
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,050
and I will cover the air tickets and hotels.

475
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,520
Not at all, Mr. Zhou.

476
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,690
This is what I should do.

477
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:22,650
Don't worry.

478
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,100
No matter what happens,

479
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,300
I will be by your side.

480
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,920
So touching.

481
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:27,790
It's a pity that

482
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,310
I already have Huahua.

483
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,860
Drink less.

484
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,340
Come on.

485
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,710
Cheers.

486
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:43,700
Cheers.

487
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:45,650
You can often

488
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,900
come to my house for dinner in the future.

489
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,060
I will cook myself.

490
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,680
Drink less.

491
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,120
Enough.

492
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:56,330
Huahua.

493
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,300
Do you want to drink my wine?

494
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,550
It's okay.

495
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,350
Never mind.

496
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,100
She will only suck you dry,

497
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,980
make you unlike the Zhou Zhifei I know,

498
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,050
and ruin our relationship.

499
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,940
She's a monster.

500
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,590
She should get lost!

501
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,350
The news about the president of Feiran Capital,

502
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,880
who turned into a child after blood phobia...

503
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,410
The news was exposed by me.

504
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,830
Zhifei.

505
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,980
Are you really willing to watch Grandpa

506
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,710
make fun of the Zhou family's reputation for you?

507
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,600
Do you dare to

508
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,950
say in front of everyone here that

509
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,110
you have no problem?

510
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,490
Do you dare?

511
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,230
Zhifei. Zhifei.

512
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,240
Miss Shi.

513
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,570
Zhifei had already fallen asleep.

514
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,240
Thank you all

515
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,900
for being with him today.

516
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,530
Huahua.

517
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,910
You are welcome.

518
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,020
Not at all.

519
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,510
We are family.

520
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,520
We'll bother you in the future.

521
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,470
Don't worry, Zhi'ang.

522
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,680
I will stay here

523
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,200
and not go anywhere.

524
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,800
It's all because of Zhou Zhiran's

525
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,930
incitement and demagoguery.

526
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,680
Those shareholders are making trouble with him.

527
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,830
And my parents

528
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,270
just don't listen to me.

529
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,480
Isn't it just blood phobia?

530
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,530
It's not a big deal.

531
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,200
And Xiaoxiao said that

532
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,800
he hadn't become a child.

533
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,380
It's not a disease at all.

534
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,140
Fortunately, he didn't become a child.

535
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,520
He can be cured.

536
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,070
Huahua, just leave it to us. Don't worry.
