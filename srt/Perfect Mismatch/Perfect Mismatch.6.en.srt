00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,970
Miss Ji, what brings you here?

178
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,390
I was just working out.

179
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,390
Miss Ji?

180
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,490
That's what you call your childhood sweetheart?

181
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,920
Qing.

182
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,000
I can't hear you. Say it again.

183
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,960
Qing.

184
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,140
When did you come back?

185
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,170
Why didn't you tell me?

186
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,480
It's a surprise for you.

187
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,340
Don't you like it?

188
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,190
I…

189
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,770
You're the new spokesperson of Feiran, right?

190
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,130
Hello, I'm Shi Huahua.

191
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,420
You're so cute.

192
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,290
Zhou, I like her.

193
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,670
I can see we'll be good friends in the future.

194
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,990
You haven't eaten, have you?

195
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,080
Come on, let's have a meal together.

196
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,610
Let's go.

197
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,070
- I can't. I'm busy.
- I can't. I'm busy.

198
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,200
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

199
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,090
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Don't be ridiculous.

200
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,390
That's what you always say.

201
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,990
Why did you reject me again?

202
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,800
I have work to do.

203
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,820
Like what you just did?

204
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,080
I mean, I'm going to work right now.

205
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,510
Okay.

206
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,220
But why bring her along?

207
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,870
I want to make a new friend.

208
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,570
But Miss Ji,

209
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,370
it's work time now.

210
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,970
Why are you…

211
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,010
Don't be so rigid.

212
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,330
She's the new face of Feiran, right?

213
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,780
I want to know her more.

214
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,120
Given who I am,

215
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,850
can't we have a meal together?

216
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,950
Let's go.

217
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,150
Come on.

218
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,520
Huahua, let's go together.

219
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,710
We'll go have some fun.

220
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,350
Darn.

221
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,790
Why did she suddenly come back?

222
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,380
Hello. Here's your key.

223
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,210
Thank you.

224
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,600
Where do you want to go?

225
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,660
Let's see.

226
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,100
[Office Building]

227
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,100
My favorite restaurant, you know.

228
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,030
It's too far.

229
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,620
I drive fast.

230
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,860
Are you a good driver?

231
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,590
What? You're worried about me?

232
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,890
I'm worried about myself.

233
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,040
Don't be such a wimp.

234
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,520
So,

235
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,380
Miss Ji and Mr. Zhou have known each other for years?

236
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,700
We've probably known each other

237
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,380
for 5, 980 days.

238
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,950
That's very specific.

239
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,710
I remember every single thing

240
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,710
that happened between us.

241
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,840
Are we still going?

242
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,070
Yes. Let's go.

243
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,920
Miss Nangong, who's that Miss Ji?

244
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,840
It seems Mr. Zhou can't do anything about her.

245
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,820
That young lady is from the Ji family.

246
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,180
They're the second largest

247
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,890
shareholder of Zhou Group.

248
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,410
The Ji family?

249
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,340
Why are you here?

250
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
Who are we?

251
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,420
We're wherever gossip is.

252
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,940
Mr. Ji was a quality associate

253
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,910
of Chairman Zhou

254
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,160
when he started the business.

255
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,910
And Ji Qing is his only daughter.

256
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,940
So,

257
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,720
she's the actual controller of the Ji family now.

258
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,360
Isn't she the female version of Mr. Zhou?

259
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,940
She is much more difficult to deal with.

260
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,140
Because of the relationship between the two families,

261
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,110
she and Mr. Zhou grew up together.

262
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,920
And of course,

263
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,350
she's considered the future granddaughter-in-law of the Zhou family.

264
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,150
Even Mr. Zhou can't do anything about

265
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,770
that mischievous girl.

266
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,020
Huahua's dining out with them.

267
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,830
Will her romantic rival give her a hard time?

268
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,540
Huahua has to be careful.

269
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,390
Thank you.

270
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,310
May I take your order now?

271
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,210
Just a moment.

272
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,180
Okay.

273
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,300
Nothing has changed here.

274
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,300
Why did you suddenly return home?

275
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,570
It was boring.

276
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,880
I had to face those prudes

277
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,480
and smile to them all the time

278
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,900
when I was abroad.

279
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,450
That's not fun at all.

280
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,830
But you did a good job.

281
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,780
The overseas office got

282
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,020
a year-on-year increase of 30% this quarter.

283
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
Wait, wait, wait.

284
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,470
Zhou Zhifei,

285
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,550
all you talk about is work when you see me.

286
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,950
Why are you so boring now?

287
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,580
Change the subject.

288
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,270
Okay.

289
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,420
Let's get married.

290
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,290
No way.

291
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,460
Why did you reject me again?

292
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,580
Are you seeing someone?

293
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,230
No.

294
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,760
You've been single for 26 years.

295
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,160
What are you thinking?

296
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,860
I want to focus on work.

297
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,610
Got no plans to start a family.

298
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,150
We both have such good genes.

299
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,640
It's like a perfect match.

300
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,470
We'll have the cutest

301
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,810
and the best baby ever.

302
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,930
Never gonna happen.

303
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,160
Excuse me, may I take your order now?

304
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,620
Hold on. We're going to talk more.

305
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,860
Huahua, does Zhou Zhifei like you?

306
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,070
- What?
- What?

307
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,810
No. No.

308
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,820
It is impossible.

309
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,880
We have only a working relationship.

310
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:13,760
Really?

311
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,340
Yes.

312
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,830
It's true. I promise.

313
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,950
I don't think

314
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,860
you two belong to each other.

315
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,120
Let's start ordering.

316
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,190
Huahua, what's your favorite food?

317
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,710
Meat. I like to eat meat.

318
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,320
The M9 Wagyu here is excellent.

319
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,910
I think you can try it.

320
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,780
M9 Wagyu.

321
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,500
M9 Wagyu.

322
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,370
What's wrong?

323
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,030
Nothing.

324
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,860
Beef is fine. It gains muscle.

325
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,180
Hello.

326
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,180
I'd like a nice T-bone steak.

327
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,960
Medium rare.

328
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,240
That if you put it back on the cow,

329
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,500
it can still be alive and kicking.

330
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,520

Have you been hungry for a while?

336
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,569
I feel so hungry when I see you.

337
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,140
This is too expensive.

338
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,990
This is too expensive.

339
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,020
Miss Ji, why don't you two eat?

340
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,780
I'll just go back now.

341
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,569
Huahua, you're so cute.

342
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,180
Zhou will pay for this meal.

343
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,420
Order whatever you want.

344
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,390
Am I right, Zhou?

345
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:22,930
Just order.

346
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,369
