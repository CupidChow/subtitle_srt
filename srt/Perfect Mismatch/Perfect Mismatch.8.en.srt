Don't leave me.

348
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,800
Don't leave me.

349
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,450
Don't leave me.

350
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,930
Don't leave me.

351
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,230
I won't leave you.

352
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,890
I won't leave you.

353
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,360
So cold.

354
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,560
Mr. Zhou.

355
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,820
Why are you hiding here?

356
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,090
Get... Get up first.

357
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:06,750
Zhou...

358
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,390
Mr. Zhou.

359
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,090
I don't mean any harm.

360
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,130
What have you been through?

361
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,570
Cold!

362
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,340
So cold!

363
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,450
Cold?

364
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,930
It shouldn't be.

365
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,320
What are you doing?

366
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,420
Mr. Zhou, you're awake.

367
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,130
That's good.

368
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,130
Stick out your tongue and let me see.

369
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,160
Shi Huahua, you're so perverted!

370
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,930
I knew you were up to no good.

371
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,450
Even if you have a lust for me,

372
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,580
I'm a patient now.

373
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,110
How could you do that?

374
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,600
That's outrageous!

375
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,720
What are you thinking?

376
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,320
You're the one who said it was cold.

377
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,250
You're so...

378
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,610
Your voice is hoarse.

379
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,630
Your throat is clogged.

380
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,290
I know what's going on even without seeing your tongue.

381
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,940
You have a deficiency of both qi and blood,

382
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,070
so the inner heat cannot be dissipated from your throat.

383
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,690
If medicine doesn't work,

384
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,190
I'll have to resort to other ways.

385
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,480
Wh-what are you doing?

386
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,190
What are you doing?

387
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,870
I'm warning you, don't do anything wrong!

388
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,170
Mr. Zhou, please cooperate.

389
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,040
Just pinch your neck to achieve congestion, you'll be fine tomorrow.

390
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,900
I don't need it.

391
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,340
Don't move!

392
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,900
Shi Huahua, wh-what are you doing?

393
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,360
It's okay.

394
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,560
Very soon, very soon.

395
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,780
How's that? Does it feel good?

396
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,240
Shi Huahua, stop!

397
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,190
I can't bear it anymore.

398
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,980
Hold on a bit.

399
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,230
You'll be fine tomorrow.

400
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,300
Shi Huahua!

401
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,320
Shi Huahua!

402
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,450
You're awake.

403
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,130
Don't get me wrong.

404
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,470
This is your private lesson fee for teaching me how to swim yesterday.

405
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,330
Because you were asleep just now,

406
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,060
I couldn't add you to my WeChat.

407
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,290
So I just...

408
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,760
I hope you like this little surprise.

409
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,120
We're WeChat friends.

410
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,520
I wasn't that drunk yesterday.

411
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,940
Bye.

412
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,140
How did you get my WeChat?

413
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,420
We've met before, Xiaoxiao.

414
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,790
I've met you many times before

415
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,320
at Feiran's launch.

416
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,590
Maybe

417
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,690
you were too busy then,

418
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,090
so you don't remember me.

419
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,310
You... you're Zhou Zhi'ang?

420
00:21:59,340 --> 00:21:59,910
Yes.

421
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,180
Zhou Zhifei's cousin?

422
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,220
It's me.

423
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,490
Then yesterday...

424
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,720
You kept calling me “coach” yesterday,

425
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,600
I thought you were joking with me.

426
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,490
Let's have breakfast together.

427
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,070
No, Zhi'ang.

428
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,230
You can eat by yourself.

429
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:19,890
Bye bye.

430
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,980
Remember to eat your breakfast then.

431
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,920
The air is not bad.

432
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,330
Mr. Zhou.

433
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,110
You're up early.

434
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,910
You've recovered so fast.

435
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,910
Of course, I'm in good health.

436
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,350
I can see that.

437
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,980
You're in good health.

438
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,150
After all, you're so young.

439
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,160
Breakfast is ready.

440
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,830
Come and eat.

441
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,410
Okay.

442
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,930
Mr. Zhou.

443
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,000
You're so lucky.

444
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,220
Lucky?

445
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,920
I didn't mean anything.

446
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,120
Mr. Zhou.

447
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,830
We all understand.

448
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,600
Thank you.

449
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,400
Why are all these people so strange today?

450
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,100
Good morning, Mr. Zhou.

451
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,250
Village Chief.

452
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,920
I come to see if you're up yet.

453
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,810
According to our plan,

454
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,180
we are supposed to take you

455
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,700
up to the mountain to see the water plant.

456
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,340
But in your condition,

457
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,630
why don't we take a day off?

458
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,650
We can go there tomorrow.

459
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,710
It's a tiring trip up to the mountain.

460
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,820
No need.

461
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,710
Stick to the original plan.

462
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,450
Let's not waste time.

463
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,130
OK.

464
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,900
Mr. Zhou.

465
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,950
I'd like to speak out of turn.

466
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,470
Young people need to be more abstinent.

467
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,130
Especially for those like you who are busy with work.

468
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,550
Nothing is more important than health.

469
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,940
Abstinent?

470
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,800
Hold on a bit.

471
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,350
You'll be fine tomorrow.

472
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,650
I have to go.

473
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,550
You have breakfast first.

474
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,810
I'll pick you up later.

475
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,060
Shi Huahua.

476
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,060
What's wrong, Mr. Zhou?

477
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,860
Are we going to start off?

478
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,060
See what you've done.

479
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,830
Don't thank me too much.

480
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,580
I heard your voice was loud and clear.

481
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,830
I'm sure you've recovered.

482
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,030
It seems the method my master taught me is really working.

483
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,840
Mr. Zhou, why are you wearing this?

484
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,640
We're going hiking later.

485
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,580
You'll be uncomfortable if you sweat with this.

486
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,050
It's none of your business.

487
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:52,980
What a nuisance!

488
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:05,620
Mr. Zhou.

489
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,380
We're going up this way.

490
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,950
Another tractor ride today?

491
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,070
What are you talking about?

492
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,300
How can that be?

493
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,420
Another vehicle?

494
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,460
No vehicle.

495
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,120
Could it be horse riding?

496
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,480
There's no horse either.

497
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,120
Then how do we get up there?

498
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,970
By walking, of course.

499
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,340
Walking?

500
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:30,780
You're so useless.

501
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,160
You can't even climb a mountain.

502
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,640
Eh...

503
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,710
Come on, go home and play.

504
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,670
So useless!

505
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,610
Useless!

506
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,260
Children say what they like.

507
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,200
Mr. Zhou.

508
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,630
The roads here are so rough.

509
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,380
How can we drive or ride a horse?

510
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,790
I told you to put on gloves and bring a rope.

511
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,680
Luckily,

512
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,580
I found this on the way.

513
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,390
Use this.

514
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,660
All right, Village Chief.

515
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,610
Mr. Zhou, let's go up the mountain.

516
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,340
The road's quite rough.

517
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,200
Take your time.

518
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,010
Be cautious.

519
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,080
The road is slippery.

520
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,690
Okay.

521
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,070
Look how fast they're going!

522
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,950
Shi Huahua, I hate you.

523
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,870
I know.

524
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,160
Come on, I'll push you.

525
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,940
Come on, come on, come on.

526
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,970
Come on!

527
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:13,870
We're almost there!

528
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,950
Come on!

529
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,740
Where are we?

530
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,100
We're almost halfway there.

531
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,220
Just over this hill, we can see the water plant.

532
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,450
Only halfway?

533
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,550
Come on, Mr. Zhou!

534
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,400
Let's try and make it to the top in one go.

535
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,000
Yes.

536
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,270
I can't do it.

537
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,400
Mr. Zhou.

538
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,320
How about I carry you on the back?

539
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:15,810
Sure, sure.

540
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,740
Let me carry you.

541
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,780
I'll carry you. I'll carry you.

542
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,710
Let's carry you.

543
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

544
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,200
How about this?

545
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,170
You go rock paper scissors.

546
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,560
Whoever wins will carry me.

547
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,790
What?

548
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,870
How dare you ask someone to carry you?

549
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,180
Well, Village Chief,

550
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,180
Erniu, sir,

551
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,750
you go first.

552
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,330
Don't worry about him.

553
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,130
I'll deal with it.

554
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:30,850
Okay.

555
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,980
We'll go ahead.

556
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,390
Take your time.

557
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:33,900
Okay.

558
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,440
Take your time then.

559
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,250
Don't worry.

560
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,670
We'll wait for you ahead.

561
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,620
You can carry me even if you lose.

562
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,410
Lose...

563
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,320
Mr. Zhou.

564
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,390
You're a big man.

565
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,350
How dare you let others carry you?

566
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,700
They asked for it themselves.

567
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,050
What should I do now as they've left?

568
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,530
You...

569
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,300
You're really spoiled.

570
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,740
Shi Huahua, listen,

571
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,820
the infrastructure in Yundian Village is not improved.

572
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,180
It can't even meet

573
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,170
the most basic traffic needs.

574
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,970
I don't think there's any need to visit here at all.

575
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,160
Wait!

576
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,860
What?

577
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:03,520
Are you...

578
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,220
Are you sure you want to give up?

579
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:05,900
Yes.

580
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,060
There's no point in wasting my time.

581
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,570
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhou.

582
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,100
Sor...

583
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:12,990
Sorry for what?

584
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,940
Earth... Earthworm.

585
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,860
To run or not to run.

586
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,250
Shi Huahua, you...

587
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,010
Are you afraid?

588
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:19,680
Mr. Zhou!

589
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,110
Go, Mr. Zhou!

590
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,090
Mr. Zhou, come on!

591
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:22,670
Village Chief!

592
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,710
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

593
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,310
Mr. Zhou.

594
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,750
He's running quite fast, isn't he?

595
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,480
He couldn't even walk just now.

596
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,000
Mr. Zhou runs so fast!

597
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,010
Miss Shi is so smart.
