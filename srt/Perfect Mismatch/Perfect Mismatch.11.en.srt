It's normal to have problems.

At such a critical juncture,

No way.

175
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,490
You should know better than me

176
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,850
whether it was an operational error

177
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,420
or intentional.

178
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,670
Mr. Zhou.

179
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,510
Keep it a secret for me.

180
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,830
I will agree to whatever you say.

181
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,580
Of course Feiran would not accept

182
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,910
ill-gotten wealth.

183
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,680
I have submitted evidence to the authorities.

184
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,050
You are done for.

185
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,340
Yes, ill-gotten wealth always leads to hidden trouble.

186
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:49,800
Hello.

187
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,520
Sealed up?

188
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,990
Mr. Ren, take your time.

189
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,580
The justice you want is coming.

190
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,950
Mr. Zhou.

191
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,940
You are so cool today.

192
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,570
As always.

193
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,350
Yes, as always.

194
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,500
Mr. Zhou and Miss Shi really have a tacit understanding.

195
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,230
He protects his love domineeringly.

196
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,660
I didn't see Mr. Zhou

197
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,230
being so good at it before.

198
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,120
Didn't you keep saying that

199
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,990
eating while watching the mobile phone

200
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,320
will affect digestion?

201
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,340
What were you searching?

202
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,220
Bus route.

203
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,220
Where are you...

204
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,750
What?

205
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,960
It tastes good.

206
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,850
Shi Huahua.

207
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,040
Mr. Zhou.

208
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,160
Why did you get up so early?

209
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,750
Don't you have to work today?

210
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,470
Today is Saturday.

211
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,340
Why are you rushing out

212
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,570
so early on weekends?

213
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,820
I...

214
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,140
Morning.

215
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,860
Huahua.

216
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,430
Zhiran.

217
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,890
Why did you come to me so early?

218
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,890
I am not here for you,

219
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,320
but for Huahua.

220
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,910
We made an appointment to hang out together.

221
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,530
Yes.

222
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,000
Did you eat breakfast?

223
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,260
Why are you going out without breakfast?

224
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,710
Here it is.

225
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,490
Zhifei, I'm sorry.

226
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,710
I didn't know you got up so early.

227
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,170
So I didn't prepare yours.

228
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,140
Never mind.

229
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,880
Last night I made dumplings for him

230
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,030
and put them in the refrigerator.

231
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,200
Mr. Zhou, when you are hungry,

232
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,730
just take it out and cook it.

233
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,710
Do you know how to cook dumplings?

234
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,510
Of course.

235
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,340
What?

236
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,720
Huahua, you have no idea.

237
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,500
Once when we were kids, there was no one at home,

238
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,950
and my brother volunteered to cook dumplings for me.

239
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,110
That day,

240
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,380
I had leek and egg flavored pimple soup

241
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,720
for the first time.

242
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,090
Enough.

243
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,030
This half is for you.

244
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,390
I'm not hungry.

245
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,770
You have to eat.

246
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,240
You are just getting better.

247
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,700
Maintain good eating habits.

248
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,320
Shouldn't tonic traditional Chinese medicine be taken before meals?

249
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,570
I didn't even take the medicine, how can I eat?

250
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,280
Shi Huahua.

251
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,430
Are you in a hurry to go out

252
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,690
without even preparing medicine for me?

253
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,080
Mr. Zhou, you have made great progress.

254
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,540
You remembered all these.

255
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,540
And now you took the initiative to ask me for medicine.

256
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,880
Why should I remind you?

257
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,790
Now you are doing a better job.

258
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,290
I didn't forget.

259
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,970
It's just that you just finished your medicine today.

260
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,340
I have to take your pulse again

261
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,230
and give you a new prescription.

262
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,380
Huahua, have you finished?

263
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,650
We are running out of time.

264
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,110
Shall we?

265
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,640
Let's go.

266
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,940
Why are you in such a hurry?

267
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,470
Take a roller coaster ride.

268
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,400
Zhifei, do you want to go together?

269
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,930
You should go.

270
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,440
I am not going.

271
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,680
It's for kids.

272
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,680
Boring.

273
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,330
We are leaving then.

274
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,300
Go.

275
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,000
Mr. Zhou, remember to cook the dumplings yourself.

276
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,990
[Take care]

277
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,990
[Drive carefully]

278
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,820
You came by car?

279
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,670
I checked the bus route yesterday.

280
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,600
You're hanging out with me.

281
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,100
How could I let you go by bus?

282
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,100
But you just said to let your brother take me there.

283
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,950
I thought you wouldn't take me out.

284
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,410
Because I know my brother won't come.

285
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,350
Why?

286
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,070
Because my brother is such a person.

287
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,520
What kind of person?

288
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,760
Tsundere.

289
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,510
To put it simply,

290
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,020
he will pretend to be cold and tough

291
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,960
in order to hide his true thoughts

292
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,890
with duplicity.

293
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,550
Even if he really wanted to come with us just now,

294
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,880
once I asked,

295
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,740
he would definitely refuse.

296
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,640
He would like to come,

297
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,660
but he said no.

298
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,350
Isn't it tiring?

299
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,560
Trust me.

300
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,790
Zhifei will definitely not come today.

301
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,430
And recently Feiran is busy

302
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,660
acquiring new mineral water companies,

303
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,780
and needs to develop new products

304
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,180
and find new spokespersons.

305
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,840
Zhifei won't have time for us.

306
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,300
Right.

307
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,110
You know him better.

308
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,010
You are worthy of being brothers.

309
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,780
Of course.

310
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,550
I think I should be the person

311
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,780
who knows my brother best in this world.

312
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,700
Not this.

313
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,030
It doesn't look good.

314
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,480
Zhiran.

315
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,620
Did you keep your eyes closed the whole time?

316
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,850
Because it was so scary.

317
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,210
And you have no idea,

318
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,540
I've never dared to take a roller coaster.

319
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,580
Actually, it's my first time taking it.

320
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,540
But it feels so good.

321
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,520
That's enough for me

322
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,700
in my life.

323
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,010
Are you fine?

324
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,580
Could it be that you yelled too loudly just now,

325
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,240
which made your voice hoarse?

326
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,260
Why didn't you say you were afraid earlier?

327
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,120
Actually you don't have to try it.

328
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,750
This time is different.

329
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,880
With you here,

330
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,150
I think I can challenge myself.

331
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,150
And you always give me strength.

332
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,560
Don't worry, I will protect you.

333
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,220
When I go back,

334
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,910
I will make soup for you with loquat leaves and sterculia scaphigera.

335
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,840
Your throat will be fine tomorrow.

336
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,480
Maybe not today.

337
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,750
I haven't finished my homework and it's due tomorrow.

338
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,040
Then why did you hang out with me?

339
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,680
Never mind. It's worth it.

340
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,770
And I can

341
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,790
get it done soon.

342
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,120
I believe in you.

343
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,210
Go back.

344
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:56,950
Fighting.

345
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,150
This is for you.

346
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,420
Our personal memories.

347
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,240
8:00 AM to 8:00 PM.

348
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:10,430
Why isn't she so active at work?

349
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,589
[When are you coming back?]

350
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,589
[Shi Huahua]

351
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:25,849
[How is it going on?]

352
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:25,849
[Shi Huahua]

353
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,940
Why should I care about her?

354
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,340
I am not waiting for her.

355
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,890
Mr. Zhou, I'm back.

356
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,850
Mr. Zhou, the book is upside down.

357
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,830
I was just thinking.

358
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,180
What?

359
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,440
Why are there so many questions?

360
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,770
I haven't asked you yet.

361
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,140
What?

362
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,440
Nothing.

363
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,740
So this is tsundere, right?

364
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,850
Me?

365
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,520
Yes.

366
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,070
You must be curious about my photos.

367
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,880
So self-sentimental.

368
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,710
You just wanted to take a look.

369
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,210
But when I asked, you pretended not to care.

370
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,110
It is tsundere

371
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,970
to deliberately pretend to be tough and duplicitous

372
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,740
in order to conceal the true inner thoughts.

373
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,190
Am I right?

374
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,500
Look.

375
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,260
No!

376
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,410
You and Zhiran...

377
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,800
Yes, we went on the roller coaster together.

378
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,360
I was protecting Zhiran the whole time.

379
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,490
Does my brother need your protection?

380
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,130
Because he was a little scared.

381
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,530
Then why did he take the roller coaster?

382
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,510
Because Zhiran said that

383
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,310
I can always give him strength.

384
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,590
I think

385
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,180
this is also a new life experience,

386
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,700
isn't it?

387
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,040
Shi Huahua, I warn you.

388
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,240
Stay away from my brother and never set a bad example for him.

389
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,650
Mr. Zhou, don't worry.

390
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,500
We get along very well.

391
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,800
And I found that Zhiran is much braver than you.

392
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,970
His physical fitness

393
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,290
is also much stronger than yours.

394
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,820
And in the afternoon, we went to...

395
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,490
Shi Huahua.

396
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,100
Yes!

397
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,240
Do you know who you are?

398
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,990
I am the ninth generation descendant of the Shi's kung fu.

399
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,780
Wrong.

400
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,820
You are the spokesperson of Feiran Group's Light Oxygen Series.

401
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,660
My

402
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,420
spokesman.

403
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,480
So...

404
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,240
Are you trying to replace me?

405
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,610
You!

406
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,100
You hang out every day.

407
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,590
Are you worthy of being a spokesperson?

408
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,100
Are you worthy of Grandpa's trust in you?

409
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,230
Are you worthy of...

410
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,450
what I taught you?

411
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,410
What did you teach me?

412
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,480
What are these?

413
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,350
For people of your level of education,

414
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,760
it will always be beneficial to read.

415
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,560
Every aspect should be covered.

416
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,290
From now on,

417
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,300
you are not allowed to hang out

418
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,630
without my permission.

419
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,140
I keep you in Feiran for work,

420
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,200
not for fun.

421
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:13,950
Of course.

422
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,960
If you want to have fun,

423
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,930
I can keep you company.

424
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,660
Mr. Zhou.

425
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,150
Thank you.

426
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,300
You finally recognized my value.

427
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,320
Don't worry, I will study hard

428
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,360
and prove myself.

429
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,120
I didn't.

430
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:30,940
You did!

431
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,800
You hated me so much before,

432
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,540
and tried every means to drive me away.

433
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,310
Now you not only keep me,

434
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,790
but also let me read these books.

435
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,280
This is your recognition of me.

436
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,730
So self-sentimental.

437
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,900
You are being tsundere again.

438
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,440
Save it.

439
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,510
I will check the learning outcomes.

440
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,340
Don't worry, Mr. Zhou, I promise to complete the task.

441
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,860
Is the person you found reliable?

442
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,040
Lin Yiru dropped the ball last time.

443
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,130
Today, in front of Dad,

444
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,720
there can't be any more mistakes.

445
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,860
Just relax.

446
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,030
She is a professional actress.

447
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,580
As long as your baby boy doesn't make mistakes,

448
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,910
nothing would go wrong.

449
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,500
Why hasn't Zhi'ang come back yet?

450
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,340
Dad, Mom.

451
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,150
I was training.

452
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,020
What did you call me back in such a hurry?

453
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,880
Stop training.

454
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,540
You've practiced for so many years without any results.

455
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,460
Go get changed.

456
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,160
Let's go to your grandpa's house for dinner in a while.

457
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,620
I like my clothes.

458
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,850
This is the same style as my idol's.

459
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,820
But why are you

460
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,700
dressing so formally?

461
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,100
Of course we have to.

462
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,770
How can you be so casual

463
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,560
to see your fiancée?

464
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,220
Who?

465
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,580
We're going to your grandpa's house to meet your fiancée.

466
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,620
Dad, I don't have a fiancée.

467
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,200
You will have one in a while.

468
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,180
Your mother found you a temporary fiancée.

469
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,080
A temporary fiancée?

470
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,440
You want me to deceive Grandpa?

471
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,030
It's called filial piety.

472
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,800
You are no longer young

473
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,550
and still haven't achieved anything.

474
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,150
Listen.

475
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,550
The only thing you can do

476
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,860
to make your grandpa happy right now

477
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,140
is to make him think you're getting married

478
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,530
and he's going to

479
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,600
have great-grandkids soon.

480
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,160
You know?

481
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,050
Why do you force me to get married?

482
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,270
What else can you do if you are not married?

483
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,230
Running business?

484
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,700
I like swimming now.

485
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,400
I will try to become a professional athlete as soon as possible.

486
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,180
Wait, you...

487
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,800
You...

488
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,020
Do you know what Zhou Zhifei is doing?

489
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,320
He just invested in Yundian Village.

490
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,500
Once the water plant over there is established,

491
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,660
do you know

492
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,260
how much Feiran's turnover

493
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
will increase?

494
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,820
Well done.

495
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,680
Good for Zhifei.

496
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,030
You are still encouraging him.

497
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,820
Look at you.

498
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,320
If your grandpa directly

499
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,760
lets him take over Zhou's Holdings,

500
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,880
you will be left with nothing.

501
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,180
Mom, Dad.

502
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,100
Come on.

503
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,420
You have been fighting Zhifei for so long.

504
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,460
But you've never won.

505
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,790
Stop talking nonsense.

506
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,510
Do what we tell you to do.

507
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,660
What's more,

508
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,820
when you're at Grandpa's house,

509
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,710
talk less.

510
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,930
Understand?

511
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,280
Go get changed.

512
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,320
Feel at ease in front of Grandpa.

513
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,400
You two are getting married soon.

514
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,080
Why are you so shy?

515
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,810
Mom, I...

516
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,170
Zhi'ang.

517
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,670
Didn't you take me to see Grandpa?

518
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,680
Yes, Zhi'ang.

519
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,790
Introduce her to Grandpa.

520
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,130
Grandpa, this is...

521
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,260
What's your name?

522
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,620
Zhi'ang, you are so funny.

523
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,390
But I just like your

524
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,420
humor.

525
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,700
Grandpa.

526
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,050
My name is Mu Xiaoting,

527
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,650
I am 22 years old,

528
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,550
and I am Zhi'ang's girlfriend.

529
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,520
Zhi'ang.

530
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,060
You brought me

531
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,250
a big surprise today.

532
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,950
I don't even know

533
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,670
you have a girlfriend.

534
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,340
Neither do I.

535
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,550
Dad, they have been together for a while.

536
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,080
As elders, we didn't interfere too much

537
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,750
in their relationship.

538
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,650
Now their relationship is stable

539
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,690
and they have next plans.

540
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,680
So we took her back.

541
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,000
Zhi'ang is reliable.

542
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,720
I know it.

543
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,660
Zhi'ang, how did you know each other?

544
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,520
We...

545
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,760
Just now...

546
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,780
Just now, we would like to tell you.

547
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,450
Grandpa, you will never know.

548
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,260
Fate brought Zhi'ang and I

549
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:54,110
to meet.

550
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,870
Once when I went swimming,

551
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,760
I almost fell

552
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,590
because the ground was too slippery.

553
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,350
Hello.

554
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,810
Watch out.

555
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,930
It was Zhi'ang who helped me.

556
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,070
If I ask you to be a personal trainer,

557
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,120
can you teach me one-on-one?

558
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,520
From then on,

559
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,030
I fell in love with him at first sight.

560
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,640
Zhi'ang.

561
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,530
The meeting between the two of you

562
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,650
was so romantic.

563
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,440
Yes.

564
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,180
If you agree,

565
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,600
I will go home at once to prepare this.

566
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,230
Dad, Mom.

567
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,860
What to prepare?

568
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,420
Marriage.

569
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,840
Zhi'ang, you are no longer young.

570
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,140
Among the grandchildren, you are the eldest brother.

571
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,370
You have to set an example.

572
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,070
Start a family before you start a career.

573
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,700
Only by solving your personal problems first,

574
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,090
can you better help Grandpa

575
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,510
share the work of the group.

576
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,820
After a few years,

577
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,440
as long as Grandpa has great-grandchildren,

578
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,540
four generations under one roof

579
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:10,260
will be a real family happiness.

580
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,140
Zhi'ang, I would like our baby to be born in the year of the rabbit.

581
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,000
What about you?

582
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,220
I know you think the same.

583
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,900
Please watch your behavior.

584
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,150
Zhi'ang!

585
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,060
Dad, Mom.

586
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,880
Enough of this act.

587
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,530
You!

588
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,960
Zhi'ang.

589
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,480
What's going on?

590
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,180
Grandpa, sorry.

591
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,100
I really didn't want to lie to you.

592
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,850
I have

593
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,330
never met

594
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,890
this Miss Mu before,

595
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,480
and we are not lovers.

596
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,920
My parents asked me to bring her to please you.

597
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,060
But I think true love is precious.

598
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,180
Feelings should not be compromised because of interests.

599
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,240
Besides, Zhifei's abilities are far superior to mine.

600
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,440
He is the most suitable heir.

601
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,990
Grandpa, it was my fault

602
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,570
to lie to you today.

603
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,920
Sorry.

604
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:28,950
So absurd.

605
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,610
Right.

606
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,360
Zhi'ang went too far.

607
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,280
I am talking about you.

608
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,450
You are elders.

609
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,100
But you are not as sensible as Zhi'ang.

610
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,840
You let me down.

611
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,200
Dad, it's our fault. Calm down, please.

612
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,420
Don't stay here for dinner.

613
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,890
What are you doing here?

614
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,550
Grandpa, sorry to bother you.

615
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,980
[Deputy Vice Director]

616
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,620
Zhi'ang.

617
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,380
Why are you here?

618
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,620
I am just passing by.

619
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,150
I heard Zhifei say that

620
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,040
you often work overtime at the company on weekends.

621
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,580
I just came to try my luck.

622
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,120
Zhi'ang.

623
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,640
There are so many good girls.

624
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,390
Why are you doing this?

625
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,360
Xiaoxiao, you know what?

626
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,420
Today my parents took me on a blind date.

627
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,300
But

628
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,780
all I thought about was you.

629
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,530
Zhi'ang.

630
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,210
Today let's put aside feelings

631
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,340
and talk about reality.

632
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,680
Reality?

633
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,270
Although Feiran and Fei'ang are both

634
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,110
subsidiaries of the Zhou Group,

635
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,550
it is obvious that the two companies

636
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,560
actually have a competitive relationship.

637
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,480
And as Zhou Zhifei's partner,

638
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,100
I have always

639
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,750
stood in front

640
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,790
and confronted your parents

641
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,020
when Fei'ang and Feiran had conflicts.

642
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,470
Do you think

643
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,380
they would let a competitor

644
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,210
be their daughter-in-law,

645
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,640
and a member of their family?

646
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,190
To be honest,

647
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,020
even if they want to,

648
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,910
I feel awkward in my heart.

649
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,100
So we are not a perfect match.

650
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,690
Even if we are together,

651
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,950
we will not be happy.

652
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,820
Zhi'ang, leave me alone.

653
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,430
I have to work.

654
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,680
You are back.

655
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,430
Where have you been?

656
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,140
I know you are angry.

657
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,300
Whatever your dad and I do

658
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,860
is for your own good.

659
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,520
Is it for my own good

660
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,220
to let me marry a girl I don't know

661
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,470
to cheat Grandpa?

662
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,580
That is to fight for your status.

663
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,050
You are not as good as Zhou Zhifei at work,

664
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:15,030
and you cannot become the heir of the Zhou family.

665
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,230
So you can only have a baby

666
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,960
to please your grandpa.

667
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,990
I'm just a tool for power struggle

668
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,220
in your and my dad's eyes, right?

669
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,840
How can you think like that?

670
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,420
If you were a tool,

671
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,960
what are we?

672
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,020
Mom.

673
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,060
I know I'm good for nothing

674
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,110
to you and dad.

675
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,790
But I also have my own dreams.

676
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,320
I want to marry the girl I like

677
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,270
and live happily ever after.

678
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,750
You have a girl you like?

679
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,510
Look at you.

680
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,780
Tell me

681
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,220
who she is.

682
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,410
Do you think they would let a competitor

683
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,250
be their daughter-in-law,

684
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,380
and a member of their family?

685
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,770
Mom, if her current job

686
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,600
doesn't satisfy you,

687
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,290
what will you do?

688
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,920
Then change her job.

689
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,800
Didn't you say she is very capable?

690
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,510
Ask her to come to Fei'ang.

691
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,570
She has her own company.

692
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,400
She is a partner in that company.

693
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,730
And this company

694
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:40,330
often has friction with Fei'ang.

695
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,730
Who?

696
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,020
She works in the Zhou Group.

697
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,700
Her surname is compound.

698
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,160
Her name is made up of duplicated words.

699
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,690
Zhou Zhi'ang.

700
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,430
Don't you tell me

701
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,230
she's Nangong Xiaoxiao.

702
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,120
Yes, that's right.

703
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,430
I like her.

704
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,100
I'd like to marry her.

705
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,210
Zhou Zhi'ang.

706
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,720
Your dad and I will definitely not agree

707
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,620
to you being with Nangong Xiaoxiao.

708
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,220
Anyone else would do, except her.

709
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,990
Give up soon.

710
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,960
We will never agree.
