5
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,940
Put on some music.

6
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,900
Shout out my name!

7
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,010
Zhou Zhifei, you're so cool!

8
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,130
Shi Huahua,

9
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,440
why are you at my house?

10
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,900
Mr. Zhou, have you forgotten

11
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,460
I'm living in your house?

12
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,920
You just...

13
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,380
danced... danced well.

14
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,030
How long have you been watching?

15
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,010
Not very long.

16
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,930
I'm warning you.

17
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,579
Don't say a word about this.

18
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,620
You swear.

19
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,250
I swear.

20
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,700
Zhi'ang,

21
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,410
no more drinks.

22
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,790
I'm scared when you drink like that.

23
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,610
You don't know what I've been through today.

24
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,980
My mom and dad forced me to accept a woman,

25
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,460
so I can give them a grandchild.

26
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,440
Then they can make Grandpa happy.

27
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,010
They said the woman I like

28
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,280
is not going to be happy

29
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,070
with me. She won't be happy.

30
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,150
Tell me.

31
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,579
Am I a loser?

32
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,560
Don't be ridiculous.

33
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,470
I'm not woolgathering.

34
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,510
We are brothers,

35
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,030
but Zhou Zhifei and Zhou Zhiran

36
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,560
are both better than me.

37
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,730
Especially Zhou Zhifei.

38
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,460
At such a young age,

39
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,570
he is the president of Feiran Capital.

40
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,340
Ever since I was a kid,

41
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,410
my mom and dad always said I was no match for him.

42
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,790
They said that he was better at studies than me,

43
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,000
taller than me,

44
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,350
and better at making Grandpa happy.

45
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,459
They also said,

46
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:23,420
“If Zhifei becomes the heir to the Zhou Group,

47
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,350
I won't get anything.”

48
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,050
You know what?

49
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,040
I don't even want to compete with him.

50
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,320
I don't even want to be the heir.

51
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,909
Business is tiring.

52
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,860
I just like swimming.

53
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,340
Thanks to Zhifei,

54
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,300
I'm free

55
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,070
to pursue my dreams.

56
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,280
That's why I've always been so grateful to him.

57
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,300
I mean it.

58
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,960
And even if he was the king of the world,

59
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,420
I...

60
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,490
I'm still his older brother.

61
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,770
I'm the oldest.

62
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,910
I was born three full days before Zhifei.

63
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,100
Me,

64
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,980
Zhou Zhifei,

65
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,540
and Zhou Zhiran.

66
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,820
We've been sorted in this order since we were kids.

67
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,470
Believe it or not.

68
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,230
Even now,

69
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,490
I can get them here with one phone call.

70
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,430
Then call them.

71
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,480
Hello, Zhi'ang.

72
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,440
Hello, Zhi'ang.

73
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,300
Why are you in my bed?

74
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,880
And in my house?

75
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,040
Don't you remember

76
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,500
what happened last night?

77
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,770
I remember I was having a drink with Wang.

78
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,330
And then...

79
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,970
And then...

80
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,570
I got drunk?

81
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,830
Zhi'ang, do you have anything to eat?

82
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,730
Let's go get you something to eat.

83
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,940
There are only eggs.

84
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,800
Why don't we order some takeaway?

85
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,980
But I don't want takeaway today.

86
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,810
Why don't you cook for us?

87
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,800
But we only have eggs.

88
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,530
Use your intelligence, Zhi'ang.

89
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,340
All right.

90
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,780
Zhiran, are these enough?

91
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,670
I don't think so.

92
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,140
It's not enough?

93
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,340
Are there any other ways to cook eggs?

94
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,420
Come on, Zhiran, don't be hard on Zhi'ang.

95
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,020
Let's eat.

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,230
By the way, I was drunk yesterday.

97
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,530
What exactly did I do?

98
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,900
You went streaking.

99
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,280
No way.

100
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,020
I don't remember anything.

101
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,070
Ask Zhifei if you don't believe me.

102
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,350
I even recorded a video. Do you want to see it?

103
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,570
A video?

104
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,570
Look, it burns my eyes.

105
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,750
Give it to me!

106
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,490
No, no, no.

107
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:54,990
Give it to me.

108
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,020
You can delete it if you want.

109
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,550
But you have to give me something in exchange.

110
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:00,880
Okay.

111
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,560
What do you want?

112
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,400
Tell me.

113
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,910
I can give you whatever you want.

114
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,590
I want...

115
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,370
Zhifei, let's have a competition today.

116
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,310
Let's see who can pop more balloons.

117
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:22,890
Okay.

118
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,320
You have to aim squarely at the balloons.

119
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,980
Otherwise Zhi'ang's body...

120
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,750
By the way, my hand...

121
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,490
I carried you back last night,

122
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,900
so I can't even lift my hands now.

123
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,570
Well, then.

124
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,320
To be fair.

125
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,309
I'll do it with my eyes closed.

126
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,130
No, no, no, no, no.

127
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,870
No, no.

128
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,659
If you can't do it,

129
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,640
I'll post your video of streaking.

130
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,740
Okay, fine.

131
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,350
Stab me.

132
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,680
Zhiran,

133
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,470
you saw that Zhi'ang was in a bad mood recently,

134
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,800
that's why you wanted to tease him, right?

135
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,370
I feel sorry for Zhi'ang

136
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,810
having parents

137
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,190
like that.

138
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,680
I knew it.

139
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,990
Our Zhiran is the kindest of all.

140
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,210
Don't say anything.

141
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,530
You're going to lose the game again.

142
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,060
Okay.

143
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,580
Zhiran,

144
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,260
did you delete my video

145
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,170
or not?

146
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,600
Didn't you stick a note on my face?

147
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,560
We're even.

148
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,530
Didn't you and Zhifei give up actively?

149
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,300
Zhi'ang,

150
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,620
why do you

151
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,900
work out every day?

152
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,600
To become a professional athlete, of course.

153
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,820
That's right.

154
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,380
You're at least

155
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,260
a pre-selected swimmer.

156
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,400
If you're going to compete internationally one day,

157
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,280
then your figure

158
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,190
will be watched by the world.

159
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,580
I

160
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,930
just let you have the feeling of

161
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,260
being a star in advance.

162
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,030
No.

163
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,570
Is streaking the same as swimming?

164
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,870
Think about it.

165
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,890
Streaking means you don't wear any clothes, right?

166
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,890
And swimming is also without clothes.

167
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,640
Streaking

168
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,320
is a kind of running, right?

169
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,900
Yes.

170
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,370
Is running a sport?

171
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,730
Sure.

172
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,720
Is swimming also a sport?

173
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,120
Yes.

174
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,590

Tell me and I'll buy it for you.

347
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,230
Zhi'ang, I can buy the bag I like myself.

Xiaoxiao, I know

358
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,780
you said that

359
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,640
because you didn't want me to be caught in a dilemma.

360
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,780
You think for me all the time.

But I've always misunderstood you.

a very important meeting tomorrow.

You should go first.

Did I have a dream last night?

Hello?

Zhi'ang, why aren't you here yet?

Do you want me to pick you up?

You're going to work at Feiran?

What's the matter? Can't I?

My personal assistant, An,

413
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,630
came to give Shi Huahua a hard time

414
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,110
without telling me.

415
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,690
It was her own decision.

416
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,560
It had nothing to do with me.

417

When I heard about this, I fired her.

Shi Huahua, after all,

419
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,310
is Feiran's spokesperson.

420
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,270
Afterwards,

421
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,900
I want to be friends with her.

00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,750

00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,270
let the personnel department arrange it.

431
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,670
Chi is my assistant. I can't give him to you.

432
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,340
All right. Arrange an office for me first.

433

Miss Ji,

434

this is an office specially arranged for you by Mr. Zhou.

435

Not bad.

436

Your name is Chi, right?

437
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,350
If you think

438
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,970
the offer I just made is okay,

439
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,370
I can get Mr. Zhou to agree.

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,660
Thank you, Miss Ji, but no need.

441
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,800
I didn't expect you to be so loyal to Mr. Zhou.

442
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,830
Mr. Zhou is very good to me.

443
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,960
It's okay.

444
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,180
You don't have to be my assistant.

445
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,350
You should know about

446
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,950
Mr. Zhou's schedule, right?

447
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,420
If you tell me his schedule,

448
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,780
I won't treat you badly.

449
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,560
Miss Ji,

450
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,620
I'm afraid I can't do that.

451
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,490
Well done.

452
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,750
I was just testing you for Mr. Zhou.

453
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,450
I didn't expect to see such a person like you

454
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,190
around Mr. Zhou.

455
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,310
I'm so relieved.

Thank you for your compliment, Miss Ji.

457
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,550
You should know about my relationship with Mr. Zhou, right?

458
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,360
Of course.

459
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,830
You're the major shareholder of Zhou Group.

460
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,850
Mr. Zhou respects your opinions.

461

That's not what I mean.

462
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,260

00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,190

It was Chairman Zhou's decision.

Besides, although Miss Shi starts from a very low level,

she is serious and responsible about her work.

And his energy has got better.

Why are you on her side?

488
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,540
Have you been bribed by her?

489

she'll be the president's wife?

Then our Feiran Capital

00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,270
I was reading about psychology today.

516
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,160
There's a question I don't understand.

517
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,240
You can ask me.

518
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,660
The book says that people's choices

519
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,950
are not often driven by thoughts

520
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,400
but subconsciousness.

521
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,360
Subconsciousness controls the direction of a person's actions.

522
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,790
Just like destiny.

523
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,380
So understanding subconsciousness

524
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,380
helps you find the button of destiny.

525
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,190
So what is subconsciousness?

526
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,310
Subconsciousness is

527
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,380
the most easily ignored unconsciously.

528
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,380
It's the voice hidden in your heart.

529
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,050
Hidden in the heart?

530
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,420
Then, isn't it hard to find out?

531
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,590
Yes, it's hard to notice it.

532
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,340
The outsider sees the most of the game.

533
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,660
I got it.

534
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,800
That's why thoughts determine words and actions.

535
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,360
The heart determines the choices.

536
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,530
What people show is often

537
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,870
an illusion.

538
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,270
For example, you.

539
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,540
Me?

540
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,190
You think you're a cold person,

541
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,160
so you act dominantly and toughly.

542
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,090
You look like you're unapproachable.

543
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,830
But in fact, you are very soft inside.

544
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,290
What you said is annoying,

545
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,530
but I think

546
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,030
you've never done anything

547
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,080
to harm me.

548
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,450
You never realized it.

549
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,370
Am I right?

550
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,240
You...

551
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,450
So,

552
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,590
did I find your button?

553
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,430
Am... I right?

554
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,250
Sheer nonsense.

555
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,780
[Feiran Capital]

556
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,980
Zhifei, you're in a good mood today.

557
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,780
Of course.

558
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,140
The contract with Yundian Village has been signed.

559
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,600
The water plant has finally been finalized.

560
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,230
I don't think it's just because of this.

561
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,660
The meeting time was announced on short notice.

562
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,150
And you suddenly invested Yundian Village.

563
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,430
You just want to surprise Huahua, right?

564
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,870
The way you create surprise

565
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:41,950
is quite unusual.

566
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,510
I'm not you.

567
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,400
Don't try to make assumptions about me

568
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,860
in the way you make fun of the young boys.

569
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,320
Mr. Zhou, Miss Nangong, Mr. Zhi'ang is here.

570
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,530
Zhi'ang.

571
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,970
This looks like your dad's clothes.

572
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,220
Zhi'ang, it's rare to see you dressed in business attire.

573
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,920
You must be here for business.

574
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,500
I guess... you found Duan Jiayang?

575
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,190
This should be put inside.

576
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,550
Yes, I've contacted him.

577
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,660
He can come to the company tomorrow.

578
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,000
You can discuss the details later.

579
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,080
Really? I knew you can make it.

580
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,080
Thank you for your hard work.

581
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,290
No, it's my pleasure.

582
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,780
I'll come with him tomorrow.

583
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,340
He's my idol too.

584
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,180
Zhiran, you're here too?

585
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,300
Zhi'ang.

586
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,290
I'm waiting for my brother.

587
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,110
Why are you dressed like this?

588
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,490
Am I handsome?

589
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,360
Zhi'ang,

590
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,660
do you know there's a term called "confident but ordinary man"?

591
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,940
Of course.

592
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,730
But it doesn't suit me.

593
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:14,900
Because...

594
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,790
You're not confident?

595
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,420
No.

596
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,350
Because I'm not ordinary.

597
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,230
What are you reading?

598
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,820
I can't understand it.

599
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,830
Sometimes I think it would be nice if you and I

600
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,530
could complement each other.

601
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,070
What do you mean?

602
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,740
I'd share my health and good looks with you.

603
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,200
You share a bit of your intelligence with me.

604
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,600
Then we'd be invincible.

605
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,990
That makes sense.

606
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,670
Seriously.

607
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,100
Although Xiaoxiao likes me a lot right now,

608
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,060
I guess, girls always admire smarter men.

609
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,150
And Xiaoxiao is very smart herself.

610
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,360
If I could be a little more intelligent,

611
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,170
I'm sure she'd love me more.

612
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,870
Is there any way to become smarter?

613
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,100
Share with me.

614
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,240
Be smart?

615
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,180
Drink more milk from an early age.

616
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,950
Really?

617
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,250
Then I'll try it.

618
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,290
But you're so old now.

619
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,580
It won't help.

620
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,000
According to research,

621
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,270
aerobic exercise helps to produce new neurons.

622
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,300
Then,

623
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,990
with intense brain exercise,

624
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,220
real nerve cells will be formed.

625
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,790
People could be smarter.

626
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,060
Aerobic exercise?

627
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,010
I'm good at it.

628
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,950
I'm off.

629
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,890
I'm going to swim two more laps.

630
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:41,770
By the way,

631
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,460
you just said I need

632
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,660
high-intensive brain exercise.

633
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,650
How about watching Detective Conan?

634
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:53,810
Yeah.

635
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,860
Great.

636
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,800
Mr. Zhou,

637
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,840
I have to say

638
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,770
your health has improved a lot.

639
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,530
Can I stop taking my medicine then?

640
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,330
Medicine has its side-effect.

641
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,490
You can stop taking Chinese medicine.

642
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,480
But the diet and exercise routine I've set for you

643
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,970
must be maintained.

644
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,600
Health maintenance is a lifelong commitment.

645
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,270
Fine.

646
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,940
Also, for your current physical condition,

647
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,680
I have specially selected a few moves

648
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,950
from Shi's kung fu to teach you.

649
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,320
If you practice them in the morning, noon and evening respectively,

650
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,470
your health will definitely get better and better.

651
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,140
Okay, let's start practicing now.

652
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,690
Hurry up!

653
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,050
Come on.

654
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,920
Spread your legs and

655
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,750
relax.

656
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,420
Arms down.

657
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,830
Take a deep breath.

658
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,000
Exhale.

659
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,660
This...

660
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,660
Is this movement from Shi family-style Fist's kung fu?

661
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,080
If you want to learn Shi's kung fu,

662
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,990
you have to open up your meridians first.

663
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,590
And shout it out.

664
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,780
Haven't you eaten? Shout it out!

665
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,660
Follow me!
