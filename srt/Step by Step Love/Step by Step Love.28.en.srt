try this grilled fish.

57
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,540
This is the signature dish.

58
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,219
It really tastes good.

59
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:14,899
I heard from Ran

60
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,420
that you are a regular here.

61
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,779
She orders a lot every time she comes.

62
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,980
Sometimes, she takes it to go

63
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:22,500
and eats while working back home.

64
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,420
She loves the food here.

65
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,339
So today,

66
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,259
we'll order all your favorites.

67
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,660
My treat.

68
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,459
At my expense, of course.

69
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,779
I can't let you pay.

70
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:33,459
Save it.

71
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,540
Come on.

72
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:43,019
Lu Cenyang has gone too far.

73
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,819
He is so late.

74
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,339
He disrespects you.

75
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,019
I'm being patient for you, Minde.

76
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,300
I have heard him badmouthing me.

77
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,620
Speak of the devil.

78
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,540
Have a seat.

79
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,339
Minde.

80
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:58,300
I heard you're good at electrical work.

81
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,740
Have you fixed the lights?

82
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,500
Yeah, the light is brighter than you.

83
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,500
Ever since I installed the street lights
for Bu Ran,

84
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,100
she no longer has to be afraid
on the way home.

85
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,779
When I drove her home,

86
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,259
I never saw her being afraid.

87
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:12,819
Given your driving skills,

88
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,019
she won't need you to do that.

89
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:15,300
You're burning bridges.

90
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,500
Without Bu Ran,

91
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,579
I wouldn't have worked with you.

92
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:24,540
That makes sense.

93
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,819
I'm happy to work with you.

94
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,779
Let's make a deal.

95
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,579
I'm leaving Pinshang,

96
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:33,180
and you do what you should do.

97
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,019
I am doing what I should.

98
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,899
Pinshang is not your target.

99
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,860
Siqi should not be your enemy.

100
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,180
And Bu Ran,

101
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:42,940
she just wants to be a good designer.

102
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,060
Don't get her involved.

103
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:44,779
Alright.

104
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,379
Then we'll do as you say.

105
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,540
I thought of bringing you down.

106
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,819
Turns out we're on the same page.

107
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,060
It's really boring.

108
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,540
I gotta go.

109
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,620
Minde, you need to teach him a lesson.

110
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:09,660
When Ms. Hua found him,

111
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:10,779
we both agreed

112
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:12,420
to deal with Yihua together.

113
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,300
But he just messed with me at this time.

114
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,180
When you made a deal with me,

115
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,339
you didn't say anything
about moving into Bu Ran's place.

116
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,259
It all evens up.

117
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:32,060
If Mingyu were still alive,

118
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,060
he would have been so happy
to see you two like this.

119
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,740
Minde.

120
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:47,500
Today,

121
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,339
I want to thank you on behalf of my dad.

122
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,019
And I want to say

123
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:58,980
that you've been doing the right things
these years.

124
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:04,579
Minde.

125
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,860
Thank you.

126
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,180
Come on.

127
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:23,219
According to the plan,

128
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,819
you must have had what we want.

129
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,019
Previously, you used Pinshang
as a stepping stone,

130
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:28,300
making me enter Yihua.

131
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,779
Ms. Hua trusts me completely.

132
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,020
Plus, with Minde's guidance,

133
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:38,499
it won't be hard

134
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,180
to find Yihua's dirty laundry.

135
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:42,060
If we didn't bet Pinshang,

136
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:43,660
how could we lure Yihua into the trap?

137
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,339
Anyway,

138
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:46,780
thank you.

139
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,699
I didn't misplace my trust.

140
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:49,780
Since you tried

141
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,020
to have Minde come to persuade me

142
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,140
and get my empathy,

143
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,099
I couldn't fail my mission.

144
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:03,859
Cheers.

145
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:22,020
Ms. Hua.

146
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,619
Long time no see.

147
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,619
You've finally shown up.

148
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:27,780
What?

149
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,459
Are you here to beg me?

150
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:32,699
I learned the lesson when Yihua

151
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,780
took over Lu Group.

152
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:35,900
I'm not letting it happen again.

153
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,060
I know Minde is helping you.

154
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,940
Anyway, Pinshang has already lost.

155
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
You rely on someone

156
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:46,420
who was kicked out of my house
to turn the tide.

157
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:50,060
It's really ridiculous.

158
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:51,579
You're right.

159
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,619
I asked Minde for help.

160
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,739
But that's not because he's your son,

161
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,900
but because he is Bu Ran's dad.

162
00:09:58,499 --> 00:09:59,900
Whether my goal can be achieved

163
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:01,859
doesn't depend on Minde.

164
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,060
Mom.

165
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:07,660
I hear Qin Xun is

166
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,219
investigating project records at Yihua.

167
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:10,780
If he turns against us, I'm afraid...

168
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:11,859
Impossible.

169
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:14,339
He has no reason to help Lu Cenyang

170
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,739
and fall out with us.

171
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,780
I envy Ms. Hua's confidence.

172
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,459
Thank you for your trust

173
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:32,099
and for giving me a chance

174
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,900
to investigate Yihua's past projects.

175
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,380
Turns out
Mingyu was not the only victim.

176
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:37,979
Minde helped me

177
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,540
find these materials at Yihua.

178
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,780
I believe you've read them.

179
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,459
Mom.

180
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:00,000
(Completed Project Information)

181
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:03,380
Yihua did wrong.

182
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,060
We have to admit it.

183
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,979
You...

184
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:12,660
I didn't expect

185
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,140
you to stab me in the back again.

186
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,420
Seven years ago,

187
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:19,819
for Lu Mingyu,

188
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:22,619
you reported Yihua
at the cost of going to jail.

189
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,940
Today,

190
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:25,780
Lu Cenyang has persuaded you

191
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,260
to work for him.

192
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,219
Are you standing up
for Bu Huiyun and her daughter?

193
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,020
You are so ruthless to me.

194
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,180
Mom.

195
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,859
You must believe me.

196
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,260
All I want is

197
00:11:48,219 --> 00:11:49,660
to ensure Yihua

198
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,260
gets better.

199
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:53,260
I am your son,

200
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:57,099
and that will never change.

201
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:58,660
I want to end our grudges

202
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,979
with the Lu family.

203
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,660
Otherwise, this time,

204
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:07,380
Yihua will be in crisis.

205
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,900
Ms. Hua.

206
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,180
If you agree to explain it all

207
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,699
to the public at a press conference

208
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:16,660
and ensure Yihua

209
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:18,739
will not use any despicable means

210
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,739
to interfere with any projects
of any company,

211
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,140
we can

212
00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:25,099
negotiate a solution.

213
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:26,300
Mom.

214
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,140
We cannot do what he said.

215
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:30,180
You're ganging up together

216
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,260
to suppress Yihua.

217
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,060
You can't win.

218
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:34,900
You have no right

219
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,940
to meddle.

220
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:39,020
What right do you have to defy me?

221
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:41,339
Minde.

222
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:43,099
You're helping them to pressure Mom.

223
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:44,940
You think you're helping Bu Ran.

224
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:47,260
But you're actually joining them
to help Lu Siqi

225
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,180
create another Lu Group.

226
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,739
With Lu Siqi being the biggest winner,

227
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:54,579
Bu Ran

228
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:56,339
will only lose even more.

229
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,380
You think about it.

230
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,459
Don't help our enemy's daughter.

231
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,780
No matter what will happen,

232
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,099
it's none of your business.

233
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,180
Ms. Meng, Ms. Hua.

234
00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:19,140
I am willing to set aside grudges
and reconcile with Yihua.

235
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,380
And I hope you can drop your prejudices

236
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:24,540
and collaborate with Pinshang
for a win-win situation.

237
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,660
Besides,

238
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,219
I need you

239
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,060
to pass a message to Yi Zihe for me.

240
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,819
Last time I used him to force my brother
to break up with Bu Ran,

241
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,380
making him hide himself.

242
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:38,819
I'm sorry about it.

243
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,940
And I want to apologize to him.

244
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,260
What?

245
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,900
My son is crazy about you.

246
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,140
It's all your fault.

247
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,739
How dare you deceive him.

248
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,140
How dare you.

249
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,979
Ms. Meng.

250
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:54,219
Do you have to use violence?

251
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,979
Lu Cenyang, you can't threaten me.

252
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:01,060
Even if the Yi Family admits defeat,
I have my maternal family behind me.

253
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,540
I will absolutely not let you win.

254
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:03,459
Enough.

255
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,380
This is Yihua.

256
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,619
Mom, they are being aggressive.

257
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,940
We can't be too nice.

258
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,859
Aunt Xin.

259
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,099
You are not afraid of us.

260
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,900
And you don't really care about Yihua.

261
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,859
What you care about

262
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:17,699
is whether Zihe
can inherit the family business.

263
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,499
It's your pride and selfishness

264
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:21,060
that lead to the division of the family.

265
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,979
- Meng Kexin.
- What?

266
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,219
Yi Mincai.

267
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:31,420
Have you lost your mind?

268
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:33,459
What did you just call me?

269
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:35,459
Right now,

270
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,339
can't you face reality?

271
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:38,619
If we don't sign,

272
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,420
we'll be done for.

273
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,380
Shut up.

274
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:44,020
You've been a spineless person
before we got married.

275
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,619
Even now, you're being more coward.

276
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,300
Luckily, mom and I
have been supporting this family.

277
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,819
Don't you feel guilty?

278
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:51,780
Yeah.

279
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,180
I shouldn't have married you.

280
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:56,660
You're my wife.

281
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,780
You endure my mediocrity

282
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,180
because you expect Zihe
to take over Yihua

283
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,540
and you can hold your head high.

284
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,339
After all these years,

285
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,819
have you ever seen me as your husband?

286
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,859
No, you haven't.

287
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,219
I've had enough of you.

288
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,260
If you keep this up,

289
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,940
we'll divorce

290
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,940
as you said before.

291
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,780
You can't make a fuss in this house.

292
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,540
Yi Mincai, are you insane?

293
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:25,339
I'm not.

294
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,499
It's all our fault.

295
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,060
In front of everyone,

296
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:29,459
you apologize to my brother.

297
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:47,780
Okay.

298
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:51,339
You're asking me to do that?

299
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,739
No way. I'll divorce you.

300
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:58,180
Mincai.

301
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,260
Although you're not smart,

302
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:06,339
you are not supposed

303
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:07,979
to say something so foolish.

304
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:08,979
Mom.

305
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,219
I'm tired of this.

306
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,140
I don't want
to endure a loveless marriage

307
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,499
for the sake of Yihua's plan anymore.

308
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:24,699
I've finally thought it through

309
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,459
and ended it all.

310
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,540
If you're not satisfied,

311
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,780
you can abandon a son like me.

312
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,300
Minde.

313
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:05,340
I'm sorry.

314
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,219
Ms. Hua, please wait a moment.

315
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,100
It seems

316
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:42,900
you won't stop until I step down.

317
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:43,979
You've misunderstood me.

318
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,459
From the beginning till now,

319
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,420
I have never intended
to bring down Yihua.

320
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,299
Never.

321
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:50,219
I just want to fulfill my dad's dream.

322
00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:54,340
Investors suggested that Yihua

323
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:56,539
and Pinshang
finish the Ancient Alley project.

324
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,100
They hope

325
00:17:58,219 --> 00:17:59,820
that I can be the bridge
between the two firms

326
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,459
and persuade you to agree to the merger,

327
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:04,820
retain the Yihua management
led by Qin Xun,

328
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,380
and work together with Pinshang

329
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,660
to reshape Yihua's corporate culture

330
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,340
and upgrade the products.

331
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,739
I'm not a child.

332
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,420
I won't be frightened by you.

333
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:19,459
Actually,

334
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:22,699
I would like to take you to a place.

335
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,420
Where to?

336
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,019
The place where you worked with Bu Ran
for the first time.

337
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,580
Ms. Hua.

338
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:47,499
This is where you and Bu Ran

339
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:48,820
worked together for the first time.

340
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:51,100
At the groundbreaking ceremony,

341
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:53,059
in front of me,

342
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,259
you acknowledged her as your family
for the first time.

343
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,699
I have seen your design.

344
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,299
Mr. Lu truly has an eye for talent.

345
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:08,340
Work harder,

346
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,059
and make your boss

347
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,100
and your family proud.

348
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,820
That day had a great impact on Bu Ran.

349
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,499
Ms. Hua.

350
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:21,860
I believe at that moment,

351
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,180
you must have been proud
of your granddaughter.

352
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,539
Sometimes, I show a bit of human touch

353
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,340
to save face in public.

354
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:34,459
I will never shake the public's trust

355
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:37,660
in Yihua for someone
with the surname Bu.

356
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:44,380
Both the company
and the space are just shells.

357
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:46,259
What can make the company

358
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:47,580
and the space lively is people.

359
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,539
The right people and aesthetics

360
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:52,059
can imbue them
with greater value and meaning.

361
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,820
The reconstruction of the orphanage

362
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:55,739
has given children

363
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:57,660
a better environment for growth,

364
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,459
making them more optimistic,
cheerful, and friendly.

365
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,820
People and the environment
complement each other.

366
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,459
The Director said

367
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:08,499
that the couples who came here

368
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,820
have all adopted children they like.

369
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:13,860
So, more people regain familial love.

370
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,459
This is the gratifying result

371
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,940
of our collaboration.

372
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:18,820
Ms. Hua.

373
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,620
Do you really not wish

374
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,580
to reconcile with Minde and his family?

375
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,860
Yihua is my remembrance of my husband.

376
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:35,620
I thought I would not fail him

377
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:38,380
by making it stronger and bigger.

378
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,140
Your suggestion

379
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,219
does not move me in the slightest

380
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:47,219
because you are too unpredictable.

381
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,459
Who knows

382
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,820
whether you'll completely

383
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,380
sever the Yi Family from Yihua?

384
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:12,900
Ms. Hua.

385
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,660
I understand your concerns.

386
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:18,140
I was one of the lonely children

387
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,340
in the orphanage.

388
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:21,380
Since I met my dad,

389
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,779
I have started to smile

390
00:21:23,219 --> 00:21:24,860
like those children.

391
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:26,699
My dad's death

392
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,459
has always weighed on my mind.

393
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:30,019
I once vowed

394
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:31,539
that I would definitely avenge him

395
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:32,860
and let any member

396
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,219
of the Yi Family pay the price.

397
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:36,860
But since I met Bu Ran,

398
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,940
everything has changed.

399
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:40,620
She made me believe

400
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:41,979
that besides revenge,

401
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:44,100
there are many meaningful things
to do in my life.

402
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,940
My joys and sorrows

403
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,739
became closely linked to her.

404
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,140
Because of her,

405
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,459
I let go of Yi Mincai

406
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,180
again and again.

407
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:55,100
She gradually melted the hatred
in my heart.

408
00:21:58,739 --> 00:21:59,620
Uncle Lu.

409
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:04,620
Xiao Yu.

410
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,019
Congratulations.

411
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:14,259
You have new parents now.

412
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,259
I'll have mom and dad to accompany me.

413
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,620
Uncle Lu, don't work too hard.

414
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,779
Spend more time with Bu Ran, okay?

415
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,459
Alright, big guy.

416
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,979
Go home with your parents.

417
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:29,180
If Bu Ran and I have time,

418
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,660
we'll come to see you.

419
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,380
Go on.

420
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:33,019
Bye.

421
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,820
Bye.

422
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:36,820
Let's go home.

423
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:40,499
What do you want to eat?

424
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,779
Anything's fine.

425
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,380
I'll get it.

426
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,059
Ms. Hua.

427
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:45,380
The business we are engaged in

428
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,699
can bring people happiness.

429
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,459
Can't we let our loved ones

430
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,340
also enjoy this happiness?

431
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,539
I have already decided.

432
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,059
After our companies successfully merge,

433
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,259
I will step out.

434
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:03,340
I want to spend more time with Bu Ran

435
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,459
and travel with her.

436
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:06,699
I have promised

437
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:08,660
to help her become the best designer.

438
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,219
I must keep my promise.

439
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,299
So,

440
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,820
I hope you can help me retire early.

441
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:22,259
Grandma.

442
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,340
Don't be punctilious.

443
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:28,539
I know you two have broken up.

444
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:31,259
Don't call me Grandma.

445
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,059
Grandma.

446
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,019
Bu Ran and I are back together.

447
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,860
Qin Xun.

448
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
You inform the shareholders

449
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,019
of the merger details.

450
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:09,779
Tell them I have given my approval.

451
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:12,259
Ask them to cooperate fully.

452
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:15,699
Yes, Madam.

453
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,380
Minde.

454
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,739
You contact the media.

455
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:27,539
I don't mind showing up.

456
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,299
It's no big deal.

457
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:39,699
Bu Ran.

458
00:24:41,219 --> 00:24:42,420
Your designs

459
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:45,420
for the orphanage and Ancient Alley

460
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,380
are filled with emotion.

461
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,620
Indeed, they surprised me.

462
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,900
I took away your blueprints
in a dishonest way.

463
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:55,739
It was indeed disgraceful.

464
00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:00,180
I can no longer keep up with the times.

465
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,019
In the future,

466
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:05,180
you must use the best design
and services

467
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,580
to make Yihua bigger.

468
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:13,739
Otherwise, I will reverse my decision.

469
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:16,459
Grandma.

470
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,580
If I seek your advice

471
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:20,059
on my designs,

472
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,259
will you be okay?

473
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,979
Of course, I will be.

474
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:35,660
Alright.

475
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,259
I want to go home
and catch up on some sleep

476
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,259
Mom.

477
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,299
I'll take you back.

478
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,459
Siqi.

479
00:26:19,499 --> 00:26:20,580
Why are you here?

480
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,019
I am waiting for you.

481
00:26:23,219 --> 00:26:24,699
I just came from Yihua.

482
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:26,259
Do you know

483
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,940
what happened?

484
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,820
I know my family

485
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:31,940
once hurt your family.

486
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,100
It's all my shares in Yihua,

487
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:37,779
but not many,

488
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,100
I wanna make amends.

489
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:43,019
I will transfer them all to you.

490
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,059
I apologize for Yihua.

491
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:48,779
And I'm taking the stand

492
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,059
that I support Yihua's cooperation
with Pinshang.

493
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,420
Don't think that by doing this,

494
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:55,459
I will agree to be your girlfriend.

495
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:56,699
That's not what I mean.

496
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,499
No strings attached.

497
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:00,499
However,

498
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,340
I still want to take this opportunity
to express my stance to you.

499
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,620
I like you,
but it's not a spur-of-the-moment thing.

500
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,420
When my parents are getting a divorce
over a dispute on interests,

501
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,979
I realize

502
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:15,739
a loveless relationship

503
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:18,140
would not end up well.

504
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:19,940
But ever since I met you,

505
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,219
my life has leaped out of chaos

506
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:25,100
with a direction and a goal.

507
00:27:26,219 --> 00:27:26,979
From now on,

508
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,620
I will shed all the glories of my family

509
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:31,140
and start from scratch.

510
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,820
And one day,

511
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:35,340
when I become the man you've dreamed of,

512
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:37,860
you can give me a chance.

513
00:27:56,438 --> 00:27:58,496
(Equity Transfer Agreement)

514
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,019
Is mom doing okay?

515
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,299
After so many years,

516
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,860
she finally let it all go.

517
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,860
She looks so tired.

518
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,059
Mom can finally sleep well.

519
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,539
It's time to take a new family picture.

520
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:17,140
Qin Xun is here.

521
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:17,660
Long time.

522
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:19,059
- Qin Xun is here.
- Qin Xun.

523
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:20,779
- Qin Xun is here.
- Qin Xun is here.

524
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:22,900
So handsome.

525
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,340
Long time.

526
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,499
Long time no see.

527
00:29:25,699 --> 00:29:28,340
I heard you're CEO now.

528
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,820
No wonder your style has changed.

529
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:31,940
You look more handsome.

530
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,140
Yes.

531
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:34,180
I'm flattered.

532
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,219
I'm going to say hi to Xu.

533
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,860
I'll come back to you later.

534
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:39,019
Okay.

535
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,860
Xu.

536
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:46,620
You're here.

537
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:48,499
Long time no see. Do you miss me?

538
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,019
You make me suffer.

539
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:51,900
You always flirted with girls.

540
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:54,779
My place is nearly turning
into a dating agency.

541
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:56,779
What do you mean?

542
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,660
Look.

543
00:30:00,219 --> 00:30:00,900
What's this?

544
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,100
They are the girls

545
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:06,820
who asked me for your phone number.

546
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,340
I found it troublesome,

547
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,499
(The girls' personal information)
so I let them write down their info.

548
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,779
I told them you will contact them
when you come back.

549
00:30:15,219 --> 00:30:16,699
And measurements?

550
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:17,979
Xu.

551
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,979
Look, it's the evidence.

552
00:30:21,739 --> 00:30:23,940
Am I more popular than Lu Cenyang?

553
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,019
Forget it.

554
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:28,019
I have someone I like,

555
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,979
so I shouldn't hurt other girls.

556
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:34,699
Bu Ran and Lu Cenyang
have been back together.

557
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,820
Their relationship is stable.

558
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:38,699
You should let it go.

559
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:41,979
Who knows what will happen?

560
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:44,539
Xu, I've realized

561
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:46,459
you are partial towards Lu Cenyang.

562
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,140
I have to establish an image

563
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,779
of being passionately devoted,

564
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:52,940
warning Lu Cenyang

565
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,620
not to cheat on Bu Ran.

566
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:56,739
Awesome.

567
00:30:57,739 --> 00:31:00,059
But Lu Cenyang

568
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,459
and Bu Ran are a lovely couple.

569
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,219
I saw the Moments they posted.

570
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,900
And I'm incredibly jealous.

571
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:08,699
Well,

572
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,860
don't be the third wheel.

573
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,140
Moments.

574
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,180
How come I haven't seen it?

575
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,340
They posted it today.

576
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:21,940
Where?

577
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,539
Could it be that you've been blocked?

578
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:41,620
Come on, my boss.

579
00:31:42,219 --> 00:31:43,299
Have some tea.

580
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:53,820

I have a feeling

582
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,820
that you're my toy boy.

583
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,140
If you could marry me,

584
00:31:58,259 --> 00:31:59,340
it would be your luck.

585
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,739
Alright, I accept your proposal.

586
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,940

587
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,299

588
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:06,779
Didn't you ask me to marry you?

589
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,140
Boss, here's your call.

590
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:17,900

599

He's made me gain weight.

600
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,140

634
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,780
Nor would I try

635

636

I remember

640
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:36,139
the first time I saw you

641
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,340
at the Yihua Art Museum.

642
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:39,300
At the time,

643
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,539
I found you were so interesting.

644
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:44,659
Later, you moved into Fortune Pavilion.

645
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,619
I wanted to drive you away.

646
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:49,459
But somehow,

647
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,139
I started trying to keep you.

648
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:54,420
I don't know why.

649
00:35:55,179 --> 00:35:55,940
Perhaps,

650
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,059
I changed

651
00:35:58,059 --> 00:35:59,659
when you tried to help the orphanage;

652
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,539
when I had your porridge;

653
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:07,900
or maybe

654
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:11,019
when I knew how you vented your anger;

655
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:14,979

hadn't been called off,

I was the guy
who promised to protect you,

662
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,019
