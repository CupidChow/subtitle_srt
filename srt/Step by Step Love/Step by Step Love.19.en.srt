20
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:46,387
This time, Carry has really
put her heart into it.

21
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:49,467
I originally thought
she would come by herself.

22
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:52,907
Unexpectedly, she found someone
even more suitable than herself.

23
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:58,627
Wherever Mr. Lu goes,
there's always something to talk about.

24
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:00,786
- Mr. Yi.
- Mr. Yi.

25
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:01,586
Hello, Ms. Meng.

26
00:02:02,226 --> 00:02:04,107
There have always been
many rumors about Mr. Lu.

27
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:05,786
I'm very curious.

28
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:08,827
What kind of girl
could catch Mr. Lu's eye?

29
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:11,547
Mr. Lu, we are all good friends.

30
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:14,227
Just reveal the mystery generously.

31
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:17,547
Satisfy our curiosity, will you?

32
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,347
- Right.
- Yes.

33
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:24,146
Wait a minute.

34
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:27,186
What's going on?

35
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:28,947
Aren't you here to help me clarify?

36
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:33,827
(I'm here to assert my authority.)

37
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:39,026
Look at me, forgetting things.

38
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,347
Of course,
only the talented and beautiful Ms. Yao

39
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:44,787
is the one who can match Mr. Lu.

40
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:45,667
Right?

41
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:47,547
Yes.

42
00:02:54,947 --> 00:02:56,306
Everyone, don't be too hasty.

43
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:59,347
It only counts
if Mr. Lu announces it himself.

44
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:01,987
Mr. Lu, say something, will you?

45
00:03:07,507 --> 00:03:09,227
Are you hiding something from me?

46
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:15,466
I may lack dating experience,
but I'm not naive.

47
00:03:15,746 --> 00:03:16,746
Listen, I...

48
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:23,547
It must be your Mr. Lu.

49
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:24,387
Hurry and take it.

50
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:25,827
Don't miss his apology.

51
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:27,026
Mr. Liu?

52
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:29,347
What good could come
from him calling me?

53
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:32,507
What if it's about Lu Cenyang?

54
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:33,547
Answer the call.

55
00:03:43,227 --> 00:03:43,906
See?

56
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,866
Mr. Lu has us all on tenterhooks.

57
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:47,787
Mr. Lu,

58
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:50,227
if you don't satisfy our curiosity,

59
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:52,866
I'm afraid none of us
will enjoy our drinks.

60
00:03:55,306 --> 00:03:57,466
Is Ms. Yao your girlfriend?

61
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:03,906
(If you refuse to do as I say,)

62
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:04,906
(I will spin the tale)

63
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:08,146
(of Lu Mingyu's past of abandoning
his wife and child all over the news.)

64
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:10,507
(It would be quite a shock
to your sister, Lu Siqi.)

65
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:11,787
(Right?)

66
00:04:19,186 --> 00:04:20,587
I knew it.

67
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:22,266
Earlier,

68
00:04:22,987 --> 00:04:24,186
Lu Cenyang and Yao Lefei

69
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:25,987
were secretly plotting something.

70
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:27,667
He was announcing
his relationship with her.

71
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:31,186
No wonder Mr. Liu said he'd take you
to see a good show.

72
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:41,626
Since you are so eager to know,

73
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:43,347
I'll just tell you directly...

74
00:04:43,547 --> 00:04:44,707
Sorry, everyone.

75
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,826
I'm late.

76
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:51,707
Mr. Lu,

77
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:53,907
shouldn't I
be your female companion today?

78
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:55,467
Why did you bring Ms. Yao?

79
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:00,027
Guys,

80
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:02,227
Mr. Lu is indeed announcing

81
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,506
his relationship with me.

82
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:05,186
It's a pity

83
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:07,667
that I just encountered
a little interlude

84
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:08,587
and got delayed.

85
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:20,787
Why are you all staring at me like that?

86
00:05:22,547 --> 00:05:23,227
You don't think

87
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:24,746
I am Mr. Lu's girlfriend, do you?

88
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:28,707
Well,

89
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:32,426
I have the most tacit understanding
of him as a subordinate.

90
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:33,866
Right, Mr. Lu?

91
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:34,866
Of course.

92
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:37,426
I admire Carry's
magnanimous personality the most.

93
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:39,107
All of you must know

94
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:42,306
that where Carry is,
there is never a dull moment.

95
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,027
Yes,

96
00:05:44,347 --> 00:05:46,347
Mr. Lu, stop beating around the bush.

97
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:49,266
Could it be that both Carry and Ms. Yao

98
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:51,147
have been taken under your wing?

99
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:53,987
Meeting this way on such an occasion,
you wouldn't be

100
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,826
too embarrassed to acknowledge it,
would you?

101
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:00,266
I know

102
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:02,426
what you all say
about me behind my back.

103
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:04,626
Today, taking this opportunity,

104
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:06,547
I'll also clear my own name properly.

105
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:08,467
Well,

106
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:10,826
if I were to really find a boyfriend,

107
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:13,667
I would definitely choose a younger man
who listens to me.

108
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:16,506
I wouldn't go
for a dominant CEO like Mr. Lu.

109
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:19,347
Carry really knows how to joke.

110
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:25,186
What is Carry up to?

111
00:06:25,826 --> 00:06:27,826
Isn't she afraid
of her identity being exposed?

112
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:30,306
You're right.

113
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:32,027
However, my identity

114
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,506
is not something
that needs to be hidden anymore.

115
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:37,506
Carry,

116
00:06:38,426 --> 00:06:40,107
I've known all
about your background for a while.

117
00:06:40,746 --> 00:06:42,066
You're Ms. Hua's person, aren't you?

118
00:06:43,426 --> 00:06:45,787
Logically speaking,
if I'd taken a liking to Bu Ran,

119
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:47,866
she would have more opportunities
to hinder me.

120
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,347
But why do you
follow other people's orders

121
00:06:51,506 --> 00:06:52,826
against Ms. Hua's wishes?

122
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:56,506
Mr. Lu, I'm sorry.

123
00:06:57,426 --> 00:06:58,547
I had no choice.

124
00:06:59,107 --> 00:06:59,746
If you

125
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,626
appear as my girlfriend,

126
00:07:02,027 --> 00:07:03,787
it must be hard for you
to explain it to Ms. Hua.

127
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:07,266
And it means someone
offered a higher price than Ms. Hua.

128
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:08,987
Who is that?

129
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:15,587
Besides Yi Mincai and his wife,

130
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:16,587
I can't think of others

131
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:18,027
who want to embarrass Bu Ran.

132
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:20,746
Do you know that I still have evidence

133
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:21,707
of Yi Mincai

134
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:23,787
and Meng Kexin's smuggling accounts
with a shell company?

135
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:26,347
Do you think you can get your cut?

136
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:29,826
Mr. Lu, I'm sorry.

137
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,266
Please let me off the hook.

138
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:35,066
Do as I say.

139
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:37,227
I can overlook

140
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:38,787
whose side you were on before.

141
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:46,787
So, Mr. Lu,

142
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:50,626
Carry is not who you love.

143
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:53,147
Then it must be Ms. Yao.

144
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:54,667
As all you expect,

145
00:07:54,826 --> 00:07:55,707
- I...
- Mr. Lu.

146
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:57,547
Look. Everyone is so curious.

147
00:07:57,547 --> 00:07:58,787
Stop keeping us in suspense.

148
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:00,426
You might as well tell us.

149
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:02,587
My girlfriend

150
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:04,626
is neither Carry nor Ms. Yao.

151
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:07,866
It's Bu Ran,
the best designer in our company.

152
00:08:17,107 --> 00:08:18,306
- It's her.
- See? I told you.

153
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:19,746
I heard it was Bu Ran all along.

154
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:24,587
You all know Bu Ran, right?

155
00:08:24,826 --> 00:08:27,386
She and Mr. Lu make a perfect match.

156
00:08:27,946 --> 00:08:30,266
Mr. Lu originally planned
to bring Bu Ran here today.

157
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:31,907
But she hasn't fully recovered
from her cold.

158
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:33,786
So I came on her behalf.

159
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,146
No wonder

160
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:37,626
Mr. Lu took so much effort

161
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:39,827
to cultivate Bu Ran,
an under-the-radar talent.

162
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:42,307
It turns out she is your girlfriend.

163
00:08:45,947 --> 00:08:49,266
Ms. Meng, you went to such lengths
for this act.

164
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:50,947
So it was to force Mr. Lu

165
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:52,427
to reveal

166
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:54,707
that his girlfriend is your niece?

167
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:58,187
Alright, now everyone knows.

168
00:08:58,347 --> 00:08:58,906
So, that's it.

169
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,546
I think, in our industry,

170
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,067
there probably won't be anyone competing

171
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:05,386
for Mr. Yi's
future nephew-in-law anymore, right?

172
00:09:06,307 --> 00:09:07,386
What are you blabbering about?

173
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:09,227
My bad for being nosy.

174
00:09:09,786 --> 00:09:11,546
But since it's already been mentioned,

175
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:13,666
let's all have a good time.

176
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:16,427
After all, it's a big piece of good news
for the construction industry.

177
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:19,746
Ladies and gentleme.

178
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:23,987
Bu Ran is the former CEO of Yihua

179
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:26,026
and the biological daughter of Yi Minde,

180
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:29,427
which also makes her
the granddaughter of Ms. Hua Lan.

181
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:34,266
In the future,
Yihua and Pinshang will be family.

182
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:45,427
Mr. Lu, congratulations!

183
00:09:45,906 --> 00:09:47,386
With Yihua and Pinshang joining forces,

184
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:48,587
it's simply the biggest boon

185
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:50,427
for the industry.

186
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,626
Indeed.

187
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:54,746
With such an outstanding nephew-in-law
like Mr. Lu,

188
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:56,506
you must be very pleased, Mr. Yi.

189
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:03,947
Mr. Wang, Mr. Lin, and Mr. Liu,

190
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:05,067
let's go over there to talk

191
00:10:05,227 --> 00:10:07,026
and allow Mr. Yi and Ms. Meng

192
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:08,947
to have a good chat
with their nephew-in-law.

193
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:10,067
Alright.

194
00:10:10,587 --> 00:10:11,666
Take your time.

195
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:13,067
Please.

196
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:14,626
Let's go.

197
00:10:18,987 --> 00:10:19,746
Lu Cenyang,

198
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:21,626
you're really something.

199
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:23,947
You've even turned Carry against us.

200
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,026
You made these two women

201
00:10:28,386 --> 00:10:29,227
cooperate with you.

202
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:31,827
Aren't you afraid

203
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,546
that your father's scandal
will be exposed?

204
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:40,266
I didn't just turn Carry.

205
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:47,707
What is this?

206
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:49,746
When I investigated Taylor,

207
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:51,146
I found out your daughter

208
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:52,987
also nearly fell prey to this scum.

209
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,067
She was afraid you'd worry,

210
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:56,666
so she sought my help
to change her major.

211
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:57,987
Now she's about to graduate.

212
00:10:58,187 --> 00:10:59,467
She sent me some graduation photos.

213
00:10:59,707 --> 00:11:01,546
I had them developed for you.

214
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:03,626
My sweetie.

215
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:06,506
She suffered, and I didn't even know.

216
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:07,906
If I remember correctly,

217
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:09,506
your child's overseas study

218
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:11,307
was facilitated
by the Meng family, right?

219
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:15,467
Xu,

220
00:11:16,026 --> 00:11:17,866
you should tell me
if you are having difficulties.

221
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:19,786
You shouldn't force yourself.

222
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:20,947
Cenyang,

223
00:11:22,546 --> 00:11:24,146
did you already know all along?

224
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:29,067
I can understand if you have troubles.

225
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:31,987
I want to know what she made you do.

226
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:36,026
I did the thing
I feel most guilty about.

227
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:40,786
It was me who betrayed Qin Xun.

228
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:49,947
I thought Mr. Liu

229
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:51,626
had something secretive to tell me.

230
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:53,506
But he threw Lu Cenyang's big face
in my face

231
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:56,666
to watch me be embarrassed
by Lu Cenyang.

232
00:11:58,187 --> 00:12:00,266
I've made a name
for myself in this industry.

233
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,866
In the future, I will refuse his offer

234
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:02,947
to show me the world.

235
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:04,347
Those who are at the scene today

236
00:12:04,546 --> 00:12:05,746
will surely make fun of me.

237
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:09,026
Who knows if Cenyang

238
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:10,587
is deliberately using you
to anger the Yis?

239
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:12,187
Don't get too cocky.

240
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:14,227
You are such a buzzkiller.

241
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:16,266
I am happy
if the Yi Family is irritated.

242
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:18,067
I'm in a good mood today.

243
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:19,707
Let me treat you to a barbecue.

244
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,307
We'll buy lots of delicious food.

245
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:22,827
Can't you see I'm busy?

246
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:24,067
Rain check?

247
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:25,987
Alright, go ahead. I'm leaving now.

248
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:27,026
Let's barbecue later.

249
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:41,408
(Lu Cenyang)

250
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:44,266
What do you want?

251
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:48,506
Okay.

252
00:12:49,107 --> 00:12:50,146
See you at the Old Pal's.

253
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:32,827
The taste seems different.

254
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:34,546
It was me who called Siqi.

255
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:35,626
I know.

256
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:37,626
Xu told me

257
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:39,786
that you were Siqi's brother.

258
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:41,987
Aren't you curious about why I did this?

259
00:13:43,307 --> 00:13:45,347
Apart from testing my true feelings
on behalf of Bu Ran,

260
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:46,746
I can't think of a second reason.

261
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,266
You didn't tell the Yi Family about Siqi

262
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:50,307
being Yao Lefei.

263
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:52,666
That shows
you didn't really plan to harm me.

264
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:57,347
No wonder you said

265
00:13:57,506 --> 00:13:58,626
that the coffee tastes different.

266
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:00,786
The reason is
that you're overthinking it.

267
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:09,866
This is the diary of Dad before he dies.

268
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,827
I think you would want
to take a look at it.

269
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:42,827
Ms. Hua,

270
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:45,026
the investigation into Qin Xun
has been completed.

271
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,026
Good.

272
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:53,746
Notify everyone

273
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:56,626
to suspend the search for Lu Siqi.

274
00:14:57,587 --> 00:14:58,227
Yes.

275
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:02,187
Speak.

276
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:04,107
Ms. Hua, I don't quite understand.

277
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:05,587
We went through so much trouble

278
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:06,906
to search for Lu Siqi.

279
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,786
Why suspend it suddenly now?

280
00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:12,947
Previously,
I didn't take Lu Cenyang seriously.

281
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:16,786
But we have been defeated

282
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,906
after so many confrontations.

283
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:23,666
Lu Cenyang likes
to exploit our weak points.

284
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:27,146
Of course, we also need
to find his vulnerability.

285
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:29,026
Is Lu Siqi his vulnerability?

286
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:35,746
It's Lu Mingyu.

287
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:38,067
Although Lu Mingyu is dead,

288
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:40,026
Lu Cenyang

289
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:43,266
owes a debt of gratitude
for Lu Mingyu's nurturing.

290
00:15:44,227 --> 00:15:47,467
Naturally,
he values his son and daughter.

291
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:49,707
And they are

292
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:52,546
the best weapons to be used

293
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:54,707
against Lu Cenyang.

294
00:15:57,107 --> 00:16:00,546
Now, Qin Xun has surfaced.

295
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:03,026
And the woman he holds dear

296
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:06,146
is also Lu Cenyang's girlfriend.

297
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:09,947
Everything about Qin Xun

298
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:12,227
has been taken by Lu Cenyang.

299
00:16:14,347 --> 00:16:17,947
What kind of feelings
do you think he has?

300
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,987
(Today is the 15th day
of the eighth lunar month.)

301
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:23,987
(It's Lu Xun's birthday.)

302
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:26,866
(The moon is full, but not the family.)

303
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:29,386
(When you were by my side in the past,)

304
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:30,707
(no matter how busy I was,)

305
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:33,146
(I would always buy a cake
and make time to return home,)

306
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:36,827
(and we three would sing birthday songs
and eat cake together.)

307
00:16:38,587 --> 00:16:40,307
(Now it's just me alone.)

308
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,187
(I don't know how tall or how heavy
my son is now.)

309
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:44,746
(I wonder if he misses his dad.)

310
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,427
(Lu Xun,)

311
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:49,786
(your mom insisted on going abroad.)

312
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:53,026
(But I couldn't abandon the company
I had just started.)

313
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:57,227
(In a fit of anger, she took you abroad,
so I couldn't see you.)

314
00:16:58,107 --> 00:16:59,587
(I miss you very much.)

315
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:01,666
(The letters I mailed)

316
00:17:01,827 --> 00:17:02,746
(and the people I sent)

317
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:04,346
(have heard nothing of you.)

318
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:07,667
(I will never give up looking for you.)

319
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:09,907
(My son,)

320
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,227
(I hope you can forgive me)

321
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:14,387
(when we meet again.)

322
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:26,306
You saw the diary?

323
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:30,187
I'm sorry.

324
00:17:31,987 --> 00:17:35,387
I revealed your identity
to the Yi Family.

325
00:17:37,227 --> 00:17:37,907
I know.

326
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,387
It was for the daughter.

327
00:17:42,546 --> 00:17:43,467
If you want to blame me,

328
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:45,707
I have nothing to say.

329
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,427
You want to use yourself as an example,

330
00:17:50,506 --> 00:17:52,867
saying there is no father in the world
who doesn't love his children?

331
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:58,707
Your father must have missed you,

332
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,667
and he hoped even more
that you could live on without hatred.

333
00:18:04,907 --> 00:18:06,026
Forgiveness is hard.

334
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:10,947
But forgiveness allows one
to live with ease.

335
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:18,026
♪What exactly is wrong
and what is right♪

336
00:18:18,026 --> 00:18:18,987
What you say makes sense.

337
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:22,066
So I forgive you.

338
00:18:22,586 --> 00:18:23,306
But

339
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:25,667
you have to give me a raise

340
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:27,227
and grant me days off.

341
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:28,746
Otherwise, I will quit.

342
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:31,907
Cenyang said if you're willing,

343
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:34,427
he would welcome you back to Pinshang.

344
00:18:35,707 --> 00:18:37,187
I don't want to owe him any favors.

345
00:18:37,707 --> 00:18:38,387
It's off-work time.

346
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:57,306
Hello?

347
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,826
You only think of me after it gets dark.

348
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:01,306
I'm home.

349
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:02,266
Where are you?

350
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:05,707
I'm at the Old Pal's.

351
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:08,867
You went there
full of dissatisfaction with me, right?

352
00:19:09,227 --> 00:19:11,187
The two of you must
have had a great time cursing me.

353
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:12,266
Are you hungry?

354
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:13,546
I'll cook noodles for you.

355
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:17,907
You argued with your girlfriend
during the day.

356
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,546
At night, you cook noodles as amends.

357
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,867
Your change of attitude
is even more dramatic than opera.

358
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:24,346
Too bad I don't appreciate
such gestures.

359
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:26,106
I've had my fill at Old Pal's.

360
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:27,346
I'm not hungry.

361
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:29,987
What a pity!

362
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:33,187
The noodles I cooked with the broth
I made are fragrant and delicious.

363
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:35,467
One bite leaves a lingering fragrance
on your lips and teeth.

364
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:36,826
It's so satisfying.

365
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:38,546
If you're not hungry,

366
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:40,147
I'll just have to eat two bowls myself.

367
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:17,227
I'm sorry.

368
00:20:17,586 --> 00:20:18,586
I didn't do well enough.

369
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:21,306
Sorry for what?

370
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:23,227
What did you do wrong?

371
00:20:26,427 --> 00:20:28,026
I've failed your kindness.

372
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:30,187
I didn't explain it well to you.

373
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:31,867
And I lost my temper with you.

374
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:33,346
It was my fault.

375
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:37,907
Your apology is quite proper.

376
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:43,266
As your boyfriend,

377
00:20:43,387 --> 00:20:45,106
I can't be without merit, right?

378
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:47,907
Otherwise, why would
my girlfriend be with me?

379
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:50,867
I am with you for your good looks,
money, discernment, and ability

380
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:52,026
to cook noodles.

381
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:07,746
I'm honored.

382
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:12,306
Are you hungry?

383
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,746
Then let's have noodles.

384
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:32,947
About Yao Lefei...

385
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:33,667
Lu Cenyang,

386
00:21:36,427 --> 00:21:37,266
I've figured it out.

387
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:40,867
I was wrong to lose my temper
at you that day.

388
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:42,907
Although you are my boyfriend,

389
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:44,387
you don't have to tell me

390
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,346
everything.

391
00:21:45,546 --> 00:21:47,227
You also need
to have your own personal space.

392
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:50,106
In the future,
if you think certain things

393
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:51,707
are better known by fewer people,

394
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:53,306
you don't have to tell me,

395
00:21:53,506 --> 00:21:54,586
even if I'm your girlfriend.

396
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,826
I trust you completely.

397
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:18,387
Let's eat.

398
00:22:35,346 --> 00:22:36,586
Are they that delicious?

399
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:39,106
I respect your labor's fruits.

400
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:42,106
Slow down.

401
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:45,786
When you're done,
I'll cook more for you.

402
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:46,586
That's enough.

403
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,227
After this bowl,
I'm going to start losing weight.

404
00:22:49,746 --> 00:22:51,786
I've been angry and eating a lot
these past few days.

405
00:22:51,947 --> 00:22:52,867
I've gained weight.

406
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:55,786
Others can't eat when they're angry.

407
00:22:56,467 --> 00:22:58,627
You're quite unique.

408
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:00,987
Can't I make an excuse for my gluttony?

409
00:23:01,586 --> 00:23:02,746
Why expose me?

410
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:04,306
The noodles aren't tempting anymore.

411
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:09,746
Then this weekend,
I'll take you out for some fresh air.

412
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,306
I'd like to, but I don't have time.

413
00:23:15,907 --> 00:23:17,066
The redesign of the ancient alley

414
00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:18,707
is still being revised continually.

415
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:21,786
I have an idea
that kills two birds with one stone.

416
00:23:31,707 --> 00:23:32,586
Bu Ran! Bu Ran!

417
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:37,707
Don't hit me.

418
00:23:38,947 --> 00:23:40,227
My shoelace is untied.

419
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:42,907
Don't chase. Watch out, or you'll fall.

420
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,387
That's for scaring me.

421
00:23:46,746 --> 00:23:47,826
I won't do that again.

433
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:27,746
I wasn't surprised

434
00:24:27,907 --> 00:24:29,667
that my uncle and his wife
used such a foolish trick.

435
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:31,586
But I didn't expect Carry

436
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:32,826
to actually help in the end.

437
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:35,667
Even the sliest person
has moments of helplessness.

438
00:24:35,826 --> 00:24:37,106
As long as you understand her,

439
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:38,627
she will naturally stand by your side.

440
00:24:39,707 --> 00:24:42,266
I will also try to learn to understand
your helplessness in the future.

441
00:24:42,786 --> 00:24:43,627
My helplessness is

442
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:45,227
that you turn around
at the drop of a hat,

443
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:47,387
either wanting to move out
or ignoring me.

444
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:49,306
You're the only one I can't deal with.

445
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:54,667
I've reflected. I will correct myself.

446
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:56,467
I have always felt

447
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:57,947
that meeting you was the luckiest thing

448
00:24:58,106 --> 00:24:59,106
in my life.

449
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,467
I hope we can be together

450
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:02,826
forever.

451
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:04,467
How can you guarantee that?

452
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:07,746
I'll use the luck I've accumulated
over 30 years of my life

453
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:08,947
and bet it all on you.

454
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:09,987
This should be enough.

455
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:14,147
Let's go.

456
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:16,147
Go where?

457
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,627
If you are looking for inspiration,

458
00:25:18,786 --> 00:25:20,266
you'll need to walk around and see more.

459
00:25:20,427 --> 00:25:21,907
Can't we take a longer break?

460
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:24,066
After all, it's a date for us.

461
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:27,066
You're tired after just a little walk?

462
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:29,627
Didn't you promise
to walk with me forever?

463
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:30,867
Then I still have to ask my dad

464
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:32,147
why he chose you.

465
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:33,786
You don't even care about my knees.

466
00:25:40,187 --> 00:25:40,627
Can you speak

467
00:25:40,786 --> 00:25:42,306
for me in front of your dad now?

468
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,066
Put me down.

469
00:25:44,227 --> 00:25:45,826
Your knees won't be able
to take it like this.

470
00:25:46,026 --> 00:25:48,106
You're so light. It's no problem.

471
00:25:49,907 --> 00:25:50,427
Alright then.

472
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:53,867
I'll just enjoy the benefits

(Lu Cenyang's Moments)

481
00:27:20,946 --> 00:27:22,603
(Yi Mincai)

482
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:24,746
Hello?

483
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:25,987
Qin Xun,

484
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,026
now it's your turn to stand out.

485
00:27:28,746 --> 00:27:29,586
United,

486
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,026
we'll surely teach Lu Cenyang a lesson.

487
00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:33,826
Not just Bu Ran.

488
00:27:34,427 --> 00:27:35,266
I'll help you

489
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:36,867
retrieve whatever is yours.

490
00:27:37,506 --> 00:27:39,266
Even if I want
to teach Lu Cenyang a lesson,

491
00:27:39,427 --> 00:27:40,506
I have my own plan.

492
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:41,746
Do you think I don't know

493
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:43,427
that the share transfer agreement
you gave me

494
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:45,026
was an empty promise?

495
00:27:45,546 --> 00:27:46,306
I pretended to agree

496
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:48,227
only to scout your situation for Bu Ran.

497
00:27:48,746 --> 00:27:50,266
We don't have to
contact each other anymore.

498
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,387
You played me?

499
00:27:52,106 --> 00:27:53,227
You will pay for this.

500
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:55,306
I...

501
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:03,066
Mom,

502
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:04,786
Zihe recently enrolled
in a management class

503
00:28:05,387 --> 00:28:08,187
to broaden his business insights
with the tycoons.

504
00:28:09,586 --> 00:28:11,306
I think he's realized
his own shortcomings

505
00:28:11,467 --> 00:28:12,586
and has refocused his efforts.

506
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:14,106
Refocusing is the right thing to do.

507
00:28:14,947 --> 00:28:17,227
The two of you
should make more time for me

508
00:28:17,907 --> 00:28:19,467
and care about him more.

509
00:28:20,947 --> 00:28:23,427
I don't think you should
go to the company for the time being.

510
00:28:24,346 --> 00:28:27,187
Arrange the marital alliance
as soon as possible

511
00:28:28,187 --> 00:28:30,546
and get him a virtuous wife
from a family of equal social status.

512
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:31,867
Perhaps

513
00:28:33,266 --> 00:28:34,826
I can still have expectations of him.

514
00:28:34,987 --> 00:28:36,867
Mom, Zihe is still young.

515
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:38,546
His marriage shouldn't be hurried.

516
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:39,947
I don't want

517
00:28:40,227 --> 00:28:41,627
to repeat my words.

518
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:57,696
(Yao Lefei)

519
00:28:58,546 --> 00:28:59,627
Ms. Yao called you.

520
00:28:59,786 --> 00:29:00,506
Will you call back?

521
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:02,867
Her calls to me are all work-related.

522
00:29:03,346 --> 00:29:05,026
I just want to be with you today.

523
00:29:09,867 --> 00:29:10,786
It's been a long day.

524
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:11,786
How about a massage?

525
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:18,947
The left side.

526
00:29:19,306 --> 00:29:20,187
Okay.

527
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:23,746
Is it comfortable?

528
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:31,026
Today, we went for an outing,
shopped at the supermarket,

529
00:29:31,546 --> 00:29:32,667
bought groceries, and cooked.

530
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:35,387
How can we're heading straight

531
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:37,227
into an elderly lifestyle?

532
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:39,826
We haven't done
a single romantic thing as a couple.

533
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:42,306
What 'elderly lifestyle'?

534
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:43,707
Then what do you want to do?

535
00:29:46,346 --> 00:29:49,707
I want to stroll the streets,

536
00:29:51,147 --> 00:29:52,346
wear matching couple outfits,

537
00:29:53,387 --> 00:29:56,506
watch the stars and sunrise,

538
00:29:56,826 --> 00:29:57,627
and kiss with you.

539
00:30:14,176 --> 00:30:15,500
(Yao Lefei)

540
00:30:19,346 --> 00:30:20,826
He is back.
Why didn't he answer the phone?

541
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:33,227
Who is it?

542
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:35,306
It should be Ms. Yao.

543
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:36,346
Yao...

544
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:38,907
Help me out.

545
00:30:45,306 --> 00:30:46,746
Why didn't you answer your phone?

546
00:30:48,026 --> 00:30:48,947
You went to the supermarket?

547
00:30:49,907 --> 00:30:50,947
I'll put these in the fridge.

548
00:30:51,106 --> 00:30:52,187
Just leave them there.

549
00:30:52,346 --> 00:30:53,467
I can tidy up myself.

550
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:57,147
Are you sure?

551
00:30:57,947 --> 00:30:59,907
What made you suddenly decide
to go to the supermarket?

552
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:02,187
You didn't answer my calls
or reply to my texts.

553
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:04,867
You don't need to shop for me anymore.

554
00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:05,786
I can do it myself.

555
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:08,627
Don't you think
the chores are a waste of time?

556
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,746
Grocery shopping by myself isn't fun.

557
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,867
It's too late.
You should head back and rest early.

558
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:19,826
I'm hungry. I'll cook some noodles.

559
00:31:19,987 --> 00:31:21,306
I've been busy all day.

560
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:22,627
Go and order some takeout.

561
00:31:23,586 --> 00:31:24,707
Let's have some tea before I go.

562
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:26,826
Tea makes me too alert.
I want to go to sleep early.

563
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:32,987
You and Bu Ran...

564
00:31:34,346 --> 00:31:35,227
We've made up.

565
00:31:37,266 --> 00:31:40,266
It seems my unsolicited initiative
at the party

566
00:31:40,786 --> 00:31:41,907
wasn't a disservice after all.

567
00:31:42,746 --> 00:31:44,707
You should be thanking me, really.

568
00:31:45,026 --> 00:31:46,106
Thank you.

569
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,066
But don't ever do that again.

570
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:52,746
It's late. I'm going to take a hot bath.

571
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:54,026
You should go get some rest.

572
00:32:11,707 --> 00:32:12,586
Has she left?

573
00:32:12,786 --> 00:32:14,746
I told her that I was taking a hot bath.

574
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:27,266
Smart move.

575
00:32:29,627 --> 00:32:31,746
But how does Ms. Yao
know your home's code?

576
00:32:32,627 --> 00:32:34,387
My mistake. I'll change it right away.

577
00:32:41,147 --> 00:32:41,826
Hey!

578
00:32:42,387 --> 00:32:43,586
Ms. Yao is still outside, you know.
