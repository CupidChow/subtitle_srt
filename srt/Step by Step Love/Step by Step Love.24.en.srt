20
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:44,356
So, are you happy now?

21
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:45,395
Feels good?

22
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:48,276
Come on.

23
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:09,596
Dark clouds have silver linings.

24
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:11,596
The Yi Family has been trying
to stir up trouble.

25
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:13,835
They deserve it this time.

26
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:15,876
Our efforts have paid off.

27
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:19,675
No wonder you didn't expose Yi Zihe.

28
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:21,156
You did it all for me.

29
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:22,476
Thanks.

30
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:25,395
That's it?

31
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:27,356
You rushed here
without even having breakfast.

32
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:28,235
Hungry?

33
00:02:28,596 --> 00:02:30,196
What do you want for lunch? My treat.

34
00:02:30,596 --> 00:02:32,156
Well,

35
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:35,476
The food made by your mother.

36
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:37,156
If I go to your home with you,

37
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:38,756
it won't seem too abrupt.

38
00:02:39,636 --> 00:02:41,235
Didn't you often visit my mom alone?

39
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:43,876
I did it all for the both of us.

40
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:46,395
Are you trying to gain favor
with my parents

41
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:48,275
and make them speak for you?

42
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:49,636
Very clever.

43
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:51,916
Now, you can read my mind.

44
00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:53,515
You're getting to know me better.

45
00:02:58,036 --> 00:02:58,555
Let's go.

46
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:00,515
I'm going to have the food
your mom makes.

47
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:20,876
It's already late.

48
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:22,795
What took Minde so long?

49
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:31,395
Who is this?

50
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:33,675
It's me, Yi Zihe.

51
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,675
You've blocked me.

52
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:37,356
I have to contact you with new numbers.

53
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:39,115
Don't hang up.

54
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:43,756
You must be unable
to reach Lu Cenyang right now.

55
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:45,196
I wanna tell you

56
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:46,756
that Lu Cenyang and Bu Ran

57
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,876
just saw my parents together.

58
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,795
Now, the Yi Family
can't break them apart anymore.

59
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:53,795
You might as well give up.

60
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:58,156
Nice try, but I don't buy it.

61
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:00,995
Last night, Lu Cenyang and Bu Ran

62
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:04,076
spent the night together in a tent
at the construction site.

63
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:06,156
Now, they're closer than ever.

64
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,795
If you don't believe it,

65
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:09,356
you check it out yourself.

66
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:19,155
Early this morning,

67
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:21,076
I saw Mr. Lu coming out
of Ms. Bu's tent.

68
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:22,275
Very surprising.

69
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:24,436
They are adults.

70
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:25,595
Just camping here,

71
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:27,035
doing something different.

72
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:28,355
No big deal.

73
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:31,595
So, you mean last night...

74
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:32,676
What do you think?

75
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:34,155
Guess what happened?

76
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:45,316
You came back without telling me.

77
00:04:45,436 --> 00:04:46,876
I had no time to prepare well.

78
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:48,475
Come on. Help yourself.

79
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:49,595
Thank you.

80
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:51,475
I've been craving the food you make.

81
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:52,636
Cenyang.

82
00:04:53,035 --> 00:04:54,955
Help yourself.

83
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:57,676
If you love the food,
you're welcome here anytime.

84
00:04:58,515 --> 00:04:59,076
Okay.

85
00:04:59,196 --> 00:05:00,275
I will often come.

86
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:02,275
You're here today.

87
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:04,996
Looks like
my parents like you better than me.

88
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:09,756
They have great hopes for me.

89
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:10,835
I must learn quickly

90
00:05:10,996 --> 00:05:12,076
how to treat you right.

91
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:13,676
That's easier said than done.

92
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,955
We're not your clients.

93
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:17,915
Don't try to be glib-tongued.

94
00:05:18,116 --> 00:05:19,556
I was serious.

95
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:20,475
You trust me, right?

96
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:22,236
Yes.

97
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:24,035
Cenyang.

98
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:27,196
Ran has been spoiled by us.

99
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:29,556
She has a sharp tongue.

100
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:32,116
Don't be mad at her.

101
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,355
How could I?

102
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:35,076
I like what she is.

103
00:05:38,636 --> 00:05:40,395
He means he loves the food.

104
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:41,996
Eat more.

105
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:43,436
Don't waste food.

106
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:45,035
Okay.

107
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:52,595
Cenyang, more rice?

108
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:54,316
Let me get you more.

109
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:55,395
Yes, please.

110
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:57,196
How much do you need?

111
00:05:58,035 --> 00:05:58,835
I have a good appetite today.

112
00:05:58,996 --> 00:05:59,676
I'd like to eat more.

113
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:00,556
Okay.

114
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:02,915
Don't eat too much.

115
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:05,556
The dishes taste more appetizing
with rice.

116
00:06:06,395 --> 00:06:07,915
He won't be stuffed.

117
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:09,556
After you've done,

118
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:11,715
take a walk in the tea garden.

119
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:13,595
I'll go help her mom.

120
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:14,756
Alright, Minde.

121
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:17,155
I have no time for that.

122
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:18,955
I need to rush to the construction site.

123
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:22,915
They finally

124
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:25,076
have a chance to gossip about us.

125
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:27,116
We shouldn't be there.

126
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,436
I knew you did it on purpose.

127
00:06:30,636 --> 00:06:32,475
I've never been
against public displays of affection.

128
00:06:33,116 --> 00:06:33,556
Besides,

129
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:35,796
we have proved
that place is not dispelled.

130
00:06:36,275 --> 00:06:37,996
I'm giving you a reward of a day off.

131
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:44,796
Eat your food.

132
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:45,876
Alright.

133
00:06:46,715 --> 00:06:47,236
Come on.

134
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:49,636
Try my favorite sweet and sour pork.

135
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:50,556
That's enough.

136
00:06:50,636 --> 00:06:52,796
You're too thin. Eat more.

137
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,236
Boss, the documents

138
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:07,715
are already put on your desk.

139
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:09,475
Are you coming back to the office today?

140
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:14,676
Siqi asked me
if I was coming back to the office.

141
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:18,236
You're our boss,

142
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:19,116
but don't dump work

143
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:20,515
on us, alright?

144
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:21,756
Got it.

145
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:24,876
I'm not returning to the office.

146
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:33,876
I'm not returning to the office.

147
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:14,996
It seems

148
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:16,116
you're in a bad mood.

149
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:18,796
If I say someone has displeased me,

150
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:20,556
you definitely know who it is.

151
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:22,395
To avoid you,

152
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:24,715
Bu Ran has worked
at the construction site.

153
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:26,556
What else do you want?

154
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:30,715
I find you quite strange.

155
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:33,556
You like Bu Ran but aren't pursuing her,

156
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:36,036
handing her over to someone else.

157
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:39,516
Yet, you care about her so much.

158
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:41,156
You confused me.

159
00:08:42,475 --> 00:08:45,475
I would never hide who I like.

160
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,036
Nor would I back down.

161
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:50,036
If I were your brother,

162
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:52,755
between Yao Lefei and Lu Siqi,

163
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:54,276
I'd choose Yao Lefei.

164
00:08:56,676 --> 00:08:57,676
You know who I am?

165
00:08:58,076 --> 00:08:59,396
Who else but Lu Siqi dares

166
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:00,635
to rely on his favoritism

167
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:02,796
and maliciously stir up trouble
without any scruples

168
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:04,635
in front of Lu Cenyang?

169
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:09,995
At least, whatever I want to do,

170
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:12,196
I will do it,

171
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:13,835
not like you,

172
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:15,396
being a coward.

173
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:18,036
I thought Lu Mingyu

174
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:19,755
gave me the only kin in this world,

175
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,475
a girl who had been hurt.

176
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,835
I didn't expect her
to be so selfish and willful.

177
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:27,595
What do you mean?

178
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:30,916
You are...

179
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:31,556
Yes.

180
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:34,595
I am

181
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:37,076
your half-brother
who wanted to meet you.

182
00:09:41,635 --> 00:09:42,516
My brother?

183
00:09:47,316 --> 00:09:49,235
In this case,

184
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:50,835
why do you also like Bu Ran

185
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,276
a girl from the Yi Family?

186
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:56,316
Lu Mingyu didn't raise me.

187
00:09:57,755 --> 00:09:59,156
So, I have nothing to do

188
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:00,875
with his past.

189
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,676
So, whether you're my brother or not

190
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:11,715
makes no difference.

191
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:14,036
You shouldn't have appeared.

192
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:16,635
You lost your memories,

193
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:17,995
but you're kind to others.

194
00:10:19,196 --> 00:10:21,355
So, I chose not to disturb you.

195
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:22,316
However,

196
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:25,396
relying on your identity,

197
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:27,355
you never care about others' feelings

198
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,115
and even try to gang up with me.

199
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:31,755
You can leave now.

200
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:34,475
You have no right to judge me.

201
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:37,276
What's the point
of you speaking for Bu Ran?

202
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:40,676
Lu Cenyang and she spent the night

203
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:41,715
at the construction site.

204
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,396
You're fooling yourself now.

205
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:46,516
It's okay if you refuse to help me.

206
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:48,835
I have ways to break them up.

207
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:06,635
The weather is so nice today.

208
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:09,316
I am so satisfied with today's meal.

209
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,516
Can I often come over for a meal?

210
00:11:12,235 --> 00:11:13,316
You wish.

211
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:15,196
If you come often,

212
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:17,196
there would be no place for me.

213
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:20,516
You can live at my place.

214
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:37,036
If I were you this morning,

215
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:37,556
I would use

216
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:39,595
the evidence of Yi Zihe bribing workers
to fake a haunting

217
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:40,755
and warn Uncle and Aunt Xin

218
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:41,916
to stop Yi Zihe

219
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:44,396
from bothering Ms. Yao anymore.

220
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:49,635
You always think of others.

221
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:50,955
Don't forget

222
00:11:51,196 --> 00:11:52,635
that Yi Zihe has been targeting you.

223
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:54,755
You're the one he wants to scare.

224
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:57,595
I displeased Grandma at the bid meeting.

225
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,316
I'm not surprised

226
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:01,475
that they will play some tricks on me.

227
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:02,995
I'm already used to it.

228
00:12:06,036 --> 00:12:07,036
Don't worry.

229
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,556
Siqi hates the Yi Family.

230
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:10,715
Yi Zihe can't make a scene.

231
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:12,475
And he's not a patient guy.

232
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:13,755
As long as we're careful,

233
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:15,436
he will give up soon.

234
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:17,635
But,

235
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:20,556
you will have to

236
00:12:21,196 --> 00:12:22,076
face more direct threats.

237
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:24,235
I have promised your dad

238
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,396
that I would protect you.

239
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:30,396
I can't break my promise.

240
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:37,352
(Yao Lefei)

241
00:12:39,755 --> 00:12:40,316
Answer it.

242
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,955
I think she contacts you for a reason.

243
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:45,516
Hello?

244
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,115
Cenyang.

245
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:49,276
I had a headache again.

246
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:51,516
I thought when I restored my memory,

247
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:52,916
it wouldn't happen again.

248
00:12:53,676 --> 00:12:56,355
Do you think
I could lose my memory again?

249
00:12:56,715 --> 00:12:57,595
Don't panic.

250
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:00,276
Dr. Ma has said

251
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:02,635
that regained memories
would not be gone.

252
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,156
Are you at the office?

253
00:13:04,556 --> 00:13:05,715
I'm at Fortune Pavilion.

254
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:07,436
I'm hungry.

255
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,276
I want to eat the noodles you make.

256
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:11,436
Don't be nervous or anxious.

257
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:12,755
I'll come back right now.

258
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:13,796
Okay.

259
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:32,276
Dad.

260
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:36,156
You know I'm not a willful person.

261
00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:39,316
But for Pinshang

262
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:41,556
and my brother,

263
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:43,916
even if I become

264
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,076
someone I despise,

265
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:49,796
I will absolutely not

266
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,835
let Bu Ran get her way.

267
00:13:56,676 --> 00:13:58,115
Siqi had a headache again.

268
00:13:58,316 --> 00:13:58,916
I...

269
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:00,556
I'll go with you to take care of her.

270
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,635
After all, it's more convenient
for a girl to do so.

271
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,556
I happen to have work
to do at Fortune Pavilion.

272
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:06,036
Let's go.

273
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:23,875
Siqi.

274
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:24,635
Cenyang.

275
00:14:25,755 --> 00:14:27,156
Are you okay? Does your head still ache?

276
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:30,475
Bu Ran has gone to buy groceries.

277
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:31,355
I'll cook.

278
00:14:31,475 --> 00:14:33,076
Let's go to see Dr. Ma after dinner.

279
00:14:33,276 --> 00:14:34,635
You two were together?

280
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:36,516
Yeah.

281
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:38,475
She is also concerned about you.

282
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:39,635
You're not feeling well,

283
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:40,995
so, she came to take care of you.

284
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:42,875
I don't need her concern.

285
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:45,436
Cenyang.

286
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:48,556
Have you forgotten how our dad died?

287
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:50,755
Why do I suffer from headaches?

288
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,635
The Yi Family is to blame.

289
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:56,635
I have never forgotten

290
00:14:56,995 --> 00:14:58,396
about our dad's death.

291
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:00,156
But he hoped

292
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:02,115
that we could
complete his unfinished aspirations

293
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,916
rather than live a life consumed
by hatred.

294
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:13,316
When I close my eyes,

295
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:16,916
all I can think of is Dad lying
in his own blood

296
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:20,755
and the moment
you were nearly hit by a car.

297
00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:25,235
Cenyang.

298
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:28,396
Fortunately, I took the impact
for you in that accident.

299
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,156
I lost some of my memory,

300
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:32,196
but luckily,

301
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:33,875
I didn't lose you.

302
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:35,835
How can I let go

303
00:15:35,995 --> 00:15:37,156
of the hatred towards the Yi Family?

304
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:40,835
You know that Bu Ran

305
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:43,396
and her parents have broken away
from the Yi Family.

306
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:45,115
But she is still one of them.

307
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:47,595
Dad's death

308
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:49,955
has nothing to do with Bu Ran or Minde.

309
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,875
Though you hate Bu Ran,

310
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:53,875
it won't change the fact
that I like her.

311
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:07,916
Cenyang.

312
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:10,755
If I didn't lose my memory,

313
00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:13,595
would you have not used Bu Ran

314
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:15,196
as an emotional substitute?

315
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:17,715
I know

316
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:20,796
that my memory loss
became your weakness.

317
00:16:21,796 --> 00:16:24,235
So, I desperately, as Yao Lefei,

318
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:25,715
made myself strong

319
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,516
and capable enough

320
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:29,276
to share your burdens.

321
00:16:29,715 --> 00:16:31,396
I expect to know better

322
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:33,676
how to love you.

323
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:47,156
Hello?

324
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:48,115
Where are you?

325
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:49,595
I just went shopping.

326
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:50,556
What's up?

327
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:51,595
Nothing.

328
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:52,396
I just wanted

329
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:53,676
to ask why you came home.

330
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:54,955
Ms. Yao has a headache.

331
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:56,595
I came back with Lu Cenyang.

332
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:58,156
Has she picked a fight?

333
00:16:58,355 --> 00:16:59,115
No.

334
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:00,436
I haven't even seen her yet.

335
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:02,796
I sincerely want to help.

336
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,155
I don't buy it.

337
00:17:04,435 --> 00:17:05,155
She even came to me

338
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,835
because you
and Lu Cenyang spent the night

339
00:17:06,996 --> 00:17:07,595
at the building site.

340
00:17:07,716 --> 00:17:08,875
She looked very angry.

341
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:10,236
Spending the night?

342
00:17:11,675 --> 00:17:13,915
Lu Cenyang just took a rest in the tent.

343
00:17:14,556 --> 00:17:15,675
Is she angry about that?

344
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:21,115
It's obvious that she likes Lu Cenyang.

345
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,716
As long as she doesn't give up,

346
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:25,756
anything you do will make things worse.

347
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:28,915
And Lu Cenyang is indulgent of her.

348
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:30,635
He sees her as his family, a friend,

349
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:31,835
but not the one he likes.

350
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:34,355
This feeling is fatal for Lu Siqi.

351
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:35,796
Who knows

352
00:17:35,915 --> 00:17:37,236
if she will do something extreme?

353
00:17:37,716 --> 00:17:38,355
Bu Ran.

354
00:17:39,076 --> 00:17:40,395
You can't see her

355
00:17:40,556 --> 00:17:42,115
as a mature woman anymore.

356
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:43,996
She is immature

357
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,556
and feels insecure.

358
00:17:57,635 --> 00:17:59,115
Bu Ran is not a substitute.

359
00:18:00,675 --> 00:18:02,276
She is the one I truly like.

360
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:05,476
I am your brother.

361
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:07,316
I will revitalize Lu Group

362
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:09,236
and assist you
in becoming a good entrepreneur

363
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,556
like our dad.

364
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:12,195
Siqi.

365
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:14,036
You are my sister,

366
00:18:14,516 --> 00:18:15,476
and you always will be.

367
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,915
Even if our dad didn't die,

368
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:19,956
our relations would not change.

369
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:21,635
Why?

370
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:24,996
Why can't you love me?

371
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:26,756
Before Bu Ran appeared,

372
00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:28,796
you only had eyes for me.

373
00:18:29,115 --> 00:18:29,956
Why has it all changed

374
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:31,675
as soon as she showed up?

375
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:37,953
♪Time teaches us a lesson♪

376
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:39,796
Listen to me.

377
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:42,195
This has nothing to do with anyone else.

378
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,835
I've only ever seen you as my sister.

379
00:18:46,915 --> 00:18:48,155
When you were young,

380
00:18:48,915 --> 00:18:50,476
you developed some errant feelings
towards me

381
00:18:50,635 --> 00:18:52,115
and did some extreme things.

382
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:54,236
I thought

383
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,236
you would understand once you grew up.

384
00:18:56,395 --> 00:18:58,355
We only have family affection
between us.

385
00:18:58,716 --> 00:18:59,675
Nothing about romantic love.

386
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:05,355
Now, it seems

387
00:19:06,316 --> 00:19:07,395
I made a mistake.

388
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:10,516
I should have stopped you in time

389
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:12,476
from going deeper into wrong feelings.

390
00:19:14,476 --> 00:19:15,236
Siqi.

391
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:17,476
You will always be my sister.

392
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:18,996
Do you understand?

393
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:20,355
No, it's not true.

394
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:23,996
No, it's not.

395
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:26,316
Don't say things like that.

396
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:29,076
Don't.

397
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:37,408
♪It's pitiful for it to become♪

398
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:40,180
♪A trace of love♪

399
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:52,236
It's okay.

400
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,476
You even know the password
to my brother's house.

401
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,036
It seems

402
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,076
my brother really likes you.

403
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:04,835
Ms. Yao.

404
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,076
I'm Yao Lefei,

405
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,276
and Lu Siqi.

406
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:11,195
If you want to be
with my brother, that's fine.

407
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,276
But if so,

408
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:14,796
you have to pass my test.

409
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:16,155
Do you dare to?

410
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:18,195
What test?

411
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:20,155
If you can transform Fortune Pavilion

412
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:23,195
into the house I lived in
when I was a child,

413
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:24,516
I will accept you.

414
00:20:24,796 --> 00:20:25,956
So many years have passed.

415
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:27,635
I've even forgotten what the house

416
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:28,395
looked like.

417
00:20:28,516 --> 00:20:29,875
Moreover, the structure has changed now.

418
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:31,276
How do you expect her to do it?

419
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:34,516
You can design the best home
for the children

420
00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:36,476
in the Welfare Center.

421
00:20:37,355 --> 00:20:38,835
You can create the most ideal dwelling

422
00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:40,595
for the residents
in our dad's birthplace.

423
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:43,236
But why can't you do the same for me?

424
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:48,076
If she can do it,

425
00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:50,756
I'll agree with what you just said.

426
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:54,635
I thought it was something bigger.

427
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:56,395
Isn't this my specialty?

428
00:20:57,195 --> 00:20:59,355
I will do my best to restore it

429
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,236
and make you accept me
as your sister-in-law.

430
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:06,316
Show me the pictures

431
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:07,316
of the old house.

432
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:08,316
Okay.

433
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,316
Let's wait and see.

434
00:21:13,595 --> 00:21:14,276
Cenyang.

435
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:17,395
I don't like the food she bought.

436
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:18,996
You buy me

437
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,675
some seafood I love.

438
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:27,036
No matter what Siqi says later,

439
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:28,675
don't take it to heart.

440
00:21:29,395 --> 00:21:30,355
I will handle it.

441
00:21:40,996 --> 00:21:41,996
Do you have a headache again?

442
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:43,595
When my mom was ill,

443
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:44,915
I learned massage techniques for her.

444
00:21:45,076 --> 00:21:45,956
Let me give you a massage.

445
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:47,395
No need.

446
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:49,236
Siqi.

447
00:21:50,195 --> 00:21:52,435
I don't expect you
to accept me right away.

448
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:54,476
Though I wanna get rid of the label

449
00:21:54,635 --> 00:21:56,316
of the Yi Family marked on me,

450
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:57,316
I can't change the fact

451
00:21:57,476 --> 00:21:59,316
that the Yi Family's blood flows
in my veins.

452
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:01,796
But you think about it.

453
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,915
When you were Yao Lefei,

454
00:22:04,076 --> 00:22:05,316
why could you accept me

455
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:07,395
as your good friend?

456
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:09,875
My good friend?

457
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,155
That's just what you think.

458
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,556
I got close to you

459
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:15,996
because I could find out

460
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:18,476
what you were up to.

461
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:37,756
Bu Ran.

462
00:22:38,076 --> 00:22:38,915
Do you think

463
00:22:38,915 --> 00:22:40,716
that you're the lady of this house?

464
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:50,076
Don't think

465
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:51,996
you spent the night with my brother,

466
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:53,195
so you can be his girlfriend.

467
00:22:53,516 --> 00:22:54,996
I've seen plenty of women like you.

468
00:22:55,155 --> 00:22:56,036
Lu Siqi.

469
00:22:57,756 --> 00:22:58,556
You're so mercurial.

470
00:22:58,915 --> 00:22:59,635
You accepted me

471
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:00,556
in front of Cenyang.

472
00:23:00,716 --> 00:23:02,115
But when he left, you acted like that.

473
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:03,115
Yes, it's quite tiring.

474
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,355
So, I'm going to tell you right now

475
00:23:05,595 --> 00:23:07,476
that you will never pass my test.

476
00:23:07,835 --> 00:23:08,635
If you're smart,

477
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:09,915
leave my brother right now.

478
00:23:10,316 --> 00:23:11,195
It's good for everyone.

479
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:12,675
I'm in a relationship with Lu Cenyang,

480
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:13,635
not with you.

481
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,635
What right do you have to say that?

482
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:17,155
When I got amnesia,

483
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:17,875
you swooped in

484
00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:19,556
and stole him away from me.

485
00:23:19,716 --> 00:23:21,556
I don't want or need to steal him.

486
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:22,595
If you like Lu Cenyang,

487
00:23:22,756 --> 00:23:23,915
just tell him directly

488
00:23:24,076 --> 00:23:25,476
instead of starting a fight with me.

489
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:26,875
Are you showing off?

490
00:23:27,036 --> 00:23:28,195
I'm not.

491
00:23:37,595 --> 00:23:38,716
Don't think you've won.

492
00:23:39,675 --> 00:23:40,875
I'll let you know

493
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:41,956
who is more important

494
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:42,796
to my brother

495
00:23:42,956 --> 00:23:44,756
between a girlfriend he's dated
for a few months

496
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:45,435
and a sister

497
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:47,716
he's lived with for over two decades.

498
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:49,556
How can you still not understand?

499
00:23:49,956 --> 00:23:50,996
Even if you drive me away,

500
00:23:51,155 --> 00:23:52,635
he'll just have another girlfriend.

501
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:54,915
And you'll always just be his sister.

502
00:24:03,076 --> 00:24:03,796
Siqi.

503
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:06,756
You've been brainwashed by this woman.

504
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,556
I don't want to listen to you anymore.

505
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:10,316
Dad has passed away.

506
00:24:10,675 --> 00:24:12,155
And now I have no home.

507
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:15,835
You have a headache again.

508
00:24:16,036 --> 00:24:16,956
It's none of your business.

509
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:19,635
Since you're marrying this woman,

510
00:24:19,996 --> 00:24:21,956
I will accept Yi Zihe as my boyfriend.

511
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:23,395
What did you say?

512
00:24:31,276 --> 00:24:32,716
What happened?

513
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:34,276
Don't worry.

514
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,996
Your sister won't be with Yi Zihe.

515
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:36,996
How can I not worry

516
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:38,195
about her?

517
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:41,036
Your sister seems sensible
in front of you,

518
00:24:41,195 --> 00:24:42,276
but she is arrogant

519
00:24:42,476 --> 00:24:43,316
and mean to me.

520
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:44,875
She started a fight.

521
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:45,996
I had to take this chance

522
00:24:46,155 --> 00:24:47,076
to make it clear to her.

523
00:24:47,675 --> 00:24:48,556
She's a patient now.

524
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:50,115
She cannot be aggravated.

525
00:24:50,316 --> 00:24:51,236
Why did you argue with her?

526
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:52,635
I told you

527
00:24:52,796 --> 00:24:54,395
that whatever she said,
don't take it to heart.

528
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:55,516
I can handle it.

529
00:25:00,036 --> 00:25:01,835
Clearly, you fail to handle it properly.

530
00:25:20,316 --> 00:25:20,875
Mom.

531
00:25:21,635 --> 00:25:22,956
I failed you.

532
00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:24,276
Next time, I'll...

533
00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:26,756
Never give up.

534
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,036
Your Grandma gained her prestige

535
00:25:31,835 --> 00:25:33,355
because she found
she had to use everything

536
00:25:33,956 --> 00:25:35,355
to run a large family business

537
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:36,796
instead of relying solely on herself

538
00:25:37,076 --> 00:25:38,395
after your Grandpa passed away.

539
00:25:40,036 --> 00:25:42,115
She used your eldest uncle's fondness
for Bu Huiyun,

540
00:25:42,556 --> 00:25:44,996
your dad's desire
for her acknowledgment,

541
00:25:45,595 --> 00:25:47,276
and the Meng family's connections.

542
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:50,395
If you want to control your life,

543
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:52,316
you'll have to learn from your Grandma.

544
00:25:52,796 --> 00:25:53,796
Take the plunge

545
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:56,635
and use everything around you,

546
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,076
including your emotions.

547
00:25:58,716 --> 00:25:59,316
Mom.

548
00:25:59,915 --> 00:26:02,195
So, you support me pursuing Ms. Yao?

549
00:26:03,236 --> 00:26:05,516
Yeah, you pursue her shamelessly

550
00:26:06,076 --> 00:26:07,435
to distract Lu Cenyang.

551
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:09,355
So I have time to prepare

552
00:26:09,796 --> 00:26:11,556
and catch him off guard.

553
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:19,635
Want a drink?

554
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:22,476
Mom.

555
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:24,635
This time, luck is on my side.

556
00:26:42,796 --> 00:26:43,635
You're late.

557
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,036
Since you asked me out,

558
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:46,835
I had to dress up well.

559
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:49,236
You came so early.

560
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:51,036
You must have been moved by me.

561
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:53,875
You're just a sycophant.

562
00:26:54,236 --> 00:26:55,195
Don't flatter yourself.

563
00:26:55,395 --> 00:26:55,915
You...

564
00:26:58,476 --> 00:26:59,556
Who are you talking about?

565
00:27:03,435 --> 00:27:05,236
Qin Xun taught Bu Ran

566
00:27:06,115 --> 00:27:07,875
how to get close to

567
00:27:08,036 --> 00:27:09,915
and seduce my brother.

568
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:12,756
I cannot lose.

569
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:15,276
Qin Xun helped Bu Ran

570
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:17,276
with nothing in return.

571
00:27:17,796 --> 00:27:19,915
I don't want to end up like him.

572
00:27:23,756 --> 00:27:25,036
I know

573
00:27:25,635 --> 00:27:26,915
about how Bu Ran and Lu Cenyang

574
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:28,796
use the haunting incidents
at the construction site

575
00:27:28,996 --> 00:27:30,195
to deal with your parents.

576
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:32,835
They upset your parents.

577
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,675
Aren't you angry?

578
00:27:36,516 --> 00:27:37,276
Yeah, I am.

579
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:38,996
Let's collaborate.

580
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:41,996
You help me break Bu Ran
and my brother up.

581
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:45,435
And I'll help you hold your head high
in front of your family.

582
00:27:45,835 --> 00:27:47,835
So, there will be no rumors
that your family used a woman

583
00:27:48,036 --> 00:27:50,236
to seduce an enemy
into a marital alliance

584
00:27:50,516 --> 00:27:51,956
and ended up with a defeat.

585
00:27:54,115 --> 00:27:54,875
How to collaborate?

586
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:58,716
You start a relationship with me.

587
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:02,875
A fake relationship.

588
00:28:08,675 --> 00:28:10,115
I'm happy to be in a relationship

589
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:11,756
with you.

590
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:14,076
But I can't believe

591
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,435
you will request that.

592
00:28:16,635 --> 00:28:18,355
Although you're repulsive,

593
00:28:18,915 --> 00:28:20,435
you look better

594
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:23,675
compared with Bu Ran.

595
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,236
As long as you agree,

596
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:28,875
I can let you hold my hands

597
00:28:29,236 --> 00:28:30,316
when we're on a date.

598
00:28:31,716 --> 00:28:32,996
But that's all.

599
00:28:33,476 --> 00:28:34,355
After it's done,

600
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:36,395
you have vented your anger.

601
00:28:39,915 --> 00:28:40,635
Fine.

602
00:28:41,155 --> 00:28:42,875
At least it's a chance
for you to get to know me.

603
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,675
However,

604
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:47,155
collaboration requires a deposit.

605
00:28:47,915 --> 00:28:48,796
You have to let me

606
00:28:52,115 --> 00:28:53,076
kiss you.

607
00:28:58,435 --> 00:28:59,395
Closer.

608
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:00,796
Nice angle.

609
00:29:03,435 --> 00:29:05,675
Posing?

610
00:29:06,476 --> 00:29:07,195
I sent it to you.

611
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:09,476
Find an opportunity
to send it to my brother.

612
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:15,872
(Yao Lefei)

613
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:23,155
The number
you have dialed is powered off.

614
00:29:41,836 --> 00:29:42,528
(Yang)

615
00:29:45,635 --> 00:29:46,395
Hello, Yang.

616
00:29:46,675 --> 00:29:48,355
Did you see Lefei
at your bar last night?

617
00:29:49,556 --> 00:29:50,355
Didn't see her?

618
00:29:50,835 --> 00:29:51,796
Can you help me ask others

619
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:52,835
if they saw her?

620
00:29:54,155 --> 00:29:54,756
Okay.

621
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:08,956
If you want a date,

622
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:10,316
just let me know.

623
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:12,956
But why do we set up a tent here?

624
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:14,395
It's exhausting.

625
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:16,796
Bu Ran and my brother dated in a tent.

626
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,435
Isn't it exciting for us to follow suit?

627
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,036
I get it.

628
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:22,635
Turns out you're trying

629
00:30:22,675 --> 00:30:23,716
to provoke Lu Cenyang.

630
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,996
So, I'm just a complete tool to you.

631
00:30:29,155 --> 00:30:30,395
I've turned off my phone for so long.

632
00:30:30,716 --> 00:30:32,155
He must be worried about me.

633
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:34,115
Let's take a photo later

634
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:35,756
and show it to my brother.

635
00:30:37,595 --> 00:30:38,796
You pretend to date me without thinking

636
00:30:39,076 --> 00:30:39,915
about my feelings.

637
00:30:40,115 --> 00:30:40,756
That's okay.

638
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:42,875
I can do whatever you want.

639
00:30:43,115 --> 00:30:44,635
Even if I get beaten to death
by Lu Cenyang,

640
00:30:44,835 --> 00:30:45,516
I'll accept it.

641
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:47,355
But you can't just use me.

642
00:30:48,036 --> 00:30:49,956
Shouldn't we truly do things

643
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,595
that couples do?

644
00:30:54,115 --> 00:30:55,236
Don't go too far.

645
00:30:55,996 --> 00:30:57,915
You're too proud.

646
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:00,115
I love you with all my heart.

647
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,835
Can't you kiss me?

648
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:05,076
What are you doing?

649
00:31:05,276 --> 00:31:05,996
Yi Zihe.

650
00:31:06,635 --> 00:31:07,516
Yi Zihe.

651
00:31:09,276 --> 00:31:10,435
Let go of me.

652
00:31:24,956 --> 00:31:26,036
Help me find Yi Zihe.

653
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:28,076
I can give you all the evidence

654
00:31:28,076 --> 00:31:29,716
which is against you

655
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:30,716
and Yi Zihe.

656
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:31,996
From now on,

657
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:34,476
we'll stay out
of each other's territory.

658
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:37,595
Why are you looking for my son?

659
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:39,675
You don't need to know.

660
00:31:42,476 --> 00:31:45,675
I hear
my son is pursuing your secretary.

661
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,435
You came to me because of her?

662
00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:53,996
As I said, Mr. Yi,

663
00:31:54,556 --> 00:31:55,516
you don't need to know.

664
00:31:59,115 --> 00:32:00,395
I guessed right, didn't I?

665
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:02,236
Previously,

666
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:03,996
I thought

667
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,476
Ms. Yao was a proud beauty.

668
00:32:05,956 --> 00:32:06,796
But unexpectedly,

669
00:32:07,115 --> 00:32:09,115
Yi Zihe won her over.

670
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:18,115
Feel free to make any request

671
00:32:18,476 --> 00:32:20,236
as long as I can fulfill it.

672
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:24,435
If you told me this earlier,

673
00:32:24,516 --> 00:32:26,115
I would have been interested.

674
00:32:26,756 --> 00:32:28,316
But today, I'm in a bad mood.

675
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:30,395
So, whatever you can do for me,

676
00:32:31,835 --> 00:32:33,236
I don't even want to help you.

677
00:33:07,516 --> 00:33:08,556
(Are you looking for Lu Siqi?)

678
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:09,835
(You beg me.)

679
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:15,076
Lu Cenyang.

680
00:33:15,675 --> 00:33:16,516
Hello, Yi Zihe.

681
00:33:17,316 --> 00:33:18,115
Where is Siqi?

682
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:19,595
If you dare to touch my sister,

683
00:33:19,675 --> 00:33:20,956
I'll make you end up in prison.

684
00:33:22,076 --> 00:33:22,875
Lu Cenyang.

685
00:33:23,236 --> 00:33:24,595
Get the facts straight.

686
00:33:25,076 --> 00:33:26,516
It was your sister who approached me

687
00:33:26,595 --> 00:33:28,316
and wanted to date me.

688
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,115
I'm not afraid
even if you call the police.

689
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:31,756
We're in a relationship.

690
00:33:32,115 --> 00:33:33,115
What can you do to me?

691
00:33:33,796 --> 00:33:34,875
I have known you for so long.

692
00:33:35,236 --> 00:33:37,276
What I hate the most is the way

693
00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:39,236
you look down on people.

694
00:33:40,195 --> 00:33:42,115
Learn how to speak to me properly.

695
00:33:42,595 --> 00:33:45,036
Then I'll consider dumping your sister.

696
00:33:46,595 --> 00:33:47,316
Yi Zihe.

697
00:33:49,556 --> 00:33:51,115
Put Siqi on the phone.

698
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:54,395
She doesn't want to hear your voice.

699
00:33:57,316 --> 00:33:57,956
How about you?

700
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:01,155
I can do anything for you.

701
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:03,875
What if I ask you
to break up with Bu Ran?

702
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:07,556
You think it over.

703
00:34:08,235 --> 00:34:09,635
If I can't have happiness,

704
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:11,795
nor can Bu Ran.

705
00:34:12,436 --> 00:34:13,595
Text me when you have an answer.

706
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:15,356
If you call the police,

707
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:17,076
you'll definitely regret it.

708
00:34:18,396 --> 00:34:20,115
Hello?

709
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:30,795
You like lollipops?

710
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:32,556
What flavor?

711
00:34:33,476 --> 00:34:34,476
My daughter,

712
00:34:34,956 --> 00:34:36,235
I mean, your sister,

713
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:38,315
she likes strawberry flavor.

714
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:40,036
Dad, brother, stop chatting.

715
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:41,436
Come and take the family photo.

716
00:34:41,635 --> 00:34:42,315
Coming.

717
00:34:42,556 --> 00:34:43,275
Got it.

718
00:35:31,076 --> 00:35:32,235
(Something happened to Lu Siqi.)

719
00:35:32,516 --> 00:35:33,476
(See you at the Old Pal's.)

720
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:41,436
Qin Xun.

721
00:35:46,195 --> 00:35:48,275
Lu Siqi and Yi Zihe disappeared
together.

722
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:49,356
She did it on purpose.

723
00:35:49,795 --> 00:35:50,516
Did you call the police?

724
00:35:50,836 --> 00:35:51,916
I wanted to,

725
00:35:52,195 --> 00:35:53,155
but he was afraid

726
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:54,556
that Yi Zihe would do extreme things.

727
00:35:54,715 --> 00:35:56,275
Otherwise, I won't be so anxious.

728
00:35:57,235 --> 00:35:57,836
No.

729
00:35:58,155 --> 00:35:59,836
I'll go check the places
Yi Zihe often visits.

730
00:36:16,356 --> 00:36:17,675
What is Yi Zihe up to?

731
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:22,315
Nothing.

732
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:28,595
I didn't see this coming.

733
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:36,960
(Yi Zihe)

734
00:36:44,356 --> 00:36:45,195
It's me.

735
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,115
Bu Ran?

736
00:36:47,795 --> 00:36:49,356
It's good you're there.

737
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:50,755
Ask him

738
00:36:51,235 --> 00:36:52,436
if he has thought my condition through.

739
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:53,436
What conditions?

740
00:36:54,155 --> 00:36:54,836
You know it.

741
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:56,876
You two have tricked me many times.

742
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:57,996
I finally found a chance

743
00:36:57,996 --> 00:36:59,195
to make a deal with you.

744
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:01,115
I need you to break up with Lu Cenyang.

745
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:05,715
(Because of me,)

746
00:37:05,996 --> 00:37:06,476
Bu Ran.

747
00:37:06,635 --> 00:37:08,115
(The spirited man has turned)

748
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:09,635
(into what he is now.)

00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:10,516
What do you say?

750
00:37:11,115 --> 00:37:11,675
Hello?

751
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:13,956
Fine, I agree.

752
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:15,795
That's really touching.

753
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,836
You sacrifice yourself for a love rival.

754
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:20,516
You better not play any tricks,

755
00:37:20,715 --> 00:37:23,675
or I will ruin Lu Siqi's reputation.

756
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:25,076
No tricks.

757
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:26,755
I gotta go.

758
00:37:27,715 --> 00:37:29,436
Will you really break up
with Lu Cenyang?

759
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:31,836
You send Siqi back now,

760
00:37:32,155 --> 00:37:33,916
and I'll resign
and move out of the Fortune Pavilion.
