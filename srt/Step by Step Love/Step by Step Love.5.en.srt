we will not work with him in the future.

Stop filming.

38
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:41,911
Please say something.

39
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,270
Don't go.

40
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,071
Answer directly please, Ms. Hua.

41
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:45,670

I, I want to thank you all.

45
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:07,631
Thank you for telling me the truth.

46
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,911
Telling me what has happened
to my brother all these years.

47
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:15,511
He has always had me impersonate him
and take his place

48
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:18,751
to prevent him
from being harmed and arrested.

49
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,110
So all along

50
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,791
he has needed me
to negotiate on his behalf.

51
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:26,990
I am like a puppet

52
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:29,990
while he is in control
behind the scenes.

53
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:31,870
This is really to my disadvantage.

54
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,550
So you really saved me.

55
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,830
Thank you all.

56
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:36,911
Goodbye.

57
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:37,430
Goodbye.

58
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,110
Goodbye

59
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:48,791
Kerry,

60
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,631
I have to thank you for your help.

61
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:51,631
It allowed Mr. Ethan

62
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,751
to switch sides from Yi Mincai
to my camp.

63
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,710
(Thank you for giving me
this chance to reform.)

64
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,550
Ethan has already agreed.

65
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,911
You didn't mind
that I drugged your drink

66
00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:06,511
and were willing to give me a chance
to do something for you.

67
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,031
I should be the one thanking you.

68
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,951
Everyone makes wrong choices at times.

69
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,191
This time, I choose to stay by your side
and learn from you.

70
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:18,790
Would you despise it?

71
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,631
Pinshang's Marketing Department
has an opening.

72
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,631
Talents like you who understand
both marketing and networking...

73
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,511
Chairman.

74
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,511
What is this?

75
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:34,790
Due to Mr. Taylor's scandal,

76
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,590
we were disqualified from bidding
on this project for the Welfare Center.

77
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,710
Because Lu Cenyang exposed Taylor's
affair, he was commended.

78
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,350
The upper management directly
awarded the project to Pinshang.

79
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:49,350
They made a name for themselves
in one battle in Hai Shi this time.

80
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:52,790
Yi Mincai, this idiot.

81
00:04:58,071 --> 00:04:58,710
Hello.

82
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:00,150
Ms. Hua,

83
00:05:00,511 --> 00:05:02,871
Did you receive the gift I sent you?

84
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,830
I want to see if the blade
you sent is sharp enough.

85
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,991
I will definitely get to the bottom
of Taylor's scandal.

86
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:19,551
I've known about your son using
a fake Taylor to deceive me

87
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,951
for a long time.

88
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,710
Since you have already reaped
what you sowed,

89
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,511
I won't pursue it relentlessly anymore.

90
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,311
Mr. Yi's deposit to bribe
the fake Taylor was fully returned.

91
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:30,230
Hope you're in a good mood today.

92
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,111
Mom.

93
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,111
You signed a contract
with a fake behind my back,

94
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,431
giving people a handle.

95
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,230
Not a penny less of the deposit
you gave the fake Taylor.

96
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,390
But my old face was slapped
too hard by Lu Cenyang.

97
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,230
Kneel down and reflect

98
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,230
until you know where you went wrong.

99
00:05:57,431 --> 00:05:58,030
Mom,

100
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,910
this is the company.

101
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,111
Mom,

102
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,311
I'm already this old.

103
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:24,230
Can you let go completely for once

104
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,551
and let me take full responsibility?

105
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,111
Watch how I deal with that Lu Cenyang.

106
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:31,951
Dealing with Lu Cenyang is your
responsibility, not something to show me.

107
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:33,910
For saying this,

108
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,191
it shows you've lived
your years in vain.

109
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,030
If you had half the careful thought
your brother once had,

110
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:43,350
I would have trusted you completely
a long time ago.

111
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,751
My brother now only
drinks and sunbathes.

112
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,030
I am useless,

113
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,350
but I can still help the company
grow and become stronger.

114
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,631
Mom.

115
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:53,551
Mom.

116
00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:55,991
It's justified for you
to teach your son a lesson.

117
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:59,270
But once a man loses his credibility,

118
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,191
what else can people expect from him?

119
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:14,951
Thank you for speaking up for me.

120
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,790
You...

121
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:20,071
It's destined that you would slip up.

122
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,390
Putting aside your identity,

123
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,871
you're lacking in every aspect.

124
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,150
You...

125
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,270
What are you talking about?

126
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,350
Kerry had it all planned out
from the start,

127
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:33,511
trying to cling to Lu Cenyang.

128
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,230
You actually believe
you're very charming.

129
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,631
Boss, vegetable meat noodles, please.

130
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:49,991
Okay, just a moment.

131
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,871
The noodles would taste better
with the beef.

132
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,590
This bowl of noodles is on me.

133
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:16,951
Don't play the victim.

134
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,871
Your "thank you" is really stingy.

135
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,671
Thank you.

136
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,590
It's not just for you that I do this.

137
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,751
I know.

138
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,470
It's for the children
of the Welfare Center.

139
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,911
I've carefully reviewed your design
for the Welfare Center.

140
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:36,191
It's a thoughtful
and cost-effective plan.

141
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:37,311
It has its merits.

142
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,750
But I disagree

143
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,391
to using a cheap renovation plan.

144
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,710
Low cost doesn't mean it feels cheap.

145
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,470
In my plan,

146
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,990
indeed, there is very little budgeted
for construction materials.

147
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,551
But we can replace the cheap materials

148
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,830
with durable, special
environmental materials.

149
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:57,191
So now, what do you think of my plan?

150
00:08:58,391 --> 00:08:59,750
It can be accepted by Pinshang.

151
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:01,710
What?

152
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:09,510
Do you still want to join Pinshang?

153
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:18,590
Mr. Lu.

154
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:20,672
(Lucky)

155
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,271
I need to take a call.
I'll be right back.

156
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,470
Please wait a moment.

157
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:39,071
Grandma.

158
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,671
(Ran,)

159
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,750
(This time, Lu Cenyang used
the Taylor incident)

160
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,791
(to deal a heavy blow to Yihua.)

161
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:48,911
(It's time for you
to fulfill your promise.)

162
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:52,990
(If you have already gained
Lu Cenyang's trust,)

163
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,750
(come over tonight and tell me)

164
00:09:56,431 --> 00:10:00,151
(about the specific details
of Pinshang's Welfare Center project.)

165
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:04,510
I won't come over today.

166
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,990
Grandma, the Welfare Center is
not a tool for your games.

167
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,350
I hope after I refuse you this time,

168
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,031
if you have any resentment,
just come to me.

169
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,191
Don't target my mother.

170
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:16,431
(I see.)

171
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:41,750
Hey.

172
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,750
I can finally go to Pinshang.

173
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:51,630
It was because of a promise
I made with Grandma.

174
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,230
But this time,

175
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,951
I can finally take control
of my own destiny.

176
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,990
You think I'm a loser?

177
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:05,791
Yes.

178
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,911
I'm a bit of a loser.

179
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:11,951
Even though I had refused him before,

180
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:15,431
as soon as my neighbor invited me,
I immediately agreed to take the job.

181
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,350
I was looking for you.
Let's talk inside.

182
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:28,791
No need to go in.
Let's just talk here for a moment.

183
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,230
How about it?
Do you want to join Pinshang?

184
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:33,630
Of course I do.

185
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:35,671
Can you answer a question for me first?

186
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,911
The reason you suddenly
invited me to join Pinshang.

187
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:43,350
Of course, it's because you are
valuable to Pinshang.

188
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,630
That's so like you.

189
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:47,951
Sounds just like you
haven't said anything.

190
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,031
Could it be that you want to compensate
me because of a misunderstanding?

191
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,750
So much nonsense.

192
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:57,151
What do you say? Make a statement.

193
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,590
If you want me to agree, fine.

194
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,990
But you have to apologize to me.

195
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:04,911
I hate it most when others wrong me.

196
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:08,590
I need this job,
but I need respect even more.

197
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,830
I...

198
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,870
I'm not in the habit
of apologizing to subordinates.

199
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,791
Don't you really want this job?

200
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,791
Why beg for a job when you lose face?

201
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,671
Oh right,

202
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:34,151
should I WeChat transfer you
next month's rent?

203
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,271
Whatever.

204
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,951
WeChat might have a transfer limit.

205
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:58,391
I'll transfer it from my bank account.

206
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,230
That works.

207
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:09,271
Almost forgot something important.

208
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,551
I didn't fulfill my promise with Douhua.

209
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,870
I want to go apologize to her.

210
00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:15,191
But I promised you

211
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,830
I wouldn't go
to the Welfare Center again.

212
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,350
I'm just going to apologize.
It's not going back on my word, is it?

213
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,350
You've said before only scum would use

214
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,551
scum that Taylor designed.

215
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,110
So you indirectly insulted me.

216
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:32,110
Can this offset the misunderstanding?

217
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,391
You said it.

218
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,350
It's not impossible.

219
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,230
If you join us, you can go
to the Welfare Center whenever you like.

220
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:40,830
Sorry, it's offset.

221
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,791
Don't be late on Monday.

222
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:47,031
Mr. Lu,

223
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:52,110
will you make me become

224
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:54,311
a better designer than Taylor?

225
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:59,151
As long as you work together
with Pinshang

226
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,110
and let the world see that China's
spatial design is the best,

227
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:04,391
you will definitely hear Taylor

228
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,510
say sorry to you.

229
00:14:08,244 --> 00:14:11,328
♪I will give my all♪

230
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:18,493
♪We roam the interwoven constellations♪

231
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:22,138
♪We sleep under the most beautiful sky♪

232
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,280
♪We hold hands and save each other♪

233
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:38,031
Onboard Bu Ran next Monday.

234
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,671
(Boss, have you thought it through?)

235
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,431
(She is Yi Minde's daughter.)

236
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,750
I know.

237
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:46,710
(I understand now.)

238
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:48,870
(You want to keep Bu Ran by your side)

239
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:50,750
(as a trump card against Yihua.)

240
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,551
That's a good idea.

241
00:14:53,071 --> 00:14:54,071
But I didn't think that way.

242
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,110
(So...)

243
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,311
It's simple.

244
00:14:57,951 --> 00:14:59,750
There is no problem with her now,

245
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:02,590
but her personality, frankly,
is not commendable.

246
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:05,110
Let her join Pinshang
and gain some good experience.

247
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:07,031
Consider it as compensation
for her efforts

248
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:08,391
at the Welfare Center.

249
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,710
(Understood, Boss.)

250
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:13,830
You've been running
back and forth recently.

251
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,071
You must be exhausted, right?

252
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,230
I'm not tired, Mom.

253
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:19,031
I just like being with you.

254
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,110
Family member of Bu Huiyun,

255
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:23,470
this is Bu Huiyun's settlement list.

256
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,110
Thank you.

257
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:24,830
You're welcome.

258
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,630
Ran,

259
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:30,830
the living expenses
you gave me are spent.

260
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,191
No need to rush.

261
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,750
I've found a job.

262
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:35,110
I can start working next week.

263
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:38,781
Which company is it?
Are you going to be a designer?

264
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:39,710
Don't worry, Mom.

265
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:41,510
I know the boss of this company.

266
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:43,551
He values my design work very much.

267
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:46,230
This time, I am going
to realize my dream.

268
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:49,590
Which careless company is it?

269
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,071
Could you please not talk nonsense?

270
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,630
Pinshang is considered a leader
in the industry.

271
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:56,271
Pinshang?

272
00:16:01,271 --> 00:16:03,191
Is it the Pinshang owned by Lu Cenyang?

273
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,311
Ran,

274
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,951
I heard

275
00:16:07,271 --> 00:16:09,630
Pinshang had some conflicts with Yihua.

276
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:10,431
I know.

277
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,031
I know the relationship
between Lu Cenyang and grandma.

278
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,630
You didn't tell him

279
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:16,990
you were from the Yi family?

280
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:18,590
We didn't have the chance
to talk about this.

281
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:23,031
If your boss finds out
about your identity,

282
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:24,470
will it affect your work?

283
00:16:24,671 --> 00:16:26,510
I am not the same as grandma
and my second uncle.

284
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:28,191
I've helped him.

285
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:38,311
The discharge procedures
have all been completed.

286
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:40,071
It's a day of double happiness.

287
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:41,671
Let's go celebrate at my bar.

288
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:42,671
Give it to me.

289
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,911
Let's go, to drink.

290
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,630
There's nothing a drink can't solve.

291
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:51,791
I'm going now, Mom.

292
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:53,311
Slow down.

293
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:55,551
We've investigated it.

294
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:57,071
Bu Ran did not come forward again,

295
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:58,551
but Qin Xun,
who studied abroad with her,

296
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,191
is very familiar
with Taylor's situation.

297
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,431
It was him who had been helping
Lu Cenyang in secret.

298
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,710
I can't deal with Lu,

299
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:09,431
but I can deal with you.

300
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:19,550
Bu Ran, you go take uncle and aunt
upstairs first.

301
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,510
I'll go park the car.

302
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:21,831
Okay.

303
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,990
Pretending not to know me?

304
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:36,310
You, Bu Ran's lackey.

305
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,990
Don't you know who I am?

306
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,990
Isn't this the little brother?

307
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:42,790
If you're here to support me,
take a seat inside.

308
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:45,151
If you don't spend
a six-figure sum today,

309
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:46,591
you'll let down your family name.

310
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:48,151
Knowing my surname,

311
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,270
you should be clear
why I am looking for you.

312
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,470
Lu Cenyang is relentlessly
pursuing Taylor.

313
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:54,030
You're the one backing him?

314
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,831
I've put in so much effort
to get involved with Taylor,

315
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,111
but you've ruined it all.

316
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:00,790
I have something to do.

317
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,550
I don't have time
to waste with you, move aside.

318
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:05,750
Let's see if you can make your way past.

319
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,871
Or crawl past.

320
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:07,871
Get him.

321
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,070
What a coincidence, Mr. Yi.

322
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,831
Bringing so many people here
to cause trouble?

323
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:19,270
I want to talk to Qin Xun.

324
00:18:19,671 --> 00:18:20,510
Not getting in your way.

325
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,151
Qin Xun.

326
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,230
Why did it take you so long?

327
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:31,230
Is that Zihe?

328
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,070
How did you get here?

329
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:34,671
You are here too.

330
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:36,990
Do you recognize this person before me?

331
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,510
Of course, I do.

332
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,550
You must be Mingyu's son, right?

333
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:46,070
Haven't seen you in years,
you dress well.

334
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,671
You've made it big?

335
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:56,256
(Qin Xun)

336
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,431
Hello, you three went out
for a private meal?

337
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,391
(This is bad.)

338
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,831
(Your dad, Lu Cenyang, and Yi Zihe)

339
00:19:03,831 --> 00:19:05,070
(bumped right into each other.)

340
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,591
(Yi Zihe is fanning the flames
and talking about you.)

341
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,790
(Lu Cenyang will find out
you're from the Yi family.)

342
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,831
What?

343
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:12,070
(It's okay, leave it to me.)

344
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,310
(You mustn't show up.)

345
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:14,230
I...

346
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:18,671
Mr. Lu,

347
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,391
I heard that Mr. Yi was here
to stand up for Taylor.

348
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,671
Can you two make it clear?

349
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:29,470
You don't remember the pain
you suffered, do you?

350
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,871
Due to Taylor,
Yihua has suffered a heavy blow.

351
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,070
If it gets out that you're picking a
quarrel with Qin Xun because of Taylor,

352
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,151
that would be like
giving me a huge gift.

353
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,710
How do you want to deal with Qin Xun?

354
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,191
Go ahead, I won't stop you.

355
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,030
Lu Cenyang, you...

356
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:46,631
What are you laughing at?

357
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,710
You can't always have the upper hand.

358
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:51,831
Back when my grandmother
broke off your engagement,

359
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,431
you looked as pitiable as a stray dog.

360
00:19:56,631 --> 00:19:58,871
If it weren't for Zihe mentioning it,

361
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,750
I would have been
too embarrassed to speak up.

362
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,510
When Mingyu was alive,

363
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,510
we did bring it up

364
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,951
about matchmaking
Mr. Lu with my daughter.

365
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,631
What's the harm in meeting?

366
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,191
But I was afraid that you guys

367
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,591
would dislike the whole arranged
meeting thing and find it awkward.

368
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,070
You're just joking with Mr. Lu.

369
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,151
Why taking it seriously?

370
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,270
I'm not joking.

371
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,911
Mingyu and I

372
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,831
exchanged

373
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:22,470
the birth details of our children.

374
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,470
and set up a child betrothal.

375
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:25,710
The fortune teller said

376
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,911
Cenyang was a warm man.

377
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,871
The two are a good match.

378
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,710
When Ms. Hua came to my home to cancel
the engagement, it was with your daughter?

379
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:36,710
Of course.

380
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:38,270
Why don't you meet?

381
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:40,990
Maybe you will hit it off now.

382
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,831
(Why didn't I think of it earlier?)

383
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:47,790
(Among the Yi family's grandchildren,
Bu Ran is the only girl.)

384
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:52,151
Uncle, you really know how
to improvise on the spot.

385
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:54,391
Mr. Lu has a chill about him.

386
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,191
An aura that could freeze
things ten meters away.

387
00:20:56,431 --> 00:20:57,550
That's nothing like a warm man.

388
00:20:57,831 --> 00:20:59,351
Did you consult a blind fortune-teller?

389
00:20:59,671 --> 00:21:00,871
You're not a woman.

390
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,631
Why would Cenyang act
like a warm man towards you?

391
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:06,951
Lu Cenyang,

392
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,510
my sister is like a fighting cock.
You can meet her.

393
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,111
Good to broaden your horizons.

394
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:13,550
Mr. Yi,

395
00:21:13,911 --> 00:21:16,030
I don't care why you came here today.

396
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,070
But based on our relationship,
I kindly advise you,

397
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:20,831
this is my friend Mr. Xu's bar.

398
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:23,030
If you come here to cause trouble again,

399
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:26,550
I will surely invite Ms. Hua
to have coffee in the bar.

400
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:27,951
You...

401
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,951
It's been so many years
since we last met.

402
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:44,990
Let me treat you to a drink.

403
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:46,351
Okay.

404
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,310
When the boss treats,
I choose the expensive ones.

405
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,070
Let's go.

406
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:58,270
Auntie, let's go.

407
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,671
Mom.

408
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,831
Mom.

409
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:04,990
Mom.

410
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,750
Ran.

411
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,911
What's the situation?

412
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,510
How come I was engaged to him
in childhood?

413
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,151
It's not something
that can be explained in a short time.

414
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:18,230
After my dad passed away,

415
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:20,911
I know you have paid your price.

416
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,671
But that does not appease my resentment.

417
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,871
I owe Mr. Lu a debt
I can never repay in this lifetime.

418
00:22:30,591 --> 00:22:33,990
If my life can appease your resentment,

419
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,270
feel free to take it.

420
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:38,391
I don't want to dirty my hands.

421
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,591
Nor do I want to let you off so easily.

422
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,070
I've heard of your strength.

423
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:51,470
You can surely fulfill
Mr. Lu's dying wishes.

424
00:22:51,951 --> 00:22:53,191
Spare me the flattery.

425
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:55,831
You still remember
my father's dying wishes?

426
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,111
I have never forgotten them.

427
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,151
I've been in prison
for seven years to avoid it.

428
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:07,310
It's because I don't want
to face my own weakness.

429
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:12,710
Okay.

430
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:15,111
Thank you for buying me a drink.

431
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,030
Why are you leaving?

432
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:26,671
I'm not used to the liquor here.

433
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:28,230
It's tasteless.

434
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:30,671
If it weren't for the free drinks
I was treated to,

435
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,831
I would have to make you compensate me.

436
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:33,671
I'm leaving.

437
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,750
No need to see me out.

438
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,631
I actually have an old, fateful
connection with Lu Cenyang.

439
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,351
I have no problem dating
someone in his twenties.

440
00:23:46,351 --> 00:23:47,750
Who want to marry a man nearly forty?

441
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:49,790
It's already cancelled, don't worry.

442
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,151
I'm worried that alcohol
has fried my dad's brain.

443
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,391
He took advantage of the situation

444
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:54,871
and talked about us meeting.

445
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,151
I'm terrified
that Mr. Lu would say okay.

446
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,111
That would be worse
than having my identity revealed.

447
00:23:59,111 --> 00:24:00,191
I would lose all dignity.

448
00:24:00,431 --> 00:24:04,151
Your dad must have calculated
he wouldn't agree to meet.

449
00:24:04,391 --> 00:24:06,871
After my dad was released from prison,
he was like a hopeless mess.

450
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:08,230
He could make such shrewd calculations?

451
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,230
Oh my god.

452
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,351
I can't believe I have a matchmaking
arrangement with my future boss.

453
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:21,391
Good morning.

454
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,671
There's a new breakfast place
near the office.

455
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,710
Do you want something?

456
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:26,431
No need, I've made some coffee.

457
00:24:28,191 --> 00:24:30,310
From your voice, it seems
you didn't sleep well last night.

458
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,790
Let's talk business.

459
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,351
(When Mr. Liu of Haohan Stars)

460
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,610
(saw that we got
the Welfare Center project,)

461
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,831
he came specifically to ask us to design
a matrimonial home for his son.

462
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,671
I think he just wants an excuse
to side with Pinshang

463
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,871
and to dump Yihua for good.

464
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,671
It seems that the Welfare Center project
has indeed dealt a heavy blow to Yihua.

465
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,671
Oh right.

466
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,550
Mr. Liu's son and his daughter-in-law
were betrothed from childhood.

467
00:24:57,111 --> 00:24:58,470
(Boss, what's wrong with you?)

468
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:00,191
Nothing.

469
00:25:01,391 --> 00:25:02,351
No need to make a fuss.

470
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:03,831
There are lots of cases like this.

471
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,310
(When the young couple
had a conflict before,)

472
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,790
the girl went to annul the marriage.

473
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,831
(But the two had no contact
after meeting as children.)

474
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,230
(It is said that Mr. Liu's son,
for the sake of free love,)

475
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:17,230
(went to a place Mr. Liu couldn't find.)

476
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:21,230
(But he ended up choosing
his childhood betrothed among the many.)

477
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,550
(We can start the design from the point
of the childhood betrothal.)

478
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:26,191
(It will definitely impress Mr. Liu.)

479
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,470
You go talk to Mr. Liu about this.

480
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:29,470
No need to tell me.

481
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,270
(Hello?)

482
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,831
(Hello, Boss.)

483
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,790
(Boss, are you still there?)

484
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,710
You have good energy.

485
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:40,151
You're full of energy
after sleeping for such a short time.

486
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:42,990
I didn't sleep well all night.

487
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,911
My mind is full of the issue of quitting
the childhood betrothal with my boss

488
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,351
being known by the whole company.

489
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,151
As a result, Mr. Lu fired me.

490
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:51,070
He probably doesn't know

491
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,671
you were the marriage partner.

492
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,710
You have to pretend you don't know
and keep a good distance from him.

493
00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:59,510
Now that you mention it, yes.

494
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:02,911
It made me lose sleep all night.

495
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,270
I have a sore back and aching waist.

496
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,710
Do you have time for dinner tonight?

497
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:08,750
Should have, let's meet after work.

498
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:09,710
Okay.

499
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:33,070
What image?

500
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,070
I'll exercise and get ready
for the new job.

501
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,111
If you don't warm up,
it's easy to get cramps.

502
00:26:45,111 --> 00:26:47,470
Your waist might need some oiling.

503
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,550
Not exercising for a long time
has indeed made me a bit out of shape.

504
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,470
What?

505
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,470
I didn't say you had deteriorated.

506
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,070
Stop talking about it.

507
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:04,111
I've said it, I don't like it.

508
00:27:04,111 --> 00:27:05,911
Can't you just return it for me?

509
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:08,391
Then why buy it?

510
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,671
Why not treat it well?

511
00:27:09,831 --> 00:27:10,391
Do you know

512
00:27:10,391 --> 00:27:11,591
how embarrassing it is
for a product to be returned?

513
00:27:11,591 --> 00:27:12,990
Aren't you being too irresponsible?

514
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:21,631
It's just a tape measure.
I don't like it, so I'll return it.

515
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,951
It's baffling.

516
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,911
Ouch.

517
00:27:29,351 --> 00:27:30,631
Leg... cramp... cramping...

518
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:33,750
I've got a leg cramp,
