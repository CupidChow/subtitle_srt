Ms. Yao,

144
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:55,219
I'm feeling very confused right now.

145
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:56,778
You're the only one I can call.

146
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:58,658
Don't rush.

147
00:10:59,099 --> 00:10:59,979
Take your time.

148
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:03,698
Mr. Lu helped me find

149
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:05,578
the bodyguard I had a crush on.

150
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:07,739
I once boasted to him,

151
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:09,339
saying that before I went to college,

152
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,418
I was helped by a bodyguard.

153
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:12,938
I thought he was really handsome.

154
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:14,019
I never expected Mr. Lu

155
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:15,778
to miraculously find him for me.

156
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:18,339
Boss,

157
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,259
why do you still keep

158
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,619
this outdated bodyguard uniform?

159
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:23,658
I traveled to a lot of places

160
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:26,099
in this outfit with my dad.

161
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:27,379
It holds memories.

162
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:30,899
Hello?

163
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:32,538
Ms. Yao.

164
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:34,739
I'm here.

165
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:37,058
Have you met with the bodyguard?

166
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,139
I'm now only separated
by a wall from him.

167
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,698
But I've suddenly chickened out.

168
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:45,219
I'm a little afraid of meeting him.

169
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:47,219
I guess you chickened out

170
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:49,739
because you're not sure
if the one you like now

171
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:50,778
is him or not.

172
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:54,979
Or maybe you're still stuck
in your girlhood's adoration.

173
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:59,139
To confirm whether you like someone,

174
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:01,219
you have to ask yourself.

175
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:03,259
Do you think of him all the time

176
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:04,658
when you eat

177
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:08,139
and when you go to sleep?

178
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:12,899
If not,

179
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,058
I suggest it's best not to meet him

180
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:18,658
to avoid being misunderstood by him

181
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,818
and to save yourself
unnecessary trouble.

182
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:38,219
Thank you for the surprise
you prepared for me.

183
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:40,818
But I really don't have the courage

184
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:42,619
to face the feelings of my girlhood.

185
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:44,458
It's better to keep them in my heart.

00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:51,458
my apologies to the bodyguard.

188
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:02,219
She said the bodyguard
was the handsomest.

189
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:03,578
Coward.

190
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,499
Don't even have the courage to meet me.

191
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,099
If I run into him again,

192
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:12,219
maybe I'll just greet him,

193
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:15,499
or maybe I'll woo him.

194
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:17,778
But only

195
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:20,379
by meeting face to face will I know.

(To confirm

(The person I think of all the time...)

201
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:48,899

(I can give you a lift.)

207
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:08,538
(Concerned about the rent?
Defer payment for now.)

208
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,899
(With me here,
I won't let you drink again.)

209
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:12,298
(Also,)

00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:15,298
(if you get a leg cramp,
you can come to me.)

211
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,458
(You can come here

212
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:25,418
(It seems I really have fallen for him.)

213
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:29,139
(But what should I do?)

214
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:34,658

I'm from the Yi Family?)

Why do you try to avoid me?

219
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:25,259
I

220
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:27,619
have wasted your kindness.

221
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:28,859
I'm ashamed to meet you.

222
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:34,298
I made porridge for you.

223
00:15:36,538 --> 00:15:37,818
You usually seem very brave.

224
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:40,099
But at the crucial moment,
you ran faster than a rabbit.

225
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,019
You suddenly changed your mind.

226
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:44,019
Could it be

227
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,778
that there's someone else you like?

228
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:53,259
Women change their mind
faster than flipping a page.

229
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:54,859
Besides,

230
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,499
I've told you the reason. Why ask again?

231
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:04,698
How did you catch a cold as well?

232
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,178
It's just rhinitis.

233
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,099
With your weak health,

234
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,019
how can you work
in the Design Department?

235
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,178
Drink the porridge yourself.

236
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:17,578
There's still some at home.

237
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:35,259
In the Extraordinary Place,

238
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:37,458
Bu Ran's friend, Qin Xun,

239
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:39,339
voted most actively for her.

240
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,698
Have you found anything about him?

241
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:44,379
Qin Xun grew up in the country
where Bu Ran studied abroad.

242
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,619
After Bu Ran returned home
without a master degree,

243
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,058
he followed her back.

244
00:16:48,818 --> 00:16:50,099
This person is a bit strange.

245
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,418
He grew up in a single-parent family.

246
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:54,339
There's no information about his father.

247
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:55,899
After his mother passed away,

248
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,499
she left him many houses.

249
00:16:57,859 --> 00:16:58,979
His condition is quite good.

250
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,339
He is currently working at Old Pal's

251
00:17:01,538 --> 00:17:03,019
and is very popular with women.

252
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,218
But the only woman
who really has dealings with him

253
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:07,379
is Bu Ran.

254
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,458
It seems

255
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,938
he has fallen for Bu Ran.

256
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:11,539
Furthermore,

257
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:12,859
the one who caused trouble

258
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:15,779
for Taylor's reputation
for Lu Cenyang was also him.

259
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:19,859
Anyone of good sense can see

260
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,539
that Lu Cenyang
takes good care of Bu Ran.

261
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,859
Qin Xun, for the sake of Bu Ran,

262
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:29,218
could join hands
with his potential love rival.

263
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:30,738
He's quite the romantic.

264
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,218
Bu Ran has good relations
with men just like her mother.

265
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:36,458
Good.

266
00:17:37,218 --> 00:17:41,018
With Qin Xun by Bu Ran's side
as her protector,

267
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:44,859
perhaps it could arouse
Lu Cenyang's competitive desire.

268
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:46,819
Bu Ran, the seemingly doomed
chess piece,

269
00:17:47,218 --> 00:17:50,379
has made an unexpected comeback
by chance.

270
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:05,299
Hello.

271
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:08,418
I thought you dared not to answer.

272
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,258
If you dare to call,
why wouldn't I dare to answer?

273
00:18:12,498 --> 00:18:14,819
Sorry about last night.

274
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:18,178
I got a bit carried away
with my hormones.

275
00:18:18,658 --> 00:18:20,178
It's not a big deal.

276
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:21,978
But I'm surprised

277
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:23,018
you see me as a woman.

278
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,539
But don't do this again.

279
00:18:24,698 --> 00:18:25,978
My heart can't take it.

280
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:29,938
Isn't it because you're too charming?

281
00:18:30,698 --> 00:18:32,139
Don't say that.

282
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:34,099
I'm afraid of you.

283
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:35,579
You can't be unscrupulous.

284
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,218
After you beat Chen Manni,

285
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:38,698
your fans are everywhere.

286
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:39,978
As your fan leader,

287
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:41,099
why can't I praise you?

288
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:43,458
Sure, why not.

289
00:18:44,418 --> 00:18:45,258
I'm off to work.

290
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:47,978
You caught a cold?

291
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:17,379
Bu Ran, you've caught a cold?

292
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:18,539
It's nothing.

293
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:31,738
Mr. Li.

294
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:33,859
This

295
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:34,738
is called mint.

296
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:36,178
It can freshen the air

297
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:37,458
and refresh the mind.

298
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:42,738
You've caught a cold?

299
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,139
When I tend

300
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:46,938
to the flowers and plants
on the terrace,

301
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:48,379
I often catch the wind.

302
00:19:48,498 --> 00:19:49,418
So,

303
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:50,738
I always keep

304
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:52,458
the cold medicine handy.

305
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:54,178
Hurry up and take it.

306
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:55,579
Thank you, Mr. Li.

307
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:59,139
Next time, I'll treat you
to bread I bake myself.

308
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:00,018
Alright.

309
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:03,178
If there's nothing else, I'll go out.

310
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,539
Don't forget to take this medicine.

311
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:17,698
You're good with people.

312
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,218
Look at the large mint Mr. Li gave you.

313
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:22,339
So fragrant.

314
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:24,218
My good relationships
are all thanks to everyone.

315
00:20:25,178 --> 00:20:26,299
I'll take the medicine.

316
00:20:26,418 --> 00:20:27,018
Go ahead.

317
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:31,018
Miss,

318
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:33,418
does Mr. Li often catch a cold?

319
00:20:34,498 --> 00:20:36,539
He always seems to be in great health.

320
00:20:36,698 --> 00:20:37,299
Why does he...?

321
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:38,178
Mind your business.

322
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:01,859
You were

323
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,059
busy with your career at the age of 20.

324
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:05,498
There was no time for romance.

325
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:07,218
You're 30 now.

326
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:09,258
Why are you too shy to taking action?

327
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:12,139
I had to help you give her the medicine.

328
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,379
Aren't we in the company?

329
00:21:16,938 --> 00:21:17,619
Alright.

330
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:19,178
If you like her,

331
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:20,738
don't be shy.

332
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:25,139
I'm afraid of being caught
by the short hairs by Yi Minde.

333
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,218
Stubborn.

334
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:31,018
I know what you're worried about.

335
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,178
She

336
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,379
isn't surnamed Yi anyway.

337
00:21:35,178 --> 00:21:36,779
Even the grudges
from the previous generation

338
00:21:36,938 --> 00:21:38,539
are just hearsay.

339
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,579
With a frank and sincere personality,

340
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,658
she's loyal to the company.

341
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:46,018
She's irreproachable.

342
00:21:48,498 --> 00:21:49,579
Uncle Li,

343
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:51,698
you tend to flowers
on the rooftop every day.

344
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:53,738
How come you are so well-informed?

345
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:57,738
I've been with your dad
for so many years.

346
00:21:58,978 --> 00:22:01,139
I know that his jumping off

347
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,418
wasn't entirely out of despair

348
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:05,738
but rather to take away

349
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:08,059
the pressure that would weigh
on your generation.

350
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:13,059
He hoped that you and Siqi
could be happy in the future.

351
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:18,059
You're not getting any younger.

352
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:20,738
It's time for you
to consider your marriage.

353
00:22:21,498 --> 00:22:23,938
You can't spend your life
just with Siqi.

354
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:26,779
It's rare to meet someone
you take a liking to.

355
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:28,059
No matter who she is,

356
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:29,139
as long as she's kind-hearted,

357
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:30,698
you should hold on to her.

358
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:32,859
I...

359
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:43,859
Mr. Li,

360
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:47,059
the mint you gave Bu Ran
is really fragrant.

361
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:48,339
I want a pot too.

362
00:22:48,498 --> 00:22:49,779
Okay, just wait a moment.

363
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:51,698
I'll pick out a pot
with a nice scent for you.

364
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:52,819
Thank you.

365
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,218
I just passed by Bu Ran's cubicle.

366
00:23:07,978 --> 00:23:08,899
She's just like you,

367
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:10,458
coughing

368
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:11,498
and sneezing.

369
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:14,379
You two have exactly the same symptoms.

370
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:17,539
She has a cold.

371
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:18,339
I have rhinitis.

372
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:20,099
The symptoms are similar,

373
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:21,418
but not the same.

374
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:25,258
Rhinitis also occurs
after catching a cold.

375
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:32,619
You caught a lot of wind last night
waiting for her, didn't you?

376
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:35,018
How did you know?

377
00:23:35,698 --> 00:23:37,379
Last night, Bu Ran called me

378
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:38,498
nervously,

379
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:41,698
asking me if she should meet
her bodyguard crush.

380
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,859
I see she has a good relationship
with Qin Xun.

381
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,379
So I advised her that if she liked
someone else,

382
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:48,658
she'd better not meet him.

383
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:49,978
You...

384
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:56,339
You have taken a liking to Bu Ran?

385
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:02,258
Ms. Yao,

386
00:24:03,498 --> 00:24:04,539
this pot has a nice fragrance.

387
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:05,899
I'll take it down for you.

388
00:24:06,498 --> 00:24:07,178
Okay.

389
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:38,899
Okay, I know. I'll go right away.

390
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:51,779
This morning,

391
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:54,018
I saw Mr. Lu have Mr. Li
give you the medicine.

392
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,218
He seems to be overly concerned
about you.

393
00:24:56,938 --> 00:24:58,978
You two aren't having
a secret affair, are you?

394
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:04,379
Carry, your imagination is too wild.

395
00:25:04,738 --> 00:25:05,619
It's just medicine.

396
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:07,218
Even if it's from Mr. Lu,

397
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:09,458
it's just the boss' concern
for an employee.

398
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:11,458
It's not what you think.

399
00:25:11,938 --> 00:25:14,258
But if you are Mr. Lu's sweetheart,

400
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:16,418
I wouldn't find it strange at all.

401
00:25:17,498 --> 00:25:18,379
Because, after all,

402
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,579
not everyone can drink on his behalf.

403
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:22,418
You'd better remember this.

404
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,018
You're the one coveting Mr. Lu.

405
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:27,258
Instead of always watching me,

406
00:25:28,978 --> 00:25:31,218
you might as well catch a cold
in front of Mr. Lu.

407
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,099
Maybe he'll feel sorry for you

408
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,539
and make you ginseng soup.

409
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:36,859
You...

410
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,658
What did you say to Bu Ran?

411
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,938
Ms. Yao, do you know?

412
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,819
Bu Ran and Mr. Lu caught a cold
at the same time.

413
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:53,218
How could it be so coincidental?

414
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:54,539
There must be something going on.

415
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:55,738
What's the big deal?

416
00:25:56,258 --> 00:25:57,218
Just a coincidence.

417
00:25:57,579 --> 00:25:58,418
I guess

418
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:00,899
Mr. Lu has been undermining Qin Xun.

419
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:03,579
Yesterday was Bu Ran's birthday.

420
00:26:03,738 --> 00:26:04,698
I saw with my own eyes

421
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:06,899
that she agreed to go
to Qin Xun's house after work.

422
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:08,379
But after work,

423
00:26:08,498 --> 00:26:11,099
I saw Mr. Lu eagerly chasing after her.

424
00:26:11,258 --> 00:26:12,379
What does this imply?

425
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:13,899
It indicates that these two men

426
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:15,579
are both putting in effort to woo her.

427
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:19,619
Originally, I thought Qin Xun
was sure to win.

428
00:26:20,738 --> 00:26:23,458
But now it seems Mr. Lu
has made a comeback.

429
00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:27,418
You're really filling in the story.

430
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:29,379
It's a pity you're not a scriptwriter.

431
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:30,938
In my opinion,

432
00:26:31,418 --> 00:26:33,619
if you lose to Bu Ran with your charm,

433
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,819
that would be the biggest gossip
in the company.

434
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,099
(Yao Lefei is the foremost obstacle)

435
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:46,339
(for Mr. Lu's admirers.)

436
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,379
(She is surprisingly indifferent
to the rumors)

437
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:49,819
(about Bu Ran and Mr. Lu.)

438
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:52,299
(The calmer she is,
the more she's hiding.)

439
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:55,779
(I need to report
some progress to Ms. Hua.)

440
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:58,018
(If I can't have the man,)

441
00:26:58,299 --> 00:26:59,619
(I can't fail to get the wealth.)

442
00:27:04,738 --> 00:27:05,379
Carry,

443
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:07,218
I know all that you've told me.

444
00:27:08,178 --> 00:27:10,859
If Bu Ran can become
Lu Cenyang's girlfriend,

445
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:14,099
it would be easier to find Lu Siqi.

446
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:16,139
In fact, it would be more useful to me.

447
00:27:17,658 --> 00:27:19,299
You need to try hard

448
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,379
to assist their relationship.

449
00:27:22,218 --> 00:27:25,458
I won't short-change you
on the money you want.

450
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:37,738
Eat.

451
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:39,379
You're still eating at such a time.

452
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:40,539
What's wrong?

453
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:43,458
You may leave.

454
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:52,738
I just heard mom instructing her mole

455
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:55,018
to properly assist Bu Ran
and Lu Cenyang's relationship.

456
00:27:55,658 --> 00:27:56,899
If Bu Ran is still useful to mom,

457
00:27:57,018 --> 00:27:58,099
our family will be at a loss.

458
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,139
Even if it means mutual destruction,

459
00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:02,938
we have to reveal Bu Ran's identity

460
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:04,099
to Lu Cenyang.

461
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:06,579
If Lu Cenyang finds out Bu Ran
is from the Yi Family,

462
00:28:06,738 --> 00:28:08,139
how can he have any affections for her?

463
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:09,258
That's doable.

464
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:12,859
However,

465
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:15,619
if mom finds out...

466
00:28:15,978 --> 00:28:16,738
What's there to fear?

467
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:19,458
This isn't enough?

468
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:22,178
Chen Manni is demanding
a breakup fee from our son.

469
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:23,698
I didn't want to give her the money.

470
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:25,579
But now it seems

471
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:29,018
by using Chen Manni's unwillingness
to lose to Bu Ran,

472
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:32,619
a two-pronged approach is more secure.

473
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:34,779
Brilliant.

474
00:28:35,498 --> 00:28:36,819
That's really clever.

475
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:39,938
I'm leaving.

476
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:42,059
I'm off.

477
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:43,978
Bye-bye.

478
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,339
Knock off work earlier.

479
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:50,299
If you're not feeling well, leave early.

480
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:51,498
Get more rest.

481
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:54,139
Only by getting fully recovered
can you improve work efficiency.

482
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:55,859
Thank you, Miss.

483
00:28:56,178 --> 00:28:57,339
Then I'll call it a day.

484
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:07,619
Bu Ran.

485
00:29:12,738 --> 00:29:13,698
It's a bit hot.

486
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:15,498
Don't ride your bike home then.

487
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:16,698
Take a taxi back.

488
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:18,978
Take a bath and sweat it out
when you get back.

489
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:19,658
Thanks.

490
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:20,738
I'll try when I get home.

491
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:21,698
See you tomorrow.

492
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:22,579
See you tomorrow.

493
00:29:34,498 --> 00:29:35,539
Bu Ran, we are leaving first.

494
00:29:35,658 --> 00:29:36,178
Bye-bye.

495
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:40,059
Mr. Lu.

496
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:41,619
The Extraordinary Place
is well-received.

497
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,539
Some media would like to interview you

498
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:45,658
about how you promoted
Chinese spatial aesthetics

499
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,218
and discovered designers like Bu Ran.

500
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:48,698
Promoting Chinese spatial aesthetics

501
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:50,978
is the direction for the Design
Department of Pinshang.

502
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:51,938
Well,

503
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:53,339
discuss with the Marketing Dept.

504
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:55,698
and arrange a group interview
with all the designers.

505
00:29:55,938 --> 00:29:57,139
Let them express their own views.

506
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:59,779
The more voices we have,
the more topics there are to discuss.

507
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:01,299
I have an emergency. I'm leaving.

508
00:30:02,978 --> 00:30:03,619
Mr. Lu.

509
00:30:15,498 --> 00:30:16,178
Mr. Lu.

510
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:17,859
Where are you?

511
00:30:20,258 --> 00:30:21,458
I have a cold and feel sleepy.

512
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:22,379
Just took a taxi home.

513
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:24,218
No wonder I saw your bike

514
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:25,418
was still in the bike shed.

515
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:27,498
Is there something?

516
00:30:33,658 --> 00:30:34,299
Nothing.

517
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,738
I was just asking if you had left.

518
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:37,099
If not, we could go together.

519
00:30:37,978 --> 00:30:39,139
I'm already in the car.

520
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:41,458
Go back and get some sleep.

521
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:42,779
Tell me when you wake up.

522
00:30:42,938 --> 00:30:43,738
I'll cook you noodles.

523
00:30:48,938 --> 00:30:51,139
Why did I make her
go up the mountain so late at night?

524
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,059
Seeing you rush out of the company,

525
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:00,938
I thought something had happened.

526
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:02,258
Turns out it was for Bu Ran.

527
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,859
I asked you this morning
if you liked her,

528
00:31:05,498 --> 00:31:06,539
it seems there's an answer now.

529
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:11,418
I don't wish to hide anything from you.

530
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:14,658
My feelings for Bu Ran are very special.

531
00:31:15,658 --> 00:31:16,619
I like her.

532
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:21,619
Boss,

533
00:31:22,498 --> 00:31:23,619
I'm your secretary.

534
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:25,498
I shouldn't interfere
with whom you like.

535
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:27,859
But it's my duty to remind you,

536
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:30,619
the designers in the company,
who have high aspirations,

537
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:31,978
came here because

538
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:33,178
they were dissatisfied

539
00:31:33,339 --> 00:31:34,859
with the barriers
Yihua set in the industry.

540
00:31:35,258 --> 00:31:37,099
That's why they chose
to work for you and Pinshang.

541
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:39,539
If one day,

542
00:31:40,018 --> 00:31:41,498
Bu Ran's identity gets revealed

543
00:31:42,018 --> 00:31:44,299
and the colleagues find out
you like someone from the Yi Family,

544
00:31:44,698 --> 00:31:46,379
it would greatly affect the morale.

545
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:48,099
Boss,

546
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:50,218
I believe you're not blinded by love

547
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:51,779
and can tell what's more important.

548
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:53,059
Let's go.

549
00:31:53,498 --> 00:31:54,099
Where to?

550
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:55,579
Back to the company.

551
00:31:56,258 --> 00:31:57,539
I will be scrupulous.

552
00:32:42,178 --> 00:32:42,539
Dad.

553
00:32:42,698 --> 00:32:43,218
Ran,

554
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:45,738
many of your fans
have suddenly come to our home.

555
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,379
They say they watched
Extraordinary Place

556
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:49,018
and have come
to take videos at our place.

557
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,139
Your mom is distressed by the noise.

558
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:52,619
Can you come back?

559
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:54,099
I'll come back right away.

560
00:32:59,418 --> 00:33:00,059
Qin Xun,

561
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:01,299
come to my home at once.

562
00:33:06,698 --> 00:33:07,779
Please stop filming.

563
00:33:07,978 --> 00:33:09,379
Thank you, okay?

564
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,178
Stop filming.

565
00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:13,139
It's no use filming us.

566
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:13,899
Right?

567
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:14,458
Stop this.

568
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:15,498
Go back.

569
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:19,458
Everyone, please go back. Stop filming.

570
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:21,059
Are you all here for me?

571
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:23,099
Miss Bu Ran is back.

572
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:25,059
I can take pictures and sign autographs.

573
00:33:25,418 --> 00:33:26,859
But please,

574
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,619
don't disclose our home address
or post my parents' photos online.

575
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:30,619
They like to be quiet.

576
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:31,178
Miss Bu.

577
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:31,978
Stop filming.

578
00:33:31,978 --> 00:33:32,658
I really like you.

579
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:34,218
I've discovered they're not true fans.

580
00:33:34,738 --> 00:33:35,619
Their acting is overdone.

581
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:36,819
Okay, no more filming.

582
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:38,379
Acting as if you're a celebrity.

583
00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:40,178
As if you would qualify.

584
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:43,539
My senior?

585
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:46,779
Did you bring these people here?

586
00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:48,059
I'm not that idle.

587
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:49,379
I just saw on the internet

588
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:51,059
that someone organized
a visit to your house.

589
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:53,218
I wanted to see what family background
you came from.

590
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:55,539
You have the ability to influence
the outcome of a competition.

591
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:58,258
The result is indeed surprising.

592
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:00,859
You turn out to be Yi Zihe's cousin.

593
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:02,379
I represented Yihua in the competition

594
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:03,899
but ended up being defeated by a Yi.

595
00:34:04,258 --> 00:34:06,779
Mr. Yi plays with feelings
and doesn't want to take responsibility.

596
00:34:06,938 --> 00:34:08,699
He teamed up with his cousin
to set me up.

597
00:34:08,978 --> 00:34:10,458
Everyone, take more videos.

598
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,458
Post them online for everyone to see

599
00:34:12,938 --> 00:34:15,418
the person promoted by the Yi Family

600
00:34:15,578 --> 00:34:16,739
by joining forces with the rival.

601
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:18,739
I have nothing to do
with the Yi Family you mentioned.

602
00:34:18,978 --> 00:34:20,538
Please everyone, stop filming.

603
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:21,618
Stop filming, please.

604
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:23,418
Stop filming, please.

605
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:23,978
What happened?

606
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,418
Don't film anymore.

607
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:25,978
Stop.

608
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:27,699
- Who told you to come?
- Put it away.

609
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,299
Delete it.

610
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,219
Put it away.

611
00:34:29,498 --> 00:34:30,739
Stop filming.

612
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:31,699
I said stop filming.

613
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,739
What Bu Ran? it's Yi Ran, right?

614
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:35,418
Someone like you, fishing for fame,

615
00:34:35,578 --> 00:34:36,819
don't deserve to have fans.

616
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:39,259
You should be writing an apology

617
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:40,299
to those who idolized you.

618
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:41,379
I've said it.

619
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:42,978
I am not a Yi.

620
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:44,859
Stop.

621
00:34:45,058 --> 00:34:46,418
Yihua's former president, Yi Minde,

622
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,538
is standing here.

623
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:49,659
Are you even going
to deny your own father?

624
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:51,418
We've met before.

625
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,739
We do know each other.

626
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,458
Chen Manni,

627
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,299
my daughter is right.

628
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:58,659
She has nothing to do with the Yi Family

629
00:34:59,018 --> 00:35:01,018
because I was cast out a long time ago.

630
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,819
You lost to Ran and are not convinced.

631
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:04,978
You might as well

632
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,458
let your work do the talking.

633
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:08,418
You all still have a long way to go.

634
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:09,618
Stop filming.

635
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:11,379
Everyone, please take more videos.

636
00:35:11,618 --> 00:35:13,018
This is the true face of the Yis.

637
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,299
When exposed,

638
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:15,538
they tried to deny any relation

639
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:16,699
and slip away.

640
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:18,299
Stop filming.

641
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:18,578
Stop.

642
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:19,458
Stop filming.

643
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:20,699
Move aside.

644
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:21,418
Stop filming.

645
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:22,058
Mom.

646
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:22,779
Mom.

647
00:35:23,018 --> 00:35:23,819
Mom, what's wrong?

648
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:24,819
Stop.

649
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:25,379
Dad.

650
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:27,179
- Mom, I'll help you inside.
- Huiyun.

651
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:28,978
Step aside, move!

652
00:35:28,978 --> 00:35:29,819
Move aside.

653
00:35:30,098 --> 00:35:31,098
Make way.

654
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:32,058
Step aside.

655
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:32,859
Make way.

656
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:34,699
Stop filming.

657
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:35,458
Move aside.

658
00:35:35,538 --> 00:35:36,138
Make way.

659
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,659
Well done, sweetheart.

660
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:45,339
Stop filming.

661
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:46,058
Stop filming.

662
00:35:49,498 --> 00:35:50,339
Your break-up fee.

663
00:36:02,379 --> 00:36:03,018
Qin Xun.

664
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:05,058
Thank you, Uncle.

665
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:07,859
I should thank you for helping Ran.

666
00:36:08,379 --> 00:36:09,018
You are welcome.

667
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,058
It's what I, as the fan leader,
should do.

668
00:36:20,259 --> 00:36:20,859
Mom,

669
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:22,699
are you okay?

670
00:36:24,618 --> 00:36:27,179
Ran, I'm fine.

671
00:36:27,578 --> 00:36:28,739
I feel much better now.

672
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:31,618
What happened today
was not a coincidence.

673
00:36:32,538 --> 00:36:33,978
Someone must have orchestrated it.

674
00:36:34,578 --> 00:36:35,259
Exactly.

675
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:36,779
You can tell

676
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:38,418
someone sent those fake fans.

677
00:36:39,138 --> 00:36:41,259
Chen Manni was also brought here
to intensify the conflict.

678
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:43,058
Whether Bu Ran is a Yi or not,

679
00:36:43,058 --> 00:36:44,498
they don't care at all.

680
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:45,299
The one behind

681
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:46,978
just wants to reveal your true identity.

682
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,418
Before I came back,

683
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:51,618
I saw the words
written on Mr. Lu's door,

684
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:52,899
which stated that I was a Yi.

685
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:54,498
I came too hastily

686
00:36:54,498 --> 00:36:55,659
and had no time to wipe them off.

687
00:36:56,138 --> 00:36:56,618
Could they

688
00:36:56,618 --> 00:36:57,899
want to tell Mr. Lu my identity?

689
00:36:58,578 --> 00:36:59,618
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

690
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,018
At this hour, Lu Cenyang should
still be at the company.

691
00:37:03,498 --> 00:37:04,538
Let's hurry back.

692
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:05,699
Is there still time?

693
00:37:05,899 --> 00:37:06,899
We have to take a chance.

694
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:07,779
But I...

695
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:09,899
Ran, your mom has me
to take care of her.

696
00:37:10,098 --> 00:37:11,779
You should go back with Qin Xun now.

697
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:12,899
Maybe it's not too late.

698
00:37:13,538 --> 00:37:14,259
Go.

699
00:37:14,418 --> 00:37:15,819
Uncle and Auntie, we're leaving.

700
00:37:15,978 --> 00:37:16,259
Okay.

701
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:17,259
Call me if you need.

702
00:37:19,418 --> 00:37:20,179
You're at home?

703
00:37:20,379 --> 00:37:22,458
I just passed by
and witnessed a big commotion.

704
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:26,299
