(It turns out I only think of Qin Xun)

22
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,195
(when I'm upset.)

23
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:59,354
(I shouldn't treat him
like my emotional trash can.)

24
00:02:07,354 --> 00:02:10,115
The most explosive news
on today's bidding site

25
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:12,754
is the video of Bu Ran
getting slapped by Ms. Hua.

26
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:15,914
I also heard
that Carry's sudden resignation

27
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:17,515
was also Bu Ran's doing.

28
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:19,314
It was her?

29
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:20,355
Of course, it was her.

30
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,075
What good do you think she is?

31
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:25,515
Mr. Lu doesn't like it
when colleagues talk about each other.

32
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:45,115
Yang,

33
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:48,395
do you have business
coming to the company so late?

34
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:52,194
I-I forgot my keys.

35
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:53,355
I've come back to get them.

36
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:55,835
Bu Ran finished the blueprints
for the ancient alley.

37
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:57,355
Be careful with your operations.

38
00:02:58,075 --> 00:02:59,795
I don't know if she saved it.

39
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:02,675
Okay, I know.

40
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:10,835
You took leave

41
00:03:10,995 --> 00:03:11,714
to do another set

42
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:13,115
of blueprints behind my back?

43
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:15,154
With what we learned
from the orphanage incident,

44
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:17,194
it was natural for me
to make an extra set

45
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:18,515
of alternative plans.

46
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:19,995
So you suspect

47
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:21,795
that it was Bu Ran
who leaked the blueprints?

48
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:25,194
I can only say what happened today
was an accident.

49
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:27,275
I simply asked Chen Manni

50
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:28,874
to innovate on Bu Ran's version.

51
00:03:29,235 --> 00:03:31,034
This could indeed
increase the odds of winning.

52
00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:32,555
Ultimately,

53
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:34,675
it was Yihua that embarrassed Bu Ran.

54
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:35,714
Not Pinshang.

55
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:36,754
And certainly not me.

56
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:38,154
Yes.

57
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:39,754
Today, you had the foresight

58
00:03:39,874 --> 00:03:41,115
to turn the tide for the company.

59
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:42,634
But we have so many designers.

60
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:43,795
Even if you distrust Bu Ran,

61
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:45,115
why did you turn to Chen Manni?

62
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:47,355
Cease all collaborations
with Chen Manni.

63
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:52,154
As you started the company,

64
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:54,395
you said those of us
in the architecture industry

65
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:56,634
should always put the designers first.

66
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:58,395
Yet today, for Bu Ran's sake,

67
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:00,355
we have to turn away
such an excellent designer

68
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:01,474
as Chen Manni.

69
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:04,034
Mr. Lu,

70
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:05,634
you never used to

71
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:07,355
act so impulsively as you are now.

72
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:10,555
With such a big mistake,

73
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:11,914
don't you suspect Bu Ran at all?

74
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:13,555
Why do you want me to suspect her?

75
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:14,675
Do you expect me

76
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:16,754
to suspect that she leaked
the blueprints to Yihua?

77
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:18,355
We have known her for a long time.

78
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:19,595
She isn't that kind of person.

79
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:21,915
Fine, then you tell me.

80
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:25,314
Who did it?

81
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:36,795
So you had guessed it all along.

82
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:42,834
Why did you do that?

83
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:47,314
To drive Bu Ran out of Pinshang.

84
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:49,155
She is from the Yi family.

85
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:50,514
She shouldn't stay here.

86
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:52,235
You're being completely unreasonable.

87
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:03,754
Siqi has lost her memory.

88
00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:07,555
But you might still remember

89
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:13,434
how Siqi got injured.

90
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:22,475
Dad jumped down from upstairs back then.

91
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:24,874
When I arrived at the scene,

92
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:27,754
I didn't react immediately.

93
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:30,514
I didn't notice a car coming towards me.

94
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:33,274
It was you who pushed me away.

95
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:36,074
You got this scar

96
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:38,915
because you got hurt in my place.

97
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:44,995
Do you remember anything now?

98
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:49,555
No.

99
00:05:51,314 --> 00:05:52,954
Since you remember so clearly,

100
00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:56,634
you must not let Siqi down, right?

101
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:01,235
Even if the person standing
in front of me today were Siqi,

102
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:03,475
my attitude would be the same.

103
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:27,954
Here are my little building blocks.

104
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:29,394
Thank you.

105
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,115
Here you are.

106
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:33,155
And mine too.

107
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:43,235
What a coincidence!

108
00:06:44,074 --> 00:06:44,874
Not really.

109
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,675
I saw you pass by my shop.

110
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:49,715
You clearly wanted to see me,
but you didn't get in.

111
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:51,834
I thought you must have something
on your mind.

112
00:06:53,155 --> 00:06:54,434
You followed me here?

113
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:55,754
You are impressive.

114
00:06:57,715 --> 00:06:58,754
Did you get wronged?

115
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:01,595
It's nothing.

116
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:03,595
I have survived the Yi family.

117
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:05,434
I'm not someone who gets wronged easily.

118
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:10,074
There's just a little issue at work.

119
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:11,595
I need to reflect a bit.

120
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:14,754
You've come to see the kids.

121
00:07:15,155 --> 00:07:16,634
It couldn't be a little issue.

122
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:19,355
It's been a long time
since I've seen the kids.

123
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:21,514
Being with them

124
00:07:21,915 --> 00:07:23,155
makes me feel particularly at ease.

125
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:24,274
I even danced,

126
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:26,355
making up for the lack of exercise.

127
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:27,675
Don't hide it.

128
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,035
The kids can only heal your mood.

129
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:31,355
They can't solve the problem.

130
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:33,394
You should have told me.

131
00:07:33,595 --> 00:07:35,475
An advisor who doesn't receive orders
for a long time

132
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:36,954
will get rusty.

133
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:39,754
That makes sense.

134
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:41,555
Actually, I do need you for something.

135
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:42,874
Find out

136
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:45,434
who leaked my blueprints to Yihua.

137
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:47,795
Okay. What about the reward?

138
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:50,634
I'll have my mom make

139
00:07:50,715 --> 00:07:52,795
the world's most delicious
sweet and sour pork for you.

140
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:54,754
Deal.

141
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:55,595
Then

142
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:57,394
you go investigate.
I'll have my mom get ready.

143
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:58,834
Let's split up to increase efficiency.

144
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:01,235
Okay, fine.

145
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:03,155
I must have owed you in a past life.

146
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:28,555
Here.

147
00:08:30,995 --> 00:08:31,834
I've been busy all day.

148
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:33,195
Being able to eat the food you made

149
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:34,195
is simply fantastic.

150
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:35,754
Come on.

151
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:37,274
If you like it, eat more.

152
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:38,235
Thank you.

153
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:41,115
She has just recovered from her illness.

154
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:42,514
As soon as she saw you,

155
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:44,235
she immediately had the energy to cook.

156
00:08:44,595 --> 00:08:45,514
Thank you.

157
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,634
But you came alone this time.

158
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:50,274
Did you have a fight with Ran?

159
00:08:52,154 --> 00:08:52,754
Yes.

160
00:08:53,235 --> 00:08:55,715
That's why I came
to seek help from both of you.

161
00:08:58,355 --> 00:08:59,435
You're quite frank.

162
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:02,475
I think before making Bu Ran believe me,

163
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:04,235
it's necessary to first gain your trust,

164
00:09:04,514 --> 00:09:05,634
Mr. and Mrs. Yi.

165
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:08,715
My wife is swayed by good looks.

166
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:12,874
Seeing a handsome guy like you,
she'll certainly be easy to talk to.

167
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:16,475
Cenyang, to be honest with you,

168
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:18,715
when we knew Ran went to Pinshang,

169
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:21,554
we had once warned her
not to fall for you.

170
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:24,674
Of course, it wasn't because
we distrusted your character.

171
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,794
It's just that there are

172
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:30,274
too many misunderstandings
and hurt feelings between our families.

173
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,274
However, it's quite comforting that Ran

174
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:34,835
can learn something from you.

175
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:36,874
Mrs. Yi, rest assured,

176
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:39,754
I will definitely not let Bu Ran
suffer any harm.

177
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,034
Between her and me,

178
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:44,435
it was I who fell for her first.

179
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,674
She is the most sincere,

180
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:51,315
the kindest, and the bravest person

181
00:09:51,955 --> 00:09:52,835
among the people I've met.

182
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:56,154
Today, at the renovation bid
for the ancient alley,

183
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:58,034
we competed fiercely with Yihua,

184
00:09:58,394 --> 00:10:00,315
and many side issues
occurred in the process.

185
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:02,115
But the one thing I am certain of

186
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:03,754
is that Bu Ran won't be used by Ms. Hua.

187
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:06,595
After all, she is your daughter, Mr. Yi.

188
00:10:07,235 --> 00:10:09,874
And she's the only daughter-in-law
my father ever approved of.

189
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:12,274
Cenyang,

190
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:14,835
you should know

191
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,274
that your father's death

192
00:10:17,435 --> 00:10:18,754
had an inseparable connection with me.

193
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:20,874
I want to know

194
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,195
how you could come to forgive me.

195
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:25,674
Mr. Yi,

196
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:28,355
it was you who made
those anonymous warning calls,

197
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:29,715
right?

198
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:32,075
You already know?

199
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:35,394
Those things are easy
to find out if I wish to.

200
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:36,835
Over these years,

201
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:39,554
I've also been trying to understand
what happened back then.

202
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:40,914
Seven years ago,

203
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,995
you advocated for the merger
of the two companies,

204
00:10:43,154 --> 00:10:44,794
utilizing Yihua's financial advantage

205
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:46,394
and the Lu family's project superiority

206
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:48,195
to join hands
through the industry's winter.

207
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,195
But someone introduced
harsh cost control standards

208
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:53,595
into the confirmed contract.

209
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:55,595
You know,

210
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:57,955
my father had an excessive pursuit
of details.

211
00:10:58,315 --> 00:10:59,595
And they deliberately provoked him.

212
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:02,715
If he wanted to breach the contract,
he could only turn to you,

213
00:11:03,075 --> 00:11:05,034
and you resigned at the crucial moment.

214
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:06,955
Later on, the Lus

215
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,874
were sued for a high amount
of damages for breach of contract.

216
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:14,195
I originally intended
to use my own resignation

217
00:11:14,595 --> 00:11:15,674
to force Yihua to back down,

218
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:17,554
but as a result,

219
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:22,595
I have been separated from my family
for seven years.

220
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:29,235
And what's more unexpected is that

221
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:35,075
Mingyu didn't want
to be coerced by Yihua

222
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:37,794
and was forced to end his life.

223
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:41,715
Regarding this,

224
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:45,835
I am filled with regret and guilt.

225
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:54,754
Cenyang,

226
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:59,595
Ran and your father
are the same kind of people.

227
00:12:00,355 --> 00:12:03,154
They only think about doing things well.

228
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:04,995
I can

229
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:07,315
guarantee my life on that.

230
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:11,274
Mr. Yi,

231
00:12:12,034 --> 00:12:12,754
please rest assured.

232
00:12:13,195 --> 00:12:14,794
Even if you
don't say these things today,

233
00:12:14,955 --> 00:12:16,715
I would never doubt Bu Ran.

234
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:18,394
Otherwise,

235
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:20,394
I wouldn't come here for a meal.

236
00:12:20,794 --> 00:12:22,595
We all know Ms. Hua's schemes.

237
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:24,235
If I let Bu Ran down,

238
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:26,315
she would instigate you to deal with me.

239
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:27,554
So...

240
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:28,874
That is not possible.

241
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:31,075
We won't become those kinds of people.

242
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:32,835
Mrs. Yi, please rest assured.

243
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:34,394
To take down the Yi Family,

244
00:12:34,595 --> 00:12:36,715
given Yi Mincai
and Yi Zihe's capacities,

245
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:37,955
I could've used them

246
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:39,674
to make Ms. Hua doubt her life long ago.

247
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,394
The reason I didn't do that

248
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,874
is because I don't want
to become like Ms. Hua.

249
00:12:45,394 --> 00:12:46,514
If the Yi family falls,

250
00:12:47,195 --> 00:12:49,955
it will implicate
countless employees and customers.

251
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:52,835
I don't want
the tragedy of the Lu family

252
00:12:53,154 --> 00:12:54,554
to be repeated by others.

253
00:12:57,034 --> 00:12:58,075
Aren't you afraid

254
00:12:58,394 --> 00:12:59,475
the Yi family will retaliate

255
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:01,475
because you're soft-hearted?

256
00:13:03,674 --> 00:13:04,955
Being softhearted is not my weakness,

257
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:07,914
but the reason I hone myself
to become stronger.

258
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,274
I will become strong enough
to change Yihua's business philosophy.

259
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:13,394
As I have Bu Ran

260
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:15,034
and the support of you both,

261
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:16,595
I am very confident.

262
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:21,394
Today's accident

263
00:13:22,274 --> 00:13:23,874
serves as a reminder for me.

264
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:26,634
I should not allow Bu Ran
to be vulnerable to blackmail.

265
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:31,554
Mrs. Yi,

266
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:34,794
I will take care
of all your future treatments.

267
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:40,754
We can't hide anything from you.

268
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:43,195
Don't worry about Ran.

269
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,554
We won't let outsiders
come between you two.

270
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:56,835
Mr. Yi,

271
00:13:58,315 --> 00:13:59,995
actually, I can't find Bu Ran.

272
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:03,514
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come
to you looking for a solution.

273
00:14:05,754 --> 00:14:08,034
Can you ask Bu Ran where she is?

274
00:14:08,754 --> 00:14:09,955
I'm really worried about her.

275
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:12,195
Okay.

276
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:22,514
I haven't found any concrete evidence
on my end.

277
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:23,595
But I think

278
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:25,634
Carry also used to work for Yihua.

279
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:26,674
After she left,

280
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:27,874
is it possible

281
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:29,075
that someone from your company

282
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:31,195
who was close to her
has taken over her role?

283
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:42,355
You're here.

284
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:42,995
Bu Ran.

285
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,435
It's pretty clear
that she betrayed the company.

286
00:14:45,874 --> 00:14:47,315
Yet Mr. Lu has always favored her.

287
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,595
I have no idea
what tricks Bu Ran has used.

288
00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:51,475
If she has any self-respect,

289
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:53,794
it would be best for her
to leave the company quietly.

290
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:56,475
Thinking about having to work with her

291
00:14:56,754 --> 00:14:57,995
is simply unbearable.

292
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:58,955
Yang,

293
00:14:59,435 --> 00:15:01,475
how do you know
that Mr. Lu is favoring me?

294
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:04,235
The video of you getting slapped
by Ms. Hua has been posted online.

295
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:06,914
And your conversation is very clear.

296
00:15:07,195 --> 00:15:08,315
What else can you argue about?

297
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,674
Did you hear clearly what Ms. Hua said?

298
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:13,154
Ms. Hua said

299
00:15:13,394 --> 00:15:15,595
that if I sold out Yihua,
she would not forgive me.

300
00:15:15,754 --> 00:15:17,754
In other words, her attempt
to buy me out was unsuccessful.

301
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:19,195
Mr. Lu knows the full story.

302
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:20,754
And that's why he believes
in my loyalty.

303
00:15:20,874 --> 00:15:22,595
Yet you continue to gossip here

304
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:23,835
and talk about favoritism.

305
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:25,514
That's right.

306
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:29,634
Favoritism means

307
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,634
he knows I'm wrong
and still covers for me.

308
00:15:31,754 --> 00:15:33,674
But the video has already proven
I'm not wrong.

309
00:15:33,794 --> 00:15:35,634
So why do you
insist on saying I'm wrong?

310
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:39,355
Only the guilty
call out 'Catch the thief'.

311
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:43,315
It couldn't be you
who stole the blueprints, could it?

312
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:45,235
Nonsense!

313
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:47,595
Last Saturday,
I saw you sneaking into the company

314
00:15:47,754 --> 00:15:49,034
with my own eyes.

315
00:15:49,154 --> 00:15:50,235
You even turned on the computer.

316
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:51,514
You were stealing the design.

317
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:53,634
I drew all the blueprints.

318
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:55,674
Do I need to sneak around on a Saturday

319
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:57,394
to steal them from the company computer?

320
00:15:58,195 --> 00:15:59,315
You remember the time, location,

321
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:00,475
and what I did so clearly.

322
00:16:00,674 --> 00:16:02,315
I think you're the one who stole them.

323
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:03,075
You!

324
00:16:03,154 --> 00:16:03,794
By the way,

325
00:16:04,514 --> 00:16:06,394
there is no surveillance
in the design department,

326
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,754
but the surveillance at the entrance

327
00:16:08,874 --> 00:16:10,955
can tell us how long
you stayed at the company.

328
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:12,034
Stop falsely accusing me!

329
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,154
Before there is substantial evidence,

330
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:15,634
none should make unfounded remarks.

331
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:18,475
Are you all so idle?

332
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:19,754
Go back to work.

333
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:27,235
Ms. Yao,

334
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:28,715
how did you know Yihua would

335
00:16:28,874 --> 00:16:29,835
steal my blueprints?

336
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,595
And you even prepared a second set
in advance.

337
00:16:32,195 --> 00:16:33,955
Because I am clear about your identity,

338
00:16:34,715 --> 00:16:36,154
as the secretary of Pinshang,

339
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,595
I have reason to suspect anyone
from the Yi family.

340
00:16:38,754 --> 00:16:40,435
So you chose Chen Manni

341
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:41,674
just to upset me

342
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,034
and turn me against Mr. Lu, right?

343
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:44,195
Bu Ran,

344
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:46,914
everything I did was for the company.

345
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:49,634
As for what you think,
that's your business.

346
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:52,235
By the way,

347
00:16:52,754 --> 00:16:54,995
Mr. Lu hasn't come to the office today.

348
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:56,355
If you want to complain,

349
00:16:56,835 --> 00:16:57,794
go home and do it.

350
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,794
You are here. Have a seat.

351
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:15,264
(CEO Meng Kexin)

352
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:18,635
What are you doing?

353
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:21,114
I had someone steal the blueprints.

354
00:17:21,794 --> 00:17:22,715
So what?

355
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:29,635
Mom should be very clear now

356
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:32,995
about who is more important
between you and me.

357
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:35,995
I am now the CEO of Yihua,

358
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:38,435
responsible for the company's
overall operations.

359
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:42,195
But I spoke well of you to Mom.

360
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:43,955
You can have my old office.

361
00:17:44,514 --> 00:17:47,155
You are now the office director of Yihua

362
00:17:47,514 --> 00:17:48,435
for internal affairs.

363
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:50,794
You wench!

364
00:17:51,074 --> 00:17:52,554
You're even stealing
your husband's thunder.

365
00:17:53,514 --> 00:17:54,675
I took this position

366
00:17:54,995 --> 00:17:56,074
all for Zihe.

367
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:58,675
You'd better work with me

368
00:17:59,074 --> 00:18:00,195
and do your best.

369
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:06,030
(CEO Yi Mincai)

370
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:29,475
Hello?

371
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:33,915
I've given you the money.

372
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:35,435
How dare you ask me for more?

373
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:43,514
Where are you?

374
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:46,715
Wait for me.

375
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:52,955
Leave and lay low.

376
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:54,995
Don't call me again.

377
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:55,995
Okay.

378
00:18:56,155 --> 00:18:56,834
Mr. Yi,

379
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:00,875
you met with my employee secretly.

380
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:02,114
It was you

381
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,475
who made her steal the blueprints

382
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:04,554
from my company, right?

383
00:19:05,754 --> 00:19:06,794
What stealing of plans?

384
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:09,675
We're having an affair.

385
00:19:11,114 --> 00:19:11,794
Mr. Yi.

386
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:14,435
Nowadays, you can even
have an affair so openly?

387
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:16,034
That's truly admirable.

388
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:17,635
Yang,

389
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:19,834
if I disclose what happened
between you and Mr. Yi

390
00:19:19,995 --> 00:19:21,114
to his wife,

391
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,354
do you know the consequences
of offending the Meng family?

392
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:25,754
Mr. Lu.

393
00:19:26,274 --> 00:19:27,274
Mr. Lu, I was wrong.

394
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:28,435
Please spare me.

395
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:32,395
That depends on what Mr. Yi's stance is.

396
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:33,395
Mr. Yi,

397
00:19:33,754 --> 00:19:34,955
let's make a deal.

398
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:36,475
If you promise me

399
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:38,834
that you won't make things hard
for Yi Minde and his family anymore,

400
00:19:39,114 --> 00:19:40,675
I won't hold your bribing of Yang

401
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:41,354
against you.

402
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,955
We'll record a verbal guarantee
and call it a deal.

403
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:49,834
M-Mr. Yi,

404
00:19:50,074 --> 00:19:51,235
I don't want this money anymore.

405
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:52,754
Please let Mr. Lu spare me.

406
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:57,235
Mr. Lu,

407
00:19:57,834 --> 00:20:00,074
actually, I was very hesitant
at the time.

408
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:01,435
I didn't want to do that.

409
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:02,395
If...

410
00:20:02,594 --> 00:20:04,395
If it weren't for Ms. Yao
reminding me at that time,

411
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:05,554
- I...
- That doesn't matter.

412
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:06,875
I only care about now.

413
00:20:07,475 --> 00:20:08,475
If Mr. Yi doesn't agree,

414
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:11,034
Yang, as long as you agree
to be my witness,

415
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:11,955
I'll still let you go.

416
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:14,794
Lu Cenyang,

417
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:16,675
I agree.

418
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:24,875
I, Yi Mincai, assure you

419
00:20:25,514 --> 00:20:27,554
that I will no longer pick
on the Yi Minde family.

420
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:28,915
Or else what?

421
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:31,034
You have plenty of ways to deal with me.

422
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:33,274
So what need is there for 'or else'?

423
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:42,554
M-Mr. Lu,

424
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,435
I-I will resign right now.

425
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,155
And I promise
never to speak ill of Bu Ran again.

426
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,155
Please spare me.

427
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,594
I want to marry my boyfriend.

428
00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:53,235
But my boyfriend is average.

429
00:20:53,594 --> 00:20:54,715
And my family is against it.

430
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,554
I want to seize love.

431
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,995
That's why I took the risk
of taking Yi Mincai's money.

432
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:00,395
Love is important.

433
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:03,034
But you caused a misunderstanding
between Bu Ran and me.

434
00:21:03,314 --> 00:21:04,034
How do we reckon it?

435
00:21:04,715 --> 00:21:05,594
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

436
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:09,114
I wish you and Bu Ran all sweetness

437
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:10,274
and happiness forever.

438
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:12,514
Please spare me this once.

439
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:17,955
She spoke to my heart.

440
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:19,475
You decide.

441
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:23,074
Yang,

442
00:21:23,554 --> 00:21:26,074
take back your blessings and leave.

443
00:21:27,794 --> 00:21:28,354
Wait.

444
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,274
Her blessings are quite nice.

445
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:31,354
Why take them back?

446
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:32,475
You really have a way.

447
00:21:32,715 --> 00:21:33,834
I simply suspected Yang.

448
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:35,715
Yet you specifically followed her here.

449
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,114
If you want to express gratitude,

450
00:21:38,274 --> 00:21:39,354
just say it.

451
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:41,794
I did it to help clear you
of the suspicion

452
00:21:41,955 --> 00:21:43,155
of betraying the company.

453
00:21:43,314 --> 00:21:44,915
My suspicion has been cleared.

454
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:46,354
But the company's actions

455
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:48,475
have left a designer,
who's been loyal to you,

456
00:21:48,635 --> 00:21:49,395
disheartened.

457
00:21:50,635 --> 00:21:51,834
Wait, the car is over there.

458
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:53,034
No, thank you.

459
00:21:56,155 --> 00:21:56,915
Are you still mad?

460
00:21:57,915 --> 00:21:59,915
Ms. Yao's actions did put you
in a difficult position.

461
00:22:00,274 --> 00:22:01,354
I apologize for her.

462
00:22:02,074 --> 00:22:03,915
You don't need to apologize
for her behavior.

463
00:22:04,635 --> 00:22:05,475
I just want to know

464
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:07,955
if it was your idea for her
to do the second set of plans.

465
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:09,235
Of course not.

466
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:12,675
And you didn't choose Chen Manni?

467
00:22:13,675 --> 00:22:14,554
Isn't that obvious?

468
00:22:14,995 --> 00:22:16,235
I already told Ms. Yao

469
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:18,114
to terminate the collaboration
with Chen Manni.

470
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:20,594
There's no need for that.

471
00:22:21,554 --> 00:22:23,675
After all, the design in the bid
was drawn by her.

472
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,794
But that was an adjustment
based on your groundwork.

473
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:27,995
If it weren't
for your all-night work earlier,

474
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:30,155
they wouldn't have finished

475
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:31,715
such complex blueprints
so quickly later.

476
00:22:34,314 --> 00:22:35,155
Are you still mad?

477
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:37,834
Not really.

478
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:40,475
I just feel a bit uncomfortable inside.

479
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:42,754
Business competition is no child's play.

480
00:22:43,314 --> 00:22:45,074
Ms. Yao was considering
the company's interests.

481
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:46,034
And I can understand.

482
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:48,354
After all, my identity is special.

483
00:22:51,314 --> 00:22:52,594
Don't worry about your identity.

484
00:22:53,314 --> 00:22:53,955
Your identity

485
00:22:54,114 --> 00:22:55,475
doesn't matter to me at all.

486
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,155
All I care about

487
00:22:57,594 --> 00:22:59,114
is that you are you.

488
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:04,435
If you're still feeling uncomfortable,

489
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:05,794
I'll take you

490
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,354
to a place where I usually
relax and unwind.

491
00:23:08,435 --> 00:23:10,915
If it's singing,
foot baths, or massages,

492
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:11,915
I will pass.

493
00:23:12,395 --> 00:23:12,995
It's too tacky.

494
00:23:14,074 --> 00:23:14,995
Bu Ran,

495
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:16,995
is that the image
you have of me in your heart?

496
00:23:19,718 --> 00:23:23,246
♪We sleep under the most beautiful sky♪

497
00:23:24,754 --> 00:23:26,475
Let's go. It's really fun.

498
00:23:27,235 --> 00:23:28,034
Come on!

499
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:41,794
It's 25 yuan for each net.

500
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:42,594
Alright.

501
00:23:44,594 --> 00:23:45,235
Hello.

502
00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:48,435
This is a game for kids.

503
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:49,554
You want me to play this?

504
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:50,675
I want to play too.

505
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:56,955
What? Do you feel embarrassed?

506
00:23:58,955 --> 00:24:00,235
So you brought me here

507
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:01,754
to toughen up my spirit, huh?

508
00:24:02,235 --> 00:24:04,074
If you feel uncomfortable
using Chen Manni's

509
00:24:04,274 --> 00:24:04,995
design,

510
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:06,274
you should toughen up

511
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:07,675
your own inner strength.

512
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:09,594
Let me show you my special skill.

513
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:17,475
How about that?

514
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:24,235
Don't mind how others see you.
Just focus on catching fish.

515
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:33,475
Kido, let's have a competition.

516
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:35,754
Look, I caught another one.

517
00:24:37,995 --> 00:24:39,195
Having you by my side,

518
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,274
I feel like my luck is better today.

519
00:24:48,314 --> 00:24:49,875
You just touched it, and my net broke.

520
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:51,114
Our auras do not align.

521
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:55,635
Come on.

522
00:24:57,074 --> 00:24:57,915
Have another one.

523
00:25:10,314 --> 00:25:10,955
See?

524
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:13,594
By working together,

525
00:25:13,754 --> 00:25:15,395
our might is doubled.

526
00:25:17,955 --> 00:25:18,834
Over here.

527
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:20,554
Another one.

528
00:25:22,594 --> 00:25:24,635
Let go. I'll play on my own.

529
00:25:28,915 --> 00:25:30,875
You've been wronged the most today.

530
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:33,155
So, you can do whatever you want.

531
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:36,435
Have you really never doubted me?

532
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:37,195
Never.

533
00:25:38,435 --> 00:25:40,074
We've agreed to trust each other.

534
00:25:40,675 --> 00:25:41,635
After the incident,

535
00:25:41,794 --> 00:25:42,995
the only thing I worried about

536
00:25:43,274 --> 00:25:44,235
was that you would avoid me.

537
00:25:44,514 --> 00:25:46,074
That's why I ran to your home

538
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:47,395
to ask your parents for help.

539
00:25:48,274 --> 00:25:49,794
You seemed
to have asked the wrong people.

540
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:51,635
They haven't even made a single call

541
00:25:51,794 --> 00:25:52,715
to speak well of you.

542
00:25:53,195 --> 00:25:54,034
That's because

543
00:25:54,235 --> 00:25:56,395
they trust the relationship between us.

544
00:25:57,235 --> 00:25:58,235
Don't get too cocky.

545
00:26:00,635 --> 00:26:02,114
Then, let's have a competition

546
00:26:02,314 --> 00:26:04,074
to see who catches more fish today.

547
00:26:04,235 --> 00:26:05,314
If you catch more than me,

548
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:07,235
I'll let you
join the ancient alley's renovation.

549
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:08,155
Okay.

550
00:26:08,715 --> 00:26:09,995
Then I'll show you

551
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,915
whether my heart is strong enough.

552
00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:19,435
I forgot to tell you.

553
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:21,395
To earn the tuition for studying abroad,

554
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:23,955
I used to run a fish-catching stall.

555
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:25,915
Impressive.

556
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:30,819
♪I really want to take you
to the castle♪

557
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:35,372
♪I hope you don't easily
reject my invitation♪

558
00:26:35,372 --> 00:26:37,955
♪Without any other disturbances♪

559
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:38,554
Watch out.

560
00:26:40,992 --> 00:26:44,809
♪Let the castle be surrounded by love♪

561
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:53,554
Son,

562
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:54,995
what are you doing?

563
00:26:58,475 --> 00:26:59,435
Picking up girls.

564
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:00,675
All you know is that.

565
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,034
Do something serious.

566
00:27:02,195 --> 00:27:03,635
Mom has already told me

567
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,195
that you've been reinstated.

568
00:27:05,675 --> 00:27:07,475
But grandma gave you the chance
because she lost again

569
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:08,235
to Pinshang

570
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:09,354
and had no one else to use.

571
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:10,354
Dad,

572
00:27:11,034 --> 00:27:11,915
you need to work hard.

573
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:13,274
You brat!

574
00:27:13,594 --> 00:27:14,834
You're lecturing your dad now, huh?

575
00:27:15,475 --> 00:27:16,354
Do I need your lecturing?

576
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:20,594
I'm only responsible
for the internal affairs now.

577
00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:24,475
I can't directly confront Lu Cenyang.

578
00:27:27,034 --> 00:27:29,754
So I will have to borrow your hands.

579
00:27:31,155 --> 00:27:32,754
But I need to pursue Yao Lefei.

580
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:34,114
I don't have time for you.

581
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:36,635
Why her?

582
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:38,915
She is Lu Cenyang's secretary.

583
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,114
However,

584
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:46,995
it's not like it's impossible.

585
00:27:47,794 --> 00:27:48,834
Have you ever thought

586
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:50,314
that with Lu Cenyang in the way,

587
00:27:50,554 --> 00:27:51,794
you won't have an opportunity?

588
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:54,155
So you need to cause some trouble
for Lu Cenyang

589
00:27:54,554 --> 00:27:55,675
to keep him busy.

590
00:27:57,354 --> 00:27:59,354
Dad, do you have any ideas?

591
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:03,754
I've looked at Pinshang's proposal.

592
00:28:04,435 --> 00:28:07,195
They demand that the ancient alley
be restored to its original state.

593
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:08,635
The residents

594
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:11,235
are already sick
of those dilapidated houses.

595
00:28:11,514 --> 00:28:14,034
They want to take this chance
to build tall buildings.

596
00:28:15,354 --> 00:28:16,235
We, on the other hand,

597
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:18,514
should stir up their emotions

598
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,235
and encourage them to protest.

599
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:25,955
Lu Cenyang wouldn't dare
to be assertive with them, would he?

600
00:28:28,395 --> 00:28:30,034
Bribing a few residents
wouldn't be hard.

601
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:31,114
But

602
00:28:32,155 --> 00:28:33,514
I'm out of money now.

603
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:36,995
I have some.

604
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:38,435
I'll give it to you.

605
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:43,155
I told you to rest for a few days,

606
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:44,195
but you came too.

607
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:45,915
Ms. Wang invited me to eat.

608
00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:47,274
And you came uninvited.

609
00:28:47,754 --> 00:28:49,074
You think I'm a burden?

610
00:28:50,514 --> 00:28:51,955
You've prepared hangover medicine
and filled

611
00:28:52,635 --> 00:28:53,955
the thermos with honey water, right?

612
00:28:54,155 --> 00:28:55,475
You followed me here because you knew

613
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:56,514
why I came.

614
00:28:57,594 --> 00:28:59,114
It's your work time.
And yet, you came here.

615
00:28:59,314 --> 00:29:01,155
There must be a problem
with the ancient alley project.

616
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:02,995
And Ms. Wang is hosting. It means

617
00:29:03,195 --> 00:29:04,635
that you are negotiating
with the residents.

618
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,155
Drinking will be involved.

619
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:09,155
It's worth bringing you along
since you've guessed so much.

620
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:11,034
It's not a big deal.

621
00:29:11,594 --> 00:29:13,635
Some residents disagree
with our choice to use old materials

622
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,274
to preserve the cultural charm

623
00:29:15,475 --> 00:29:16,834
of the ancient alley.

624
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,195
We'll have a meal with them

625
00:29:19,395 --> 00:29:20,554
and explain our design philosophy

626
00:29:20,554 --> 00:29:21,635
to them

627
00:29:22,114 --> 00:29:24,155
so that we can feel a bit closer
to each other.

628
00:29:24,435 --> 00:29:26,074
It won't be an easy meal.

629
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,635
If there's something like this again,
remember to bring me.

630
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:30,514
Or you're treating me like an outsider.

631
00:29:31,794 --> 00:29:33,354
I'm not treating you like an outsider.

632
00:29:33,715 --> 00:29:35,195
How about I take care of the drinking

633
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:36,834
and you drive me home later?

634
00:29:37,034 --> 00:29:38,514
Remember not to drink a drop of alcohol.

635
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:53,635
(They don't seem to be)

636
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:56,435
(the type that we
can easily get close to.)

637
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:57,074
(It's alright.)

638
00:29:57,074 --> 00:29:58,675
(If we get into a fight, I have you.)

639
00:29:59,475 --> 00:30:00,314
(If you get drunk later,)

640
00:30:00,475 --> 00:30:01,475
(you go back on your own.)

641
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:06,715
Gentlemen, let me pour the wine for you.

642
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:15,155
Mr. Lu,

643
00:30:16,074 --> 00:30:17,034
we

644
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:19,834
have lived in this alley for years.

645
00:30:20,074 --> 00:30:20,915
The truth is,

646
00:30:21,114 --> 00:30:21,875
we've long been tired

647
00:30:22,074 --> 00:30:24,074
of these decrepit houses
with their broken tiles.

648
00:30:24,675 --> 00:30:25,675
The renovation

649
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:28,074
of the alley is meant to serve us.

650
00:30:28,235 --> 00:30:28,834
Yes.

651
00:30:29,675 --> 00:30:31,514
Most of the young men who have stayed

652
00:30:31,715 --> 00:30:32,875
in this alley

653
00:30:33,274 --> 00:30:34,675
aren't even married yet.

654
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:35,594
That's right.

655
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:36,594
Why is that?

656
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,794
It's because the women
despised our poverty.

657
00:30:38,995 --> 00:30:40,715
We do not even have a decent place.

658
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:42,675
Marrying us would mean
a life of hardship.

659
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:44,155
At least now there's an opportunity.

660
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:46,594
So, in terms of building materials,

661
00:30:47,354 --> 00:30:49,354
you must use the new types,

662
00:30:50,395 --> 00:30:51,754
and they need to be eco-friendly.

663
00:30:52,114 --> 00:30:52,635
Right.

664
00:30:53,074 --> 00:30:54,195
Mr. Lu, the thing is,

665
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:56,235
we didn't want to trouble you too much.

666
00:30:56,435 --> 00:30:57,834
We want our places
to be like what's on TV:

667
00:30:58,514 --> 00:30:59,955
a bit more upscale, spacious,

668
00:31:00,114 --> 00:31:00,834
and attractive.

669
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:02,395
And that's enough.

670
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,915
Don't leave us with something old

671
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:05,034
by spending all the money,

672
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:05,794
manpower,

673
00:31:05,955 --> 00:31:07,754
and resources. It will be meaningless.

674
00:31:07,955 --> 00:31:08,354
Right?

675
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:09,875
Mr. Lu, you wouldn't want to see us

676
00:31:10,074 --> 00:31:11,354
remain single for life, would you?

677
00:31:12,274 --> 00:31:13,235
Exactly.

678
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:23,875
I have no ill intent.

679
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:26,435
I know you often come for acupuncture.

680
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:28,074
I want to keep you company.

681
00:31:29,114 --> 00:31:30,514
I'm serious about pursuing you.

682
00:31:32,195 --> 00:31:33,514
What joke are you making?

683
00:31:33,955 --> 00:31:36,235
I simply helped you out at the bar.

684
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,354
And you fell for me?

685
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:39,435
That's ridiculous.

686
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:42,235
It has always been me
stepping in for women.

687
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:44,435
It's the first time a woman
has helped me out.

688
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,435
Who else would I fall for?

689
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,715
Love is mutual.

690
00:31:48,955 --> 00:31:51,354
And I find you extremely repulsive.

691
00:31:53,195 --> 00:31:54,314
You just work for Lu Cenyang.

692
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:55,635
No need to distinguish the factions.

693
00:31:55,754 --> 00:31:57,235
You can quit your job
and let me support you.

694
00:31:57,554 --> 00:31:58,354
If you want to work,

695
00:31:58,514 --> 00:31:59,635
we can open a family-run shop.

696
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:01,514
Still no?

697
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:02,514
Do you like Lu Cenyang?

698
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:04,514
Shut up.

699
00:32:05,114 --> 00:32:06,475
If you like Lu Cenyang, just give it up.

700
00:32:06,554 --> 00:32:07,435
He won't dump Bu Ran.

701
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:08,034
Listen.

702
00:32:08,155 --> 00:32:08,834
He announced

703
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:09,754
that she is his girlfriend,

704
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,195
and he still loves her even knowing

705
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:11,875
she is a Yi.

706
00:32:12,034 --> 00:32:13,114
He disregards even Pinshang.

707
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:13,715
And you?

708
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:15,114
He has never fallen for you.

709
00:32:15,314 --> 00:32:17,114
You're just a secretary to him.

710
00:32:19,475 --> 00:32:20,034
Here.

711
00:32:21,995 --> 00:32:23,274
You all know Mr. Lu.

712
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:25,074
And this

713
00:32:25,274 --> 00:32:28,314
is Bu Ran, the designer
who renovated my house.

714
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:29,354
Look.

715
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:32,074
How beautifully my house is designed.

716
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:34,834
Now, my son and his family
are also visiting more often.

717
00:32:35,594 --> 00:32:38,435
You guys should listen more
to the experts.

718
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:44,514
They are all nice folks.

719
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,754
Feel free to say whatever you want.

720
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:55,395
The reason you guys can't get married

721
00:32:55,594 --> 00:32:57,554
is not simply because
your places are not good.

722
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:00,195
In my opinion,

723
00:33:00,435 --> 00:33:02,034
there are two issues
that need to be addressed.

724
00:33:02,195 --> 00:33:03,715
The first is income.

725
00:33:04,114 --> 00:33:06,395
As long as we increase
the alley's tourism appeal,

726
00:33:06,715 --> 00:33:08,395
your income will naturally increase.

727
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:10,875
The second is mindset.

728
00:33:11,274 --> 00:33:13,195
Your good taste is nurtured
by such beautiful surroundings

729
00:33:13,395 --> 00:33:14,395
every day.

730
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:16,074
Just maintain that.

731
00:33:16,354 --> 00:33:18,675
Make sure not to be easily led astray.

732
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:21,195
I have some similar cases on my phone.

733
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:22,794
You can all take a look at the effects.

734
00:33:23,354 --> 00:33:25,754
The actual results are really beautiful.

735
00:33:27,955 --> 00:33:28,395
Here.

736
00:33:28,514 --> 00:33:29,314
Sir, have a look.

737
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:37,715
This is not bad.

738
00:33:38,635 --> 00:33:39,715
It's good, right?

739
00:33:40,074 --> 00:33:40,435
Look.

740
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:41,715
Look at this. It's really nice.

741
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:42,915
It is good.

742
00:33:42,955 --> 00:33:43,675
Hello, Ms. Yao.

743
00:33:43,715 --> 00:33:44,354
What's up?

744
00:33:45,155 --> 00:33:45,715
Brother,

745
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:47,554
it's Siqi.

746
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:51,715
Wait for me. I'll be right over.

747
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:52,794
Okay.

748
00:33:55,915 --> 00:33:56,834
Sorry, everyone.

749
00:33:57,155 --> 00:33:57,875
It's urgent.

750
00:33:58,074 --> 00:33:58,955
We need to go back first.

751
00:34:00,794 --> 00:34:01,514
Mr. Lu,

752
00:34:01,754 --> 00:34:03,675
your call came at quite a coincidence.

753
00:34:04,034 --> 00:34:05,675
You don't want to drink with us?

754
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:07,114
Wait, Mr. Lu.

755
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:08,674
Ms. Wang has the wine and food ready.

756
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,795
And you're leaving us now?

757
00:34:11,594 --> 00:34:12,554
That's disrespect.

758
00:34:15,395 --> 00:34:16,114
Gentlemen,

759
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:18,275
I'm the person in charge
of this project.

760
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:19,475
I will stay.

761
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:22,315
Mr. Lu's presence
will only affect my performance.

762
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:30,194
Don't talk nonsense.

763
00:34:30,995 --> 00:34:32,074
Cenyang is one of our own.

764
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:34,634
He must have urgent business
to attend to.

765
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,755
Ms. Bu's presence

766
00:34:37,114 --> 00:34:38,275
represents Mr. Lu.

767
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:41,234
- Okay.
- Fine.

768
00:34:41,315 --> 00:34:41,955
Mr. Lu,

769
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:43,995
if you have something to do, go ahead.

770
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:49,114
Sir, Bu Ran cannot hold her liquor.

771
00:34:49,395 --> 00:34:50,315
I hope you can...

772
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:51,514
Rest assured.

773
00:34:52,114 --> 00:34:53,275
Everyone understands.

774
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:55,114
We're here to be happy. Don't worry.

775
00:34:57,634 --> 00:34:59,475
Don't overdo it. I'll be right back.

776
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:04,514
Ms. Wang,

777
00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:05,554
don't let Bu Ran drink.

778
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:06,594
Call me if you need it.

779
00:35:06,795 --> 00:35:07,234
Okay.

780
00:35:07,435 --> 00:35:08,835
The boss who loves to nag has left.

781
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:11,114
Shouldn't we give him a round
of applause to send him off?

782
00:35:15,034 --> 00:35:15,835
Let's continue.

783
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:16,795
Where were we just now?

784
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:27,554
Brother!

785
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:34,915
You brat, you're finally back.

786
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:36,955
Haven't I always been here?

787
00:35:37,714 --> 00:35:38,875
Finally, the day has come.

788
00:35:39,435 --> 00:35:40,795
You siblings should have a good talk.

789
00:35:40,995 --> 00:35:42,514
Thank you, Dr. Ma.

790
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:45,315
Thanks to her
being more cooperative lately,

791
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,275
my reputation has been saved.

792
00:35:51,554 --> 00:35:52,194
By the way,

793
00:35:52,755 --> 00:35:54,114
did I interrupt your work

794
00:35:54,514 --> 00:35:55,674
by suddenly calling you over?

795
00:35:56,074 --> 00:35:57,594
You're my sister.
You've regained your memory.

796
00:35:57,835 --> 00:35:59,114
I'd leave behind any work for this.

797
00:36:01,194 --> 00:36:01,755
Brother,

798
00:36:02,154 --> 00:36:04,435
let's find a time
to pay respects to Dad.

799
00:36:04,714 --> 00:36:05,915
We should also inform Mr. Li.

800
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:07,074
Also,

801
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:08,395
I will tell the Yi family.

802
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:10,475
Haven't they always wanted to find me

803
00:36:10,714 --> 00:36:12,475
and then use me against you?

804
00:36:13,315 --> 00:36:14,475
I want to tell them in person

805
00:36:14,835 --> 00:36:15,634
that they can dream.

806
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:17,795
Okay.

807
00:36:18,234 --> 00:36:19,995
As long as you're happy,
you can do anything.

808
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:22,634
Whatever else you want to do,
just tell me.

809
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:25,114
There's a tricky matter at hand

810
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:26,154
that requires your help.

811
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:30,114
You have to help me
get rid of the annoying Yi Zihe.

812
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:31,034
