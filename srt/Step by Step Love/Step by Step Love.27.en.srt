(Breaking News,
Lu Cenyang leaves Pinshang)

21
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,746
What's Lu Cenyang up to now?

22
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:51,987
He's worse off than us now.

23
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:53,826
He deserves it.

24
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:56,987
Mom was indeed impressive.

25
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,947
She used us to find out
Lu Cenyang's capability

26
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:02,987
and then spared no expense
to support Lu Cenyang's nemesis,

27
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:04,707
striking the snake at its vital spot.

28
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:09,507
But did Lu Cenyang
just give up like that?

29
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:10,947
Who cares?

30
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:13,227
Mom wants us to be more obedient.

31
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:15,546
Let's just be the fisherman
and reap the benefit.

32
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:17,986
Stop fooling yourself over there.

33
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:19,866
Lu Cenyang has lost.

34
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,347
But is Qin Xun's rise to power
good for us?

35
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:24,666
So, what do we do?

36
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:27,866
A small fry can't make big waves.

37
00:02:28,586 --> 00:02:29,227
Just wait.

38
00:02:29,586 --> 00:02:30,507
I'm curious to see

39
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:32,947
what Mom would do
to this Qin Xun in the end.

40
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:45,986
Ms. Hua.

41
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:48,947
These are all of Pinshang's
past projects.

42
00:02:49,187 --> 00:02:49,947
Please take a look.

43
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:52,256
(Project Contracts)

44
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,947
Lu Cenyang gave you his shares,

45
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:02,546
thinking you would show mercy.

46
00:03:02,826 --> 00:03:03,826
But unexpectedly,

47
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:07,106
it became your weapon against Pinshang.

48
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,907
Pinshang's current partners

49
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:10,787
began to sell off their shares and chose

50
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:11,706
to work with Yihua

51
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:13,386
once they heard the company's

52
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:14,787
majority shareholder

53
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:16,907
had no confidence in their management.

54
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:21,507
You've worked so hard,
and I can't be stingy.

55
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:23,586
I can't let down my great contributor.

56
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:28,640
(Equity Transfer Agreement)

57
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:31,266
This is an Equity Transfer Agreement.

58
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:32,507
every word in it

59
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,146
is true

60
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:35,706
and worth a lot.

61
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:38,986
I prepared it for my eldest son,

62
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:41,146
but now I have

63
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:43,386
no expectations for him.

64
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:46,907
Take it.

65
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:50,426
This way, you'll have more confidence
in pursuing Bu Ran.

66
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,067
Thank you, Ms. Hua.

67
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:54,866
However, speaking of which,

68
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,826
may I ask you

69
00:03:57,347 --> 00:03:59,947
to let me handle the follow-up
of the Ancient Alley Renovation?

70
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:01,706
What do you want to do?

71
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:03,386
This project has a high buzz

72
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:05,747
due to heated online attention.

73
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,347
It's truly a hot potato.

74
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:11,586
The best solution at the moment is

75
00:04:11,747 --> 00:04:13,666
to let it completely drag down Pinshang.

76
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:17,386
When I help Yihua swallow
the failing Pinshang,

77
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:19,867
I will have more energy

78
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:20,987
to do my best to repair

79
00:04:21,146 --> 00:04:22,987
the relationship between Ms. Hua
and Uncle Minde.

80
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:26,507
Because I want to become
Uncle Minde's son-in-law.

81
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:28,747
With a happy family,

82
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:31,667
the shares I hold will be more valuable.

83
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:36,346
You're quite the crafty one.

84
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:37,547
All right then.

85
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:40,427
I'll be waiting for you
to come back and celebrate together.

86
00:04:53,722 --> 00:04:56,800
(Two Months Later)

87
00:05:00,706 --> 00:05:01,906
This classmate of mine

88
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:03,987
uses Traditional Chinese Medicine
to regulate heart function.

89
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:05,346
He knows what he's doing

90
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,786
and has cured countless patients.

91
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:08,906
Rest assured.

92
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,466
Thank you for your help, Dr. Ma.

93
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:11,547
You're welcome.

94
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:14,346
This is something Mr. Lu
mentioned repeatedly.

95
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:16,747
Have you seen Lu Cenyang recently?

96
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,706
I haven't been in touch
with him for a long time.

97
00:05:18,747 --> 00:05:19,826
Do you have any news of him?

98
00:05:20,627 --> 00:05:21,466
I'm really sorry.

99
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:23,906
He asked me to make medical
appointments for your mother

100
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:25,386
two months ago.

101
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:27,466
I haven't seen him recently either

102
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:28,947
I don't know what he's been up to.

103
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:31,667
Thank you, Dr. Ma.

104
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:32,586
Thank you so much.

105
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:42,906
(How irresponsible,)

106
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:43,747
(unmoral,)

107
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:45,067
(and unsympathetic of Lu Cenyang)

108
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:46,547
(to disappear, leaving)

109
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,026
(the project and his sister behind.)

110
00:05:59,112 --> 00:05:59,747
(Qin Xun)

111
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:01,786
(I want to go back to Pinshang
to complete the project.)

112
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:21,146
What are you doing here?

113
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:25,152
(Company Merger Agreement)

114
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:27,427
To discuss cooperation.

115
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:30,507
The project that Pinshang
has worked so hard on

116
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:33,466
was easily taken away by you
before its completion.

117
00:06:34,747 --> 00:06:35,826
I have nothing to say

118
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:37,786
to someone like you.

119
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:41,307
Broaden your horizons.

120
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:44,947
It's praiseworthy for two companies
to join hands and benefit society

121
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,026
through cooperation.

122
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,547
Sister, why bother calculating
personal gains and losses?

123
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,386
You're not my brother.

124
00:06:52,987 --> 00:06:55,266
Now you know what it feels like
to be schemed against

125
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:58,026
and to have something
taken from you by force, don't you?

126
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:01,987
Please leave.

127
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:07,667
Last month, 30% of Pinshang's customers

128
00:07:07,747 --> 00:07:09,067
switched to Yihua.

129
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:11,987
This month, 50% of the projects

130
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:13,266
have either switched to Yihua

131
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:14,427
or ended their contracts.

132
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:16,067
If this continues,

133
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:19,386
how can you live up to the memory
of our father in heaven?

134
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:20,706
You're not worthy of mentioning Dad.

135
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:21,667
Fine.

136
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:23,947
Then let's talk about Lu Cenyang.

137
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:27,067
It took him nearly three years

138
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,947
to get Pinshang's market share
almost on par with Yihua.

139
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:32,586
Under your management,
it's been about seven weeks, right?

140
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:33,706
And you've lost it all.

141
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,266
You were Lu Cenyang's
secretary for three years.

142
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:38,586
I believe you have the ability.

143
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,187
It's just bad luck

144
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:42,187
that you've encountered
an opponent like me.

145
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:45,586
I won't go easy on you

146
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:46,867
just because you're my sister.

147
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,786
If you want the brand Pinshang

148
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:50,266
to survive,

149
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:52,627
it would be best to merge with Yihua.

150
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,947
Otherwise, the only thing left to do
is wait for the liquidation of assets.

151
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:57,586
You wish.

152
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,667
I am the only buyer

153
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:05,107
who comes with an offer,
considering our blood ties.

154
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:06,867
If you miss this opportunity,

155
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,507
the final outcome for Pinshang

156
00:08:09,747 --> 00:08:11,226
might be even worse than the Lu Group's.

157
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:40,128
(Lu Siqi signs
the Company Merger Agreement)

158
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:46,986
By the way,

159
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:49,267
initially, Yihua didn't want

160
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:51,506
to take over the poorly managed

161
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:53,106
Ancient Alley Renovation project,

162
00:08:53,226 --> 00:08:54,147
but someone

163
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:55,907
wants a perfect conclusion to it.

164
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:57,667
I've asked her to come to Pinshang

165
00:08:57,986 --> 00:09:00,147
and oversee the follow-up matters
of the project.

166
00:09:00,226 --> 00:09:01,067
No problems, right?

167
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:06,667
Have you arrived?

168
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:07,307
Okay.

169
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:12,147
I disagree.

170
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:15,547
Do you have anyone left?

171
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:17,866
How long has Lu Cenyang been gone?

172
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,226
Whether you agree or not

173
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:22,427
won't change the outcome.

174
00:09:26,547 --> 00:09:27,307
Siqi,

175
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:30,586
you can no longer, as in the past,

176
00:09:31,106 --> 00:09:32,866
rely on Lu Cenyang's doting on you

177
00:09:33,027 --> 00:09:34,147
and behave recklessly.

178
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:57,787
Alright.

179
00:09:57,866 --> 00:09:59,787
Designer Ms. Bu, let's go

180
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:01,586
and see your new office together.

181
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:06,907
You want me to work here?

182
00:10:07,746 --> 00:10:08,307
No way.

183
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:12,147
What if as soon as I left Pinshang,

184
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:12,866
Yao Lefei

185
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:14,547
reassigns you to scrub toilets?

186
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:18,346
Having you sit in this position

187
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:19,267
is to make it easier

188
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:21,746
for you to advance
the Ancient Alley Renovation.

189
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:23,226
Don't overthink it.

190
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:01,826
What's meant to come has come.

191
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:04,427
Brother Mingyu.

192
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,387
Your son has come to see you.

193
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:12,226
Your father's ashes

194
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,427
were scattered in this sea.

195
00:11:18,147 --> 00:11:20,986
Bow to the sea.

196
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:25,226
Uncle Minde.

197
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,267
The ashes of that faithless man

198
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,307
only remind me

199
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:33,706
of my mother's painful memories
from those years.

200
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:38,226
I know you hate your father,

201
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:44,787
but I am more aware

202
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,067
of your inherently good nature.

203
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:50,027
If you really held a grudge
against your father,

204
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:51,547
you would have used Ran

205
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:53,147
to achieve your revenge long ago.

206
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:55,427
But you never did.

207
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,387
So you knew all along, Uncle Minde.

208
00:11:59,267 --> 00:11:59,947
Qin Xun,

209
00:12:02,147 --> 00:12:03,626
I want to talk to you about your father.

210
00:12:05,106 --> 00:12:06,027
I don't want to.

211
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:10,147
I'm just saying,

212
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:12,866
and you can listen casually.

213
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:14,826
Back then,

214
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:17,986
when Brother Mingyu went bankrupt,

215
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:19,067
your mother contacted him

216
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:22,787
and was prepared to give up
everything she had left for you

217
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:25,106
to help him get through the rough patch.

218
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:27,986
You know that back then, the houses

219
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:29,187
didn't cost as much as now.

220
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:33,466
Even if she sold all the properties
under your name,

221
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,826
it might not have saved
Mingyu's business.

222
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:40,866
But then, your future security

223
00:12:42,187 --> 00:12:43,147
would have been gone.

224
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:47,387
That's why Mingyu refused.

225
00:12:49,106 --> 00:12:49,746
Furthermore,

226
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,027
have you ever thought

227
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:55,307
that your mother was alone abroad

228
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:57,826
as a woman,

229
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:01,267
so how could she afford so many houses?

230
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:09,506
Mingyu once told me,

231
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:11,547
that he and your mom

232
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:14,506
had separated

233
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:16,387
because of a misunderstanding.

234
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:19,626
And he felt guilt and regret

235
00:13:22,106 --> 00:13:23,626
about that marriage.

236
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:26,267
You are making excuses for his
abandonment of his wife and child.

237
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:34,466
I'm just telling you
the facts that I know.

238
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:46,826
Sorry.

239
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,626
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

240
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:51,147
(Lu Cenyang)
Please try again later.

241
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:54,986
Mom, I'm back.

242
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:02,866
Mom, where's Dad?

243
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:05,346
I'm not your mom.

244
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:06,626
I can't answer for her.

245
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:09,067
What are you doing here?

246
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,667
Where have you been all this time?

247
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:15,506
Not even a call?

248
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:16,866
And what's this about you resigning?

249
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:18,626
Are you going to abandon Pinshang

250
00:15:18,746 --> 00:15:20,267
and the Ancient Alley
Renovation like that?

251
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,267
Your sister was going crazy
looking for you, you know?

252
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,346
How can you suddenly

253
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:24,427
ask so many questions?

254
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:26,147
This is such a critical time and you are

255
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,427
cooking here?

256
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:30,346
I've already resigned publicly.

257
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,106
What else can I do if not cooking?

258
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:34,027
Lu Cenyang, what are you talking about?

259
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:35,547
Chinese.

260
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:36,947
Are you joking with me?

261
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:39,586
Is this the time to be joking?

262
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:41,267
Lu Cenyang, when did you

263
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:42,746
become so irresponsible?

264
00:15:43,387 --> 00:15:44,067
When I left,

265
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:46,187
I had already entrusted
the company to Siqi.

266
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:47,387
As for Fortune Pavilion,

267
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:50,267
every time I go back there,
I'm reminded of my dad.

268
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,307
And thinking of him makes me sad.

269
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:53,586
So I had nowhere to go.

270
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:54,986
I could only come here.

271
00:15:56,586 --> 00:15:58,307
You're not welcome here either.

272
00:15:58,787 --> 00:15:59,547
Wait, a call.

273
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,387
Besides, I have no connection with you.

274
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:02,307
Phone, your phone.

275
00:16:03,106 --> 00:16:04,866
It's your dad. Let me take it.

276
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,866
Cenyang, have you arrived home?

277
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:11,986
We just talked with Dr. Ma

278
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:13,706
and she needs to be hospitalized.

279
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:16,067
Dad, why did you go to the hospital?

280
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,387
Is Mom feeling unwell?

281
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:18,346
Don't worry.

282
00:16:18,626 --> 00:16:19,427
The doctor said

283
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:21,667
it's best for your mom
to be hospitalized

284
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:22,506
and have a check-up.

285
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:24,667
I forgot to make an appointment,

286
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:26,667
so Cenyang arranged it this time.

287
00:16:28,106 --> 00:16:30,226
Ran, I'm quite well.

288
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:32,067
You should really thank Cenyang.

289
00:16:32,947 --> 00:16:33,667
Okay, Auntie.

290
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,586
Goodbye, Auntie.

291
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:41,067
You owe me.

292
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:42,667
Lu Cenyang.

293
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:44,387
How did I not realize before

294
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:45,787
that you're so thick-skinned?

295
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:48,106
You discarded Pinshang,
disappeared from Siqi,

296
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,667
and the renovation has been put on hold.

297
00:16:49,826 --> 00:16:51,346
So many things need your decision,

298
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:52,307
and here you are,

299
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:55,147
vanishing after resigning
with just a few words.

300
00:16:55,746 --> 00:16:57,626
So you went to help out at Pinshang.

301
00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:02,427
I went so I wouldn't get scolded.

302
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:06,266
♪I will do everything for you♪

303
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,947
Don't think that I did it for you.

304
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:12,107
I did it for the Ancient Alley,
and for Ms. Yao.

305
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:13,827
Didn't you trick me into the show

306
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:14,867
and ask me to help you?

307
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:15,546
Didn't you say

308
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:16,907
your father spent his childhood there

309
00:17:16,907 --> 00:17:18,266
so you wanted to renovate it properly?

310
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:18,947
Didn't you say

311
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:20,107
during flowering season,

312
00:17:20,226 --> 00:17:21,026
there'd be Iris ensata?

313
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:22,266
Thank you for not giving up on it.

314
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:26,746
Then why did you give up?

315
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:27,986
I...

316
00:17:30,107 --> 00:17:31,587
I have more important things to do.

317
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:34,387
What's more important than this now?

318
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:37,546
Being with you.

319
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:38,466
From today on,

320
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:38,947
you work

321
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:40,147
and I'll cook for you at home.

322
00:17:40,187 --> 00:17:41,907
Lu Cenyang, you're really
hopeless as a grown man.

323
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,387
We just need to finish one more soup.

324
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:46,627
Tomato and egg soup.

325
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:47,786
Tomato and egg...

326
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:01,266
(I've sent Yihua's projects)

327
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:02,746
(to your email.)

328
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,427
Concerning the construction materials,

329
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:10,907
does anyone have any good ideas?

330
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:11,827
Let's hear them.

331
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:18,066
We have discussed
this matter many times.

332
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:20,746
We all agree with the original intention

333
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:21,786
of using old wooden parts.

334
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,706
But such materials
are indeed hard to find

335
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:25,986
and they are prone to issues.

336
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:28,546
Therefore, we want to use new materials.

337
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:30,786
Although there are flaws in appearance,

338
00:18:31,187 --> 00:18:32,107
they won't cause problems.

339
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:36,306
Is this what you all think?

340
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:38,746
Yes.

341
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:40,706
This is the only way.

342
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:42,907
Siqi, what do you think?

343
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:46,306
Restoring the old as it was
is my brother's requirement.

344
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,986
I agree to replace the old wooden parts,

345
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:51,907
but not with new materials.

346
00:18:53,226 --> 00:18:54,546
Because if my brother were here,

347
00:18:55,107 --> 00:18:56,466
he would definitely not agree.

348
00:18:56,786 --> 00:18:58,667
Then, do you have
any thoughts on the materials?

349
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:04,026
If I did, what would I need you for?

350
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:06,587
Aren't you here to solve these issues?

351
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:09,827
Alright.

352
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,026
Let's leave it at that for today.

353
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:13,867
Okay.

354
00:19:15,226 --> 00:19:16,066
Siqi, stay behind.

355
00:19:22,147 --> 00:19:22,867
Bu Ran.

356
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:25,786
Don't think that you can boss me around

357
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:27,627
just because you're sitting
in my brother's chair.

358
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:30,066
Shall I leave?

359
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:31,466
You...

360
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:42,506
Siqi.

361
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:44,506
I support your perseverance,

362
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:47,306
but the team leader's
concerns make sense.

363
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:49,187
Currently, the residents have a strong

364
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:50,107
aversion toward us.

365
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:51,986
We don't have the luxury
of trial and error.

366
00:19:53,786 --> 00:19:55,387
So, I've decided to use new materials.

367
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:56,746
However,

368
00:19:57,746 --> 00:19:59,306
we must also preserve
Mr. Lu's determination.

369
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:01,266
What is your solution?

370
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:02,907
Say it directly,
no beating around the bush.

371
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,107
When you were young, you lived
with Uncle Lu in the ancient alley.

372
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:07,627
Do you know any carpenters?

373
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:08,347
The craftsmen

374
00:20:08,427 --> 00:20:10,587
who originally lived in the alleys

375
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:13,266
understand the residents' needs
and preferences better than we do.

376
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:14,667
And they can help us identify

377
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:16,706
the most suitable ancient wood
materials for replacement.

378
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:19,746
I was too young back then.

379
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:21,867
Even if I had met some,

380
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:24,827
I can't remember their houses or names.

381
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,306
But my brother would remember.

382
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,387
It's just I can't

383
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:36,746
get in touch with him at all now.

384
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,466
Okay, I got it.

385
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:44,746
Go back to work.

386
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,387
I thought you really loved Lu Cenyang.

387
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:05,026
But the moment he stepped down,

388
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:08,226
you teamed up with Qin Xun
to seize his position.

389
00:21:11,347 --> 00:21:12,107
Bu Ran.

390
00:21:13,827 --> 00:21:15,706
Sometimes I don't understand you.

391
00:21:16,147 --> 00:21:17,107
Think whatever you want.

392
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:18,827
I have a clear conscience.

393
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:21,867
I just want to wrap up
this project properly.

394
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,266
I knew you were

395
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:53,427
working overtime.

396
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:56,947
Do you think this is a vegetable market

397
00:21:59,387 --> 00:22:00,427
and came here for a stroll?

398
00:22:02,026 --> 00:22:03,427
I can go wherever I want.

399
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:04,266
None of your business.

400
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:07,667
Trespassing into the office area

401
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,667
is a serious matter.

402
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:12,627
You...

403
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:14,907
Call the police

404
00:22:14,986 --> 00:22:15,786
and have me arrested.

405
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:16,867
Come on.

406
00:22:21,226 --> 00:22:22,947
What are you two doing here?

407
00:22:23,627 --> 00:22:24,546
Have some food first.

408
00:22:24,986 --> 00:22:25,786
I made it.

409
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,546
How did the great CEO end up as a cook?

410
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:32,907
How do you charge for it?

411
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:34,427
Shall I order some staff meals

412
00:22:34,427 --> 00:22:35,947
and help you drum up business?

413
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:38,107
You won't come home for dinner

414
00:22:38,147 --> 00:22:39,627
so I had to come and bring you food.

415
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:41,026
Come home?

416
00:22:41,546 --> 00:22:42,387
Lu Cenyang, you...

417
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:43,466
It's not what you think.

418
00:22:44,107 --> 00:22:45,546
Lu Cenyang, you're shameless.

419
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:48,147
Yes, I am shameless.

420
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:50,427
All I want is Bu Ran.

421
00:22:50,427 --> 00:22:51,107
Come on.

422
00:22:51,466 --> 00:22:52,187
Try this.

423
00:22:56,986 --> 00:22:57,667
Try it.

424
00:22:58,947 --> 00:22:59,706
Security Station?

425
00:23:00,347 --> 00:23:01,226
Send someone over quickly.

426
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:02,947
Someone is trespassing
in the office right now.

427
00:23:03,947 --> 00:23:05,947
Qin Xun, you're serious, aren't you?

428
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:06,986
Or else what?

429
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:09,266
You have three minutes now.

430
00:23:10,587 --> 00:23:11,066
Here.

431
00:23:11,427 --> 00:23:12,867
Go home first.
I'll be back after I'm done.

432
00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:14,026
I'll stay for a while longer.

433
00:23:15,107 --> 00:23:16,187
Two minutes left.

434
00:23:17,827 --> 00:23:19,026
Remember to eat, okay?

435
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:20,187
Five, four...

436
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:21,066
I'll wait for you.

437
00:23:21,187 --> 00:23:21,867
Three.

438
00:23:22,306 --> 00:23:22,947
Two.

439
00:23:23,306 --> 00:23:24,147
This isn't over.

440
00:23:31,506 --> 00:23:32,427
Stop eating these things.

441
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:33,827
I'll take you out later.

442
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:36,066
No. there's still a lot of work to do.

443
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:37,546
I'll eat these later.

444
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,387
Lu Siqi didn't give you
a hard time today, right?

445
00:23:47,347 --> 00:23:47,986
No, she didn't.

446
00:23:48,786 --> 00:23:49,867
I can feel it.

447
00:23:50,107 --> 00:23:51,947
Even though verbally,
she still rejects me,

448
00:23:52,506 --> 00:23:53,827
deep down, she relies on me.

449
00:23:57,706 --> 00:23:58,347
That's good.

450
00:24:01,387 --> 00:24:02,627
This road is so dark.

451
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,147
It's not safe for you.

452
00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:07,107
I'll take you home every day.

453
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:12,947
Thank you.

454
00:24:13,347 --> 00:24:14,827
Starting tomorrow,
I will come back earlier.

455
00:24:24,786 --> 00:24:26,907
Does this wooden post
stand guard here every day?

456
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:30,107
It's been a few days.

457
00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:41,706
Childish.

458
00:24:59,986 --> 00:25:01,066
Thank you for bringing me back.

459
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:03,947
If you really want to thank me,
invite me in for a cup of tea.

460
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:10,627
Next time, Old Pal's, I'll treat you.

461
00:25:12,026 --> 00:25:12,827
Stingy.

462
00:25:13,627 --> 00:25:14,187
I'm off.

463
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:15,546
Drive safely.

464
00:25:29,746 --> 00:25:30,947
He, he...

465
00:25:31,786 --> 00:25:32,387
He...

466
00:25:32,746 --> 00:25:34,506
If you can't catch your breath,
don't talk.

467
00:25:35,347 --> 00:25:35,986
Flashlight.

468
00:25:37,306 --> 00:25:38,187
Light the way.

469
00:25:58,466 --> 00:25:59,226
Are you alright?

470
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:05,107
The road is dark,
and I didn't see clearly.

471
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:07,466
It is a bit dark.

472
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:15,907
I'll carry you.

473
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:21,786
What's the matter, are you shy?

474
00:26:22,627 --> 00:26:23,746
I have held you before.

475
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:25,667
It's not the same.

476
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:27,786
It's never changed in my heart.

477
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:41,867

Guys,

512
00:28:42,907 --> 00:28:44,667
why is Pinshang doing this?

513
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,347
Mr. Lu has already been
forced to resign by you all.

514
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,347
Pinshang can just drop this project,

515
00:28:49,867 --> 00:28:50,986
but they haven't.

516
00:28:51,306 --> 00:28:53,387
They are still working on
the alley's renovation.

517
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,026
So if you make trouble again,

518
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:57,706
that would be heartless.

519
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:00,867
Now that Ms. Wang has spoken,

520
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:01,746
well, let's just

521
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:02,466
leave it at that.

522
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:03,347
It's about time, right?

523
00:29:11,303 --> 00:29:14,880

Now that the project is re-opened,

527
00:29:44,026 --> 00:29:44,947
I can withdraw then.

528
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,306
It's up to you now, Siqi.

529
00:29:48,907 --> 00:29:50,266
You sure are open-minded.

530
00:29:51,147 --> 00:29:52,147
You've done so much

531
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,986
all for my benefit.

532
00:29:55,187 --> 00:29:56,947
Previously, the outcome wasn't clear,

533
00:29:57,147 --> 00:29:58,147
and I didn't want to say much.

534
00:29:58,786 --> 00:29:59,867
Now I can.

535
00:30:00,947 --> 00:30:03,147
I asked Qin Xun to let me
return to Pinshang

536
00:30:03,347 --> 00:30:05,187
to continue the Ancient Alley
Renovation project

537
00:30:05,786 --> 00:30:07,947
because I want to preserve Pinshang
for Cenyang and you.

538
00:30:09,187 --> 00:30:11,107
The Ancient Alley Renovation
started with Pinshang

539
00:30:11,986 --> 00:30:13,546
which led to Cenyang's resignation

540
00:30:14,306 --> 00:30:16,746
and caused Pinshang's reputation
in the industry

541
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:17,827
to plummet.

542
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:20,026
Where one falls down,

543
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:21,786
one must rise up again.

544
00:30:22,147 --> 00:30:24,546
Therefore, the Ancient Alley
Renovation must be re-opened.

545
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:29,427
Of course,

546
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:30,746
my actions

547
00:30:30,907 --> 00:30:32,627
were not entirely for you and Pinshang.

548
00:30:33,387 --> 00:30:35,706
Because Cenyang entrusted
this project to me initially,

549
00:30:36,306 --> 00:30:38,026
and if I neglect it now,

550
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:40,107
it will be like a thorn

551
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:41,226
that's always there.

552
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,827
Whenever I think of it,

553
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:46,947
my heart would be filled
with guilt and regret.

554
00:30:48,706 --> 00:30:51,066
I must uphold my professional integrity

555
00:30:52,187 --> 00:30:53,466
and the trust of Cenyang.

556
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:57,827
Actually, when you came to Pinshang,

557
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,026
I really liked your design philosophy.

558
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:05,387
But in the time that followed,

559
00:31:06,387 --> 00:31:08,266
too many things flooded in,

560
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:11,387
making me lose my judgment of you.

561
00:31:13,587 --> 00:31:15,986
Jealousy and hatred

562
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:18,587
filled my heart.

563
00:31:21,627 --> 00:31:22,706
I can understand.

564
00:31:27,546 --> 00:31:29,587
You don't have to be so magnanimous.

565
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:33,107
Because I did do many things wrong.

566
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,427
I put on an act with Yi Zihe

567
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:40,907
and post on Moments for you to see.

568
00:31:42,306 --> 00:31:44,306
I thought these would drive you away

569
00:31:46,226 --> 00:31:47,226
but unexpectedly,

570
00:31:48,746 --> 00:31:49,907
they drove my brother away

571
00:31:50,706 --> 00:31:52,226
and made him lose everything.

572
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:58,187
During the time he disappeared
after his resignation,

573
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:00,427
I thought a lot.

574
00:32:02,306 --> 00:32:04,746
I mistook possession

575
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:07,506
for love.

576
00:32:10,147 --> 00:32:11,746
When I carried Pinshang on my own,

577
00:32:12,107 --> 00:32:15,026
and when I was isolated and helpless,

578
00:32:17,387 --> 00:32:18,627
fortunately, you appeared.

579
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:20,907
Otherwise,

580
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,306
I would have collapsed long ago.

581
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,427
During this period,

582
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:31,187
my own brother Qin Xun

583
00:32:31,746 --> 00:32:33,466
showed me no mercy.

584
00:32:35,107 --> 00:32:37,107
I originally thought he was taking
it out on me for you.

585
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,867
But later I realized

586
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:42,266
he was teaching me to grow.

587
00:32:44,827 --> 00:32:46,427
Is that what Qin Xun thought?

588
00:32:47,587 --> 00:32:48,266
Bu Ran.

589
00:32:49,587 --> 00:32:50,347
Thank you.

590
00:32:53,107 --> 00:32:54,627
I sincerely apologize

591
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:56,827
for my actions.

592
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:58,986
I'm sorry.

593
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:00,827
It doesn't matter.

594
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:04,387
You are my sister-in-law, after all.

595
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:06,546
Are you really with Qin Xun now?

596
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:09,387
No.

597
00:33:13,226 --> 00:33:15,066
I have to tell you something,
but don't be mad.

598
00:33:19,187 --> 00:33:21,427
Actually, your brother didn't disappear.

599
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,387
He's been living at my house
this whole time.

600
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:26,827
He's been living at your house?

601
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:29,907
So you've moved in together?

602
00:33:31,466 --> 00:33:32,947
Well, not exactly.

603
00:33:34,266 --> 00:33:34,867
