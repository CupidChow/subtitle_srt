=Episode 4=

20
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,711
You set fire to my home?

21
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,048
Accuse me in public, huh?

22
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,271
Do you know why I'm so powerful?

23
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,991
Because I created this
fascinating world.

24
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:53,471
I am a genius.

25
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:54,510
Sorry, ma'am.

26
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,271
According to professor Taylor's
piece of evidence,

27
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,191
you broke into his residence

28
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,111
and burned some valuable designs.

29
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:03,271
Just because of his rejection.

30
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:09,270
The prosecutor has decided to drop the accusation
due to his legal self-defense action.

31
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:19,790
Taylor's a veggie due to cholesterol.
Why is he eating meat?

32
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,751
I'm sorry. I need to go now.

33
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,751
Anyway, it's nice talking to you guys.
Hope we can cooperate in the future.

34
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:28,790
Thank you, me too

35
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,911
See you.

36
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,670
Bye.

37
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:01,990
Would you like to come in?

38
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,230
Which floor are you going to, Miss?

39
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,191
Seventh, thank you.

40
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:19,031
Taylor gave up on treating
his toenail fungus long time ago.

41
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:22,790
But his nails are smooth,
and his finger joints are not deformed.

42
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:52,390
I knew he wouldn't recognize me.

43
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,631
How could an imposter
look exactly like him?

44
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,031
Whoever conspires against Lu Cenyang
sure thought it through.

45
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,031
What do you want?

46
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,631
Trying to catch up to Lu Cenyang
to say something?

47
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,431
I live across from him.
Can't I just hitch a ride?

48
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,071
I saw you following him here.

49
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:18,991
Quit lying.

50
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,751
So you've been watching me all day?

51
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,431
Why are you spying on me?

52
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:25,270
Who did you see?

53
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,871
Or are you afraid
I'll say something to Lu Cenyang?

54
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:33,710
This is a Yi Family matter.
Stay out of it.

55
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,751
He assaulted me in a public place.

56
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:40,311
- Come take a look.
- What's going on?

57
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:40,991
What is this?

58
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,791
Yihua's employee attacked me.

59
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,590
Everyone, take a look.

60
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,431
Are you okay?

61
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:49,470
Thank you.

62
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,270
The fake Taylor must be Yihua's doing.

63
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:56,830
I need to notify Lu Cenyang ASAP.

64
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:50,671
Too high.

65
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:22,510
I can't get out.

66
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,431
Out...

67
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,390
Help me, I'm stuck, hurry.

68
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,150
Serves you right.

69
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,671
Are you even human?

70
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,071
Come and help me.

71
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,231
I'll help you.

72
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,751
Go back to where you came from.

73
00:06:47,431 --> 00:06:49,751
I have something important to tell you.

74
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,671
Tell you what.
I'm suing you for trespassing.

75
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,231
My back hurts. I got stuck.

76
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:54,350
It hurts, it really hurts.

77
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,791
My back, it's stuck.

78
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,510
It hurts. My back hurts.

79
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,111
Do it yourself.

80
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:04,631
Pull harder, come on.

81
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,270
I'm telling you.

82
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:09,950
The Taylor you saw was an imposter.

83
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,350
Don't be fooled.
He's plotting against you.

84
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,030
More like you're plotting against me.

85
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,671
I don't want to see.

86
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,191
I won't look.

87
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,590
Give me the robe.

88
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:25,470
Give me the robe.

89
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,311
You dirty scum.

90
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:28,231
- My robe.
- Get lost.

91
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,431
Give me the robe.

92
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:30,350
Who let you look?

93
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:32,470
Give me the robe.

94
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,671
- Creep!
- Female creep!

95
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,270
I know I was wrong to intrude.

96
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,551
But it's an emergency.

97
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,510
Would you let me explain?

98
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:50,470
Then make your decision

99
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,231
before treating me so roughly.

100
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,111
Who's being rough again?

101
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,830
Haven' t your parents teach you?

102
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:57,510
You can't climb into
other people's home.

103
00:07:57,671 --> 00:07:58,751
Let alone strip them.

104
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:01,791
That wasn't intentional.

105
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:04,191
I was simply out of options.

106
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,150
You answered neither

107
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,991
you phone nor door.

108
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:08,111
You almost forced me
to climb in over the railing.

109
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,231
But none of that matters.

110
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,631
What's important is Taylor is fake.

111
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,950
Just let that sink in.

112
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:13,350
Don't let them fool you.

113
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:15,431
You were going to
climb over the railing?

114
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,150
Do you know how dangerous that is?

115
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,350
Remember this.

116
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:19,710
Your well-being concerns

117
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:20,551
other people, too,

118
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,111
including your family
and those who care.

119
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,150
You have no idea what is like
to lose a loved one.

120
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,830
Stop talking like you're right.

121
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:30,751
If this happens again,
move out immediately.

122
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,431
Is he worried about me?

123
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:43,791
That Taylor is fake.

124
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,391
That Taylor is a fake.

125
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,870
You answered neither

126
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,710
your phone nor door.

127
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,830
You almost forced me
to climb in over the railing.

128
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,151
Do whatever you like.

129
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,350
Why should I worry about her?

130
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,431
Don't forget what I told you.

131
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,870
Fake Taylor. Conspiracy.

132
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,470
Don't forget. Conspiracy.

133
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,031
Conspiracy!

134
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:36,031
Mom,

135
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,470
I have reasons to believe

136
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,791
that Bu Ran is working against us.

137
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:41,590
First, she sabotaged the beauty trap

138
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,671
I set up for Lu Cenyang.

139
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,391
Then,

140
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,470
she exposed fake Taylor to him.

141
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,110
Mom,

142
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:47,870
we can't let her keep acting
so recklessly.

143
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:57,511
You are my successors.

144
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,710
You should learn to solve problems
instead of coming to complain.

145
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,911
Grandma, Bu Ran is getting in the way,

146
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:07,431
seriously affecting our plans.

147
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,311
Our opponent is Lu Cenyang, not Bu Ran.

148
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,630
What can I expect from you
if you can't even see that clearly?

149
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,710
Get out.

150
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:34,791
My mother never favors me
as she does my brother.

151
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,710
And Bu Ran used that.

152
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:41,431
Bu Ran sold us out.

153
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:43,511
Lu Cenyang must know
that Taylor is fake.

154
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,230
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

155
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,950
Given how revengeful Lu Cenyang is,

156
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,311
he'll certainly retaliate
against fake Taylor.

157
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:01,710
How about this?

158
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:05,630
We pay more to get the real Taylor.

159
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:08,271
Then swap the two of them.

160
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:12,031
Let Lu Cenyang take his anger
out on the real Taylor.

161
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:14,990
Dad, that is a brilliant.

162
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,710
When the real Taylor
has a conflict with Lu Cenyang,

163
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:19,431
he will be more dedicated to helping us.

164
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,350
I'll contact Taylor now.

165
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,710
You're reaching beyond your grasp,
meddling in things.

166
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:27,950
Lu Cenyang is certainly not grateful.

167
00:11:28,391 --> 00:11:30,311
Why are you still chasing after
that fake Taylor?

168
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,311
Staking out in the lobby every day.

169
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,110
Groupies aren't as obsessed as you.

170
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,271
I called you for tips on

171
00:11:36,431 --> 00:11:38,230
snapping shots and tracking people,

172
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,350
not so you can rain on my parade.

173
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:42,870
Leave professional matters to the pros.

174
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:44,990
Just go back to drawing plans.

175
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,031
I can't talk anymore.
The target has appeared.

176
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,391
Hello?

177
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,031
You aren't supposed to
spend work hours on long calls.

178
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,071
(I was fooled by Taylor last time.)

179
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,911
(He told me he went to China.
Actually, he was dating other girl.)

180
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,191
(But this time, he's really in China.)

181
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,590
(This is his hotel information.)

182
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,710
(The one staying in the hotel now
is the real Taylor?)

183
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,191
Bu Ran.

184
00:12:47,071 --> 00:12:48,071
Which floor?

185
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,350
Same as last time.

186
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,391
Seventh.

187
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,431
Thanks.

188
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,271
(Looks like someone
did their homework this time.)

189
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,151
(Not leaving out the details.)

190
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:03,990
(If I didn't know you were an imposter,)

191
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,470
(I might have actually been fooled.)

192
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:14,391
You look good.

193
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,551
But I like more
the way you looked last time.

194
00:13:19,071 --> 00:13:20,071
Last time?

195
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,870
(Tell me more about the welfare center.)

196
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:30,350
(No, no.)

197
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,990
(I think I'm not safe now.)

198
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:35,271
(Okay.)

199
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,630
(Okay, I know now.)

200
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,750
(Talk to me later.)

201
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,110
You, let go of me, now.

202
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,710
Do you think you're smart now?

203
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,511
You recognize

204
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:08,870
who I am now?

205
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,110
So it was really you.

206
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:13,710
Yes, this time you will not run away.

207
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,551
Let me go, you, let go.

208
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:18,830
Back off.

209
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,350
Sir.

210
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:31,791
It's not what you think.

211
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:35,311
She followed me all the way to my place.

212
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,031
Invade and trick me.

213
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,630
Maybe she wants to offer some special service.

214
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:44,911
Your excuse is upside down

215
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:48,911
Obviously, you know nothing
about Chinese law.

216
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,350
There's no special service in our country.
You're just going to jail for sure.

217
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:54,830
Don't move.

218
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:57,911
This is my private space here.

219
00:14:58,311 --> 00:14:59,870
Please go out now.

220
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,990
Don't move.

221
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:04,990
Okay.

222
00:15:06,191 --> 00:15:06,830
Okay.

223
00:15:07,391 --> 00:15:09,191
This is the Taylor
you've always wanted to work with.

224
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:11,191
Do you see his true face now?

225
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:12,230
Go.

226
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,271
You're still trying to cover for him
because he is the real Taylor?

227
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,071
We broke into someone else's room.

228
00:15:19,271 --> 00:15:21,230
This will not look good for you.
Leave now.

229
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:25,230
I finally see you for who you truly are.

230
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,311
Only a scum would use
a design made by another scum.

231
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,350
Leave.

232
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,911
Who are you?

233
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,950
I'm Lu Cenyang.

234
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:43,950
What? Lu, it's you?

235
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,511
And you know Ran?

236
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,830
You know that I'm a teacher.

237
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:52,071
We have a chance to cooperate together.

238
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,271
Don't hit, don't hit.

239
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:57,191
I'm willing to cooperate with Pinshang.

240
00:15:57,431 --> 00:16:00,671
But I don't want to
cooperate with you, asshole.

241
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,350
Bu Ran.

242
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:10,870
We can have a good talk.

243
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,950
Not in this way.

244
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,551
Mr. Lu, you sure are full of surprises.

245
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,031
I will repay this favor
on behalf of Bu Ran.

246
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,830
In the future, if you want to know

247
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,391
more about Taylor's unspeakable deeds,

248
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,470
feel free to call.

249
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,910
Hey, who are you?

250
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,870
Why did you tell me the Yis' plan?

251
00:17:13,071 --> 00:17:15,390
To keep my conscience clean.

252
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,311
You're doing this for Bu Ran.

253
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,670
Don't take what happened today to heart.

254
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:04,231
Why?

255
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:06,031
Should I thank you for it?

256
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:07,551
No need for that.

257
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,991
If you really want to thank...

258
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:11,791
I thank you.

259
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,071
You, you...

260
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,511
You...

261
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:22,271
I saved your life.
Not only did you not thank me,

262
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,190
but you got mad?

263
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:34,830
This is absurd.

264
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,031
Thank you, Mr. Lu, for giving me
a chance to make amends.

265
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,071
Ethan has already agreed.

266
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,430
Thanks to you,

267
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:57,231
this Taylor thing went smoothly.

268
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:03,471
Disgusting, filthy.

269
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:09,110
What do you mean?

270
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:25,271
(Douhua, Yueyue, Xiao Yu, rest assured.)

271
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,670
(I will design a new home for you.)

272
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,670
(Even if it ends up being discarded.)

273
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:39,751
(She is a member of the Yi family.)

274
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,511
(Her grandmother and uncle)

275
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:46,560
(are collaborating with Taylor, who
insulted and forced her to drop out.)

276
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:50,150
(Bu Ran.)

277
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:55,231
(What exactly is your role
in the Yi family?)

278
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,670
Mr. Lu attacked me.

279
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,630
I have to call the police.

280
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,150
He must face the consequence.

281
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,711
Hold on.

282
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,110
If this foreigner calls the cops,
situation will escalate.

283
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,830
Will it affect the project?

284
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:15,590
I have experienced his skills.

285
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:17,350
He knows some Chinese kung fu.

286
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,870
Your wound may not be inspected out.

287
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:22,511
Also, you were in the room
when he's hurting you.

288
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:24,951
So, we lack evidence.

289
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:28,830
If Bu Ran comes out to testify for him,

290
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:31,031
we're gonna loss outweigh the gain.

291
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,870
I understand.

292
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:35,830
But no. No.

293
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:38,150
I understand

294
00:20:38,711 --> 00:20:43,150
your feeling. If we sign a contract,

295
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:48,590
I will beat Lu Cenyang for you.
I promise.

296
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,910
Really?

297
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,830
Yeah, really.

298
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,511
Okay.

299
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,190
Okay?

300
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,031
But I want 20 percent

301
00:20:57,031 --> 00:20:58,870
more than Lu is offered.

302
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,590
And also, a pre-paid 50 percent deposit.

303
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,830
That's too much.

304
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,031
I'm not demanding too much from you.

305
00:21:09,711 --> 00:21:10,711
Mr. Taylor.

306
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,551
I agree with your conditions.

307
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,711
From now on,
we deal with our common enemy.

308
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:22,590
I'd like that.

309
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,390
Yihua and Taylor join forces to
reconstruct the welfare center.

310
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,271
Once the word is out,

311
00:21:29,511 --> 00:21:30,991
how much can we save in marketing?

312
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:33,630
And how much can it increase
our chances of going public?

313
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:34,910
Do you not understand?

314
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:36,870
Okay.

315
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,231
Okay.

316
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:46,910
Have a good cooperation.

317
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,791
Thank you.

318
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,751
You're welcome.

319
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,870
My pleasure.

320
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,110
Greedy prick.

321
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,644
(Design Plan for Rainbow Welfare Center)

322
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,791
So beautiful!

323
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:59,670
Let me see.

324
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:00,630
Come, take a look.

325
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,271
I want to see too.

326
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,190
It's beautiful.

327
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:03,551
Our new home is so cool.

328
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,791
There's even a basketball court.

329
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,350
Come, you guys have a look.

330
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,751
So pretty.

331
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:09,791
Gorgeous.

332
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,711
Miss Bu.

333
00:22:11,071 --> 00:22:12,590
I thank you on behalf of the children.

334
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,870
Thank you, big sister.

335
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:16,390
Thank you for all you've done for them.

336
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,951
I also want to thank you, Director,
for trusting me all this time.

337
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,511
And for giving me a chance
to do something for everyone.

338
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,150
If you find any flaw in the design,

339
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,870
I can fix it as many times as necessary.

340
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,830
As long as it helps the reconstruction,
even a little bit,

341
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,311
it would made me very happy.

342
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,031
Don't worry.

343
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,670
I will give the plan to the contractor.

344
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,190
Also,

345
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,390
you and Mr. Qin are welcome
to visit the children anytime.

346
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,271
Ran.

347
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:45,350
You must come play with us again.

348
00:22:45,471 --> 00:22:47,150
Ran.

349
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,471
You must come play with us again.

350
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,350
Come play with us.

351
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:55,150
Okay.

352
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,350
I will definitely come back
to play with you guys.

353
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,630
I have to leave now.

354
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:02,630
Goodbye.

355
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:04,630
Goodbye, Ran.

356
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:05,511
Goodbye.

357
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:12,150
Alright, let's head back to class.

358
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:12,910
Go back.

359
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,190
Let's go, come on.

360
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:14,791
Come.

361
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,670
Let's go.

362
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:18,870
Slow down, don't run.

363
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,110
No deposit, no signature.

364
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,190
It doesn't even have reference value.

365
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,670
Do you have to be so stubborn?

366
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,630
Consider the design
my gift to the children.

367
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,791
At least I've tried my best.

368
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,751
Whether you think it is scrap paper,

369
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,670
or prefer Taylor's precious design,

370
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,791
that's up to you.

371
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,150
You won't see me here again.

372
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:40,791
You don't have to treat me like a thief.

373
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,711
(In the future, if you want to know)

374
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:54,590
(more about Taylor's unspeakable deeds,)

375
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:55,711
(feel free to call.)

376
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:04,670
Hello?

377
00:24:05,471 --> 00:24:07,231
Qin Xun, this is Lu Cenyang.

378
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,830
I'd like to work with you.

379
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,744
(Today, Yihua Group and Taylor will hold
a cooperation signing press conference.)

380
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,751
Wasn't he cooperating with Lu Cenyang?

381
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,751
How did he end up working with Yihua?

382
00:24:28,951 --> 00:24:30,870
Taylor must be a double-crosser.

383
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:32,991
Whatever, forget about him.

384
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,071
Here are some of the victims'
statements and evidence.

385
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:42,590
Bu Ran used this to sue Taylor abroad.

386
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,630
It came to nothing.

387
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:45,231
But in China,

388
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,471
this evidence is enough to
bring him down hard.

389
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,471
Thank you.

390
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,150
After the press conference, I will

391
00:24:57,471 --> 00:25:00,231
hand over all his criminal evidence
to the foreign police.

392
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:02,870
What evidence do you have against him?

393
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,551
Fraud.

394
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,630
Most of his works are

395
00:25:06,991 --> 00:25:08,190
doubtful in intellectual property.

396
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:10,471
He was exploiting his students.

397
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:12,951
I didn't expect

398
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,991
you to trust Bu Ran's words.

399
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,430
I'm leaving.

400
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,590
Taylor must be a double-crosser.

401
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:31,311
Mark my word.

402
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,670
I will expose this hypocrite

403
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,670
in front of the press.

404
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:51,328
(Yihua Group &amp; Design Master Taylor
Cooperation Signing Ceremony)

405
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,271
Distinguished guests,

406
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,511
our partners,

407
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,471
welcome to the signing ceremony

408
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,190
between Yihua Group
and design master Taylor.

409
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,231
I now declare

410
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,910
the signing ceremony officially begins.

411
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:14,630
Please welcome Mr. Yi Mincai,
President of Yihua, to give a speech.

412
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,511
Globally,

413
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,110
we chose to work with Mr. Taylor

414
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,720
because we see in him

415
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,150
a noble man attending to details.

416
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,551
as well as a meticulous designer.

417
00:26:33,311 --> 00:26:34,791
No unauthorized personnel
are allowed here.

418
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:37,271
Working together on the
welfare center renovation project,

419
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:39,430
we hope to truly

420
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,551
build a warm, loving home
for the children.

421
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,511
Please welcome Mr. Taylor.

422
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,551
Come, please.

423
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:53,751
This is my last chance.

424
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,430
What is this?

425
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:06,670
Is this true? It can't be.

426
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,031
This is fake. This is a fake image.

427
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:10,830
Mr. Taylor.

428
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,190
Don't believe this.

429
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:11,670
Mr. Taylor.

430
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,991
Can you explain in details?

431
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:13,870
It's fake.

432
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,311
What's going on?

433
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,231
The screen is overtaken.

434
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:17,791
What's with the intimacy?

435
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:19,791
It's done by people
who wants to destroy us.

436
00:27:20,711 --> 00:27:22,830
Don't believe this. This is fake image.

437
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:23,791
What's your relation?

438
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,630
What a pale excuse.

439
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,551
Do you even believe?

440
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,951
You can not trust any images.

441
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,991
This will end up in court.

442
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,231
This will be settled by lawyers.

443
00:27:32,991 --> 00:27:34,751
Don't believe the fake images.

444
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,071
It's all fake.

445
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,791
This will end up in the court.

446
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,231
This will be settled with my lawyer.

447
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,791
Is she your student?

448
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,430
No.

449
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:43,551
It's my student.

450
00:27:43,551 --> 00:27:44,751
I mean, not my student.

451
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,551
I mean, this is all fake.

452
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:47,150
Hurry.

453
00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:47,870
Come up here.

454
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:48,870
It's my student.

455
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:49,951
Hear my out.

456
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:50,991
All of is is fake.

457
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:52,190
Mr. Taylor, please explain.

458
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:52,630
Stop filming.

459
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,910
I will tell my lawyer at once.

460
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:55,991
Don't go.

461
00:27:57,311 --> 00:27:58,311
Stop filming, stop it.

462
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:00,751
Lu Cenyang, you are behind this.

463
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,031
